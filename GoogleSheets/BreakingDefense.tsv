Boeing machinists vote to end strike, putting KC-46, P-8 programs back on track	A P-8 maritime patrol aircraft undergoes assembly at Boeing's Renton production line. Future E-7s, based on the 737 NG, will be slotted into this line for assembly. (Michael Marrow/Breaking Defense) WASHINGTON — Boeing’s Seattle-area machinists union voted on Monday evening to end a seven week strike and accept a new contract with the planemaker, a move that will allow the company to restart production of commercial derivative military planes like the KC-46 tanker and P-8 Poseidon. Members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM), which represents about 33,000 Boeing workers mostly in Washington state and Oregon, voted in a 59 percent majority to end the strike and will return to work on Nov. 6. Union workers first rejected a previous contract and voted to strike on Sept. 13. 'While the past few months have been difficult for all of us, we are all part of the same team,' said Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg said in a statement. 'We will only move forward by listening and working together. There is much work ahead to return to the excellence that made Boeing an iconic company.' IAM 751 President Jon Holden said the strike allowed Boeing workers to 'rebalanc[e] the scales' with a contract that provides improved wages and a better quality of life. 'This contract also creates a new foundation to build on for the future and that future begins today,' he said in a statement. 'We are ready to help Boeing change direction and return to building the highest quality and safest airplanes in the world. Our members are critical to that mission, and now have a stronger voice in the decision making process to ensure those needed improvements are made.' The strike had immediate financial consequences for Boeing, halting production of its 737, 767 and 777 jetliners and impacting military derivatives of those aircraft, which include the 737-based P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft and the the 767-based KC-46 tanker. Boeing also acknowledged it could see impacts to the Air Force's program to build E-7 Wedgetail prototypes due to the strike. The company recognized $6 billion in losses in the third quarter, including $2 billion on defense programs, which it partially attributed to the work stoppage. At the onset of the strike, Boeing said it was 'working with our suppliers and customers to ensure continuity to the extent we can' on the P-8 and E-7 Wedgetail programs, and that it had fulfilled its commitment to the US Air Force to deliver at least 15 KC-46 tankers during fiscal 2024, which ended on Sept. 30. During an earnings call with investors in October, Ortberg said that coming to a contract agreement with the union and ending the strike was the first step necessary for moving the company forward. 'I met with the union leadership the first week on the job and let them know that I was committed to resetting the relationship. And I remain committed to getting the team back and improving our relationship, so we don’t become so disconnected in the future,' he said on Oct. 23, hours before the union would vote to reject an earlier contract proposal. However, as the strike continued on, Boeing leaders showed signs of frustration with the impasse. During a Nov. 1 interview with The Seattle Times, Holden said Ortberg told union leadership that, should the union reject the company’s latest offer, the next proposal would contain less generous terms. Under the agreed-upon contract, machinists would earn a 38 percent general wage increase over the next four years, $12,000 in bonuses, the reinstatement of the company’s incentive plan, and additional contributions to 401(k) plans. As part of the deal, Boeing also agreed to build its next commercial aircraft in the Puget Sound region, should the company launch a new program during the contract’s duration. The deal is an improvement from the original Sept. 8 contract proposal, which offered a 25 percent wage increase, as well as the latest Oct. 19 proposal, which offered a 35 percent increase. However, it still falls slightly short of the 40 percent wage increase originally demanded by the union, and although the offer includes higher bonuses and improvements to benefits, Boeing has refused the union’s continued demands to reinstate the company’s legacy pension program, which was phased out 2014. IAM 751 recommended that members accept the contract proposal, calling for the union 'to lock in these gains and confidently declare victory' in an Oct. 31 post on its website. 'In every negotiation and strike, there is a point where we have extracted everything that we can in bargaining and by withholding our labor. We are at that point now and risk a regressive or lesser offer in the future,' the union stated. In a Nov. 1 message to employees, Ortberg said, 'It’s time we all come back together and focus on rebuilding the business and delivering the world’s best airplanes. There are a lot of people depending on us.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/boeing-machinists-vote-to-end-strike-putting-kc-46-p-8-programs-back-on-track/	2024-11-05T06:09:28-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/01/P-8-photo-scaled-e1704386404109.jpg
Netherlands orders 12 H225M helicopters for special operations	Dutch Special Operations Forces (SOF) will receive 12 newly configured H225M Caracal helicopters (Airbus Helicopters) EURONAVAL 2024 — The Dutch Ministry of Defence signed a contract with Airbus today for the acquisition of 12 H225M Caracal heavy-lift helicopters to equip special operations forces (SOF) and replace aging AS532 Cougars. The agreement was signed at the Euronaval trade show by Vice-Admiral Jan Willem Hartman, Head of the Netherlands Command Materiel and IT (COMMIT) agency, and Bruno Even, CEO of Airbus Helicopters. The deal was widely expected after Gijs Tuinman, Netherlands State Secretary of Defence, wrote a letter to lawmakers in October to explain that a proposed procurement of 14 aircraft had been reduced to 12 because funding was 'not sufficient' enough to absorb costs for aircraft modifications. The Netherlands has requested a tailored H225M configuration to support SOF requirements. 'Airbus Helicopters and the RNLAF [Royal Netherlands Air Force] will work closely together on the development of the H225M adapted to the requirements of the users, enhancing capabilities and efficiency for special operations missions success, through tactical communication and a unique design of interaction of the aircraft and its systems,' said the manufacturer in a statement. In October, the Dutch Ministry of Defence also announced that a new unit, 300 Special Operations Squadron, based at Gilze-Rijen Air Base, southern Netherlands, had been formally stood up to support the future rotary fleet. The Netherlands plans on issuing a number of other H225M-related contracts, including an agreement with Israel's Elbit Systems for self-protection systems — equipment already installed on Dutch Gulfstream G650ER aircraft and due for integration on future C-390 tactical airlifters. Additionally, in line with the Dutch Armed Forces Foxtrot communications program and combat net radio requirement, Airbus will integrate L3 Harris radios on the rotary wing platforms. At a design level, the H225M aircraft itself features 'new avionics, an enhanced main gear box, airborne communication systems and can be equipped with the HForce weapon system,' according to Airbus company literature. The Hague had previously put forward 2030 to 2032 as the period for deliveries of the new rotorcraft but that has shifted 'partly due to the technical complexity' of integrating specialised mission equipment and 'great pressure on the production lines of the Caracal helicopter due to international orders,' according to an online translation of Tuinman's letter. In response to the suggestion that the H225 production line is having problems keeping up with demand, an Airbus Helicopters spokesperson told Breaking Defense, 'I would not say that we are struggling, but the fact is there will be a lot of helicopters to deliver in the coming years.' He added: 'The other factor to take into account is the fact that the NL [Netherlands] are asking for a new advanced configuration of the H225M matching their specific needs. We can't go into specifics, but new development work will be needed. It's always the case when a customer asks for new types of equipment.' The spokesperson declined to share an updated delivery schedule. The Dutch Ministry of Defence declined to comment. Outside of the Dutch deal, this year alone Airbus has secured new H225M orders from the German Federal Police (38 aircraft), Iraq Ministry of Defence (12 aircraft) and Japan Coast Guard (3 aircraft). Other defense customers include Brazil, France, Hungary, Indonesia, Kuwait, Malaysia, Mexico, Singapore and Thailand. Breaking Defense reported exclusively last year that the United Arab Emirates had decided to cancel a $800 million H225M acquisition, citing high lifecycle costs and modular design limitations.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/netherlands-orders-12-h225m-helicopters-for-special-operations/	2024-11-05T04:46:32-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/unnamed-4-scaled.jpg
France begins delivery of 100 loitering munitions to Ukraine	French drone manufacturer Delair displays a model of the Ukraine supplied OSKAR short range loitering munition at Euronaval (Breaking Defense) PARIS — France has started transporting loitering munitions to Ukraine for the first time — just a little over six months since the suicide drones were rapidly developed from demonstration standard to war ready, according to an industry executive. Made by French drone manufacturer Delair and KNDS France, the OSKAR (Opportunity Strike Kinetics Aircraft Ruggedised) platforms are currently 'being sent' to Ukraine, Bastien Mancini, CEO of Delair, told Breaking Defense. Under the French Colibri (Hummingbird) project, 100 of the short-range loitering munitions are due for transfer to Ukraine, as part of broader plans by Paris to acquire 2,000 units of different types overall. Mancini declined to share additional details about the new deliveries but they fit with a timeframe shared on X, in October, by Sébastien Lecornu, France’s Armed Forces Minister. At the time, Lecornu noted that 'successful testing' of the loitering munitions had taken place and deliveries to Ukraine would begin in 'the coming weeks.' Evolved from Delair's UX11 unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and modified to integrate a 2.3 kilogram (5 pound) warhead from KNDS France, OSKAR can fly for up to 45 minutes and has been designed to strike fixed targets, light vehicles and personnel. The back-packable loitering munition was selected as one of two solutions for acquisition under Colibri in March. In all, 'we had six months to transform [our] demonstrator into an operational product &#8230; operational with constraints of the ammunition,' Mancini told Breaking Defense. 'Now this phase is finished and the [OSKAR] drones are being delivered to Ukraine. They are being sent, I don’t have' further details. Loitering munitions have flown steadily into Ukraine since the war started and are widely considered cost effective solutions compared to antitank or cruise missiles. As an example, US manufacturer AeroVironment estimated in April that it had provided Ukraine with 'thousands' of drones, including Switchblade types. RELATED: France makes new &#8216;pact' with industry to speed small drone production, acquisition Similarly, Delair has already gained product feedback from Ukraine, having provided Kyiv with UX11 and DT26 surveillance drones. Mancini noted that Russian Electronic Warfare (EW) capabilities continue to present 'a real danger' to Ukrainian supplied equipment and stressed that because a platform 'works today' does not mean that 'it will work in three months.' The 'quality that we need is to remain very adaptive and alert &#8230; because so far, we have solutions that work, but &#8230; things evolve very quickly on the battlefield,' he said. To resist EW attacks, OSKAR also uses satellite navigation denied capabilities and can operate fully encrypted, out to a 25 kilometer (15.5 mile) communication range, according to KNDS company literature. Mancini also said that following Delair’s acquisition, late last month, of French swarming and inspection drone manufacturer Squadrone System, the company could decide to test multiple OSKAR’s in a swarm. He declined to share the value of the Squadrone deal. The Grenoble-based manufacturer is currently part of the DGA- and Defence Innovation Agency-led Tactical Multi-Objectives Swarming UAVs) TAMOS line of effort — a two-year research and development program exploring development of an interface capable of letting a human operator control the flight of several small-sized UAV’s for civil and defense markets.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/france-begins-delivery-of-100-loitering-munitions-to-ukraine/	2024-11-05T04:14:26-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/IMG_2223-1-scaled-e1730808912287.jpg
Navy will extend service lives of 3 cruisers following destroyer announcement	A Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) Block 1B interceptor missile is launched from the guided-missile cruiser USS Lake Erie (CG 70) during a Missile Defense Agency and U.S. Navy test in the mid-Pacific. (U.S. Navy photo/Released) PARIS — The US Navy announced today it is extending the service lives of three Ticonderoga-class cruisers, a decision that adds 10 years of cumulative ship service to the fleet and follows a similar decision last week to extend 12 Arleigh Burke-class destroyers. 'All three cruisers received extensive hull, mechanical and engineering, as well as combat system upgrades as part of an extended modernization program,' according to a service statement published today. 'USS Gettysburg (CG-64) and USS Chosin (CG-65) completed modernization in fiscal year 2023 and fiscal year 2024, respectively. USS Cape St. George (CG-71) is on schedule to complete modernization this fiscal year.' For years, the Navy has lobbied Congress to allow for certain Ticonderoga-class cruisers — as well as Littoral Combat Ships — to be decommission ahead of schedule, but lawmakers have repeatedly blocked those efforts, largely citing the need for the service to achieve a larger fleet. Those efforts have followed a large, and problematic, effort to modernize those ships, which is nine years old and counting. 'As a former cruiser sailor, I know the incredible value these highly-capable warships bring to the fleet and I am proud of their many decades of service,' Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro said in the statement. 'After learning hard lessons from the cruiser modernization program, we are only extending ships that have completed modernization and have the material readiness needed to continue advancing our Navy’s mission.' The Chosin (CG-65) was also recently part of a Navy demonstration that has been personally lauded by Del Toro for transferring and reloading missile cannisters at sea, a capability the Navy claims will be 'transformational' because it removes the need for a ship to pull into port.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/navy-will-extend-service-lives-of-3-cruisers-following-destroyer-announcement/	2024-11-04T10:02:29-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/04/934664-scaled-e1713286156806.jpg
The next president must recognize Americans’ unwavering support for int’l leadership, engagement	NATO delegates come together at the 2024 summit in Washington, DC on July 11, 2024. (NATO) As Donald Trump and Kamala Harris make their closing arguments to voters around the country, both candidates must contend with an undeniable truth: Americans across the political spectrum favor strong U.S. leadership in the world. Regardless of who wins the presidential election and takes office in January, he or she would be wise to recognize this clear mandate from the American people. The American public’s commitment to an internationalist foreign policy is unwavering in recent years amidst chaos and conflict around the world, as shown in six years of consistent data from the Reagan National Defense Survey. Since 2018, the Ronald Reagan Institute has conducted an annual nationwide public opinion poll assessing Americans’ views on a wide array of defense, foreign policy, and national security topics. One message we have heard loud and clear: a rock-solid preference among the American people for U.S. leadership and engagement on the global stage. Even as public opinion has shifted on the particulars of some foreign policy issues, many core principles receive consistent support year on year. When asked whether the United States should be more engaged and take the lead or be less engaged and react to world events, a majority favors American engagement. Across six years of polling, there has always been a preference for global leadership—and in recent surveys, more and more Americans want the United States to take the lead, now up to 54 percent, from 40 percent in 2022. On a bipartisan basis, the American people have a clear preference for internationalism over isolationism. Americans also consistently support our forward-deployed global military presence. A remarkably constant supermajority of about two-thirds of Americans has favored the United States maintaining military bases around the world to deter attacks and provide a quick response. Almost eight in ten Americans, including majorities across party lines, favor increased defense spending, a figure that has remained consistent since 2018. Despite the four decades since President Ronald Reagan was in office, his philosophy of peace through strength still resonates with the American people. The American public maintains a steadfast commitment to standing by our allies and partners. Since 2018, about six in ten Americans have consistently reported having a favorable view of NATO. And they support NATO’s core principle of collective defense, with almost three-quarters saying United States should respond militarily if a NATO ally was attacked. On Ukraine aid, our polls have shown rock-solid support for sending U.S. weapons. Since 2022, around 60 percent of Americans across party lines want the United States to provide military aid to Ukraine—debunking speculation of 'Ukraine fatigue' among the public. This is what international leadership and engagement looks like. While foreign policy may seem distant, it is not abstract. And the broad, bipartisan mandate is clear. Over 80 percent of Americans believe that a strong U.S. military is crucial for peace and prosperity, both at home and abroad; 78 percent agree that American leaders is essential to promote trade and boost the economy; and 77 percent say the United States has an obligation to champion human rights and democracy whenever possible. While support for these core principles has remained steadfast, we have seen a remarkable shift when it comes to threat perception—particularly vis-à-vis China. A steadily rising percentage of Americans view China as the country posing the greatest threat to the United States. In the most recent Reagan National Defense Survey, released last December, 51 percent of Americans identified China as the top threat, up from just 21 percent in 2018. This shift reflects growing public concern about China across every domain: its military build-up, technological advancements, economic engagement, human rights abuses, and global ambitions. And yet, over half of Americans say that the United States does not have a clear strategy for managing its relationship with China. Beyond the bipartisan consensus that we are engaged in a great power competition, the next president should articulate how our country and the free world can win that contest. On the eve of the 1980 election, then-candidate Ronald Reagan made foreign policy part of his closing argument, saying, 'Many of us are unhappy about…our diminishing prestige around the globe, about the weakness in our economy and national security that jeopardizes world peace, about our lack of strong, straightforward leadership…I believe we can embark on a new age of reform in this country and an era of national renewal.' Now, facing similar circumstances, Americans desire a renewed commitment to strong U.S. leadership and international engagement, the approach that has long safeguarded peace in a dangerous, turbulent world. Whoever steps into the Oval Office in January should heed this call.

Austal eyeing European markets for US Navy’s new medical ship design	A graphic of Austal USA's expeditionary medical ship. (Courtesy of Austal USA) EURONAVAL 2024 — Austal USA is eyeing European markets for its relatively new medical ship that is being designed and produced for the US Navy, as the company looks to beef up future production to avoid fallow periods at its facilities. 'We’re interested in expanding our market — three to four years out — we want to be looking at a new set of programs,' Larry Ryder, a company executive, told Breaking Defense here at the Euronaval exposition. 'It’s a piece of the market we haven’t touched yet. We’ve come close on a couple of international [foreign military sales] deals, but we want to kind of gage the market over here.' Austal is slated to build three Bethesda-class Expeditionary Medical Ships for the US Navy, a specialized platform derived from the expeditionary fast transports and designed to provide a more mobile and agile version of the iconic hospital ships Comfort and Mercy. The interest to put the platform forward in markets abroad stems from the American shipyard’s recent history. As Breaking Defense reported, Austal’s Mobile, Ala.,-based yard was facing numerous programmatic closures and severe layoffs at the outset of the coronavirus pandemic as several US Navy programs were slated to close and no new work was on the horizon. Through a combination of facility expansion and contract wins, the shipyard, a staple builder for the US Navy, has come out of that period with a more diverse portfolio of programs than it held a few years ago. But, Ryder acknowledged, it also acted as a warning sign for the need to seek out new customers. 'We've got to be looking three, four years out, and if we sit and wait till we need work, it's too late,' he added. Europe is relatively fresh ground for Austal as a whole. While the Expeditionary Medical Ship is built by Austal USA, its parent company, Austal, based in Australia, is largely focused on its domestic market and Asia, especially as it pertains to defense.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/austal-eyeing-european-markets-for-us-navys-new-medical-ship-design/	2024-11-04T07:19:59-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/01/53440417469_c4b21d066d_o-scaled-e1704306136265.jpg
Australia kills $5.3B military space program with Lockheed	Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese (L), US President Joe Biden (C) and British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak (R) during the AUKUS summit on March 13, 2023 in San Diego. (Photo by Leon Neal/Getty Images) CANBERRA — The Labor government of Anthony Albanese today cancelled Australia's largest space program ever, almost 18 months after killing the main civil space program, drawing sharp criticism from analysts and industry experts. The satellite communications program, known in typical Australian military fashion as JP 9102, was projected to be worth at least $7 billion AUD ($5.3 billion USD). The government began the project in 2021 and eventually chose Lockheed Martin's Australian arm to see it through, but the Department of Defence said in an announcement today that due to the 'acceleration in space technologies and evolving threats in space, Defense has assessed that a single orbit GEO-based satellite communications system would not meet strategic priorities.' 'Instead of a single orbit solution, defense must instead prioritize a multi-orbit capability increasing resilience for the Australian Defense Force,' the department said. 'Defence’s current satellite communications capabilities support the immediate needs of the organisation. This decision allows Defence to prioritise emerging needs, mitigate capability gaps and continue to support our transition to an integrated, focused force.' News of the cancellation was broken by The Australian newspaper, which said the decision was based on budget issues. After The Australian broke the story, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese spoke with Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio and offered justification for the government's defense planning and spending. 'We’re busy prioritizing all of our purchases when it comes to defense assets. We’ve got a considerable increase in our defense budget and we’ll make sure all of the decisions that we make are in our national interest,' the prime minister said. 'We are not only seeing advances with the AUKUS arrangements being on track and on time and on budget, we’re seeing our capabilities increased with increased asset purchases. We are also very much interested in this being part of our ‘Future Made in Australia’ agenda.' But the cancellation was cast as a broad example of the Albanese government's unwillingness to increase defense spending beyond inflation and currency changes and its lack of commitment to space programs. The Space Industry Association of Australia (SIAA) noted the government's decision with 'profound disappointment.' Its chairman, Jeremy Hallett, said in a statement, 'While other OECD [Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development] nations see sovereign space capability as critical to creating high-tech, high-value jobs and a military advantage, in our own backyard we seem to be doing the exact opposite.' Lockheed Martin Australia said it would try to keep the jobs created so far: 'We are committed to preserving our sovereign workforce with impacted staff being redeployed across other existing and emerging programs where possible.' Malcolm Davis, a defense expert with The Australian Strategic Policy Institute, told Breaking Defense in an email that If the government offers no alternative to JP 9102, it will mark 'a retreat back to dependency on foreign actors to provide our crucial upstream space segment.' Australia has already experienced this. It discovered the limits of access to the Boeing-built WGS defense constellation, even after paying to build one of the satellites. During the massive bushfires here in 2019 and 2020, the Aussies asked the US military for WGS coverage to help with command and control; US Army Pacific reportedly turned things around within 24 hours, but that was time lost and highlighted the limits of Australia’s access even during a time of peace. 'In the meantime, government doesn't send any signal of confidence to the Australian commercial space sector and that will only see that sector seeing greater risk,' Davis said. 'At a certain point, companies begin to close doors and relocate over to the US, or elsewhere. Jobs are lost, financial returns decline, and it snowballs.' Davis said the government is trying to cover the high cost of AUKUS and the Navy's surface fleet expansion, without making a 'real increase in defense spending.' He notes that 'other key projects' have been redefined, reprioritized, delayed or cancelled by Labor. 'And now, as the cost of AUKUS continues to increase (as it always was going to) they are having to continue to make cuts to avoid spending more on defense,' he said. Hallett of the SIAA ticked off space programs either cut or in limbo. 'We’ve seen a change in direction for Space Domain Awareness under JP 9360 after industry being led along for many years. We have the media-reported cancellation of the Resilient Multi-Mission STaR Shot program by DSTG, we have heard nothing public on Assured Positioning, Navigation and Timing under JP 9380 even though that tender closed over a year ago, and now this news on JP9102 — not to mention cuts to civil space programs,' Hallett said in the SIAA statement. 'I am sure some companies will seriously consider the business case for dealing with defense as a customer in the future, which I worry will mean our warfighters will miss out on homegrown innovations that can make a difference on the battlefield,' he said. Hallett said Australia needs strategic autonomy and resilience for its 'future economic and national security' and it is central to AUKUS Pillar II, the cluster of capabilities such as hypersonics, autonomy, AI and other advanced weapons America, Britain and Australia are pursuing to rapidly improve their militaries in the face of China's rapid military modernization. 'Owning and operating significant military space infrastructure in the Indo-Pacific as part of a multi-orbit architecture would have achieved this, and provided meaningful contribution into AUKUS Pillar [II],' Hallett said, 'the advanced capabilities of which cannot function without space capability.' The DoD's statement suggested Australia would pursue an altered space program, one with a 'multi-orbit capability,' but did not provide further details.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/australia-kills-5-3b-military-space-program-with-lockheed/	2024-11-04T05:19:22-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/aukus_2023-scaled-e1678742636131.jpg
As Election Day looms, what Trump and Harris presidencies will (and won’t) mean for defense	US Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris (R) shakes hands with former US President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump during a presidential debate at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on September 10, 2024. (Photo by SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — On Tuesday, Americans will head to the polls to cast a vote for either Vice President Kamala Harris or former President Donald Trump in an election where national security has taken a backseat to domestic issues like the economy, immigration and abortion rights. Neither Harris nor Trump have provided details on their defense priorities and the budget it will take to bring them to fruition. But both have spent four years in the White House, leaving plenty of clues as to how they could lead the most powerful military in the world. And while analysts told Breaking Defense a Trump administration would likely be a more unpredictable one on defense policy compared to a relative continuation of Biden administration priorities under Harris, they also said that equally, if not more important, will be whichever party controls the houses of Congress where the defense budget is crafted. 'We have a much wider range of uncertainty when it comes to Trump,' said Todd Harrison, a defense budget expert with the American Enterprise Institute. 'Under Trump, we could see a huge shift in strategy to become much more isolationist, which could end up bringing major changes in the defense budget and a drastic reduction in force structure.' At the same time, Harrison added, 'the makeup of Congress, and specifically the makeup of the House, I think will actually matter much more to the future of the defense budget than whoever the president is.' Meanwhile, public comments by industry executives suggest they're confident the demand signal for their products will remain strong, no matter what happens next week. With four days until America votes on its next leader, here are the key factors at play. The Republican platform includes a promise to 'prevent World War Three, restore peace in Europe and in the Middle East, and build a great Iron Dome missile defense shield over our entire country.' Throughout the campaign trail, Trump has reiterated those statements, potentially setting the stage for greater missile defense investments. At the same time, he has questioned whether the US should remain in NATO, a longtime point of skepticism for the former president, who has hammered alliance members for failing to live up to the 2 percent GDP commitment for defense spending. Trump has also signaled that he would oppose further military aid for Ukraine unless it enters peace talks, and stated in September that Ukraine should have made 'concessions' to Russia to avoid war, according to the Associated Press. RELATED: Zelensky implores US to continue aid for Ukraine amid election uncertainty During a rally at Madison Square Gardens on Sunday, Trump said he would strengthen and modernize the military, reiterating an old 2020 claim that he had 'rebuilt our military in total.' But Harrison said those comments are somewhat contradictory, leaving it unclear how much defense funding Trump believes is actually needed. 'If you've got all new equipment, why do you need to procure anything else?' Harrison said. 'Of course, it's laughably untrue what he said. But what if he actually believes it?' US President Donald Trump speaks during his meeting with Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg at Winfield House, London on December 3, 2019. (Photo by NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP via Getty Images) While Trump’s first term brought rising budgets and a renewed focus on China to the Pentagon, Trump himself was sometimes a turbulent influence on the department, with moments that included personally involving himself in contract negotiations for the F-35 and Air Force One, and unilaterally promising to cut the defense budget, only to reverse course and boost the budget after meeting with key defense leaders. That volatility makes it hard to know whether Trump is serious when he talks about leaving NATO or signaling that he could revoke support for Ukraine, analysts said. 'Maybe none of this happens. That is one view that, ‘Oh, this is just rhetoric,’' said Byron Callan of Capital Alpha Partners. 'But I think that there would be a pretty profound period of uncertainty until those answers are known.' Roman Schweizer, a defense analyst with TD Cowen, was optimistic about defense investments under a Trump presidency, characterizing the Republican platform as 'very supportive of defense.' He added that prominent national security Republicans in Congress and within the administration would likely be supportive of increasing the base budget, though they may be less likely to approve supplemental spending like the foreign aid bill passed last spring, which approved additional funds for Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan and key US defense industrial base priorities. However, even if the Trump administration is broadly supportive of defense spending, other campaign priorities could have negative impacts on the defense industry, Callan said. For instance, plans to enact a 20 percent tariff on all imported goods could result in financial pressure on defense contracts. Another complication could be the potential creation of a new organization, the Department of Government Efficiency, centered on reducing federal spending, Callan said. Trump has said he would tap SpaceX founder Elon Musk to lead the new department, and Musk said on Sunday he believed he could cut at least $2 trillion from the $7.3 trillion federal budget requested for FY25. 'When you start hearing those numbers get thrown around, it's like, if you think defense is going to be rising with a $2 trillion cut, it's not going to happen,' Callan said. 'Not that I think a $2 trillion cut is likely, but just this period of uncertainty about, well, what's going to happen?' Analysts agreed that a Harris victory would likely bring a fair amount of continuity with the Biden administration in terms of both policy and personnel, should the new administration retain some Pentagon leaders like Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall, who has expressed interest in serving under Harris. During her speech at the Democratic National Convention, Harris said she would ensure the United States retains 'the strongest, most lethal fighting force in the world,' and that the nation wins the technological race against China in areas like space and artificial intelligence. Unlike Trump, she has vowed to 'stand strong with Ukraine and our NATO allies,' signaling she would seek further military aid for Ukraine going forward. And while Harris condemned the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, she said she would 'always ensure Israel has the ability to defend itself,' confirming that she will also continue military aid for Israel. Still, that doesn’t mean a Harris presidency would mean a gold rush for defense contractors, Harrison said. His prevailing assumption is that a Harris administration would prioritize domestic spending, leading to defense budgets that are 'basically flat with inflation or maybe slight real growth.' 'The only way I would see significant defense budget growth in the Harris administration is if it is part of a deal with congressional Republicans to get through some of her priorities on the non-defense side of the budget,' he said. Vice President Kamala Harris waves after arriving at Ellington Field JRB and being greeted by Chief Master Sergeant Bennie Bellvin, 147th Attack Wing Command Chief and Colonel Bif French, 147th Attack Wing Commander, July 24, 2024. (U.S. Air National Guard photo by Tech. Sgt. Stacy Cooper) Schweizer said the single best scenario for defense contractors is a Harris win, coupled with a Democratic House and Republican Senate. That permutation of what he called the 'congressional Rubik’s cube' couples Harris’s likely support for Ukraine and Israel with a pro-defense Senate and — most importantly — a House where the far-right Freedom Caucus would have little power to stymie military aid for supplemental spending, he said. The worst-case scenario, according to Harrison, is a narrow Republican majority in the House, 'because the Freedom Caucus will continue to hold defense hostage to try to give more spending cuts overall,' he said. Although defense companies announced third quarter results in late October, just a couple weeks before Election Day, the subject of the next president largely flew under the radar during earnings calls with investors. 'Right now, the stocks are really trading on results,' Callan said. 'They don't appear to be looking beyond results and into election scenarios.' Even when pressed, executives haven’t drawn a distinction between how a Harris or Trump presidency could impact defense spending — at least not publicly. Northrop Grumman CEO Kathy Warden said she didn’t expect a 'significant difference' in defense spending between a Trump or Harris administration during an earnings call last month. 'What we have seen over time is that the defense budget more reflects the threat environment than any particular administration change, and so we fully expect that again, this time,' she said. 'The national defense strategy has remained consistent over the past several years, in the last couple of administrations, and we believe that's because it is responsive to the emerging threats around the globe and focused on both deterring and defending. And in that regard, it's well aligned to the program portfolio that Northrop Grumman has.' Similar sentiments have been shared by Frank St. John, Lockheed Martin’s chief operating officer. During an August interview with Breaking Defense, St. John said that the Pentagon is experiencing 'a flat or a declining real purchasing power' relative to inflation, but added that it was too early to say how defense budget toplines could shape up over the next couple years. 'With regards to the election, we think that deterrence and deterrence capabilities are an enduring theme, regardless of which party is in the executive branch or who’s in control of Congress,' he said. 'And so we think our programs are well supported in the budget, and we’re looking forward to working with whatever the new administration looks like.' Other defense executives pointed to the uncertain political environment as a factor underlying more conservative projections about how business could fare in 2025 and beyond. Speaking to investors during an Oct. 19 earnings call, Leidos Chief Financial Officer Chris Cage said the company sees 'growth momentum' in its defense unit but wants to be 'cautious' about giving more exact financial guidance for 2025 until there is greater certainty on the outcome of the election and ongoing FY25 budget process. 'You look at the backdrop, we're clearly in an election year. There is a risk of … an extended CR and some disruption,' he said. 'If we get more clarity in the several months ahead, we'll be in a better position to refine that point of view going into the early part of next year.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/as-election-day-looms-what-trump-and-harris-presidencies-will-and-wont-mean-for-defense/	2024-11-01T11:30:09-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/241101_harris_trump_shake_GettyImages-2170583836-scaled-e1730474242663.jpg
After French court intervenes, Israeli firms rushing to get to Euronaval	Rafael's c-dome design will be on display at Euronaval 2024. (Rafael) JERUSALEM — On the eve of the annual Euronaval show, a French court has overturned a ban that would have prevented most Israeli companies from showcasing their products at the event. And while that’s good news for Israeli vendors, it also has left key members of the defense industry here scrambling to see if abandoned plans to attend the conference can be salvaged last minute. In mid-October, it was announced that any Israeli firms whose products are being used in the war in Gaza would be barred from presenting at Euronaval, occurring in Paris Nov. 4-7, with the Jerusalem Post saying at least a dozen companies would be affected. It was the second time the rug had been pulled out from under Israeli firms in France, following the firms being banned from attending Eurosatory earlier this year — a restriction which French courts also overturned, though with too little time left for Israeli companies to react. Prior to Euronaval, the French government claimed that the ban didn’t prevent Israeli companies from participating, but rather prevented them from 'promotion of weapons used in Gaza and Lebanon, which cause unacceptable damage to the civilian population.' Companies that want to showcase their wares now have a logistics challenge. Generally, models or full-size products for these kind of defense shows need to be shipped in advance. The uncertainty left companies in the lurch on whether to ship items at all, and now some have to figure out if they want to bother getting equipment in place. Of the 'big three' Israeli firms, Elbit is not presenting at the show. Israel Aerospace Industries, which in the past has showcased radars for naval solutions, as well as missiles, electro-optics and drones, is still weighing the logistics of trying to attend the show on short notice after the court decision. (IAI’s subsidiary Elta has collaborated with Hensoldt in the past on solutions for submarines. Hensoldt, which is not an Israeli company, is attending EuroNaval.) And in a statement to Breaking Defense, a Rafael spokesperson said the company 'is readying for Euronaval where it is focusing on unique modular naval solutions, asymmetric warfare and layered air defense at sea. From C-Dome to the C-UAS capable Typhoon and its various configurations, there is a whole lot in store [for the exhibition].' In the past Rafael has showcased its naval remote weapon station to counter UAVs, the naval version of its Spike missile system, EW systems, including C-Gem which deceived missile seekers and the Torbuster anti-torpedo system. Over the past year Rafael’s C-Dome, the naval version of Iron Dome, has had its first operational interception and the company has been pitching a modular version of C-Dome. A major player when it comes to naval assets is Israel Shipyards. In a statement, the company told Breaking Defense it has already shipped products to France for the show and plans to attend. 'Israel Shipyards will unveil our newest platform, the Mini Shaldag, specifically designed to address the unique challenges of river and lake environments,' the company said. 'Regarding the recent French ruling, the issue of non-discrimination is a central factor in European law. As we have seen with the court’s decision following our petition, it is also upheld in France. However, our focus remains on showcasing our innovative solutions at Euronaval, where we aim to connect and collaborate on pressing maritime security needs.' Plans for smaller firms are unclear, including both DSIT and Orbit, neither of which responded to requests for information by press time. At the 2022 Euronaval DSIT described itself as one of the 'world’s leaders in underwater defence and security solutions' and said it would present 'together with parent company RAFAEL Advanced Defense Systems, a comprehensive, integrated Torpedo Defence System (TDS) for surface vessels.' In the past, Orbit showcased its satellite communication terminals at the show. Orbit announced on October 29 that it had secured a $3 million contract with 'a leading European integrator to supply advanced satellite communication systems for naval military surface platforms.' It did not name the integrator of the platform. The Israel Ministry of Defense did not comment on the developments, though Israel’s Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant previously said the French decision was a 'disgrace.' And in a post on social media, Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz congratulated the Israeli companies who had petitioned the French court on the outcome of the ruling. The announcement was a 'significant victory against the unjust and undemocratic decision by the French government to prevent Israeli companies from participating in the Euronaval exhibition,' Katz said. 'This outcome, achieved in part through the legal and diplomatic efforts of the Foreign Ministry, is a critical win for justice and a clear message against attempts to weaken Israel in its fight against forces of evil.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/after-french-court-intervenes-israeli-firms-rushing-to-get-to-euronaval/	2024-11-01T10:03:21-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/Rafael-CDome-JPEG.jpg
Pentagon developing ‘Responsible AI’ guides for defense, intelligence, interagency — even allies	Images of RAF Air Controllers aboard an RAF Boeing E-3D Sentry, aka AWACS, conducting a mission in support of NATO. (British Ministry of Defense) WASHINGTON — As part of the Biden administration’s global push for 'Responsible Artificial Intelligence,' the Defense Department is building a growing library of interactive online guides to help program managers and other officials develop safe and ethical AI. (AI-aided counter-drone defense? Sure. Algorithms to help draft contracting language? Maybe, with guardrails. Self-aware nuclear launch systems that don't wait for human input? No). Versions have already been published or are in the works for defense officials, the intelligence community, civilian agencies, and even foreign allies, Pentagon RAI director Matthew K. Johnson said this week, with updates addressing generative artificial intelligence and President Joe Biden’s recently signed National Security Memorandum on AI. The original version of the Responsible AI Toolkit, published last November, is essentially an interactive digital checklist. It’s meant to walk Pentagon program managers and other defense officials through the laws, regulations, ethics, and best practices on developing AI. But it was also made available to the public online from the very beginning. And even before that official rollout, RAI director Johnson made clear he saw the toolkit not just as a handy guide for bureaucrats, but as part of a much broader soft-power push to promote American values on AI — and to contrast them with the less scrupulous approaches of adversaries like China. RELATED: Clear guardrails mean faster progress on AI: Biden signs sweeping guidance for DoD &amp; IC Since then, Johnson and his RAI team have been busy, he told a Responsible AI in Defense conference convened this week by the Pentagon’s Chief Digital &amp; AI Office (CDAO). 'We co-developed a version of the toolkit with NATO,' he said. 'That’s based on our version, [but] we mapped it to NATO’s principles of responsible use and NATO’s data, life cycle, and some other things.' (The NATO version isn’t publicly available, he told Breaking Defense after his remarks). The RAI team is also working with 'other allies and partners' and the US intelligence community, though he didn’t give any details. The long-term ambition is that allied nations will gain confidence in each others’ systems and feel safe connecting them for combined operations, Johnson said. 'If you think about things like CJADC2, Combined Joint All-Domain Command &amp; Control, our ability to share information and allow us to interconnect systems at speed is going to require us having streamlined assurance processes,' he said. 'It can also facilitate things like reciprocity. &#8230; If you certify a model through your country's process and our processes are aligned, we may not have to run it through our process,' saving considerable time. The Pentagon RAI team is also developing versions of the toolkit for other US agencies. 'We were appointed by the Executive Office of the President to create the recommended process for government agencies to meet the AI risk requirements under the [2023] Executive Order,' Johnson said. 'We also have integrated into it the ability to show how you meet the requirements under the National Security Memorandum on the issue last week.' Johnson said his team has seen 'a lot of interest across interagency.' 'We've gotten a lot of feedback from OSTP [the White House Office of Science &amp; Technology Policy] and NIST [the National Institute of Standards &amp; Technology], and we're working on getting that into a version two that'll be released to the interagency in the next couple of weeks.' Finally, Johnson and his team aim to expand the toolkits to include evolving guidance on one of the most rapidly advancing and controversial forms of AI: generative artificial intelligence, especially the powerful but hallucination-prone Large Language Models. 'We're currently… developing versions of the toolkit to support approvals and reviews for various use cases,' Johnson said. In particular, he went on, 'we're really focused on developing version of the toolkit right now for generative AI and Large Language Models. Our division wrote the Department's policy on generative AI.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/pentagon-developing-responsible-ai-guides-for-defense-intelligence-interagency-even-allies/	2024-11-01T09:01:59-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/03/240320_brit_computer_mod_45169437-scaled-e1710969350247.jpg
IAI ELTA air defense radars	Iron Dome’s Multi-Mission Radar detects rockets &amp; guides interception. (image IAI/ELTA). Maintaining airspace security is more critical than ever in a rapidly evolving threat landscape. Israel has established itself as a global leader in air defense technologies, with Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) ELTA Systems standing out as a Center of Excellence for radar solutions. This leadership position is derived from the constant threat and frequent attacks Israel is exposed to, which have driven the development of cutting-edge, operationally proven technologies. IAI ELTA Systems has positioned itself as a leading provder of advanced radar solutions that serve tactical and strategic air defense needs. With a broad range of radars catering to diverse military requirements, IAI ELTA’s air defense radar systems have earned their place as industry benchmarks, offering reliable, adaptive, and operationally proven solutions. A Comprehensive Approach to Air Defense At the core of any air defense system lays the radar, which provides the crucial capability to detect, track, and classify aerial threats. IAI ELTA Systems offers a comprehensive portfolio of air defense radars that meet various tactical, operational, and strategic levels. Every air defense need has a specific system solution characterized by unique parameters, technologies, and techniques. These systems are designed to detect, track, classify, and engage aerial threats ranging from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to ballistic missiles. What distinguishes IAI ELTA is the ability to tailor solutions that address both battlefield needs and homeland defense, providing continuous situational awareness and threat evaluation. Several radar families are at the core of IAI ELTA’s air defense strategy, including the MMR (Multi-Mission Radar), Green Pine, MS-MMR, Terra, and over-the-horizon (OTH) detection systems. Each is uniquely designed to cover different threats, utilizing advanced radar technologies that integrate seamlessly into various defense architectures. Green Pine &#8211; an advanced high performance strategic early warning radar. (image: IAI/ELTA). Building Blocks for Strategic Missile Defense The ELM-2080 Green Pine radar was developed specifically for Israel's Arrow Weapon System, one of the world’s most advanced anti-ballistic missile systems. Green Pine is designed for threat detection, early warning, and interception guidance and provides the long-range detection capability required for missile defense operating at ranges of hundreds of kilometers away. This radar can operate in a cluttered electromagnetic environment and detect incoming ballistic missiles at great distances, allowing for ample response time. Green Pine radars are not limited to Israel's defense needs; they are also exported to several countries for strategic missile defense roles, underlining the system's reliability and adaptability. Green Pine's performance has made it critical to creating an effective shield against long-range ballistic missile threats. ELM-2090 Terra systems provide unparalleled capabilities for strategic-level threat detection. Comprised of dual-band electronically scanned radar arrays operating in the UHF and S-bands, the Ultra and Spectra radars that make the Terra array detect threats over vast areas. They are particularly valuable for providing early warning of missile launches or airborne incursions by targets with low radar signatures. IAI ELTA's radar portfolio also includes the ELM-2040 OTH A/B system specially designed for over-the-horizon (OTH) detection. This radar offers the ability to detect airborne targets, including cruise missiles and tactical ballistic missiles, beyond the horizon, thereby extending the radar's reach well beyond the immediate theatre of operations. OTH radar capabilities provide a comprehensive air picture over a vast area of land and sea, that helps in early detection, especially for low-altitude and stealth threats that would otherwise go unnoticed by conventional radar systems. The ability to detect targets before they come within direct line of sight significantly enhances the preparedness and response capabilities of a nation’s air defense forces. Multi-Mission Radar &#8211; Proven Tactical Versatility The ELM-2084 MMR is one of IAI ELTA's most recognized systems, renowned for its exceptional versatility and operational reliability. The MMR is the backbone radar for Israel’s Iron Dome and David’s Sling air defense systems. The MMR is in service with several NATO air forces and other advanced militaries worldwide. It is designed to provide real-time detection and tracking of incoming threats like rockets, artillery, mortars, aircraft, and drones. The MMR's adaptability means it can seamlessly integrate with different air defense systems, making it suitable for addressing rapidly changing battlefield conditions. The MMR employs an S-band Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) technology, which enables simultaneous tracking of many targets, from low-flying drones and cruise missiles to high-altitude rockets, ballistic missiles, and aircrafts. Its software-based architecture allows the radar to be updated on the go, ensuring it remains a step ahead of evolving threats. The MMR family includes several variants that are operational in armed forces worldwide. The family includes the MS-MMR an enhanced version that adds passive detection capabilities to the radars, making it ideal for defending against advanced, low-signature threats, while CMMR, a compact version, is configured for mobile operation on tactical vehicles. Advanced Sensors for Tactical Air Defense At the tactical level, IAI ELTA's ELM-2026 provides a lightweight, portable system in service with several NATO armies, Israel, and other advanced militaries worldwide. Its compact design allows for quick deployment and mobility, making it an ideal asset for integrated air defense systems for expeditionary forces. The proliferation of drones has necessitated new defense strategies. IAI ELTA has responded with the ELI-4030 Drone Guard Counter-UAS system, its core is in a radar system specifically designed to detect, identify, and intercept UAVs. The rapid growth of commercial and military drones as sensors and weapons poses a significant challenge to traditional air defense systems. Drone Guard's proven ability to handle these threats fills a critical gap in the modern air defense environment. Collaboration and Continuous Improvement IAI ELTA actively collaborates with international partners to enhance their radar capabilities by tailoring solutions for global customers. By working closely with local industries in different countries, IAI ensures its products are optimized for specific operational environments and customer needs, providing operational independence and robust local support. One key aspect of IAI ELTA's radar portfolio is its adaptability to changes and constant improvements based on battlefield feedback. Operational experience gathered from real-world deployments is used to regularly refine and update the systems, ensuring that IAI's solutions are relevant today and prepared for the future. This continuous improvement keeps IAI ELTA at the cutting edge of air defense technology, with solutions that evolve in tandem with the threat landscape. Operational Experience and Future Challenges IAI ELTA's air defense radar systems have been operated extensively in recent conflicts where their capabilities have been pivotal in ensuring the safety of civilians and military personnel. In Israel, the MMR, Drone Guard, and Green Pine systems have become synonymous with effective, reliable performance under complex conditions, providing a shield against rocket, missile, and UAV threats. As threats become more sophisticated, quickly adapting and deploying new techniques and capabilities becomes essential. IAI ELTA's radars offer software- driven modular designs, allowing updates to be implemented without significant hardware changes—a critical capability in staying ahead of adversaries. IAI’s broad portfolio ensures it can provide tailored solutions to specific challenges, whether addressing low, slow, and small drones or countering high-speed ballistic missiles.

How US election might impact stalled Saudi-Israeli normalization, arms sales to Gulf	)US President Donald Trump, US First lady Melania Trump (2nd R), Saudi Arabia's King Salman bin Abdulaziz al-Saud (2nd L) and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi (L) put their hands on an illuminated globe during the inauguration ceremony of the Global Center for Combating Extremist Ideology in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on May 21, 2017. (Photo by Bandar Algaloud / Saudi Royal Council / Handout/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images) BEIRUT — The outcome of Tuesday's US presidential election is unlikely to have much short-term impact on the diplomatic effort to normalize relations between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) and Israel, as the fallout of Israeli military actions over the last year has made such an agreement untenable politically, experts tell Breaking Defense. Saudi-Israeli normalization has been a foreign policy priority for the US over the last two administrations. Under the Abraham Accords, the Trump administration helped ink normalization deals between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco, and had hoped to conclude such a deal with Riyadh. The Biden administration then tried to close the deal before the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks in Israel set off a regional conflagration. It stands to reason that whomever wins on Nov. 5, either former president Donald Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris would also seek to tie the Saudis and Israelis together. But five experts told Breaking Defense they see no easy way forward for such an agreement, no matter how much a new US president may seek to encourage it — at least until Israel ends its operations in Gaza. 'Regardless of whether Harris or Trump wins this year’s presidential election, I don’t expect Saudi Arabia to normalize relations with Israel at any point in the foreseeable future,' said Giorgio Cafiero, CEO of Gulf State Analytics, a US-based consulting firm. He added that 'any talk of Israeli normalization [is] toxic in the Arab world. Saudi Arabia’s leadership would be taking huge risks if they were to bring Riyadh into the Abraham Accords at a time in which images of death and destruction in Palestine are livestreaming 24/7.' Mohammed Soliman, strategic adviser at McLarty Associates and director at the Middle East Institute, said that seeking normalization between the two countries is a 'bipartisan priority' that should play out regardless of who wins the election. But he, too, is skeptical anything will happen anytime soon. 'The situation in Gaza and its trajectory will play a fundamental role in shaping the prospects for any potential normalization agreement, influencing how it is negotiated, its timelines, and its parameters. Whether this is successful or not is difficult to assess at the moment,' Soliman said. Mohammed Baharoon, general director of B'huth, a Dubai-based public policy research center, said that one way the US president can influence such an agreement is putting pressure on Israel to 'reach a political deal with Palestinian that provides them with a state and end the occupation which has been a major source of instability in the region.' Ali Bakir, professor at Qatar University and non-resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Scowcroft Middle East Security Initiative, noted that Saudi Arabia has signaled it has two key requirements it wants to see before moving forward with normalization. 'These include a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and a NATO-like security agreement with the US. Currently, it appears that the conditions are not conducive for Riyadh to advance in this area,' he said. The US-Saudi security deal, something that seemed extremely close before the Oct. 7 attacks upset the regional balance, is a key lever here, said Abdallah Al Junaid, a Bahraini strategic expert. 'Saudi Arabia is clear on that, no normalization without 1) Addressing the Palestinian Israeli solution, and 2) The Saudis won't sign a deal that constraints their strategic security options. So if the next president of the USA secures that, the Saudis will,' he told Breaking Defense. In April, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced that a new defense pact between the United States and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is 'potentially very close to completion.' Getting that agreement in place could give either a Trump or Harris administration a modicum of power in trying to find peace between Riyadh and Jerusalem. But summing up the tone of the analysts, Cafiero said, 'I don’t see either a Harris or Trump administration having much success in terms of bringing new Arab-Islamic countries into the normalization camp.' Another tool the US president could employ in the region is a tried and true one: dangling arms sales for policy wins. The Trump administration put an emphasis on 'economic security as national security,' and loosened guidance on arms sales in order to make it easier to sell weapons abroad. In contrast, the Biden administration put an emphasis on human rights when judging potential arms sales, and is seen as less willing to open the armaments chest to the Gulf nations. How a new administration could handle weapon sales to the region is of great interest, with eyes likely to fall on Trump should he win the presidency, especially as one of the signature moments of the Trump administration was his visit to Riyadh and announcement of a major arms sale package to the Saudis. 'Buyers might perceive Trump as more transactional, potentially leading them to believe that purchasing more weapons would grant them greater influence over him,' said Bakir, the Qatar University expert. But, he warned, 'Trump would likely aim to increase arms sales to the Gulf States, possibly pressuring some of them to buy more, even if it's not in their best interest.' That could also mean revisiting arms sales announcements from before the Biden administration. Most notable is plans to sell the UAE F-35 Joint Strike Fighters, alongside MQ-9 SeaGuardian UAVs. That deal fell apart over US concerns about UAE's Chinese 5G wireless technology. In the intervening time, the UAE seems to have moved on to other plans, meaning it's no guarantee that the F-35 deal happens if Trump returns. 'Most [Gulf Cooperation Council] air forces have acquired 4.5 generations fighters, the next strategic step is to pool their resources in R&amp;D to develop the smart munitions that their armed forces need,' Al Junaid told Breaking Defense. 'Saudi Arabia and the UAE have opted to different strategic approach by partnering [with] others in the development 5th and 6th [generation] solutions rather than acquiring solutions.' And of course, each country in the region has slightly different desires when it comes to arms. 'For the UAE, the F-35 deal could be contingent on other issues, such as their potential role in Gaza,' said Bakir. 'Israel expects the US to maintain its regional military edge. For Saudi Arabia, the primary goal is to secure a NATO-style agreement with the US, which would obligate the US to protect Saudi Arabia from foreign threats. Qatar, on the other hand, may seek a more robust military-partnership and US military presence in the country.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/how-us-election-might-impact-stalled-saudi-israeli-normalization-arms-sales-to-gulf-experts/	2024-11-01T07:56:35-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/trump-orb-e1730389404351.jpg
‘Alarming’ but ‘not surprising’: Australia reportedly left with 1 operational sub amid repairs, upgrades	A Collins Class submarine at Henderson Marine Complex, Western Australia. Credit Australian DoD SYDNEY — Five of Australia's six aging Collins-class submarines are undergoing repairs or are awaiting upgrades, according to a new report here, leaving only one fully operational boat to prowl the Pacific. It's a development that could hobble Canberra's ability to project power in the region and one that analysts said was 'alarming' if not predictable. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation broke the story today, quoting 'defense sources' who said that two of the Collins boats are currently in Adelaide's Osborne shipyard. Workers there are striking, which is reportedly also causing delays to the in-depth maintenance underway. Unexpected levels of corrosion are reportedly slowing work as well. The three other boats are at HMAS Stirling's Garden Island naval base in Western Australia The Defense Ministry issued a statement to the ABC that it has 'more than one boat available' for operations 'if required.' The statement said that the Collins boats 'meet government-directed levels of operational availability.' The ministry did not immediately respond to Breaking Defense's request for comment. Analysts expressed concern about the news, noting successive Australian governments have deferred and delayed making decisions about what was to replace the Collins class and how they should be maintained and upgraded. The Collins-class subs are being upgraded to extend their projected lifespans. The 'Life-of-Type Extension' (LOTE) was announced in June. Australia had already scaled back earlier planned upgrades to optronics for the Collins. Optronics refers to a visual sensor technology widely used on submarines. The boats will also not receive the Tomahawk cruise missile. The new report is 'pretty alarming news, especially since these boats have to operate through to the 2040s (alongside the Virginia class SSNs) and much was riding on LOTE, which has now been significantly scaled back. If our Collins class SSKs are non-operational in 2024, I really doubt that they will be a credible force through the remainder of this decade, let alone into the next one,' Malcolm Davis, a defense expert at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, said in an email. The so-called capability gap between the planned lifespan of the Collins class and the arrival of the first Australian-owned Virginia class nuclear-powered attack submarines has long been a topic of concern here. The United States intends to sell Australia three Virginia class boats as soon as the early 2030s. Australia has an option to buy up to two more. If the Collins fleet remains as hobbled as they are now, that gap may need to be addressed more urgently. One UK and up to four US nuke boats will rotate regularly to HMAS Sterling starting in 2027 in what is called Submarine Rotational Force &#8211; West (SRF-West). That force may be used to bridge the capability gap. 'My guess is that government will try to explain that SRF-West will carry the burden if the Collins class boats can't deploy, but that argument is pretty unconvincing given that the SRF-W boats are US Navy and occasional Royal Navy Astutes,' Davis said. The AUKUS Optimal Pathway, the government's plan for acquiring next-generation subs, should have included an option to purchase Japanese or South Korean conventionally powered subs to replace Collins immediately rather than pursuing the LOTE upgrades, argued Davis. He said the Royal Australian Navy was opposed to such an option because they worried that the nuclear option would be canceled. The state of the Collins fleet was 'not surprising,' according to Jennifer Parker, a former Royal Australian Navy officer now at the National Security College of the Australian National University. 'If the reporting is correct, it’s not surprising given the state of the aged boats outlined by Defense in estimates and the plan to extend their life,' Parker said in an email. 'The lesson here is that successive governments have delayed decision making on recapitalization of the Navy. Now the issues can’t be immediately fixed. We must learn to start planning for replacement capabilities when classes of vessels are first commissioned and make timely decisions.' At the end of May, officials with the Australian Submarine Corporation (ASC) told a parliamentary hearing that half of the Collins fleet would be unavailable for the rest of the year as they were being upgraded and treated for unexpected corrosion problems discovered on two of the boats.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/alarming-but-not-surprising-australia-reportedly-left-with-1-operational-sub-amid-repairs-upgrades/	2024-11-01T06:43:26-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/20230207adf8630742_0011.jpeg

Perla Alfaro) WASHINGTON — As the US Army contemplates floating extremely high-flying balloons into the stratosphere for a variety of missions, service space officials suggested recently that one of those missions might be carrying and launching drones that would disrupt or destroy enemy space assets on the ground, like jammers or satellite control stations. Col. Donald Brooks, commander of the Army's 1st Space Brigade, told the annual Association of the US Army conference earlier this month that the service will have 'multi-form factor balloons operating at various altitudes, executing different mission sets, ultimately increasing the target problem set and dilemma for our adversaries, which directly supports the Army and [Defense Department] resiliency efforts and makes us more lethal.' The balloons are envisioned as aiding in 'deep sensing and support long-range precision fires, enable navigation warfare, provide network extension via voice and data, enable assured access to PNT — our position navigation and timing — and have both lethal and non-lethal payloads.' But, as a senior Army space official, Brooks also said the Army is 'integrating high-altitude platforms with the ability to reconstitute, augment and surge space effects, if and when our adversary interferes with our freedom of access and movement maneuver in the space domain.' A chart shown during his presentation offered more detail, depicting drone-dropping balloons for missions deep into enemy territory and apparently targeting terrestrial space assets.

(Photo: Theresa Hitchens/Breaking Defense) Comparing the idea to 'Russian stacking dolls,' Andrew Evans, director of the Army’s Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) Task Force, told Breaking Defense on Oct. 16 that 'the concept of having a balloon drop something else is not new.' The Army, he explained, is looking at a number of potential payloads that could be dropped from balloons, as well as other types of high-altitude platforms. 'So, the idea would be that if we do successfully exploit the stratosphere, which we will do eventually &#8230; it won't be exclusive to a sensing mission, it won't be exclusive to an [intelligence] mission, it won't be exclusive to a comms relay mission. It'll be all of the above, in a variety of different forms and factors. &#8230; [W]e'll probably fly decoys as well,' Evans said. 'That's how you win, I think, in the future, is that you deliver multiple different payloads in multiple different ways for different missions,' he added At the moment, however, there isn't any formal Army solicitation to industry for employing counterspace drones launched from high-altitude platforms of any sort — whether those be balloons, crewed aircraft, bigger drones or helicopters, according to a service spokesperson. Rather, a number of different Army organizations across mission areas and within Army Futures Command are involved in experiments to test out potential applications. 'The Army is considering applications in which high-altitude platforms employ launched effects, aiding in the ability to see and sense further. Currently, there is no formal RFP [request for proposal] or RFI [request for information] for launched effects from a high altitude platform. However, the Army continues to learn more from its experiments and Soldier feedback about the unique potential military capabilities these platforms could provide,' the spokesperson said Oct. 25. 'Launched effects' is the Army term of art for small drones that shoot out of something else mid-flight to collect info or strike targets, and the service is studying a number of options for short-, medium- and long-range missions.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/army-eyes-balloon-motherships-to-drop-lethal-and-non-lethal-drones-aid-in-counterspace-ops/	2024-11-01T05:16:56-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/8498180-e1721841254694.jpg
Marine Corps reveals what went wrong in 2023 missing F-35 saga	A U.S. Marine Corps F-35B with Marine Medium Tiltrotor Squadron 265 (Rein.), 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit, takes off aboard the amphibious assault ship USS America (LHA-6), in the Pacific Ocean, June 12, 2023. (U.S. Marine Corps photo by Cpl. Christopher R. Lape) DENVER — The US Marine Corps revealed today that the F-35B stealth fighter that captured the nation's attention after going missing for a full day in September 2023 pulled off its inadvertent technological vanishing act due to an electrical malfunction — though the service still said the surviving pilot was to blame for the plane's eventual crash. According to the Marine Corps, on Sept. 17, 2023 the F-35 pilot was attempting to climb out of a 'missed approach in instrument meteorological conditions and heavy precipitation near Joint Base Charleston, South Carolina,' when he ejected from the plane. The release said there had been an 'electrical event during flight' that took out several on-board systems, and there was a 'probability that the helmet-mounted display and panoramic cockpit display were not operational for at least three distinct periods.' Still, the service said, the plane was airworthy. 'The pilot incorrectly diagnosed an out-of-controlled flight emergency and ejected from a flyable aircraft, albeit during a heavy rainstorm compounded with aircraft electrical and display malfunctions,' the Marines Corps said. Though the pilot punched out successfully and landed safely, the plane went on to fly by itself for 11 minutes and 21 seconds due to the jet’s 'advanced automatic flight-control systems,' the service said, before crashing '64 nautical miles northeast of the airfield in Williamsburg County, South Carolina.' That 11 minutes-plus of flying proved a problem for the military as officials scrambled to find the jet shortly after the pilot ejected. Joint Base Charleston even appealed to the public for help in locating it. Predictably, the fiasco led to a flood of jokes on social media, along with statements from bewildered elected officials. The F-35 is supposed to be masked from radar in combat conditions, but when flying under circumstances like those surrounding the crash, the stealth fighter often flies with a transponder that transmits its location. The transponder’s failure stemming from the electrical issue, the jet’s low observable coating and its 'eventual descent below the air-traffic control radar horizon' all contributed to its loss of radar contact and subsequent prolonged disappearance, according to the Marine Corps’s release. 'The mishap resulted in no ground-related injuries, but it did result in property damage in the form of lost forested land and crops' in the rural area where the F-35B crashed, the release says. The jet was assigned to Marine Fighter Attack Training Squadron (VMFAT 501) under the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing, and the pilot 'was qualified and current to conduct the scheduled flight,' according to the service’s release. The F-35B is the short takeoff and vertical landing version of the tri-variant fighter. The Marines Corps said that 'no punitive actions [were] recommended.' The Military Times reported the pilot was given a new command nearly a year after the incident, but was relieved months after taking the helm. The investigation concluded that the electrical malfunction 'was not related to any maintenance activities.' Asked about the crash investigation, Russ Goemaere, a spokesperson for the F-35 Joint Program Office, said in a statement that '[t]he F-35 electrical power system performed as intended in accommodating the malfunction of an electrical component, and the aircraft remained fully controllable throughout the event. The F-35 remains safe to fly worldwide.' 'The safety of F-35 pilots is our number one priority and we will continue to work with the Services and our industry partners to ensure the safety of our warfighters,' Goemaere said. F-35 manufacturer Lockheed Martin referred a request for comment to the Marine Corps and Joint Program Office.

Crew safety for units under armor: Accurate sensors are the key	Thales' Catherine thermal image sensor is seen on the gun turret of the Amphibious Combat Vehicle, ACV-30, to provide advanced threat detection and imaging for the weapons station and crew. (Thales photo) The threat environment for ground vehicle platforms has evolved significantly. Maneuver formations now face a multifaceted threat that includes both kinetic force-on-force and unmanned systems threats and non-kinetic effects such as active electronic warfare, or a combination of both. EW is a particular challenge, not only being able to detect and react to threats but also being able to understand and mitigate the formation’s own EW signature in order to be less visible to the enemy. These combined threats are being mitigated with a three-fold operations construct that provides a comprehensive understanding of the battlefield, an ability to detect threats, and capability to deny or degrade those threats. Together they give maneuver forces a means to understand what’s going on around the formation and each individual platform. Situational awareness in those scenarios come about through three enabling buckets of technology: The specific threat and capability requirements may vary across Areas of Responsibility such as U.S. Central Command or European Command, but the core principles of situational awareness, threat detection, and counter-measure capabilities remain critical for ensuring vehicle and crew survivability. 'We now must assume we are always operating in contested environments,' said Erik Balascik, director of business development for ground vehicles, Thales Defense &amp; Security, Inc. (TDSI). 'If you're an armored platform commander you are now operating in a closed environment, inside your vehicle. 'Now, given the threats and technology for crew and vehicle survivability, crews operate closed hatch. They are physically inside the vehicle either in the turret or hull of the vehicle, and they must rely on external sensors for situational awareness.' Sensors for closed-hatch operations The most important sensor types for vehicle survivability include infrared sensors for vision, acoustic sensors for shot protection, and thermal imagers for targeting. HD Minerva is Thales’s latest uncooled thermal imaging sensor, which is the outside eyes for driver vision enhancement (DVE) and local situational awareness (LSA) as the vehicle crew conducts under-armor maneuvers. Thales’s Minerva HD uncooled thermal imaging sensor is the ‘outside eyes’ of the vehicle crew as they conduct under armor operations, and its 1280&#215;1024 HD detector provides 2x more pixels than previous VGA sensors (Thales photo) Designed and manufactured by Thales in Canada, home to Thales’ global center of excellence for uncooled technologies, Minerva integrates uncooled Long Wave Infrared (LWIR) HD 1280&#215;1024, 12-micron detector – a rarity in uncooled devices – and a full HD 1920&#215;1080 visible module. Minerva’s sensor outputs fully digital 60 Hz video (3G-SDI), and its low-latency and automatic image processing algorithms ensure users experience no delays in optimizing situational awareness without needing to make adjustments. That means users can trust the live images to give them the information they need to act fast, feel safe, and gain a crucial tactical advantage. 'Our camera provides twice the pixels than the previous sensors, and the crews will immediately see the difference based upon what they had in the past,' said Balascik. 'You can see farther and even better than you would see standing outside a vehicle with your own eyes. It's a completely different way to experience the world around you to understand what your vehicle and the vehicles in the formation are doing.' If HD Minerva is the eyes of an enhanced DVE/LSA system, then gunshot protection through a Thales system called Acusonic is the ears. Acusonic gunshot detection overcomes an established weakness in other shot-detection systems. Rather than relying solely upon picking up muzzle blast to provide accurate bearings alone – the Achilles Heal of other systems due to false alarms – Acusonic also utilizes the projectile's supersonic shock wave and wake signature to augment the weapon muzzle blast to provide detection and threat location capabilities in diverse battlespace. Thales Acusonic for robotic applications transforms the system into a multi-functional sensor by providing a telepresence capability to the robotic vehicle operator. (Thales photo) 'That's what sets us apart from prior systems,' said Balascik, noting that Acusonic was selected for both the British Army’s Ajax armored fighting vehicle and Boxer mechanized infantry vehicle programs. 'It is being evaluated on multiple prototypes in the United States, and the reason that we're getting that acceptance is because the system's not constantly giving you false alarms. It is actually a force multiplier instead of the hindrance for the operation.' It has also shown it can provide accurate bearings to firing positions from moving platforms not just on land but also on the water for special forces operating in littoral or riverine environments where hostile firing positions may be concealed, for example. Interestingly enough, the collection of signals from Acusonic can also play an important role in ground robotics on platforms like the XM30 Mechanized Infantry Combat Vehicle to provide what’s called 'telepresence.' Most robotic vehicles only provide visual sensing, but one equipped with Acusonic would let the operator not only see what the robot is seeing but actually hear what it picks up to get an even better understanding of the surroundings. The third key category of sensor for vehicle survivability is thermal imaging and laser range finding for targeting. Thales has a broad portfolio when it comes to targeting, including a cooled thermal imager called SharpView that the U.S. Marine Corps has integrated onto its Marine Air Defense Integrated System (MADIS) air-defense vehicle, and a system called Panoramic Above Armor Gimbal (PAAG). PAAG is a stabilized 360-degree electronic surveillance and sighting system in a compact package that gives vehicle commanders and crews a wide range of capabilities through a combination of sensors. They include a cooled thermal imager and high-resolution daylight color camera, both with continuous zoom, along with a laser rangefinder and laser target designator. Together they give crews long-range threat detection and identification, weapon aiming and fire support capabilities, day and night, in all weather conditions. Everything is remotely controlled from inside the vehicle to keep crews protected at all times. 'Whether it is for air defense systems like MADIS or new vehicles like the Marine Corps’ Advanced Reconnaissance Vehicle, our camera system provides those vehicle crews with the next generation of thermal imagers,' said Balascik. 'It’s critical because the military is up-gunning to 30mm, Medium Caliber Weapon System turrets. That means you need additional distance from your thermal imagers so you can see to the same maximum effective range of that weapon system.' Power management and standards for SA In space-constrained vehicles, integration of these systems presents its own particular challenge. For example, the vehicle systems themselves need to have certain smart capabilities like intra-vehicle network management and especially energy management. 'We can make decisions with our vehicles today that are more capable than our vehicles from years past, but they still roll from point A to point B and have a finite amount of power to drive these vehicles and also power the systems that are inside,' said Patrick Allison, director of DoD business development for TDSI. 'You can't go to the battlefield without power. It's absolutely necessary. And how you manage power can make or break your battle plan.' Thales has a family of power management systems that not only distribute power, they channel the right amount of power to various systems across the vehicle, which can also help mitigate vehicle signature management. The power loads are smartly managed to let operators take power from one area and reserve it for another when necessary. That’s especially valuable at night and during obscure operations so crews can have a silent-watch capability where systems are running without the vehicle being turned on. Finally, compliance to standards like CMOSS and VICTORY are critical enabling technologies that allow new capabilities to be integrated onto vehicles by the government and OEMs as threats and requirements evolve. 'In the Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence (C4I) arena, vehicles introduced post-2030 will have a requirement written around CMOSS and CMFF compliance,' noted Allison. 'That will let the Army upgrade or add systems to these platforms all based on open standards and architecture with interfaces that permit systems to be swapped between platforms. Thales is working the C4I aspect of CMOSS and bringing in capability for both voice and data on the battlefield.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/crew-safety-for-units-under-armor-accurate-sensors-are-the-key/	2024-10-31T12:25:17-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/Thales-lead-image-scaled.jpg
Full house: Google to be final JWCC partner authorized for Secret-level cloud work in 2025	Warfighters operate equipment at the lab located at Defense Information Systems Agency Headquarters at Fort Meade Md. (David Abizaid / Defense Information Systems Agency) DoDIIS 2024 — By the beginning of next year, all four of the Joint Warfighting Cloud Capability (JWCC) providers will have reached Impact Level 6 (IL-6) security authorization, which deals with information classified Secret, as Google becomes the last to join the pack, a military official said Tuesday. Having the four cloud service providers that can operate in the IL-6 environment is a 'massive help' in JWCC's development, according to Lt. Col. John Hall, who serves as the joint program lead for the JWCC at the Defense Information Systems Agency. He added that having all four at IL-6 will prevent any vendor lock. 'It allows you to get the right [cloud provider] for the job, and then potentially allows competition. So you know when they start to do things like rates, it gives you that capability,' he told Breaking Defense on the sidelines of the Department of Defense Intelligence Information Systems conference Tuesday. 'So it's been massively helpful to have four different [cloud providers]; it keeps [the vendors] honest too.' The other three providers, Oracle, Microsoft and Amazon Web Services, already have authorization to operate on an IL-6 environment in the JWCC. IL-6 is reserved for the storage and processing of information classified up to the 'Secret' level. Migrating data to the JWCC has been on the top of the Pentagon's to-do list since it announced the initiative in 2022. The contract is worth up to a collective $9 billion, and recently crossed the $1 billion mark in task orders back in September. As the Pentagon continues its mass migration to the JWCC, it’s important for the department and its business partners to think of operating on the cloud as a fundamental part of one’s information technology architecture, Hall said during a breakout session Tuesday. 'Cloud should be something that is part of your larger IT infrastructure. I don't think it is one or the other, [the cloud] should be built in to help you with your IT, services and delivery,' he said. 'Thinking about how you integrate multiple different clouds is important, because if you think about them as siloed like, ‘This is my Google cloud; this is my AWS; this is my Microsoft; this is my Oracle,’ you're not achieving the efficiencies that all of them will achieve together as a whole,' he said. 'So I encourage everybody, when you look at these things, think of it as multi-cloud, not separate multiple standalone instances.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/full-house-google-to-be-final-jwcc-partner-authorized-for-secret-level-cloud-work-in-2025/	2024-10-31T12:14:31-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/241031_DVIDS_DISA_lab_8558227-scaled-e1730382574632.jpg
The truly spooky munitions shortage for the Pentagon: Silver bullets	This mystical creature is rolling his eyes because someone came up and said to him, 'A werewolf? More like a war-wolf, amirite?' (Graphic Breaking Defense, original images via Getty/DVIDS; caption to be blamed on Editor-in-Chief Aaron Mehta) WASHINGTON — With werewolves on the prowl and vampires stalking the shadows, there's no more valuable munition on Halloween than silver bullets, legendarily capable of felling supernatural foes. The concept of a silver bullet may have its origins in folklore, but the term long ago evolved to signify a simple, quick solution to an intractable problem. And to listen to Pentagon officials and others in the US national security establishment beset with intractable problems — from Russia's invasion of Ukraine to tech innovation to spooky drone incursions — the Defense Department could really use a few in their five-sided Trick or Treat baskets. (The military does actually employ a 'Silver Bullet,' an all-in-one secure comms capsule that can be loaded aboard transport aircraft to keep senior officials in communication, and apparently in comfort, while they're in the air. But why let that get in the way of a good gag?) This Halloween, Breaking Defense has collected a list of times defense leaders have openly wished that a silver bullet would appear, or lamented that one doesn't seem available. This is a non-exhaustive list of all mostly from 2024, but still gives a sense of how the munitions shortage facing the US and its allies extends to the realm of the mystical. Earlier this month, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin made an impassioned speech (at least for him) in defense of America's commitment to backing Kyiv. But, he said, no one thing the US or any of its allies could give Ukraine would be the 'silver bullet, no single capability will turn the tide.' 'What matters is the way that Ukraine fights back. What matters is the combined effects of your military capabilities. And what matters is staying focused on what works,' he said. The speech could serve as a summary of US policy when it comes to capabilities provided to Ukraine, in which just about every major weapon system announced for Kyiv came with the same caveat: it's not a silver bullet that will end the conflict. That's true of the decision to send American Abrams tanks, when then-Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley said in April 2023, 'I would also caution, there's no silver bullet in war. &#8230; The outcomes of battles and wars are the function of many, many variables.' Or in August 2023 when Gen. James Hecker, commander of US Air Forces Europe, said the F-16's future introduction to combat is 'not going to be a silver bullet, [that] all of a sudden they're going to start taking down [Russian air defenses] because they have an F-16.' This year, officials used the phrase when discussing sending additional Patriot air defense batteries and the Ukrainian employment of the Army Tactical Missile System, better known as ATACMS. 'I believe they will make a difference. But as I've said before at this podium — and as you've heard from Secretary Austin, the Chairman, and other senior military officials — there is no silver bullet in this conflict,' White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told reporters in April. A few times this year officials have employed the silver bullet rhetoric to make the case against allowing Ukraine to strike more deeply into Russia with American arms than they are comfortable with — a long-running and ongoing controversy. 'You heard me say the other day that there is no silver bullet when it comes to things like this,' Austin said in September when asked about loosening restrictions on Kyiv. 'One thing doesn't determine the end of the end of a conflict or the transition in that conflict. It's a combination of different things that create the effects that you want to create. But I think as you make those decisions, the goals and objectives need to be clear, what are you trying to accomplish as you employ those weapons systems?' Based partly on lessons they've learned from Ukraine, US officials have been increasingly concerned about the novel threat that drones present, combined with the older but still potent threat from missiles. And while none of those unmanned systems are haunted (we think), it sounds like a silver bullet would still be useful. In April, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Space Policy John Plumb praised Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) systems, specifically saying that in both Ukraine and Israel, 'air and missile defense systems have proven to be indispensable, life-saving assets: defending military forces, civilian populations, and critical infrastructure against unprovoked terror and aggression.' But, as the reader may expect by now, he cautioned, 'I don't want to leave you with the impression that IAMD systems are a silver bullet against every type of sophisticated adversary threat.' 'Relying solely on traditional air and missile defense systems — with a limited number of interceptors, guided by large, detectable radars in closed fire control systems — can no longer be the only response against the array of technologically sophisticated offensive air and missile systems threatening U.S. interests,' he said. Similarly, in December a senior US Army official said the service was purposefully not seeking a 'silver bullet' solution to the growing drone problem, but a layered defense system. There's certainly no shortage of specific tech problems that could use silver bullets. One involves hardening US forces' position, navigation and timing (PNT) so that they can operate in GPS-denied environments. 'There is no silver bullet,' Nikki Markiel, senior GEOINT authority for geomatics at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), told Breaking Defense in May. 'Everybody would like to have one. And I think that is where a lot of the struggle comes, because GPS has been easy. It’s ubiquitous.' Another revolves around the Pentagon's sprawling Combined Joint All-Domain Command and Control (CJADC2) initiative and the data-sharing its meant to do in an incredibly complex network environment. 'Our ability to push data in the places and to the people that need to get it right now is confined by whether or not you’re on a network that allows me to talk to you,' Brig Gen. Luke Cropsey, the Air Force’s integrating program executive officer for Command, Control, Communications and Battle Management (C3BM), said in July 2023. To broaden JADC2 capabilities, Cropsey said he needs new tools to enable better data transfer, ones he cautioned would not materialize in a 'silver bullet' solution. More broadly, Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks highlighted the silver bullet problem when looking back over her tenure in a 30,000-foot view of the defense industrial base's ability to innovate within Pentagon acquisition structures. 'I think the biggest takeaway I could give you is that &#8230; any attempt to simplify to some kind of silver bullet system, fix to the system, you know, those will fail,' she said in March. 'We have needs across the department that are vast and that kind of fall all across the spectrum, software, hardware, everything in between, and most importantly, integration of all of that.' Just a few weeks before that, Hicks specifically discussed the institutional roadblocks when it comes to the development and adoption of artificial intelligence. 'So for three years, we've been taking a comprehensive, iterative, warfighter-centric approach to defense innovation writ large — recognizing we face an accumulation of challenges and barriers, and there is no silver bullet that will lower them all,' she said at the February Global AI Contest event. More recently, she decried budgetary delays and its affect on the Pentagon's plans. 'We've been able to deliver real outcomes,' Hicks said. 'There is no silver bullet at a level that we're talking about, [which is] the scale of the Defense Department.' Perhaps Hicks, in her push for innovation, should have simply asked industry to come up with schematics for a truly devastating weapon: a silver bullet for all the DoD's problems.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/the-truly-spooky-munitions-shortage-for-the-pentagon-silver-bullets/	2024-10-31T10:00:16-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/241031_werewolf_soldier.png
HII slashes financial outlook for 2024 due to contract delays, supply chain issues	The Virginia-class attack submarine Minnesota (SSN 783) is under construction at Huntington Ingalls Newport News Shipbuilding. (U.S. Navy photo courtesy of Newport News Shipbuilding/Released) WASHINGTON — Supply chain problems, COVID-era contract terms and lagging contract negotiations with the Navy hampered shipbuilding giant HII during the third quarter, forcing the company to lower its financial guidance for the year, the company announced today. Free cash flow for the year is now expected to top out at $100 million, a drastic reduction from a previous estimate of between $600 million and $700 million. HII also withdrew its five-year cash flow outlook, which spanned from 2024 to 2028. Shares of the company plummeted 23 percent today as the company failed to meet Wall Street expectations. 'The long-term value equation for HII has not changed. There's unprecedented demand for our products and services,' CEO Chris Kastner told investors during an earnings call. 'We remain confident in our mid- to long-term guidance of nine to 10 percent shipbuilding margins, and we firmly believe the actions we are taking will enable us to stabilize performance as we continue to work through these shifts.' The company’s Newport News Shipbuilding division — which builds aircraft carriers and submarines — took a total $78 million in charges, including $34 million related to design changes for Block IV Virginia-class submarines, with the rest of the impact spread between two Ford-class carriers and the refueling and overhaul of the John C. Stennis (CVN-74), said Chief Financial Officer Tom Stiehle. Executives broke down the company’s challenges into two buckets. First, it is unclear whether HII will wrap up contract negotiations with the Navy for 17 Virginia-class Block V and Block VI and Columbia-class submarines by the end of the year, which could alter the company’s profitability and cash flow for the year and beyond. RELATED: Supply chain issues slowing down General Dynamics sub construction, CEO says Second, HII’s shipyards have underperformed due to late deliveries from its supply chain and a lowered experience level among its own workforce, which has led to greater than expected rework. 'It bears repeating that nearly all of the ships currently under construction were negotiated prior to COVID, and since those contracts were signed, we have seen a significant loss of shipbuilding experience in our yards,' Kastner said in a statement accompanying the results.'Those ship contracts, which we are still operating under at Newport News, did not anticipate in their cost targets and risk limiting clauses the significant disruption of our workforce and supply chain, or extended periods of heightened cost inflation.' On the ongoing negotiations with the Navy, Kastner said the discussions were a chance to 'reset' contract terms to reflect those post-COVID realities. 'We've been working very hard with the customer to try to get those 17 ships right. It's a broad-based sort of contract that we're working on that really unlocks investment in in labor and infrastructure and technology across the portfolio,' he said. 'We thought we were pretty close to getting it done. It's in review still, and alternatives are being reviewed, and we're supporting that conversation, but it's just created some unpredictability.' RELATED: From Kabul to keel laying, Afghan immigrants find new careers at US shipyards In a note to investors, J.P. Morgan analyst Seth Seifman said the company's third quarter results and withdrawal of its cash flow guidance was 'a worse outcome than we expected.' 'Shipbuilding, and especially submarine building, is a top national priority that is attracting significant funding,' he wrote. 'As parts of industry struggle to keep pace with demand, however, the Navy and Congress may need to take more dramatic action to advance their plans if they are not content to muddle along.' Among the challenges at Newport News is an investigation into reports that workers had improperly welded noncritical structures on carriers and submarines. An initial assessment found that fewer than two dozen welders did not consistently follow procedures in their weld process, Stiele said, adding that the company continues to work with the Navy on a comprehensive investigation. HII took an initial charge connected to the welds, which Stiehle characterized as 'immaterial,' but the total financial impact will not be known until the investigation is over, he said. Cash flow for the next couple of years will be 'choppy' and heavily dependent on whether the company is able to improve performance as it enters its new contracts, Kastner said, adding that the company is also taking a 'hard look' at its expenses. HII’s supply chain issues echo concerns raised by General Dynamics CEO Phebe Novakovic, who said the company would slow submarine construction because its supply chain could not keep pace with General Dynamics Electric Boat. 'We’re going to control what we control,' Novakovic said last week on a GD earnings call. 'We’re going to adjust our pace to align with what we now see is more of a predictable supply chain schedule that is elongated. We’ll take cost out of our business, and we’ll continue to work productivity on the deck plates with an increasingly capable and skilled and experienced workforce.' While the money flowing to the submarine industrial base is helping HII’s supply chain, it will take time for the company to reap the benefits that come from those capital investments in new facilities, equipment and tooling, Kastner said.

UK vows to ‘closely monitor all our supply chains’ after collapse of hypersonic supplier	UK firm Reaction Engines specialises in high speed propulsion and cooling technologies, but collapsed today after failing to secure a rescue deal (Reaction Engines) BELFAST — The UK Ministry of Defence said it will continue to 'closely monitor all our supply chains' as it reels from the collapse of Reaction Engines, the high speed propulsion manufacturer and industry lead on London's quest to develop a reusable Mach 5 and beyond aircraft under the Hypersonic Air Vehicle Experimental (HVX) program. The aerospace company, best known for its cutting-edge cooling technology and Synergetic Air Breathing Rocket Engine (SABRE), is also part of the £1 billion ($1.3 billion) Hypersonic Technologies &amp; Capability Development Framework (HTCDF) effort to build and deliver a first UK hypersonic missile, but was plunged into administration today after failing to secure a financial rescue deal, according to Sky News. The company reportedly conducted weeks of talks with potential buyers, including an unsuccessful attempt to win over £20 million from the United Arab Emirate's Strategic Development Fund (SDF), the investment agency of the UAE's Tawazun Council. Sky News noted that accountancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) had officially taken on Reaction administration duties today. PwC did not immedately respond to a requst for comment from Breaking Defense, nor did the UAE's SDF. A spokesperson for Reaction declined to comment. Analysts told Breaking Defense it remains to be seen what impact Reaction's troubles will have on hypersonic programs, but there are few who could replace the company's share of the hypersonic work. The UK MoD only told Breaking Defense in a statement on Wednesday, prior to the official news, that the MoD has a 'long running relationship with Reaction Engines Ltd and closely monitor[s] all our supply chains to ensure the continued delivery of key capabilities, including research and development.' Reaction, Rolls-Royce, the Royal Air Force’s Rapid Capabilities Office (RCO), the UK Government’s Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl) and the UK’s National Security Strategic Investment Fund (NSSIF) are jointly involved in HVX, which has been designed to 'rapidly develop critical high-Mach/hypersonic technologies, including novel air-breathing propulsion architectures, innovative thermal management systems and advanced vehicle concepts,' according to Rolls-Royce. SABRE and patented cooling technologies are critical parts of HVX. Progress on the effort includes launch of a full-scale experimental engine test campaign, partners carrying out design work on hypersonic vehicle concepts and the unveiling of Concept V — a single engine hypersonic concept vehicle. Regarding the separate hypersonic framework effort HTCDF, Reaction was picked by the UK in May, as one of 90 small and large organizations from industry and academia, eligible to bid for contracts in support of developing indigenous hypersonic missile capabilities. A total of eight hypersonic technology lots for the project cover: design and integration, modelling and testing, airframe and power generation, low Technical Readiness Level (TRL) concepts, a lethality package (including warhead and fuse), propulsion, on board computing, and seekers. London has settled on a three-step strategy of buy, collaborate and develop to build out hypersonic missile capabilities, which also focus on potentially acquiring a Hypersonic Glide Vehicle (HGV) as part of AUKUS Pillar II. Like all other major projects, the long term future of HVX and HTCDF remain on hold until the UK's Strategic Defence Review (SDR) reports in mid-2025, but Reaction's collapse could have a troubling impact on both high profile projects, analysts said. William Freer, research fellow at the Council on Geostrategy, a British think tank, told Breaking Defense on Wednesday following early reports of Reaction's then-potential downfall that 'going into Administration would certainly cause headaches for the HVX programme, but it is difficult to say exactly what the direct impact would be.' He noted the 'outcome is highly dependent on exactly who is brought in for administration and how they decide to carry out the process.' Christie Maddock, an associate professor at the Aerospace Centre of Excellence at the University of Strathclyde in Scotland, questioned how UK industry could replace Reaction. 'The biggest impact will be that the UK loses its its leadership in this field [cooling technology], and I don't know that anybody at the moment has enough momentum or enough investment to be able to pick it up again,' she noted. The financial difficulties that led to Reaction's demise were not altogether new. Asked about company challenges on the Aviation Extended podcast last year, Mark Thomas, Reaction Engines CEO said, 'Historically, it's been money raising &#8230; having to continually, on an almost annual basis, raise money for the business to fund the projects and the demonstrations and the trials. That's becoming less of a concern, but now it's shifted more into the need to penetrate the markets, generate revenue, to pour that back into the business to be self sufficient.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/uk-vows-to-closely-monitor-all-our-supply-chains-after-collapse-of-hypersonic-supplier/	2024-10-31T08:40:04-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/F-_S4BBXcAAwEVu-e1730370198366.jpg
More soldiers, control vehicles may be required to maneuver Army’s early Robotic Combat Vehicles	A Robotic Combat Vehicle Light prototype during Soldier Experimentation at the National Training Center, NTC, Fort Irwin, Calif. from July to September 2023. (US Army/ Savannah Baldwin) WASHINGTON — Testing has found that additional US Army soldiers are likely needed to operate early Robotic Combat Vehicles than anticipated even just months ago, the service disclosed this week. Under the Army's envisioned 'human machine integrated formations,' the service wants a future where RCVs are out ahead of soldiers on the front lines, taking on dangerous missions without potential loss of life. However, the service is not expecting early versions of those robots to have high levels of autonomy, which means soldiers will need to stay close by teleoperating them for the foreseeable future. Based on testing earlier this year at Fort Irwin, Calif., service leaders believed that for every two RCVs, it would need one control vehicle containing five soldiers — one driver and two teams with two each remotely manning an RCV. But in late July, as part of the Army Futures Command’s RCV Pilot-24 exercise, soldiers with the 1st Squadron, 7th Cavalry Division, again used the four RCV surrogates. The idea, the service explained in a Tuesday press release, was to have soldiers inside two trailing control vehicles operating a total of four RCVs on reconnaissance and security missions. The verdict? That wasn’t an adequate pairing that time around, and the platoon needed a third control vehicle to effectively operate the four robots, according to Brig. Gen. Chad Chalfont, the commandant of the Army Armor School at Fort Moore. As a result, the unit was 'restructured' and a third control vehicle was folded into the mix, the service explained. The service did not detail how many soldiers were now in each control vehicle, but if the math holds, that would be an additional five soldiers needed towards the front lines. While that July test event is moving the manned vehicle to robot ratio in the wrong direction, service officials previously told Breaking Defense that it is going to take time to develop and field RCVs. And part of that process may mean soldiers closer to the robots they control, as well as using them for limited missions while work continues evolving on a number of fronts. The service is testing out those RCV surrogates and control vehicle to examine how they may operate them in battle and tech limitations but still hasn’t selected which company will build the initial RCVs. That decision is expected to come in early 2025 when one company is picked to proceed with platform development. (McQ, Textron Systems, General Dynamics Land Systems, and Oshkosh Defense are all under prototyping contracts today.) And it has broadly laid out plans to use an Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV) as the future control vehicle. In recent months industry sources from all sectors have raised questions about how DEVCOM’s work and the GVAP project will ultimately converge, and the service is now hosting a Nov. 20 industry day to try and clear up confusion. There, it said, it will unveil a 'technology roadmap' to help each company 'make its best effort to align their technology against timing of future opportunities nested with the forecasted needs of the RCV program.' 'The industry day will clarify key points and provide updates regarding the RCV platform as it relates to tele-operation and growth to autonomous movement,' the Army wrote in an announcement.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/more-soldiers-control-vehicles-may-be-required-to-maneuver-armys-early-remote-combat-vehicles/	2024-10-31T08:01:42-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/12/231213_army_robot_combat_8069610-scaled-e1702489865317.jpg
US Navy to extend service lives of 12 destroyers	The guided missile destroyer USS Barry (DDG-52) enters Naval Station Mayport, Fla. (U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Shane Cameron Ross/Released) WASHINGTON — The Navy announced today it will extend the service lives of 12 Arleigh Burke-class destroyers, resulting in an anticipated 48 years of combined additional operational service from those vessels between 2028 to 2035, according to a statement from Secretary Carlos Del Toro. 'Extending these highly-capable, well-maintained destroyers will further bolster our numbers as new construction warships join the fleet,' Del Toro said in a statement. 'It also speaks to their enduring role in projecting power globally, and most recently in the Red Sea, their proven ability to defend themselves, as well as our allies, partners and friends from missile and drone attacks.' The ships included in the announcement are the oldest destroyers in the fleet ranging from the Barry (DDG-52), which will be extended for three years, to The Sullivans (DDG-68), also slated for a three-year extension. The Navy in March 2023 opted to extend the life of the class’s lead ship, the Arleigh Burke (DDG-51). The ships and their associated life extensions included in the announcement are: The statement did not include any information about the costs associated with the service life extensions, but did say the Navy had already proposed funding in its budget plans for fiscal 2026 and will update the long-range shipbuilding plan accordingly. 'Today’s budget constrained environment requires the Navy to make prioritized investments to keep more ready players on the field,' Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Lisa Franchetti said in the same statement. 'The Navy is actively pulling the right levers to maintain and grow its battle force inventory to support the United States’s global interests in peace and to win decisively in conflict.' The choice to extend the service lives of a dozen destroyers is multifaceted one for the sea service. During the Trump administration, lawmakers repeatedly hounded top Navy brass to lay out a plan to reach an overall fleet of 355-manned warships. (The Navy’s current fleet size fluctuates between 285 and 290 ships depending on the time of the year and how it lines up with commissioning and retirement ceremonies.) The service responded with a plan that eventually reached the 355-ship figure in the 2040s and 2050s through a combination of building more destroyers than originally planned as well as extending the service lives of those currently in service. The thought process, Navy leadership said at the time, was that while the fleet’s composition would not be optimal, destroyers were the best choice of ship to have in excess. Since the Trump administration ended in 2021, Navy leadership have overall tamped down on their zealousness to achieve a fleet size of any particular number, but Franchetti has repeatedly called for 'more players on the field,' invoking the service’s bottom-line need for a larger fleet. On the flip side, service life extensions necessarily mean operating a vessel for longer than intended which can lead to costlier maintenance periods and longer delays depending on a ship’s materiel condition.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/us-navy-to-extend-service-lives-of-12-destroyers/	2024-10-31T06:52:12-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/909174-e1730380760174.jpg
Hypori CEO: Air Force, Space Force to soon get access to non-classified mil networks on mobile	Spc. Acxel Budet Gonzales, Papa Company, 244th Quartermaster Battalion, takes a phone call while awaiting bus transport to his unit during Holiday Block Leave return processing Jan. 3 at the MacLaughlin Fitness Center. On Tuesday Hypori CEO Jared Shepard told Breaking Defense the Department of the Air Force will start gaining access to Hypori Halo on Nov. 15. A spokesperson from the DAF confirmed in an email that the transition to the mobile tech began in mid-October 'with the process being initiated in phases over several weeks.' 'With the Air Force deploying Hypori as part of the Workspace Anywhere program, we empower airmen and air guardsmen to interact securely with government CUI [controlled unclassified information] data from their own devices — whether at home, on the go, or even during their kids’ activities,' Shepard said. 'As global threats rise, it's crucial that our personnel have confidence in their mobile solutions to maintain mission readiness without compromising security,' he added. In August, Hypori was awarded a $4.1 million contract to provide 10,000 licenses of Hypori Halo to the DAF. Since then, more DAF service members have shown interest in registering for the program, Shepard said. The DAF’s adoption of the Halo software comes after it underwent a trial of Hypori’s Workspace Anywhere program, which ended in March. Before that, some Army service members adopted Halo in line with a new policy requiring secure virtual desktop access for soldiers, Guardsmen and Reservists, which included the option to use Halo on their mobile devices. The Army currently has 50,000 Hypori licenses, Shepard said. The Air Force will be looking for a smoother rollout than the Army's, in which some Reserve and Guardsmen said they felt left behind, as Breaking Defense previously reported. At the time, the Army expressed confidence that the virtual platforms, including Hypori, worked for the majority of users. Additionally, Shepherd said that the software is designed around zero-trust access, meaning the software assumes that no user trying to access the platform should have free rein of the network, and users have to go through particular verification processes. This is all done on a Level 5 cloud environment — the most secure environment for controlled unclassified information. As DAF users start to migrate onto the Halo platform, Halo is transitioning from a platform-as-a-service model with Microsoft’s Azure cloud to a software-as-a-service model with Amazon Web Service’s cloud. 'From a performance standpoint, that means that each individual is actually getting dedicated processing power and compute power in their virtual device. So it's going to significantly improve performance. It reduces late latency and lag and touch latency,' Shepard said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/hypori-ceo-air-force-space-force-to-soon-get-access-to-non-classified-mil-networks-on-mobile/	2024-10-31T05:33:42-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/10/231019_soldier_iphone_crowd_7580394-scaled-e1697732209145.jpg
Air Force’s new cloud-based cyber defense system to protect ‘soft unbelly’ of cyber ops networks	U.S. Air Force Maj. Gen. Thomas Hensley, 16th Air Force deputy commander, is greeted by Col. Craig Bailey, 9th Maintenance Group commander, on Beale Air Force Base, California, Aug. 24, 2023.(U.S. Air Force photo by Senior Airman Alexis Pentzer) DoDIIS 2024 — When it comes online, the Air Force expects a new, more robust cloud-based system for cyber operations to allow airmen to better understand their network ecosystem and spot weak spots before adversaries do, Gen. Thomas Hensley, commander of the 16th Air Force said Tuesday. The new system, dubbed the Integrated Defensive Cyberspace System (IDCS) is intended to replace the Cyberspace Vulnerability Assessment/Hunter (CVA/H) and the Operations Platform Fly Away Kits (IOP-FAK), and offer data sharing through the cloud so airmen from different bases can share sensitive information regarding cyber threats. Hensley’s goal: have two IDCS kits installed at each Air Force base. 'So what we are trying to do as an Air Force is make sure that our networks are not the soft underbelly to our war fighting capability,' Hensley said at the Defense Intelligence Information Systems conference Tuesday. He later told Breaking Defense on the sidelines of the conference that the new IDCS are 'bigger and more expensive' compared to their predecessors, and they will help with information gathering and defensive cyber operations. The CVA/H and IOP-FAK are technically referred to as 'weapons systems,' but practically they’re defensive structures that identify, track and abate potential cyber threats with software- and hardware-based sensor platforms. With these older systems, airmen were still able to share data, but not on a cloud environment. Now with the IDCS, the data collected from within the system will be transported from the kits and through a cloud platform into the service’s wide-ranged data platform for additional analysis. Hensley explained that when implementing the IDCS, airmen will first have to perform a 'terrain analysis,' which is a cybersecurity evaluation of the network, so they can decide where to embed the system’s sensors that will gather information on potential cyber threats. 'Buying sensors to cover everything in our ecosystem is cost prohibitive. So where is the key terrain that we need to put the sensors to protect the data to go where it needs to go?' Hensley asked. 'So that's precision sensor deployment, but you got to understand the terrain to begin with.' The timeline on replacing the older systems with IDCS is not clear, as it is dependent on when the Air Force gets the 'sustained funding' to make the transition, Hensley said. However, the initiative appears to be behind schedule. When solicitation for this program first came out, the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center said it expected IDCS to be fully underway by mid-to-late fiscal year 2024.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/air-forces-new-cloud-based-cyber-defense-system-to-protect-soft-unbelly-of-cyber-ops-networks/	2024-10-30T12:49:21-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/7995666-scaled-e1726608345988.jpg
NRO taps 3 startups for innovative launch experiments	An artist's rendering of Starfish Space's Otter satellite servicing vehicle. (Courtesy Starfish Space) WASHINGTON — Ther National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) today announced it has awarded study contracts on innovative launch capabilities to three US-based startups: Cognitive Space, Impulse Space and Starfish Space. The contracts come under the spy satellite agency's Broad Agency Announcements (BAA) for Agile Launch Innovation and Strategic Technology Advancement (BALISTA) program, which is exploring 'in space mobility and maneuver, on-orbit logistics and sustainability, mission acceleration, artificial intelligence for ground operations, and spacecraft propellant particle count,' according to the NRO's press release. The NRO said the contracts, managed by NRO's Office of Space Launch (OSL), are 'smaller in scope' — though NRO has provided no specific value, as usual for the agency as its budget is classified — and intended to assess the potential for emerging space launch providers to provide new types of capabilities. 'This BAA helps NRO advance emerging technologies across launch, on-orbit support, and command &amp; control,' said OSL Director Col. Eric J. Zarybnisky. In it's initial solicitation back in March, NRO explained that it was looking for companies that could provide a number of novel space launch services, including docking, moving between orbits, and AI to manage satellite constellations. Houston-based Cognitive Space specializes in AI for autonomous management of space systems and satellite constellations. Impulse Space, headquartered in Redondo Beach, Calif., provides in-space transportation services from low Earth orbit to other orbits. The company on Oct. 3 announced that it had won a $34.5 million Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase III contract from the Space Force's Space Safari in partnership with the Pentagon's Defense Innovation Unit office to support the next two experiments in the services next two Tactically Responsive Space program, called VICTUS SURGO and VICTUS SALO. Both missions will use the firm's Mira vehicle, and are aimed at demonstrating 'how prepositioned capabilities can improve responsiveness to on-orbit situations, enabling the dynamic operations aspect of space domain awareness,' the company said. Based in Tukwila, Wash., Starfish Space also has previously won a Space Force contract. On May 20, the service announced it had awarded the company a $37 million Strategic Funding Increase (STRATFI) contract to build, launch, and operate one of its Otter vehicles for a 'first-of-its-kind docking mission' designed to provide two years of 'augmented maneuver for National Security Space assets.' Essentially, the Space Force target satellites would use the Otter as an attached engine.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/nro-taps-3-startups-for-innovative-launch-experiments/	2024-10-30T12:33:16-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/Starfish_Space_Otter_GEO_Earth-e1730316131187.png
South Korea eyes pathway for AUKUS Pillar II with new defense tech agreement	Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and South Korean Defense Minister Kim Yong Hyun stand for the playing of the US and South Korean national anthems prior to a US-Republic of Korea Security Consultative Meeting at the Pentagon on Oct. 30, 2024. (DoD photo/US Navy Petty Officer 1st Class Alexander Kubitza) WASHINGTON — The defense ministers for the US and South Korea today announced a new joint defense science and technology executive committee, one that expressly will consider options for Seoul's participation in AUKUS Pillar II. 'Based on the defense vision of the alliance, we plan to establish a vice-minister level defense science and technology executive committee within this year to explore the application of cutting-edge science and technology in the defense sector, as well as cooperation on AUKUS Pillar II,' Kim Yong Hyun, the minister from South Korea, said during comments at the Pentagon. Kim’s announcement came on the heels of the US-Republic of Korea security consultative meeting today that included US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. Tomorrow, the duo will join Secretary of State Antony Blinken and ROK Minister of Foreign Affairs Cho Tae-yul for a 2+2 meeting. While North Korea’s deployment of upwards of 10,000 troops to Russia is a hot-button topic for the two nations this week, the Pentagon announced beforehand that the S&amp;T expansion will remain a focal area, particularly in the areas of autonomous systems, artificial intelligence, and quantum technologies. That fits in nicely with the six technology areas identified as priorities for Pillar II: undersea, quantum, artificial intelligence and autonomy, cyber, hypersonic work, and electronic warfare. While US officials said in September that they are open to other areas of opportunities, the goal is to keep the focus on those areas as much as possible. Ever since the creation of AUKUS, there has been a question of whether other nations would be allowed to join the tripartite agreement. Officials have made a delineation: Pillar I, which is focused on nuclear submarine technology and tighter military alliances between the US, UK and Australia, is closed. But Pillar II would offer opportunities for other countries to get involved. That has led to some confusion about whether outside countries can 'join' Pillar II. Inside the Pentagon, at least, the issue is viewed less as one of other nations 'joining' and more about allowing outside parties to work on technological efforts the three core AUKUS nations are developing. Speaking to Breaking Defense in August, Richard Marles, Australia’s defense minister, said that while he expects Pillar II to 'grow,' the focus has to be on making sure 'we get Pillar II into a place where there is something to, kind of, offer. 'I think what’s really important is that we get this better down amongst the three of us first, so that we really know what the architecture of our collaboration looks like, and what the specific projects are,' he said. The first country to be formally tied to Pillar II was Japan, in an April announcement that the AUKUS nations are 'considering cooperation with Japan on AUKUS Pillar II advanced capability projects.' (As an example of the confusion about how Pillar II works, that statement was followed almost immediately by a statement by Australia’s prime minister that 'What is not proposed is to expand the membership of AUKUS.') Officials in New Zealand have had preliminary talks with Australian counterparts about participation in Pillar II, New Zealand’s defense minister told Breaking Defense earlier this year. And there have been calls for Canada to take part as well. (Given New Zealand and Canada are the two non-AUKUS members of the 5 Eyes intelligence sharing network, they both have close connections to the AUKUS partners.)	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/south-korea-eyes-pathway-for-aukus-pillar-ii-with-new-defense-tech-agreement/	2024-10-30T12:21:59-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/kim-austin-scaled-e1730315341861.jpg
Lockheed completes acquisition of smallsat maker Terran Orbital	SDA Tranche 0 Transport Layer (Image: Terran Orbital Corporation) WASHINGTON — Lockheed Martin has completed its acquisition of small satellite maker Terran Orbital, the company announced today. The smallsat producer — now known as Terran Orbital, a Lockheed Martin Company — will report to Lockheed’s space unit and serve as a merchant supplier to other major space primes, Lockheed said. The $450 million deal, which was announced in August, resolves Terran Orbital’s mounting debt problems by uniting it with its biggest customer, which has previously bought the startup’s products for the Space Development Agency’s (SDA) transport and tracking layer of small satellites. The acquisition also gives Lockheed the opportunity to expand from its legacy position making large satellites for the defense sector into the small satellite business, where it may be able to pick up commercial sales. 'The addition of Terran Orbital's spirit of entrepreneurship to the scale of Lockheed Martin means there is a great deal of opportunity to keep pushing the boundaries of technology and space solutions together,' Robert Lightfoot, president of Lockheed Martin Space, said in a statement. 'We welcome their ingenuity and dedication to ensuring mission success and we've always valued those aspects of our working relationship.' Lockheed has had a longstanding relationship with Terran Orbital, having invested in the company multiple times since 2017 through its venture capital arm. Terran Orbital is the first company that Lockheed has acquired from its ventures portfolio. In August, Terran’s Tyvak Nano-Satellite Systems subsidiary announced a $254 million contract to build 10 satellites for SDA's Tranche 2 Transport Layer (T2TL) Gamma contract. The company also brings its expertise in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) for remote sensing, with its PredaSAR subsidiary. In 2023, Terran Orbital received $500 million from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency for the organization’s Digital Radar Image Formation Technology (DRIFT) program. Under that effort, the company is expected to demonstrate at least two SAR satellites, which will fly in formation to better see a target area and allow fusion of imagery via advanced processing.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/lockheed-completes-acquisition-of-smallsat-maker-terran-orbital/	2024-10-30T11:52:08-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/09/SDA-Tranche-0-Tansport-Layer-Image-Terran-Orbital-Corporation-e1710347311201.jpeg
UK pledges additional $3.8 billion on defense spending, stops short of 2.5 percent GDP timeline	F-35B fighter jets from the UK Carrier Strike Group launch from the HMS Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier to undertake sorties under NATO command in the Atlantic (UK MoD) BELFAST — The United Kingom announced today it intends to increase its defense spending by £2.9 billion ($3.8 billion) next year, according to a newly released budget. Rachel Reeves, the UK Chancellor, shared the uplift with lawmakers in a parliamentary speech, though she said that a Labour Party election manifesto commitment of reaching 2.5 percent GDP on defense spending will be met at a 'future fiscal event.' 'I am announcing a total increase to the Ministry of Defence’s budget of £2.9 billion next year, ensuring that the UK comfortably exceeds our NATO commitments and providing guaranteed military support to Ukraine of £3 billion per year for as long as it takes,' added Reeves. Across the 2023 to 2024 fiscal year, London spent £54 billion on defense, according to government figures, tracking at around 2.33 percent GDP and to date has pledged £12.8 billion to Kyiv for military, economic and humanitarian aid. Earlier this month, the UK also announced a new £2.3 billion loan for Ukraine, funded by frozen Russian assets. A supporting Autumn Budget 2024 document [PDF] says that the new funding, approved by Reeves, will allow UK armed forces to 'modernise' and sustain Britain's 'leading role in NATO, including through the nuclear deterrent, combat and surveillance aircraft, surface and submarine fleets, forward land forces, Special Forces and cyber and space capabilities.' Experts have long questioned the ability of the UK to meet its NATO commitments, especially with respect to the British Army delivering a Strategic Reserve Corps, made up of two divisions and additional corps echelon troops. 'The current British Army actually fields half of one heavy brigade’s worth of equipment, split between two, and one regiment of artillery,' Jack Watling, senior research fellow for land warfare at RUSI, wrote in a July analysis. The decline in size and capability of the force in its current state falls far short of a 2015 effort to deliver a 'warfighting division of two heavy and between one and two medium combat brigades, an artillery brigade, an engineering brigade, an air defence group, a logistic brigade and an ISR brigade,' he noted. Patrick Sanders, former head of the British Army, also admitted that UK aid to Ukraine in the form of warfighting platforms, amounting to 14 Challenger 2 main battle attacks and 30 AS90 155mm self-propelled guns, would 'leave us temporarily weaker as an army.' As for increasing spending further, before losing office, the Conservative government had committed to hitting the 2.5 percent GDP target by the end of the decade, which would have resulted in a 2030 annual defense budget of £87 billion, but Labour has still to put forward an exact timeframe for making good on the same GDP pledge. The new government has launched the Strategic Defence Review (SDR), set to report in mid-2025, 'in recognition of the urgency of the threats' it faces and designed to assess national defense priorities and policy. Chief among the threats sits Russia, conflicts and increasing instability in the Middle East and an assertive China in the Indo-Pacific. Though equipment planning remains in limbo until the SDR is published, financial challenges persist, largely owing to a £43 billion, 10-year spending plan deficit, according to figures [PDF] from the National Audit Office, a government watchdog.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/uk-pledges-additional-3-8-billion-on-defense-spending-stops-short-of-2-5-percent-gdp-timeline/	2024-10-30T10:44:50-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/FLEET-20231105-XN0184-136.jpg.iCexsZ_kMWATAA.lYYOVfIex0-e1719261083813.jpg
First German Leopard 2 tank gets Israeli Trophy Active Protection System	On Oct. 29, 2024 the Israeli and German governments presented the first Leopard 2 tank outfitted with the Trophy Active Protection System. (Israeli Ministry of Defense) JERUSALEM — The Israeli and German ministries of defense held a ceremony in Germany today to inaugurate the first Leopard 2 tank to be upgraded with the Trophy Active Protection System. The system was developed by Israel's Rafael and has been active on Israeli tanks for more than a decade. The installation is the culmination of a government-to-government agreement signed in 2020. Israel’s Ministry of Defense noted that its Directorate of Defense Research and Development had spearheaded this initiative to 'equip Germany’s Leopard 2 tank fleet with Israel’s premier active protection system.' Carsten Stawitzki, national armaments director in the German Ministry of Defense, was present at the ceremony along with the head of the Israeli Ministry’s Survivability Systems Branch, who was unidentified and whose face blurred in photos due to security reasons. Germany conducted live fire tests with Trophy in 2021. The tests took place with Rafael and Germany’s KMW, which developed and manufactures the Leopard. At the time Israel’s Ministry of Defense underlined how the system was combat proven and integrated on the IDF’s Merkava tanks. 'The advancement achieved by our industries in cooperation with our German friends and partners will further strengthen the capabilities of both our defense establishments. We will continue to work at the forefront of tech capabilities, prepare for every operational scenario, and deepen our relations with partners around the world,' Israel’s then-Defense Minister Benny Gantz said then. Rafael has also established a joint venture in Germany called EuroTrophy, modelled on its success supplying European countries with the Spike family of missiles as part of the EuroSpike enterprise. The Spike family includes a number of precision guided and anti-tank missiles made by Rafael. The EuroTrophy venture includes General Dynamics European Land Systems, Krauss-Maffei Wegmann and Rafael. The Trophy system has also been integrated on the IDF’s Namer armored personnel carriers, as well as on US Abrams tanks and has been integrated on Challenger 3 tanks. Trophy will also be used on Leopard 2 tanks in Norway. Rafael also announced updates to Trophy at AUSA in early October, in part inspired by Israel's experience fighting in Gaza and Lebanon. The system can now defend against top attack threats. The Leopard 2 deal is part of a number of high profile deals for Israeli defense industries in Europe. In 2023 Finland signed a deal to acquire David’s Sling, the medium-range air defense system made by Rafael. Israel also finalized a deal to sell Israel Aerospace Industries Arrow 3 to Germany in 2023. 'This [Leopard/Trophy] milestone adds to a series of recent high-value defense agreements, including Germany’s purchase of Israel’s Arrow missile defense system, reflecting a shared commitment to advancing defense capabilities,' Israel’s Ministry of Defense noted.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/first-german-leopard-2-tank-gets-israeli-trophy-active-protection-system/	2024-10-30T10:22:07-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/241029_trophy_leopard_israeli_MOD-e1730234696944.png
GPS resiliency is falling short, but there is a solution	The GPS constellation that provides positioning, navigation and timing signals to the US military and civilians around the world, is made up of 31 active satellites. (BlackJack3D/Getty Images) The third generation of GPS satellites continues to deploy, and US Space Force has selected companies to introduce new Low Earth Orbit augmentation (LEAP) under the Resilient GPS program – yet these upgrades, while necessary, are not sufficient to adequately address growing risk from attacks to GPS. Ground-Based Position, Navigation and Timing (PNT) must be a part of efforts to upgrade and back up GPS if we are to meet rapidly evolving threats. Among the obstacles keeping us from addressing growing adversary counter-space capabilities is the failure to imagine what a day without space might look like. The seams between space, air, ground, electronic warfare and cyber are preventing full appreciation of cross-boundary threats to PNT. We should be organizing more holistically around a diverse set of PNT solutions, including adding a ground-based element to provide PNT signals receivable by our smartphones and other critical receivers. For decades, the civil-military success of the GPS program has supported unprecedented automation stemming from the widespread availability of accurate PNT. The nation’s critical infrastructure: telecommunications networks, the energy grid, and the financial sector all rely on GPS signals to operate. Legacy routines that used to operate independently from space-based signals have long since been retired. Recently, jamming, spoofing, cyber, and physical attacks have brought into question whether we have become overly dependent on space-based PNT signals. An attack (kinetic or electronic warfare) or mishap in the crowded low earth orbit could have cascading impacts and degrade or even eliminate the weak signals from Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites in medium earth orbits. Without access to space, the day to day technologies we take for granted — navigation, logistics, travel, alarms, AI sensors, robotic actuators, ATM machines, agriculture — stop working. 911 calls spike in volume, quickly overwhelming systems designed around automated location, and over time, telecommunications networks fail as they lose synchronization. The public, having built much of their lives around ever-available communications and location information, would further place a surge of demands on critical infrastructure that has lost control of essential functions. In short, if GPS goes down, critical infrastructure fails and our nation plunges into chaos. This scenario is not science fiction. Heightened tensions around the world include adversaries that have demonstrated attacks on space systems. These threat actors know that Space provides an asymmetric advantage to the United States and our allies. In their perverse calculus, an attack on space assets, intended to reset a losing hand, would be an escalation preferred over a nuclear exchange. What was a high bar for an attack on space systems is being lowered daily as Ukraine and the Middle East showcase adversary exploitation of GPS and other space-based PNT signals. RELATED: GPS shows some Lebanese citizens in Jordan, likely result of combat-related ‘spoofing’: Experts We need to add resiliency to our current space-based PNT, creating services to complement and back up GPS. Admiral Thad Allen, USCG (ret.), the current Chair of the Space-based PNT Advisory Board, said that 'America’s continued over-reliance on GPS for PNT makes critical infrastructure and applications vulnerable to a variety of well documented accidental, natural, and malicious threats.' The Board reported this summer that China and other nations are already ahead of the United States in building out resiliency to GPS and PNT. They concluded that the United States has 'fallen behind,' presenting a 'troubling shortfall in GPS’s greater vulnerability to jamming and spoofing.' China continues to build more capable and resilient PNT systems with an integrated architecture. The Chinese approach to PNT enhances their efforts to gain global technology market share for critical infrastructure industries. We need a whole-of-government approach, working together with the private sector to counter Chinese PNT gains. PNT services underpin the smooth functioning of our economy, and we need a ground-based component to compete. The United States should heed the board’s warning. A ground complement to GPS would address both today’s PNT availability issues and provide needed backup. This would be a deterrent to any adversary considering an attack on GPS. When space-based GPS is threatened, a ground-based system, receivable by smartphones and other widely available devices, would greatly reduce adversary motivation for counter-space escalation. There is widespread agreement on the need for ground based PNT as space-based alternatives share common GPS vulnerabilities but there is also much debate on the approach. Some PNT professionals advocate bringing back an enhanced Long Range Navigation (eLORAN) capability that would upgrade ground-based transmitters using Low Frequency signals from the decommissioned LORAN system, creating excellent propagation characteristics but needing either larger receiver antennas or new antenna technology breakthroughs to be receivable by smartphones. Others point to FM Radio and TV broadcast signals that can support distribution of accurate timing reference after disasters with new protocols. Ultimately, however, we will need to provide signals that are receivable in the devices we rely upon every day. Shifting our National policy from Resilient GPS to Resilient PNT, would ensure that we build an architecture and systems that degrade gracefully under the full spectrum of conflict using multiple ground-based approaches. The FCC is currently reviewing the record on a proposal that would enable a ground-based complement and backup to GPS. The act of establishing a ground-based PNT service category, as the proposed FCC order would do, would let the market introduce and sustain competitive solutions without the tail of a new federal program. The proposal is a strong step towards addressing our national security PNT risk. In the meantime, DoD and other agencies with GPS oversight, should replace governance of GPS with resilient PNT, motivating a mix of diverse PNT solutions capable of supporting society’s needs anticipating a day without space. Now is the time to act. Establish a complement and backup so that if GPS is denied, we have ground based PNT signals at the ready. Rear Admiral USN (ret.)

Lockheed Martin successfully demos Navy combat system on hardware destined for ICS	Aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman (CVN 75) transits the Atlantic Ocean. (U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class K. H. Anderson/Released) WASHINGTON — Lockheed Martin, in conjunction with roughly a dozen industry partners and the US Navy, successfully demonstrated it could run a virtualized version of a key combat system on hardware anticipated for use in the service’s forthcoming Integrated Combat System, according to a company executive. The demo, which took place in late September at the Navy’s Maryland-based software factory known as The Forge, focused on running the Ship Self-Defense System (SSDS), the multi-functional combat system used by aircraft carriers and certain Navy amphibious ships that lack the Aegis Combat System, Shireen Melvin, integrated combat management systems director at Lockheed Martin, told Breaking Defense. RELATED: App Store For Warships: Inside The Navy’s Project To Revamp How The Fleet Gets Software It was a necessary show of agility since the stated purpose of the Navy’s Integrated Combat System is to outfit its ships with hardware and software capable of running independently from one another. Among other benefits, the service hopes this will lead to the sorts of rapid, over-the-air software updates for its warships similar to those routinely done by America's technology behemoths. Operating a key piece of software for aircraft carriers and amphibs, the SSDS, on the latest developmental hardware being designed for ICS is another major step towards that goal of software and hardware independence. 'The team was able to do that successfully and virtualize a recent software build of SSDS, and then have it run on the new hardware that’s been selected for the ICS,' Melvin said. 'We’re going to keep adding to these demonstrations that we’re doing &#8230; as we continue to develop the ICS and as we move along and showing the progression of it.' Breaking Defense exclusively reported this February an in-depth view of the other key Navy facility developing the ICS, which the service has dubbed 'The Foundry.' Whereas 'The Forge' is focused specifically on software development, the otherwise incognito Navy building in Dahlgren, Va., has been tasked with producing the hardware destined for the ICS. Notably, most of that hardware is coming directly from products already being mass produced by industry, Navy officials told Breaking Defense at the time. RELATED: Inside The Foundry, The Navy’s Program To Modernize Hardware Across The Surface Fleet 'The technology that we’re taking is really technology that’s coming from the industry side, that has been out there and we’re now applying it to warfighting,' said Capt. Brian Phillips, an officer overseeing the Foundry. 'The world has become much more dynamic,' he continued. 'It changes much more quickly. We’ve really had to put a lot of thought into how do we incentivize industry … and empower them to sort of unleash their power to give us the technology we need, rather than dictating everything to them?'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/lockheed-martin-successfully-demos-navy-combat-system-on-hardware-destined-for-ics/	2024-10-30T08:32:42-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/01/2065424-scaled-e1706551345299.jpg
‘New Indo-Pacific missile age’ drives Australia to domestic GMLRS, munition production deals	Part of the forging process at the Maryborough munitions plant, a joint venture between Germany's Rheinmetall and a privately owned Australian company, NIOA. (Colin Clark/Breaking Defense) 'Why do we need more missiles? Strategic competition between the United States and China is a primary feature of Australia's security environment,' Pat Conroy told the National Press Club here. The most immediate commitment to increasing missile capabilities here came when Conroy said Australia would spend $316 million AUD ($207 million USD) to create a local factory to build Lockheed's Martin's Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (GMLRS), starting in 2029. It will be able to produce 4,000 missiles a year, roughly one quarter of current global production, he added. 'Producing GMLRS missiles in Australia is the stepping stone towards local production of more advanced, longer-range strike weapons in the future — local production that is essential to our sovereignty and our security,' Conroy said. Breaking Defense contacted Lockheed Martin and the ministry for more details about the plant. Lockheed declined to comment. At press time, defense had not responded. Australia recently committed to jointly manufacture Naval and Joint Strike Missiles with Norway's Kongsberg Defense in the city of Newcastle on Australia's eastern coast, the only site outside of Norway. The JSM can be carried internally by the F-35, preserving its stealth profile. Reinforcing that made-in-Australia penchant, Conroy announced that BAE Systems Australia received a $160 million contract to triple production of the Passive Radio Frequency Sensor (PRS) used in the JSM. However, those sensors, at least in the short term, will primarily be put into missiles procured by the US Air Force, Japan and other countries, BAE Systems said in a statement. 'This is a significant achievement for our manufacturing teams at Edinburgh Parks and an innovation success story that has required more than a decade of commitment from our employees and our partner Kongsberg,' Andrew Gresham, managing director of defense delivery at BAE Systems Australia, said in a statement. 'The Passive Radio Frequency Sensor is highly innovative technology designed, developed, and built in Australia.' Speaking to Breaking Defense last week, Conroy pledged that a new contract for manufacturing 155mm shells would be announced 'shortly.' That turned out to be true, with Thales Australia winning a hotly contested contract to manufacture the shells, part of the Lucky Country's effort to better able to handle supply chain disruptions and build stockpiles of crucial weapons. That contract includes building a new forge to make the shells, notable because Australian-owned NIOA, which had been competing with Thales for the contract, already has a custom-built forge in operation to produce 155mm shells. However, those shells are under contract to be exported to Germany, whose company Rhenimetall has a majority interest in the shell-making joint venture. Australia currently imports its finished 155s from a South African subsidiary of Rhenmetall. The artillery shells are the most in-demand military product in the world and mark an important commitment by the Labor government to ensure the Lucky Country's supply chains are more organic and less subject to the vagaries of global manufacturing and shipping. As usual, the opposition's defense expert, Andrew Hastie, cast scorn on today's announcements, saying the government had provided very few details about either GMLRS or 155s. 'Part-time Defence Industry Minister, Pat Conroy, used his National Press Club speech to announce Labor’s preferred tenderer to build a new forging capability for 155mm artillery ammunition – excluding any details around the costs associated. We are left scratching our heads once again,' Hastie said in a statement. 'Meanwhile, Labor’s announcement to establish a new $316 million Australian Weapons Manufacturing Complex comes with no plan or details for implementation. We must now wait for the Albanese Government to identify a site sometime next year for the facility which won’t be operational until 2029. But the clock is ticking and we have no time to waste.' Outside of the munitions announcement, Conroy was asked about a Chinese ICBM test from September, which flew more than 11,000km and landed in the Pacific Ocean off of Australia's north-east. It was the first such test by China in more than 40 years. Australia 'expressed significant concern about that ballistic missile test, especially its entry into the South Pacific given the Treaty of Rarotonga that says the Pacific should be a nuclear weapons free zone,' Conroy told reporters during Q and A.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/new-indo-pacific-missile-age-drives-australia-to-domestic-gmlrs-munition-production-deals/	2024-10-30T07:15:23-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/IMG_3175-scaled-e1727963129906.jpeg
Secretary Wormuth’s advice to next administration: ‘Stay on the path’ on Army programs	Secretary of the Army, Hon. Christine Wormuth, visits Japan, August 1, 2024. Secretary Wormuth had bilateral meetings with Japanese defense leaders and visited soldiers at the 5th Composite Watercraft Company at Yokohama North Dock. (U.S. Army photo by Sgt. David Resnick) Wormuth, whose name has been floated in news reports as the potential next Secretary of Defense should Democratic candidate Kamala Harris win in November, said she wouldn't speculate on what the future has in store for her. 'I am going to run through the tape as Secretary of the Army, wherever that tape ends,' she said. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. BREAKING DEFENSE: Looking at the broader picture, what are your key takeaways after nearly four years on the job? Concerns? The road ahead? WORMUTH: There's a benefit to having the duration of leadership for multiple years, because it provides consistent direction for where we're trying to take the Army. We have had clear objectives, and we've been able to follow them through. We've really moved the needle on a lot of our acquisition programs … [with] a lot of that progress because we're using new authorities. We have consistent resourcing, as much as we can, given [continuing resolutions] and things like that. But we haven't changed direction. We haven't zigged and zagged. So, I think, there's a lot of benefit to that consistency over time. Looking ahead, the Army still has a lot of work to do. … We need to have a mindset that reflects a greater sense of urgency and a somewhat higher willingness to take prudent risks, because the security environment is really challenging and technology is changing rapidly. As you have worked through the upcoming five-year budget, will you talk about some of the priorities you're looking at? Frankly, we are going to need to remain consistent across a lot of our big portfolios — long-range fires, future vertical lift, ground combat vehicle — [and] all the things we've been working on. It would be my hope and advice to the next administration, whatever party that may be, that they kind of stay on the path that the Army is on because I think we're on the right path. I've talked publicly about the fact that the next budget that [Chief of Staff Gen. Randy] George and I have been working to build a greater investment still in UAS [unmanned aerial systems], counter-UAS and electronic warfare (EW). The Army has been the service that's most invested in counter UAS to date, but we're going to increase that some more. But frankly, I think, a lot of what we need to do is just keep on, keeping on and see things through. Get the [Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft] to first flight, have a successful hypersonic weapon test, things like that. Part of that push has been this flexible spending pots of money for groups of systems. What are you hearing from Congress? And do you think that this will actually, you'll be able to get this over the line? I’m cautiously optimistic. &#8230; I was a little skeptical, just because of my experience with appropriators and with the appropriation staffers, they don't like what they see as slush funds. We're really trying to work with them to talk about what approach would work for them. I think the fact that we're targeting it narrowly to UAS, counter-UAS and EW, rather than kind of trying to have it encompass all of our different kinds of programs may be helpful. We're in an active conversation with on the appropriation side, in particular about what kind of mechanisms do they need to feel comfortable? What kind of transparency mechanisms would they need to feel comfortable enough to give us the ability to bin things into larger pots. …The proof will be in the pudding and we'll see what comes out in the ‘25 appropriations bill when it passes but I'm a little more optimistic than I was nine months ago. You have mentioned concerns about the negative impact a flat budget will have on Army programs and the hard choices the service might need to make. When will the service need to start making those tough decisions? We have to see what's going to happen in a couple areas. The quality-of-life panel [from] the House Armed Services Committee was proposing a 15 percent pay increase. If that passed in that form, that will be a very, very big bill that will absolutely crowd out other things that are important for our soldiers, to their readiness, to be combat effective, to give them the equipment they need. So, that's a variable…. But certainly, a 15 percent pay increase for junior enlisted soldiers is a big bill that would put further pressure on our modernization programs. What should I be asking you about or topics the media isn’t covering? The United States Army needs to look hard in the next couple of years at kind of what I call the Army lifestyle, the burden of our frequent PCS [permanent change of station] moves. A lot of our younger officers are choosing to get out of the Army because they feel like they don't have enough stability and predictability. Their spouses want to work and have a lot of challenges doing that when they're having to move every two years. And so, I think, that's something we really need to take a very hard look at &#8230; are we going to be able to attract the best people? Are we going to be able to retain the best people? 'Embrace the suck' is sort of part of the Army philosophy, but there are limits to that, there are limits to individuals' selfless service. We've had a model that's static for a very, very long time. It's not going to be easy to change that, but it's really important.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/secretary-wormuths-advice-to-next-administration-stay-on-the-path-on-army-programs/	2024-10-30T06:20:14-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/241029_wormuth_helicopter_8683810-scaled-e1730223933875.jpg
E-2D Hawkeye: Flexible airborne command and control for sea, land and joint operations	The E-2D supports a wide variety of missions: defensive and offensive counter-air, integrated air and missile defense, electronic warfare, air traffic control, combat search and rescue, humanitarian relief, border security, and counter-drug operations. (Northrop Grumman photo). Initially designed for airborne early warning (AEW) and defense of carrier battle groups, the E-2D Advanced Hawkeye has evolved into a versatile platform that provides airborne command and control (C2) for multiple nations. The U.S. Navy has invested more than $1 billion in a technology roadmap to modernize and sustain this aircraft, positioning it as a critical node for joint command and control. Breaking Defense discussed the platform’s capabilities with Janice Zilch, Northrop Grumman vice president and Integrated Product Team (IPT) lead for Multi-Domain Command and Control (MDC2). Breaking Defense: How has the E-2D evolved to include airborne command and control alongside its traditional AEW role? Janice Zilch: The E-2D Advanced Hawkeye represents the latest in a legacy of AEW aircraft that stretch back over 60 years. While its original focus was defending carrier battle groups and monitoring long-range threats over water, it has now evolved into a cutting-edge platform capable of identifying and neutralizing a diverse range of threats in various environments. It’s similar to the evolution of mobile phones. When those were originally designed, it was to make a voice call. Think about how much has expanded in terms of functionality available. The same applies to the E-2D. Our advancements in bandwidth, processing power, and organic sensors – a radar, ESM (electronic support measures), IFF (identification, friend or foe), AIS (automatic identification system) – as well as our comms suites, allow the E-2D to offer unmatched detection and connectivity. This ensures seamless data sharing across U.S. and allied forces, enhancing joint operations across air, land and sea domains. Today, the E-2D supports a wide variety of missions: defensive and offensive counter-air, integrated air and missile defense, electronic warfare, air traffic control, combat search and rescue, humanitarian relief, border security, and counter-drug operations. This platform has become an indispensable element of JADC2, and the Navy’s continuous investment in its modernization ensures it remains a critical operational asset. For nations needing to protect their borders, the E-2D’s capabilities and performance are attained through its ability to detect smaller targets early and often before other AEW platforms, coupled with mission processing power that give it unsurpassed surveillance volume. (Northrop Grumman photo). For nations needing to protect their borders, the E-2D’s capabilities and performance are attained through its ability to detect smaller targets early and often before other AEW platforms, coupled with mission processing power that give it unsurpassed surveillance volume. The robust communications suite helps create an integrated common operating picture across allied forces and provides real-time data contributing to greater situational awareness. One of the E-2D's key advantages is its operational flexibility. Thanks to its carrier design, it requires shorter runways and has a smaller infrastructure footprint when compared to larger AEW aircraft, making it ideal for rapid deployment. Additionally, the platform offers day one readiness with interoperability capabilities that provide enhanced performance to numerous allied assets including ground-based air and missile defense systems, such as the U.S. Army’s and Poland’s Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command System (IBCS). The combination of these two assets alone provides an increase in decision space and clearer situational awareness to optimize threat deterrence. E-2D also enhances and integrates seamlessly with fighters such as F-16s, F-35s, and unmanned systems such as NATO AGS, in addition to other allied systems. Moreover, Northrop Grumman’s 40 years of experience in supporting international partners operating E-2 platforms ensures we are well-equipped to train, sustain and modernize these systems globally. Our work with France, for instance, highlights the potential for operational synergies across Europe. As France transitions from E-2C to E-2D, we expect to see efficiencies in training, material procurement, and sustainment that could reduce maintenance lead times for European operators. Describe the E-2D's multi-functional role in providing AEW and C2? There is a wide spectrum of operations and use cases for a platform as versatile as the E-2D and its crew members. The E-2D can support civilian missions, such as emergency and disaster relief. We can clear the path for time-sensitive emergency operations, direct military aircraft for humanitarian aid, and we can sequence aircraft for safe takeoff and landing in the absence of air traffic control. In addition, as an airborne air traffic controller, E-2D increases national border security and helps mitigate occurrences of escalating incidents. For example, in the on-going NATO air policing efforts in the Baltic region, E-2D could play a critical role in enhancing the allied posture and effectiveness of these efforts. We can also provide data reports on drug interdiction, surveillance and pattern of life tracking, as well as search and rescue, in addition to enhancing air policing by providing maritime security through the collection of intelligence on ships that aren't emitting AIS. The bottom line is that E-2D offers mission versatility and operational mobility while it plays a pivotal role as a central node across mission areas. That’s enabled by its ability to communicate with numerous assets, providing real-time data for onboard and offboard commanders leveraging its massive surveillance volume on continuous refresh cycles. What does continuous modernization look like for the E-2D, particularly regarding radar and weapon system upgrades? We’ve entered a new era of upgrades with the Delta System Software Configuration (DSSC) 6, or Block II. Awarded last year, Block II represents the most significant upgrade since the E-2D's inception in 2003. This upgrade involves a complete technology refresh for the cockpit, mission computer, and operations station. Most importantly, the new open mission systems architecture will enable rapid integration of new capabilities, including non-proprietary applications from industry partners. Beginning in 2027 and continuing into the 2030s, the entire U.S. Navy fleet will be retrofitted with this cutting-edge technology at the forefront of airborne command and control. How does artificial intelligence and machine learning fit into the future of E-2D operations? With E-2D Block II, we're setting the stage for incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) tactical decision-making aids. These technologies will enhance the speed and accuracy of our decision-making processes, ensuring that critical information is disseminated faster. Thanks to the E-2D's open mission systems architecture, we’ll be able to rapidly import and integrate AI/ML capabilities as they develop, ensuring we stay ahead of the curve in partnership with the U.S. Navy and allied nations over the next two decades, and beyond. Final thoughts? The E-2D Advanced Hawkeye is the world's premier airborne command and control surveillance platform operating in theater today. For European nations, especially those protecting land-locked borders, the E-2D offers critical capabilities for homeland protection. We will continue modernizing this platform to ensure it outpaces evolving threats, making it a combat-proven and trusted solution for decades to come.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/e-2d-hawkeye-flexible-airborne-command-and-control-for-sea-land-and-joint-operations/	2024-10-30T05:25:14-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/E-2D_AR_11.png
Swedish defense minister: ELSA long-range strike development lesson from Ukraine	Swedish Defence Minister Pål Jonson speaks to the media ahead of a joint training exercise with the Norwegian, Finnish and Swedish armies, on the Finland/Norway border during the Nordic Response military exercise on March 09, 2024 in Kivilompolo, Finland. (Photo by Leon Neal/Getty Images) STOCKHOLM — Sweden is 'eager to participate' in the new European Long Range Strike Approach (ELSA) program, with Defense Minister Pål Jonson telling Breaking Defense he sees an industrial role for companies like Saab and MBDA in the new effort. 'The companies have to speak for themselves. But of course, Saab has capabilities. So that could certainly be an option. Of course, I'd see strong participation from MBDA also.' Jonson said on a call from Qatar, where he was visiting this week. The ELSA project was initiated in July 2024 by France, Germany, Italy, and Poland, with the goal of developing a ground-launched cruise missile with a range of 1,000 to 2,000 kilometers. This range for ground launched missiles was previously banned by the US and Russia by the Cold War INF Treaty, which imploded in 2019, when both countries left the agreement. A few months later, the UK announced it would also have a role in the project, and at the Oct. 18 NATO defense ministers meeting, Jonson signed a letter of intent for Sweden to join the ELSA coalition. Sweden is not currently prioritizing ground-based strike options, but Jonson said that the ELSA effort could have applicability in the aerial and naval domains, which are more a focus for Stockholm. 'The missile will probably be compatible with all the alliance's aircraft, all the surface vessels that have cruise missile launch capability, and simple launch trucks on land,' said William Alberque, former director of arms control at NATO and former director of strategy and technology at IISS. Saab is developing the next generation of corvettes (the Luleå class), fighter jets (Jas Gripen E), and the next generation of submarines (A26). Jonson said that the new subs will not have a long-range strike capability, but that Stockholm wants it for their other modernizing assets. 'We are developing long-range strike capabilities, predominantly for the air force,' Jonson said of Sweden’s focus. 'We are also adopting more long-range strike capabilities for our navy, predominantly for our corvettes.' Strategically, the ELSA effort is 'is very clearly coming out of the lessons learned from Russia's war on Ukraine, and the realization that there are huge gaps in the long-range strike capability of the NATO alliance,' Alberque said. Jonson did not shy away from that idea, telling Breaking Defense that 'The lesson learned from the war in Ukraine is that long-range strike capabilities are becoming increasingly important on the battlefield, and of course, also with stronger air defense capabilities.' Sweden plans to spend 2,4 percent of its GDP next year and 2.6 percent in 2028, which is above NATO’s minimum defense spending target. Jonson said it's too early to give a timeline when ELSA can be operative. 'We joined this project a few weeks ago. Now our ambition is deepened interaction between our government agencies, but also the industry as well, as it depends on our partners and the other countries.' Could it be ready within five years? 'I don't exclude that possibility,' he said. Jonson was in the Middle East to meet with counterpart Khalid bin Mohamed Al Attiyah. Qatar is a NATO partner, and the visit serves as a follow-up to the September visit to Stockholm by Amir Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani. Jonson told Breaking Defense that the two men had top-level discussions about enhanced situational awareness in air and at sea. 'They're interested in enhanced situational awareness, both in the aerial domain and on the seas,' the Swedish official said, noting that Saab produces an 'agile platform in GlobalEye' that would meet the requirement. However, Jonson said 'it was a more general discussion. discussions about Qatar needs in this regard.' In September Saab delivered a Global Eye to the United Arab Emirates. The recent delivery is the fifth in the series of five Global Eye Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&amp;C) aircraft delivered to the UAE since 2020.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/swedish-defense-minister-elsa-long-range-strike-development-lesson-from-ukraine/	2024-10-30T03:15:34-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/GettyImages-2070957235-scaled-e1715612311169.jpg
Hundreds of drone incursions reported at military installations over past few years: NORTHCOM	Soldiers from 5th Armored Brigade, First Army Division West, developed a course of instruction to counter the threat of commercial, off-the-shelf unmanned aerial surveillance vehicles at McGregor Range Complex, N.M., June 28, 2019. (Staff Sgt. Timothy Gray / 5th Armored Brigade) PETERSON SPACE FORCE BASE — The US military has collectively reported hundreds of drone flights over Pentagon installations on American soil in the past few years, and that's just the ones US Northern Command (NORTHCOM) knows about. 'I have no doubt that there's significantly more incursions that we don't see, either with a system or with our eyeballs,' Gen. Gregory Guillot, the commander of NORTHCOM and North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), said during a roundtable today with a small group of reporters at Peterson Space Force Base, the dual headquarters for both commands. Unmanned aircraft system (UAS) sightings over US military bases have raised alarm at the Defense Department, as incursions at sensitive installations like Langley Air Force Base — where the Air Force keeps F-22s — have mystified officials, as the Wall Street Journal previously reported. According to data shared by NORAD, drone sightings in 2022 numbered 250, but that figure has dipped somewhat in recent years, numbering 202 in 2023, and 163 so far this year. Guillot said the events are likely gaining more attention due to the spread of systems that are able to detect and track UAS with greater 'fidelity.' The UAS sightings at places that contain highly classified programs have also raised questions about the drones’ provenance, including whether they reflect operations of an adversary nation, though Guillot said today that he has not yet seen evidence of any 'organized or unorganized foreign nexus.' Instead, he said 'the overwhelming majority of them are probably local hobbyists that are just flying too close to the base.' RELATED: The Army's &#8216;most challenging' unmanned threat? Group 3 drones And while he said there are certainly more events that have gone undetected, Guillot cautioned that many observed phenomena could be duplicate sightings, such as multiple servicemembers calling in the same event. Others could be a case of mistaken identity, like if a servicemember mistakenly identifies blinking lights on a civilian airliner miles away as a closer UAS. Several reports could even concern the same drone flying back and forth over a base repeatedly, he said. Tackling the UAS problem on US soil has flummoxed officials, in part, because of regulations that protect civilian air travel — preventing commanders from taking steps like simply shooting down potential threats or taking other steps to disable them. 'The threat, and the need to counter these threats is growing faster than the policies and procedures that [are] in place can keep up with,' Guillot said. One solution the general pointed to is disrupting position, navigation and timing capabilities for a UAS, otherwise known as GPS jamming or spoofing. But as the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East have shown, GPS interference can pose hazards for civilian travel if painted with too broad a brush. Tight coordination with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is needed, Guillot stressed, to ensure counter-UAS capabilities are responsibly used. With established ties to the FAA, Guillot said NORTHCOM can step up to play a greater role in defeating drone incursions. One example would be developing preset approvals to engage UAS under specific parameters, obviating the need for a potentially days-long process to get an FAA greenlight. NORTHCOM could also help distribute key systems needed to fend off drone flights by bringing in new capabilities and 'fast-tracking' approval to use them, 'hopefully' within hours. Ultimately, Guillot said NORTHCOM could be a 'clearing house' of counter-UAS capabilities that serves as the 'lead synchronizer' for numerous government agencies. Other UAS challenges stem from properly detecting and tracking certain systems. While Guillot said he was 'pretty confident' that the Pentagon can sufficiently track larger objects, smaller Group 1 and Group 2 systems can pose more of a challenge since they can blend in with the clutter of airspace. (The Pentagon classifies drones in five 'groups,' with the first group being the smallest and the fifth being the largest.) Besides the UAS conundrum, Guillot has plenty of other issues keeping him busy. Toward the end of the discussion, an aide beckoned him away, bringing an abrupt end to the roundtable. 'I’m sorry, I’m going to have to run for a second,' Guillot said before sprinting out of the room.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/hundreds-of-drone-incursions-reported-at-military-installations-over-past-few-years-northcom/	2024-10-29T14:53:29-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/241029_drone_quadcopter_5816882-scaled-e1730238738198.jpg
Show me the data: DISA leaders outline do’s and don’ts on industry AI pitches	Nathan Helmly, NSWCDD Computer Scientist, builds an algorithm with his team at the NSWCDD Innovation Lab’s wargaming hackathon on Aug. 11, 2021. (Caleb Gardner / Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division) BALTIMORE — The Pentagon’s IT arm, the Defense Information Systems Agency, has seen quite enough AI hype, thank you very much. So at the agency’s annual Forecast to Industry here on Monday, new DISA director Lt. Gen. Paul Stanton said he needs clarity from vendors on how their offerings’ AI features actually work and what data they were trained on. 'If vendors are incorporating artificial intelligence &#8230; they need to be able to explain the details of how and why they’re using it,' Stanton told reporters at a roundtable during the industry day. 'AI requires context. You don’t just sprinkle AI on a problem.' 'Don’t do it for the joy of doing AI &#8230; just to say that you have it,' added the agency’s chief technology officer, Steve Wallace. 'We’ve seen a lot of vendors who claim to have it, and when you peel back the onion, there’s not a whole lot of depth there.' In particular, DISA is not interested in ChatGPT clones. The Air Force has already developed a chatbot for Defense Department use, NIPRGPT, Wallace said, so there’s no need to duplicate that capability: 'We don’t need 60 GPTs running around the Department.' Instead, Stanton, Wallace, and other agency leaders emphasized, DISA needs AI built to serve specific Defense Department missions. They also need to understand — and have contractual rights to — the underlying data on which that AI is trained. 'Being very, very careful and thoughtful about how we acquire, leverage and analytically resolve the right data is important,' Stanton said. 'That’s at the heart of our business as an agency.' One way that focus on the underlying data manifests, said Douglas Packard, DISA’s director of contracting and procurement, is that the agency’s rights to data are absolutely going to come up in contract negotiations. 'Don’t create AI without thinking I’m going to need the data rights to it,' he said. In many negotiations, 'people spend weeks on data rights,' Packard went on. 'Our biggest negotiation item [is] always the data rights, because we [may] need to give it to someone else' to enable competition between contractors and avoid 'vendor lock.' DISA also wants to understand the data used by AI tools so it can assure itself that foundation is sound. Stanton and his team want AI trained on relevant, authoritative, and carefully curated data — not random Reddit posts or other dubious datasets built from indiscriminate trawls of the public internet. 'We don’t want our data derived from the entire corpus of the internet; there’s a lot of bad data,' Stanton said. AI trained on inaccurate data — or even on accurate data mixed in with irrelevant information which the algorithm doesn't know to ignore — can produce wildly erroneous answers. For example, Wallace said he asked a large language model how many directors DISA has had. 'The answer I got was something like 1,700.' Since the agency was founded in 1991, just 33 years ago, that AI result would imply DISA got a new director almost every week. RELATED: How new White House AI memo impacts, and restricts, the Pentagon LLMs can also make subtler errors that are harder to detect, Wallace went on, as DISA discovered in recent internal testing of an 'AI concierge' intended to help its staff sort through what policies and procedures they need to follow. 'We learned a lot,' Wallace said. For instance, when the agency issues a new policy that supersedes an older one, a human can simply look at the dates each document was issued to figure out which one is the latest guidance. But, it turned out, the LLM could not. As a result, the prototype AI concierge would give contradictory answers, sometimes applying the current policy and sometimes the obsolete one, with which it used often depending on exactly how a user phrased the question. To protect against such AI errors and hallucinations, Wallace said, one essential safeguard is well-trained workforce that knows better than accept the algorithm’s output without question. With today’s widespread naiveté about AI, he said, 'it’s not terribly different than when GPS came on the scene' and, out of blind trust, users would navigate to nowhere — or drive into a lake, he added, citing an episode of The Office. (Such navigation errors have happened in real life.) But industry also needs to build better, more reliable algorithms that don’t hallucinate as often in the first place, Wallace and the other officials said. Large Language Models, in particular, need to generate their answers based on verified official sources, rather than the internet at large (using a technique known as Retrieval Augmented Generation, aka RAG). LLMs also need to provide links to specific sources that users can double-check, the officials said, rather than just output plausible but unsourced paragraphs, the way publicly available chatbots do. 'There’s some ongoing research that is really intriguing' on such 'traceable' answers, Stanton said. Forcing the AI to footnote its work this way may require more processing power and data storage, he said. But properly curating datasets could also reduce costs, he said, by allowing AI to ignore vast amounts of junk data and just work with the data that actually matters. 'Help us understand what data is relevant &#8230; so we leverage the right data,' Stanton said. 'Or else we’re going to be stuck in data centers we can’t afford, cranking away on datasets that have no relevancy to the problem we’re trying to solve.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/show-me-the-data-disa-leaders-outline-dos-and-donts-on-industry-ai-pitches/	2024-10-29T13:24:16-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/11/231121_navy_hackathon_6821369-scaled-e1700595190716.jpg
Space Force chief wants catchy ‘themes’ for naming service kit, including black programs	Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman (right). (DoD photo by Chad J. McNeeley) WASHINGTON — In his latest missive to Guardians, Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman says he wants service members to help brainstorm catchy thematic names for a series of Space Force programs. But a follow-up memo by another senior service official includes some already pretty catchy names, for what appear to be previously unpublicized classified efforts — whose nomenclature may give a clue as to their purpose. Saltzman's 'C-NOTE #32', dated Oct. 25 and obtained by Breaking Defense, explains that the naming of equipment and weapon systems is one way a military service substantiates its internal culture. 'Afterall, words are simply thoughts given form, so the way we refer to something says much about the way we conceptualize it. Taken in the aggregate, our collective language provides insight into our shared values, our common desires, our group norms—in other words, our culture,' Saltzman writes in the note, which was sent to all Guardians in the service. 'How do we talk about our equipment in the Space Force? How do we name the systems we operate? Do those names accurately reflect the Guardian spirit—the space warfighting culture that we are working to build? I am not convinced that they do, but we are making strides to rectify that,' he adds. Providing examples from other services, such as the Air Force's F-16 'Fighting Falcon' fighter jet, Saltzman asks: 'For example, should we name the systems within our Missile Warning and Tracking activities after birds of prey? Or systems within SATCOM activities after canines? Should we leverage mythology? Natural phenomenon?' The memo provides a list of 10 areas of Space Force activity for which Guardians are asked to recommend themes that would guide system nicknames by Nov. 30 — ranging from satellite communications to missile warning/tracking to 'orbital warfare.' CSO NOTICE TO GUARDIANS (C-NOTE #32) Attachment 1. Subset of USSF Activities for Weapon System Naming Themes In a follow-up memo Monday, also obtained by Breaking Defense, Lt. Gen. Shawn Bratton, deputy chief of space operations, strategy, plans, programs and requirements provides instructions for the naming process, noting that winning themes will be announced in December. The memo also provides Guardians with background memoranda for guidance purposes, including the official Space Force naming convention process that was created last October, and an 'abridged list' of current 'weapon systems designations' with explanatory notations. The designations list, dated October 2024, for the most part is structured as might be expected. For example, the category 'Navigation Warfare (NAVWAR)' includes all the current versions of the Global Position System (GPS) satellites, which all carry the designation 'NM,' standing for 'NAVWAR' and 'medium Earth orbit.' Likewise, the ground-based Cobra Dane radar falls under the 'Surveillance' category and is designated as ST-108, with the 'ST' standing for 'Surveillance' and 'Terrestrial.' But the list also includes some surprises, including the names of a couple of 'Cyberspace Warfare' and 'Theater Electro-Magnetic Warfare' systems, called 'Red Dragon' and 'Red Cloud' respectively, that do not make an appearance in the fiscal 2025 Space Force budget documentation — suggesting classified programs. Perhaps most interesting is the 'Reconnaissance' mission area, listed separately from that of 'Surveillance.' In military parlance, reconnaissance usually refers to collecting data to answer a specific military question, or more short-term tactical info-gathering missions, whereas surveillance denotes long-term observation of a target area. While the surveillance mission area includes current and developing Space Force radars, the reconnaissance' mission area lists only four systems — all with intriguing code names that once again are nowhere referenced in the service FY25 budget documents. The first three seem likely to be related: Stargate, Snowgate, and Lightgate. The fourth is called Shiloh. And for some reason, all four carry the ST designation just like the radars ground under the Surveillance mission area, rather than using a primary R designator for reconnaissance. The Space Force did not respond by press time to a request for comment about the listed reconnaissance systems. But as Saltzman said, the military likes to group items by name where possible, so while information about these systems is nonexistent in the public sphere, some logical inferences can be made. One not unreasonable guess might be that the '-gate' named systems are fixed, ground-based lasers to track adversary satellites. For one thing, since all the known Space Force radars are under the Surveillance basket, it seemingly would be odd for classified radar to be put into a completely different basket. Thus it stands to reason that the systems under the Reconnaissance basket are not radars. A second hint is that a 'light gate' is a kind of sensor that uses an infrared transmitter and receiver to detects objects passing through the beam, for the purposes of monitoring time, speed, velocity, and acceleration. Air Force Research Laboratory's Starfire Optical Range at Kirtland AFB in New Mexico long has housed telescopes that can track satellites in low Earth orbit, and specialized in experiments that in the past have been linked [PDF] to the use of optical technologies for anti-satellite weapons. Saltzman visited Kirtland in June, where one of several meetings was with officials at the Directed Energy Directorates. Kirtland also is the home of the Space Rapid Capabilities Office, created by Congress in 2018 to take urgent, and largely classified, requirements directly from operators at US Space Command and find ways to quickly get capabilities into the field. Further, the previous head of the Space Force, Gen. Jay Raymond, told the Houses Armed Services Committee back in 2021 that the service was developing directed-energy weapons for space dominance, but would not elaborate in the unclassified session.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/space-force-chief-wants-catchy-themes-for-naming-service-kit-including-black-programs/	2024-10-29T12:15:22-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/04/saltzman-salute-scaled-e1681836461283.jpg
The Biden-era Pentagon makes its case for continued industrial base funding in new plan	Contractor employees at Iowa Army Ammunition Plant prepare 155 mm artillery rounds to be filled as a part of the load, assemble and pack operation. (Photo by Joint Munitions Command) WASHINGTON — The Pentagon needs to continue key investments to strengthen the nation’s defense industrial base, including in areas like the submarine industry, munitions production and prototyping projects, according to a new National Defense Industrial Strategy Implementation Plan. The implementation plan released today follows the publication of the Pentagon’s first National Defense Industrial Strategy in January. The strategy called for improvements in resilient supply chains, workforce readiness, flexible acquisition, and economic deterrence as four strategic priorities meant to enable the defense industry to ramp up weapons production at speed and scale. The COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine exposed vulnerabilities in the global defense industry’s supply chain and highlighted the need for the US industrial base to become more agile and resilient, capable of quickly churning out weapons to respond to a crisis if called upon by the Defense Department. RELATED: Pentagon homes in on counter-drone tech in Replicator 2 initiative With nearly three months to go before a new president moves into the White House, the implementation plan can be read as the current Pentagon’s entreaty to the next administration to keep the ball rolling on key industrial initiatives — a list that includes the Defense Production Act, the Office of Strategic Capital, the Replicator initiative and multi-year procurement of missiles and munitions. It also warns what could be at risk if new leaders abandon them. 'Our aim is not merely to maintain America's edge, but to sharpen it and lay the foundation for continued U.S. leadership in critical technologies and capabilities that will define the battlespace of the future,' Pentagon acquisition executive Bill LaPlante wrote in a foreword to the report. 'Most importantly, this implementation plan will serve as a guiding framework for resourcing decisions and investments in the coming years. It will inform our budget priorities, shape our research and development focus areas, and drive our engagement with industry.' During a roundtable this morning, Laura Taylor-Kale, assistant secretary of defense for industrial base policy, stressed that defense industrial policy had been an area of bipartisan support, with the department working with both Republicans and Democrats in Congress to shape the strategy and implementation plan. 'We are confident in the feedback that we're getting, that this will be a priority regardless of who wins next week in the elections,' she said. The implementation plan lays out six key initiatives the Pentagon sees as critical for advancing the stability of the defense industrial base, as well as current funding lines and the risks associated with vulnerabilities in those areas: All told, the Pentagon’s FY25 funding request of $849.8 billion includes $37.73 billion connected to implementation initiatives, slightly down from $39.42 billion in FY24, according to the plan. In both years, more than three quarters of that funding is earmarked for missiles and munitions, with the submarine industrial base in second place with $4 billion requested in FY25. The plan notes that it does not contain initiatives under consideration during FY26 budget deliberations, noting that those efforts are 'predecisional.' Both Taylor-Kale and Carla Zeppieri, deputy assistant secretary of defense for industrial base resilience, declined to comment on whether current plans call for defense industrial base funding efforts to rise in FY26. However, Taylor-Kale noted that the FY26 budget was the first to be built with the National Defense Industrial Strategy in mind. 'I think there was a definite understanding across the board of the importance of building capacity in the defense industrial base and also bringing in nontraditional companies into working with the Department of Defense,' she said. 'There's a real concern around supply chain vulnerabilities and … adversarial sources in our supply chains, as well as sole source and single source [components].' Zeppieri added that 'some of the topics that continue to get emphasized [in the FY26 budget] build on some of the things that we've seen in FY24 and 25 with respect to munitions and the organic industrial base.' Much of the implementation plan functions as a comprehensive list of tools and projects the Pentagon has started to help strengthen the industrial base. For instance, it outlines how $393.4 million in Defense Production Act funding would be spent to address shortfalls in critical chemicals, casting and forgings, the hypersonics industrial base and micro electronics. The plan highlights the U.S. Army’s multibillion-dollar plan to boost domestic 155mm artillery munition production as well as the service’s ongoing efforts to modernize its ammunition plants and depots. It also lays out current efforts to improve the cybersecurity of defense contractors. While there was no big news about high-profile Pentagon projects like Replicator or RDER, the plan did include some interesting tidbits about how the department hopes to enable those programs to come to fruition. For example, the plans states that the department 'intends to commission various projects, studies, and white paper reviews to identify vendors who can accelerate solid rocket motor production,' an effort that Zeppieri described as separate but complimentary to Replicator. The Pentagon is working on a classified annex to the implementation plan, which will include more detail on vulnerabilities and lay out its mitigation strategy in more detail. The department hopes to finalize that document by the end of the year, Taylor-Kale said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/the-biden-era-pentagon-makes-its-case-for-continued-industrial-base-funding-in-new-plan/	2024-10-29T11:19:28-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/6471690-e1653593193301.jpg
Emirati firms make presence felt at Turkish expo, aiming to boost defense cooperation	Turkish Minister of National Defense Yasar Guler makes a speech during the opening ceremony of SAHA EXPO, Turkiye's leading international defence &amp; aerospace exhibition in Istanbul, Turkiye on October 22, 2024. (Photo by Serhat Cagdas/Anadolu via Getty Images) BEIRUT — Defense companies from the United Arab Emirates made high-profile appearances at the Turkish Saha Expo last week, inking a number of memoranda of understanding and contracts in the latest tightening of security relations between Abu Dhabi and Ankara. 'The agreements signed by Emirati companies at Saha Istanbul are part of an ongoing trend of strengthening defense industrial ties between Türkiye and the UAE, a development that has gained momentum since early 2023,' Albert Vidal, a research analyst for the London-based thinktank IISS, told Breaking Defense. The expo is put on by Saha Istanbul, an association of hundreds of companies and more than two dozen universities — meaning it's a key opportunity for foreign firms to make connections in the Turkish defense world. As such, the UAE's largest defense conglomerate, EDGE Group, said earlier this month that it established a new office, dubbed MALATH, specifically to 'act as a catalyst for new business engagement between EDGE and SAHA companies, marking a new chapter in UAE-Türkiye cooperation in the advanced technology and defence sectors, and creating greater growth opportunities across the wider region and beyond.' At the show MALATH signed an MoU with Turkish ERA RF Technologies in which the two firms are expected to cooperate on advanced satellite communication terminals and ground modems. LAHAB, another EDGE Group entity, signed three agreements with Turkey's ASSAN Group to supply the latter with LAHAB’s MK munitions, with focus on African continent. The Emirati firm will also 'expand its product portfolio through incorporating Warsaw-configured MK munitions, with the support of ASSAN, to meet the operational requirements of its existing customers,' EDGE Group announced last week. The third agreement states that ASSAN will be a 'key supplier' to LAHAB, to deliver 'NATO-standard MK munitions components,' reinforcing LAHAB’s supply chain. 'These agreements with ASSAN Group represent a pivotal move in strengthening our international partnerships and expanding our global footprint, which is a key component of EDGE’s export strategy,' said EDGE Group CEO Hamad Al Marar. From his point of view, Emin Öner, chairman of ASSAN Group, said that his company 'aims to focus on enhancing serial production capacity. Regarding this, we are one of the biggest and one of the most successful in Türkiye. Today, we are taking a very important step toward getting into the global defense market.' In the cybersecurity field, EDGE’s ORYXLABS joined forces with Pavo Group in a strategic partnership 'to develop and execute a joint go-to-market strategy across Türkiye, the Middle East and Africa,' according to a company statement. Elsewhere, building on the earlier agreement with Baykar, EDGE Group signed an agreement to 'strengthen ties,' 'enhance capabilities, and expand market presence for both companies.' RELATED: New EDGE Group CEO says 2024 is the &#8216;year to catch up' on deliveries, talks missile integration Outside of EDGE Group, at the show Emirati aircraft producer Calidus signed an agreement with two Turkish firms, Aselsan and Havelsan, in which Aselsan is expected to provide advanced cockpit display solutions for Calidus’ aircraft, and both firms will collaborate 'on joint production, technological innovation, and upgrading rotary and fixed-wing aircraft' 'This partnership will focus on comprehensive cockpit modernization projects, ensuring the delivery of innovative solutions to meet both current and future operational requirements,' according to Calidus's statement. Havelsan will equip UAE’s Calidus with ground-based training solutions. The UAE air force contracted 40 B-250 trainer aircraft from Abu Dhabi-based Calidus, the first deal ever for the trainer aircraft, the company’s CEO Khalifa Alblooshi, told Breaking Defense in November.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/emirati-firms-make-presence-felt-at-turkish-expo-aiming-to-boost-defense-cooperation/	2024-10-29T09:51:16-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/241029_saha_expo_turkey_defmin_GettyImages-2179397631-scaled-e1730219636858.jpg
Political leaders need to stop standing in the way of defense innovation	The US Capitol. (Photo by Anna Rose Layden/Getty Images) Earlier this month, the global leaders of the defense industrial base converged in Washington DC for the annual Association of the United States Army conference. The entire convention hall overflowed with weapons, munitions, and any type of military gear that one could imagine. Touring the show floor, it became clear that while defense giants like Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and Raytheon still rule the roost, the startups and tech firms moving into the defense sphere are no longer happy to just get a small piece of the pie, but instead are looking to tip over the applecart of how weapons are provided to the military. Wall Street appears to be bullish on these new startups, and Palantir, arguably the first of this new wave, recently entered the S&amp;P 500 with a larger market cap (as of Oct. 15) than Northrop, which is a phenomenal accomplishment. And the desire of the warfighters to access the products and services offered by these startups appears to be bottomless; having uniformed leaders actively encouraging innovation is a rare sight in the military, but Army officials made it clear at AUSA that they want to engage Which is to say, everything should be lined up for new entrants to succeed — except that standing in the way are three roadblocks, none of which are technological, and all of which the next President and Congress should consider challenging. First are the incessant battles within the legislative branch, in particular from those who sit in the Appropriation Committees supporting national defense. The entire Congress approved a PPBE commission to address the appropriation process challenges, and while the report came back with many recommendations, the Appropriation Committees essentially responded in writing that the problem is not them, it is everyone else. Appropriators manage defense spending down to the thousands of dollars, enjoying the power given to them by being able to decide, line item by line item, what programs get quantity changes or are allowed to be bought. Unfortunately, this creates a constipated system. To try to survive, many of these tech startups then pay lobbying firms stocked with former appropriators to help them navigate the process for the crumbs of funding that they need. This can change fairly quickly if those elected to Congress want it to change. One small step forward would be to approve the Army’s request in the FY26 budget to provide flexible funding for unmanned aircraft systems, capabilities to counter them and electronic warfare tools. The second roadblock resides at the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), where the rules are written for how the Pentagon procures weapons. The rules, set up in the 1960s, often force companies to set up special pentagon-approved accounting systems. These rules have antiquated ideas of how labor should be tracked and compensated, sometimes forcing software engineers to account for their time in fifteen-minute blocks as if they were lawyers and allowing them to be compensated based upon educational attainment rather than productivity. As Bill Greenwalt testified before Congress in March 2024, 'progress in creating alternative acquisition pathways around the acquisition system have been marginal at best.' One fix would be for OSD to deem all software purchases as commercial, giving the services the ability to just buy the majority of software directly while still requiring the services to get approval for any software that is procured on a cost-plus basis. Doing this will further drive the military services to using the multitude of software vendors that do not have compliant DoD-specific back office systems. The third roadblock resides in the service secretary offices and staff. The political leadership of the services control the acquisition powers and comptroller budget powers within the bureaucracy. They could, if they wanted to, devolve those powers down to warfighting leaders, with political leaders providing oversight but not day-to-day decision making. To do this, both money and acquisition authority would be sent to the major warfighting commands where they could procure items directly from defense firms. This bottoms up approach is similar to how the American economy works, rather than the top-down centralized execution model created by the political leadership. Having different warfighting commanders procure different items will create a true marketplace of capabilities, allow winning and losing products to sort naturally. In effect, the era of contracting-to-monopoly would be over. It is hard to tell if the optimism in the air at AUSA will sustain itself once the war in Ukraine and the Isreal come to an end. Should budgets contract, tolerance for risk will be reduced and it is entirely possible that these startups will evaporate. This should not be tolerated, as it is these startups that are going to help secure our nation both militarily and economically. As we approach the upcoming election, it is crucial for new political leaders to prioritize defense innovation by devolving power and reforming the system. We should ask all candidates for federal office where they stand on this issue. No matter which side wins, the new administration should step up, devolve power, and change the system.

Five Eyes officials say they want a shared Top Secret cloud, someday	Close up of a mature man looking at a large computer monitor which is displaying a map of the world along with numerical data &amp; lines linking locations on the Earth. (Getty images) DODIIS 2024 — Members of the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing alliance want a Top Secret cloud environment that all five countries can operate on, though it's just an 'ambitious,' aspirational goal for now. Officials from each member nation said here Monday that with such a cloud environment, the allies would be able to seamlessly share data with each other, which would turn information technology interoperability into a reality. Furthermore, in their vision data would be properly 'tagged,' meaning it has metadata that helps identify who and where the data came from, Brig. Gen. Eric Vandenberg, director of the general intelligence enterprise for the Canadian Department of National Defence, told an audience at the Department of Defense Intelligence Information System conference. 'Not only would this cloud be a Top Secret cloud, but it would be classification agnostic as well, because the data is all tagged, because all of my users all have the correct digital identities, I can store all the data in the cloud. Everyone can access what they're allowed to access when they're allowed to access it. It would enable interoperability,' Vandenberg said. RELATED: $2 billion AUD deal for top secret Aussie cloud with AWS Jack Maxton, chief information officer for defence intelligence at the United Kingdom Ministry of Defence, said his top wish is the same as Vandenberg’s, along with cutting down 'unnecessary bureaucracy.' The Five Eyes group already shares intelligence far more readily than most nations do with their foreign counterparts, but Maxton said bureaucratic restrictions in place still 'are adding very little value, either to our security or to our intelligence mission, but because they've been there for so long, we've just got really, really comfortable.' Austin Martin, the assistant Director for Five Eyes IT integration within the American Defense Intelligence Agency’s Chief Information Office, reiterated Vandenberg and Maxton’s wish for such a network, also speaking on the role of data tagging in creating an interoperable environment. He said if he could solve any problem within the Five Eyes today it would be fixing the siloed data so it can exist on one cloud, which includes 'fine-grained tagging data' throughout the 'entirety of the Five Eyes alliance and intelligence enterprise community.' He added that he thinks the US had made 'great strides in recent times' in this area, but 'there's a lot more work to do.' Brig. Andrew McBaron, director general of intelligence data and targeting for the Austrialian Department of Defence, said a five-nation Top Secret may seem 'ambitious' right now, but other Australian officials revealed months ago that Canberra is already working on a three-nation set up. As Breaking Defense reported in December, Australia’s top intelligence official revealed then the development of a 'Top Secret' intelligence cloud that is planned to be interoperable with US and UK spy networks. Though officials did not say when that cloud will be first launched, they said that it will 'transform' how Australian intelligences work together, and with the US and UK.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/five-eyes-officials-say-they-want-a-shared-top-secret-cloud-someday/	2024-10-29T06:43:16-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/220524_cybersecurity_hack_map_GettyImages-1305131670-scaled.jpg
Japan to get US Navy’s Lockheed-made EW system in first international sale	Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force Murasame-class destroyer JS Yudachi (DD 103) and Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Sterett (DDG 104) sail together in formation with Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson (CVN 70) and Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Kidd (DDG 100) on Nov. 19, 2023. (U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Benjamin Ringers) WASHINGTON — For the first time the Japanese military will be installing a Lockheed Martin electronic warfare anti-ship missile capability on its vessels, courtesy of a new $113 million contract, the company announced today. 'The purchase for Japan marks the first international sale of the premier shipboard electronic warfare system in the world,' according to a Lockheed statement. 'Japan is a critical ally in the Western Pacific. Having [Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program] provides the same state-of-the-art system for detecting and identifying threats that the U.S. Navy uses, enhancing shipboard capabilities, and increasing interoperability with the U.S. Navy.' The Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program, or SEWIP, refers to the AN/SLQ-32 system, which the Navy often calls 'slick 32,' and is being installed on almost every surface ship in the American fleet. Generally EW uses electromagnetic or directed energy to accomplish one of three objectives: electromagnetic attack or jamming an adversary’s systems, defensive measures to protect personnel or protect equipment from getting jammed and electronic support which focuses on surveillance and identifying sources of electromagnetic energy. As Lockheed Martin puts it, 'SEWIP allows sailors to protect the ship from the threats you can see (incoming missiles) to those you can’t (radar jamming).' RELATED: Disrupting The ‘Critical Linkage’: What Is The Navy’s SEWIP? The SEWIP program has four blocks, with varying levels of capability: General Dynamics makes Block I, Lockheed Martin produces Block II, Northrop Grumman is responsible for Block III and the fourth block is a yet-to-determined future upgrade. In general, Lockheed Martin's block specifically focuses on enhancing the system's electronic sensing capabilities. Lockheed’s block is installed on the Arleigh Burke-class destroyers and both classes of the Littoral Combat Ship as well as planned for installation on the US Coast Guard’s Offshore Patrol Cutter. The sale to Japan comes as the White House has made multiple efforts to strengthen the US-Japan relationship through defense technology cooperation and investments among other things. In April, Washington and Tokyo announced plans to 'bilaterally upgrade our respective command and control frameworks to enable seamless integration of operations and capabilities and allow for greater interoperability and planning between U.S. and Japanese forces in peacetime and during contingencies. 'More effective U.S.-Japan Alliance command and control will strengthen deterrence and promote a free and open Indo-Pacific in the face of pressing regional security challenges,' the White House said. The Navy announced last week that an American F-35B landed onboard a Japanese destroyer for the first time while exercising off the coast of California.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/japan-to-get-us-navys-lockheed-made-ew-system-in-first-international-sale/	2024-10-29T05:00:49-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/241028_DVIDS_japanese_ship_8131025-scaled-e1730141075949.jpg
Aussies grappling with AI’s role in cyber threat decision making	The Australian Signals Directorate cyber and foreign intelligence facility in Canberra. (Australian Defense Force) CANBERRA — As Australia's national security establishment seeks to implement the US-led Responsible Military Use of AI and Autonomy Agreement, which requires a human being make the final decision to fire a weapon, a top government official on cyber policy is being up front that his government is trying to figure out how to make it all work. At the core of the challenge, said Peter Anstee, first assistant secretary of the Department of Home Affairs' cyber and technology security policy division, is whether man-in-the-loop decision making can ever be fast enough to keep up with a cyber attack guided by artificial intelligence, or if that requirement will effectively hamstring Canberra's ability to counter and respond to such a threat. 'It's a good question, and one we're currently grappling with,' Anstee said, 'and I don't think there's a straightforward answer.' 'And then there's the question around, where do we draw these guardrails in terms of military applications or use, Anstee said. 'At the moment, the principled approach its that you always have to have a given decision maker sitting within the kill chain. American autonomy and artificial intelligence experts have long pointed to the unique character of cyber warfare, where response times can be measured in nanoseconds, which raises the question whether humans could respond quickly to a significant threat to be effective. But the Australian official said he didn't 'think we've arrived to the point yet in the cyber domain where you'd have real time offense/defense activity happening in cyberspace, where it would be impossible to have a human decision maker insert themselves — short of a threat-to-life scenario, where we haven't defined risk situations yet in a satisfactory way.' When Breaking Defense asked if that was because Australia has not engaged in that type of warfare yet, he said it was a question of 'those special thresholds haven't been significantly defined.' Anstee appeared on a panel here today at the Australia and Pacific Security conference sponsored by the German Konrad Adenauer Foundation. Breaking Defense accepted travel accommodations from the foundation to attend. Shiri Kreb, an expert on cyber warfare and the laws of war from Australia's Deakin University, said during the panel that the nature of cyber means that 'it's not like a yes or no, if we have human control or not, if we have a scale or a spectrum of human guidance to these machines.' Krebs, who is also a legal fellow advising Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, said that, in the end, 'the question is, what can this human do?' And that question extends to AI and autonomous systems such as large drone swarms. 'We have a human in the loop, but how can a human respond to targets generated through 300 drones at the very same time, right? And so I think this is all not about whether we have the human on the loop that needs to verify a target, but rather, what can that human do with his or her cognitive abilities and to add effects, which I think is one of the examples we celebrate,' Krebs said. As opposed to humans, algorithms — especially those that are AI based —evolve 'on its own path' and 'we simply cannot trace it back. So we can have an algorithm making life and death decisions, and ultimately, it's completely unaccountable because we can't trace the reasoning behind that,' she noted. A secondary effect of relying on AI, Krebs said she had learned in interviews with intelligence analysts, is a decline in their skills. 'It became apparent that one of their concerns is this killing off our intelligence forces, mainly because when we allow AI-based technologies to do a lot of the collection and analysis of data. When we don't allow ourselves the type of intelligence work that that we used to devote to each and every target or threat, that means some of our skill and capabilities in this area are being eroded.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/aussies-grappling-with-ais-role-in-cyber-threat-decision-making/	2024-10-28T14:38:14-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/20220322asd8638673_0001-e1730131581892.jpeg
US SAR satellite imagery firms say draft ITAR changes still too restrictive	SAR image of forces lined up along the Ukraine-Belarus border in February 2022. (Capella Space) WASHINGTON — As the State Department awaits industry comment on proposed space export rules, they're likely going to get a bit of an earful from at least two major American synthetic aperture radar (SAR) firms — who each told Breaking Defense the new regulations would not go nearly far enough to even the playing field with foreign competitors. '[W]e won't be able to sell the premium technology, which means we'll be out-competed by [Finnish firm] ICEYE and other competitors in the global market,' said Jason Mallare, vice president and general manager at Umbra Space's Mission Solutions group. Likewise Frank Backes, CEO of Capella Space, said the proposed regulations, while an improvement, would still mean that some very high-quality American imaging systems designed to be lofted into space on satellites would fall under restrictions in the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, even if competing systems from foreign firms are readily available on the commercial market abroad. Besides ICEYE, he said, these include companies 'from Italy, from France, from Germany, [and] from China.' Both California-based companies, along with ICEYE's US arm, are among a handful of commercial firms that have been providing SAR-satellite data to the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) under study contracts since 2022. Senior Intelligence Community officials publicly have credited that commercial SAR imagery as critical in helping the US government support Ukraine in its long-running war with Russia. Further, ICEYE said it is now is providing Kyiv directly with SAR imagery. SAR satellites are particularly of interest to Ukraine because of their ability to 'see' through clouds, rain and fog — weather conditions prevalent in the region. The proposed State Department changes are part of a broad package of space-related export reforms — which also includes changes to the Commerce Department's Export Administration Regulations (EAR) — put together under the auspices of the National Space Council chaired by Vice President Kamala Harris. Specifically, the Oct. 23 State Department proposal would change the threshold on export of SAR-satellite systems based on the radio frequency bandwidth used, which directly affects the resolution quality of the allowable images. At the moment, ITAR prohibits the sale of SAR payloads using a spectrum width of greater than 300 megahertz (MHz); the new proposal would increase that to 500 MHz. It's a change that Umbra and Capella officials were quick to say is going in the right direction toward allowing US firms to stay competitive on the global marketplace, but nonetheless sets a threshold that is still far below what nearly all current SAR systems use. 'The reality is that the industry international standard right now for what's currently being deployed is 1,200 MHz,' Backes said. 'Our systems are currently 1,200 MHz systems. For SAR systems bandwidth is resolution. Resolution is quality. Quality is, in many regards, the value of the data,' Mallare said. At 1,200 MHz, a SAR satellite sensor provides an imagery resolution roughly equivalent to a picture taken by a space-based electro-optical camera with a resolution between 0.25 and 0.30 meters, the officials said. Umbra can provide SAR images down to 16 centimeter resolution, using digital enhancement capabilities. (Umbra Space) Somewhat confusingly, they added, the Commerce Department licensing regulations prohibit the export of SAR data and products that result from the use of a SAR system with a 1,200 MHz bandwidth. The Commerce Department's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is US government entity that provides licenses for operators of all remote sensing satellites, and sets the rules on imagery resolution. 'So the irony of that scenario is, under NOAA, I am licensed to do higher-resolution SAR, I just can't sell it as a system. So, I could sell the data, but I can't sell the system,' Backes said. 'It's frustrating that you have one part of the US government — in our licensing entity at NOAA — who is basically assessed this [1,200 MHz/0.25 meters] is the state of foreign technology and foreign availability. &#8230; And then you have a separate entity of the United States government that's saying this [500 MHz/0.50 meters] is the standard &#8230; of relevant military equipment that's available,' said Todd Master, Umbra's chief operating officer. Backes said that Capella experts are now putting together a comparative analysis that will map more precisely the equivalency between 'the electro-optical recommendation and the SAR recommendation' in the State Department proposed rules. Interestingly, the State Department proposal would also shift the current ITAR threshold for export of electro-optical imagery from 0.30 meters to 0.20 meters, another relaxation of the rules. Officials from both companies said they are working on formal responses to the State Department proposal, which sets a date of Nov. 22 for comments. They also acknowledge that the proposal clearly states that the department is seeking feedback on the current state of the art and market availability of SAR systems — noting US government officials have made clear that the 500 MHz limit is essentially a placeholder, and encouraged them to provide technical data to underpin their arguments for a change. Further, Backes said that Capella intends to try to 'coordinate' some 'industry-broad response as well.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/us-sar-satellite-imagery-firms-say-draft-itar-changes-still-too-restrictive/	2024-10-28T13:36:18-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/capella_space_russia_collects_20220224_Belarus-Ukraine-Border-Zoomed.png
Israel signs $500 million deal to expand Iron Beam laser air defenses	The Israeli-developed Iron Beam laser system. (Israeli Ministry of Defense) JERUSALEM — Israel’s Ministry of Defense announced today that it had signed a $500 million deal with Rafael and Elbit to expand production of the Iron Beam laser air defense system, set to come online next year. 'The system is expected to integrate into Israel's multi-layered defense array as a complementary capability to the Iron Dome system. This integration will significantly enhance Israel's defense capabilities against current and future threats while offering substantially lower operational costs,' the ministry said in a statement. Iron Dome is the lowest layer of Israel's three-layered system, responsible for taking out rockets, drones and other shorter range threats. The ministry, which has led the development of the system, called the deal a 'major milestone' in a statement. Rafael makes the Iron Dome, and Elbit, which said it is receiving $200 million in the new deal, is expected to supply the high-energy laser system. The laser will be able to counter various types of threats from rockets to mortars, UAVs and also cruise missiles, the ministry said. The IMoD signed a landmark deal worth approximately NIS 2 billion (over $500 million) to expand serial production of Israel&#39;s first domestically developed laser interception system, the Iron Beam, with lead developers Rafael Advanced Defense Systems and Elbit Systems. pic.twitter.com/dtAvPluIqm &mdash; Ministry of Defense (@Israel_MOD) October 28, 2024 All eyes have been on Israel's air defenses as it battles Iranian proxies on multiple fronts, from Hamas in Gaza to Hezbollah in Lebanon to the Houthis in Yemen — each of whom is capable of lobbing rockets, missiles, mortars or drones towards Israeli targets — in addition to Iran itself, which has twice launched missile and drone barrages. Today alone, the Israel Defense Forces said 'approximately 115 projectiles fired from the Hezbollah terrorist organization crossed from Lebanon' into Israel. Israel's push for laser defenses predates the current conflict, and in 2022 then-Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said tests had been completed on the Iron Beam system, calling it a 'game changer.' Eyal Zamir, Director General of the Israel Ministry of Defense, said today that the new contract is 'among our most significant agreements.' 'The Iron Beam deal will ensure continued and accelerated procurement of many additional laser systems.' This is part of a much larger procurement drive worth 'billions of dollars' the Ministry noted. Israel calls the focus on local domestic production of new systems 'blue and white' procurement, emphasizing the large funds spent on local defense industries. 'The capabilities developed at Elbit that will be integrated into Iron Beam represent a quantum leap in future defense technology against various threats,' Bezhalel (Butzi) Machlis, President and CEO of Elbit Systems, said. He pointed out that the development of laser technology 'is another significant step in maturing Elbit Systems' diverse capabilities in transforming and advancing defense and warfare technologies.' The Iron Beam development comes amid other Israeli initiatives relating to lasers, countering drones and financing air defenses. Rafael announced that it had developed a smaller laser air defense system called Lite Beam at AUSA in early October. The smaller system can be mounted on vehicles. On Oct. 15, the Israeli Ministry of Defense hosted an event in the Negev desert at which eight Israeli companies showcased their innovations to counter different types of UAV threats. In addition on Oct. 21 the Ministry announced that it had completed an exchange of letters with the US 'initiating the implementation of a special emergency aid package totaling $5.2 billion to strengthen Israel's air defense system[s]. This strategic support will enhance and expand Israel’s Iron Dome, David's Sling, and the developing ‘Iron Beam’ laser defense system,' the Ministry said at the time.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/israel-signs-500-million-deal-to-expand-iron-beam-laser-air-defenses/	2024-10-28T13:04:55-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/221205_iron_beam_daytime_MoD-scaled-e1670266593660.jpg
AI has role to play in protecting American nuclear C2 systems: STRATCOM head	Lt. Gen.

(U.S. Air Force photo by Airman 1st Class Chase Sullivan) DODIIS 2024 — US Strategic Command must update its nuclear command, control and communications (NC3) systems to become more resilient to adversaries, which includes implementing artificial intelligence and machine learning, STRATCOM's chief said today. NC3 systems 'must be secure, and they must be redundant to function in both conventional conflict conflicts or nuclear ones,' Gen. Anthony Cotton, commander of STRATCOM, said during his keynote address at the Department of Defense Intelligence Information System conference here in Omaha. 'Robust cybersecurity measures are critical to protect NC3 systems from adversary attacks or manipulation. Maintaining technological superiority in IT systems create uncertainty in the calculus of our adversaries. That enhances deterrence.' 'Advanced AI and robust data analytics capabilities provide decision advantage and improve our deterrence posture. IT and AI superiority allows for more effective integration of conventional and nuclear capabilities, strengthening deterrence. IT superiority is crucial in this new paradigm, enabling us to deter aggression across physical and virtual realms,' he added. To be able to mobilize such AI and ML, STRATCOM must first work on centralizing its data, Cotton said. If data can be a 'communal asset,' this will make it more possible to add AI and ML into the NC3 systems and allow warfighters and allies to share their information. Data, he said, are 'foundational for the AI application and research for STRATCOM. We must maintain the advantage over our adversaries by enabling faster and better decisions. Effective data management will help ensure we maintain decision advantage by enabling rapid and informed decision making across the enterprise. STRATCOM will transform to a data-centric organization that leverages high-quality data,' Cotton said. However, STRATCOM still has 'a long way to go' in centralizing its data, Cotton said, adding that his team is 'hindered by disparate data formats and lengthy timelines.' Though Cotton emphasized the strategic advantages that AI and ML will add to its NC3 systems, he said that a human must still be involved in the loop as this will 'maximize the adoption of these capabilities and maintain our edge over our adversaries.' He added later that the US’ adversaries are also making strides in AI and ML, which requires the US to have 'constant vigilance and adaptation.' He assured the audience that the US is 'ahead of' the adversary currently, but 'we simply must maintain and expand that lead.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/america-needs-ai-in-its-nuclear-c2-systems-to-stay-ahead-of-adversaries-stratcom-head/	2024-10-28T11:38:57-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/6741362-scaled-e1663270224912.jpg
To focus on China, US needs to wean off Europe and Middle East missions	A Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) Block 1B interceptor missile is launched from the guided-missile cruiser USS Lake Erie (CG 70) during a Missile Defense Agency and U.S. Navy test in the mid-Pacific. (U.S. Navy photo/Released) Earlier this month, Gen. Charles Flynn, the head of US Army Pacific, appeared at the Center for a New American Security with a clear warning: China’s build-up in land, air, and naval power has put it on an 'accelerated path' toward military superiority in the region. Concerns about China’s military capabilities are par for the course in national security circles these days, but Flynn’s direct comments serve as a good reminder that the PLA’s growth is not something just happening in hypothetical papers, but something the US military is seeing in real time. The problem is that for all the talk about how China is the 'pacing challenge' and needs to be the main focus for Washington, the US is overstretched at this most critical juncture. The uncomfortable reality: To be able to focus on China, American commitments need to change abroad. A quick survey of America’s missions abroad sums the situation up. In the Middle East, the US Navy has steadily chipped away at its already limited inventory of missiles intended to protect its ships in a war with China. In May 2024, Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro reported that the US launched more than $1 billion in missiles during operations against the Houthis, consisting of nearly 100 SM-2 and SM-6 surface-to-air missiles. In October 2024, US Navy destroyers fired roughly one dozen of the Navy’s advanced SM-3 surface-to-air missiles in one night, intercepting Iranian ballistic missiles targeting Israel — and expending an entire year’s worth of production for the Navy’s top-flight missile defense interceptor. For years, experts have warned that the US Navy was not acquiring the missiles it needed to defend itself in the Indo-Pacific fast enough and now it is using them up at an alarming rate in a secondary theater. In Europe, Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has captured America’s attention for nearly three years, drawing the focus away from China at a crucial time. American military deployments to Europe continue to grow as Russian actions in Ukraine distract from China’s efforts to displace the United States as the guarantor of the prevailing international order. With the United States focused on the conflict in Ukraine, China has been emboldened to challenge American interests in the Indo-Pacific, raising questions about whether US support for Ukraine detracts from support for Taiwan and, more broadly, American efforts to secure a free and open Indo-Pacific. If the United States remains overstretched, it will only further the ambitions of the so-called 'Axis of Upheaval'— the term my colleagues at CNAS have assigned to the loose coalition of Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea intent on disrupting the American-led international order that has ensured economic, political, and security stability since the Second World War. The situation, however, is not hopeless. There are several options available to prevent that outcome, if political leadership in Washington is willing to make hard choices. In Europe, American military power and its extended nuclear deterrent must remain the bedrock of European security, but the US should continue pressing its NATO allies to invest in collective defense. All NATO members should meet — and ideally exceed — the 2 percent spending target set by the alliance. Russia’s invasion prompted long-time NATO partners Sweden and Finland to formally join the alliance and spurred significant investment in military modernization and planning in Poland, and critically, among the Baltic states along NATO’s vulnerable northeastern flank. The US should push NATO to capitalize on these developments by expanding its Enhanced Forward Presence mission, ensuring that it can support frontline NATO battlegroups with the necessary reinforcements during a crisis, and continuing to support defense innovation in key areas among its member states. That would allow the US to draw down its presence in Europe, freeing up assets for use in the Pacific — the kind of movement that was underway before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In the Middle East, the US should reduce its commitment of high-end capabilities within the region and redeploy them to the Indo-Pacific region. The rapid expenditure of advanced munitions in the region is unsustainable. The US should take the lead in organizing a multinational coalition of allies and partners to protect commercial shipping, allowing American military forces to take on a reduced role in the interception of Houthi missiles. This effort could model the success of the EU-led counterpiracy taskforces that operated off the Horn of Africa for many years. That must go hand in hand with the US pressing Israel to reach a solution to the crisis in the Middle East that allows the Pentagon to reduce its force posture in the region. The diversion of thousands of US servicemembers and critical missile and air defense capabilities to the region detracts from the ability to place those forces in the Indo-Pacific where they may be needed on short notice in a crisis with China. In addition to doubling-down on its own posture in the region, the US must prioritize the capacity of partners and allies in the Indo-Pacific to support US operations during peacetime competition and wartime engagement. To do so, the US must increase the production rate of the critical munitions it expects to rely on in great number during a conflict with China; while US production lines are hitting maximum output, encouraging investment from allies and partners in their own domestic production, as Australia is currently doing, can help make up shortfalls. To ease the logistical burden of surging American forces into the region during a crisis, the US should expand its efforts to preposition and stockpile American military hardware in the region. And the US must continue to encourage its allies and partners in the region to invest in their own defense capabilities in ways that complement American advantages in the region. Interoperability and familiarity are foundational to this approach and a key objective of the US military’s approach to peacetime campaigning in the region. Finally, the United States must ensure that the trilateral AUKUS agreement proceeds on schedule. This landmark agreement serves as a bedrock for future security in the region and a framework for expanded cooperation with other key Indo-Pacific allies and partners. President Xi has chosen to support his partners in the 'Axis of Upheaval' in large part to sow the decline of the American-led international order — with the goal of making sure the US is stretched thinly if China decides to make moves in the Indo-Pacific. If the United States cannot rebalance its military focus toward the Indo-Pacific it risks expediting Chinese aggression in the region and furthering the decline of the US-led economic and political order worldwide. Yes, a relative withdrawal from Europe and the Middle East is difficult to swallow and carries its own risks. But if China is the biggest threat to American interests, then it has to remain the biggest focus of America’s capabilities — even if it comes with accepting risk elsewhere.

‘Growing desperation’? NATO chief confirms North Korean troops deployed to help Russia in Kursk	NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte addresses media after a North Atlantic Council meeting with Republic of Korea intelligence and defense officials (NATO) BELFAST — North Korean troops have been deployed to the Russian border territory of Kursk in support of Moscow’s war against Ukraine, the head of NATO said today, calling the move 'a sign of [Russian President Vladimir] Putin's growing desperation.' 'I can confirm that North Korean troops have been sent to Russia and that North Korean military units have been deployed to the Kursk Region,' Secretary General Mark Rutte said in a press briefing after a North Atlantic Council meeting with South Korea’s National Intelligence Service and its Ministry of National Defense. Rutte called the development a 'significant escalation' of DPRK’s continued involvement in Russia’s 'illegal war' against Ukraine and a further 'breach' of UN Security Council resolutions. Hours later Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh told reporters an estimated 10,000 North Korean troops had been sent to 'train in eastern Russia [and] will probably augment Russian forces near Ukraine over the next several weeks.' Singh said 'a portion of those solders have already moved closer to Ukraine.' Echoing Rutte, Singh said any move to put North Korean troops in combat 'highlights President Putin's increasing desperation, as Russia has suffered extraordinary casualties on the battlefield, and an indication that Putin may be in more trouble than people realize.' The troop commitment mirrors the estimated number of troops — 10,000 — that Ukraine used to seize portions of the Russian territory of Kursk in August. Rutte said that NATO 'calls on Russia and the DPRK to cease these actions immediately.' 'The deepening military cooperation between Russia and North Korea is a threat to both the Indo-Pacific and Euro-Atlantic security. It undermines peace on the Korean Peninsula and fuels the Russian war against Ukraine,' he said. Earlier this month, John Kirby, US National Security Adviser, said that should DPRK troops be deployed in Russia they could expect to be treated as 'fair game' by Ukrainian forces. 'The possibility that there could be dead and wounded North Korean soldiers fighting against Ukraine is — is absolutely real if they get deployed,' he told reporters. On Friday the Council on Foreign Relations published an analysis on the potential introduction of North Korean troops into the fighting, saying in a counterpoint to Rutte and Singh that since Russian forces have been gaining ground recently, it's unlikely Putin was acting out of desperation. 'Rather, Putin is probably making this move based on tactical considerations,' the analysis said. 'In helping Russia retake Kursk, the North Korean contingent can also allow Putin to focus Russian forces on their advance in eastern Ukraine, the main front where Russia has been steadily, if slowly, advancing.' Either way, defense ties have become more pronounced since Moscow and Pyongyang signed a mutual defense agreement in June. The pact commits the two sides to come to the other's defense in the event of being attacked. Beyond troops, it is estimated that the DPRK has supplied Moscow with over 8 million 122mm and 155mm artillery shells, based on Republic of Korea intelligence that the nation says has been verified by satellite imagery of Russian cargo ships transporting weapons in large containers out of North Korean ports. Ukrainian officials have also said North Korean KN-23 short-range ballistic missiles have been used to target Ukrainian cities. 'Pyongyang has already supplied Russia with millions of rounds of ammunition and ballistic missiles that are fuelling a major conflict in the heart of Europe and undermining global peace and security,' Rutte explained. 'In exchange, Putin is providing North Korea with military technology and other support to circumvent international sanctions.' Russian forces have sustained more than 600,000 losses or injured personnel since the war in Ukraine started, leaving Putin 'unable to sustain his assault &#8230; without foreign support,' according to Rutte. Allies, Ukraine and Indo-Pacific partners are in close consultation about the Kursk deployment and the need to bolster military aid for Kyiv, he added. On Sunday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on X that additional military aid packages are expected 'next week,' following the creation of a northern Europe cooperation pact made up of Ukraine, Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Iceland. 'We expect support from all our partners for the Victory Plan,' he shared. 'They all understand the importance of being resolute and the necessity of creating challenges for the aggressor, so that Russia loses the ability to disrupt global stability.'

How new White House AI memo impacts, and restricts, the Pentagon	149th Intelligence Squadron airmen conduct training in a computer training lab at Mather Field, California Dec. 2, 2023. The December 2023 UTA focus was on the readiness of the airmen by embracing their unit's stated mission to 'Organize, train, and equip Cyber-ISR leaders to provide intelligence in support of federal and state mission priorities​. WASHINGTON — A landmark National Security Memorandum recently signed by President Joe Biden requires human oversight, safety testing and other safeguards for many military and intelligence applications of artificial intelligence. The memo also launches a sweeping review of how the Pentagon and intelligence agencies acquire AI, with recommendations for regulatory changes and other reforms due back next year. However, neither the memo itself nor the accompanying Risk Management Framework [PDF] impose significant new restrictions on AI-controlled drones, munitions and other 'autonomous weapons,' the chief concern of many arms control activists around the world. Instead, the RMF largely defers on that issue to existing Pentagon policy, DoD Directive 3000.09 [PDF], which was extensively revised last year to restrict, but not prohibit, autonomous weapons (some of which already exist in the form of computer-controlled anti-aircraft and missile defenses). The new policy documents, by contrast, focus on AI used to analyze information and make decisions — including about the use of lethal force. That said, the memo does mention 'a classified annex' that 'addresses additional sensitive national security issues, including countering adversary use of AI that poses risks to United States national security.' The published documents do not specify what kind of 'adversary use' the annex covers nor what other 'sensitive' issues it might address. RELATED: Clear guardrails mean faster progress on AI: Biden signs sweeping guidance for DoD &amp; IC The other major question mark, of course, is the election: Many of the mandates in the memo and the RMF won’t even take effect until next year. While a Kamala Harris administration would presumably continue Biden’s policies, the GOP platform already promises to 'repeal Joe Biden's dangerous Executive Order [published last year] that hinders AI Innovation.' And former advisors to President Donald Trump have called for a 'Manhattan Project' approach to accelerate military AI. A Trump Administration might well remove all the restrictions and guardrails in the Biden plan. Current and former Biden administration officials have emphasized that the goal of the new policy is to accelerate adoption of AI by setting clear guardrails, not to hinder what they call 'responsible' employment. As a result, the memo and RMF rarely impose outright prohibitions and more often allow AI development and deployment to proceed — if, and only if, an extensive checklist of best practices is followed. One of the few blanket bans in the RFM is against using AI [to] remove a human ‘in the loop’ for actions critical to informing and executing decisions by the President to initiate or terminate nuclear weapons employment.' This is a reaffirmation of longstanding US policy that computers can't be allowed to launch nuclear weapons without human oversight. The framework restricts use of AI to forecast likely civilian casualties and collateral damage when planning a potential military strike. Any such use of AI requires both technical safeguards, such as continuous 'rigorous testing' of the AI, and human oversight 'by trained personnel.' The framework forbids computer-generated intelligence reports and analysis 'based solely on AI' unless they are clearly labeled with 'sufficient warnings' to the reader. RELATED: Can tech reduce civilian deaths in conflict? Mark Milley isn’t so sure. The framework then goes into a longer list of 'high impact AI use cases,' all of which are allowed if, and only if agencies implement a detailed set of guardrails. Many of these precautions are about protecting human rights. That includes restrictions on AI 'tracking or identifying [or] classifying an individual as a known or suspected terrorist, insider threat, or other national security threat.' The framework also mandates human oversight of any AI assessing eligibility for benefits ranging from political asylum to federal employment. Yet other provisions aim to ensure that human beings remain in control of AI and can be held accountable for whatever the software does, from handling nuclear and other hazardous materials, or deploying malware online. Before a new AI is even deployed for the first time — and retroactively for AI already in use — agencies must conduct a thorough 'risk and impact assessment,' including an up-front, bottom-line cost-benefit analysis of whether AI is even the right solution for the problem at hand, as opposed to more traditional tools. The mandated guardrails include extensive testing 'in a realistic context,' preferably including a 'pilots and limited releases' prior to widespread deployment; analysis of 'possible failure modes' and mitigations; assessment of whether the underlying data to train, test, and update the AI is accurate, adequate, and accessible; and ongoing, continuous monitoring to ensure the AI continues to perform as intended. The mandatory best practices also address the human users of AI. They must be trained not only to operate it, but to watch for errors instead of blindly trusting the machine (what’s called 'automation bias'), with reporting channels and whistleblower protections when problems arise. Unsurprisingly, the policy does make it possible to waive some or all of these safeguards. But such waivers must come, in writing, directly from an agency’s designated Chief AI Officer, and be reviewed and renewed at least annually Overall, the National Security Memorandum and the Risk Management Framework are not about banning sensitive uses of AI, but regulating them — without getting in the way of rapid progress in the tech race with China. 'The NSM does a good job of balancing between making clear what is not allowed and enabling rapid adoption by the national security community, when the technology and the testing environment mean you can validate the ability to do it safely,' said Michael Horowitz, a UPENN professor who, until recently, worked on AI as deputy assistant secretary of defense for emerging capabilities. And, he told Breaking Defense, the Pentagon has spent years figuring out just how to test and safeguard such systems. 'DoD and other agencies have decades of experience in developing and employing AI, and in designing policies to do so safely,' Horowitz said. 'The NSM not only builds on those lessons learned, it breaks new ground in ensuring the national security community can adopt AI with responsible speed.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/how-new-white-house-ai-memo-impacts-and-restricts-the-pentagon/	2024-10-28T07:23:34-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/241028_DVIDS_intel_squadron_8201945-scaled-e1730121863433.jpg
Space Force scrambling to get GPS ground system upgrades done by 2025	Spc. Caleb Green of 2nd Battalion, 13th Field Artillery Regiment, 1st Stryker Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division, prepares for his nightly call-for-fire mission with the Long Range Advanced Scout Surveillance System (LRAS) mounted on top. (Photo: Gregory Dalglish, Test Officer, Intelligence Electronic Warfare Test Directorate) WASHINGTON — The Space Force is pushing hard to wrap up its long lagging programs to upgrade the ground systems and receivers for Global Position System (GPS) satellites — including ditching the Air Force B-2 bomber as a first test platform for airborne receivers capable of using the jam-resistant M-Code signal in order to speed them to cross-service aircraft operators, according to a senior service acquisition official. 'Current programs that are scheduled to complete in 2025? &#8230; There is a gun to our head to finish in 2025,' Cordell DeLaPena, program executive officer for Military Communications &amp; Positioning, Navigation, and Timing at Space Systems Command (SSC), said on Thursday. Speaking at SSC's annual Space Industry Days conference in Los Angeles, he said that progress is being made on the troubled ground system for command and control of the most modern GPS satellites, the Next-Generation Operational Control System (OCX). Being developed by RTX (formerly Raytheon), OCX is needed to allow some 700 weapon systems across the US military to fully access the encrypted M-Code signal. However, the program has been a poster child for broken acquisition, having been originally planned to begin operations more than a decade ago. OCX 'is almost done with the lab development. Operator testing starts next month. There's one final acquisition program baseline, APB, milestone left on that program. It's called &#8216;ready to transition operations.' Think of that as readiness to enter operational test. That's the last milestone, and we're going to hit it before the end of the year,' DeLaPena pledged. The Space Force also has shaken up its multifaceted effort to field the M-Code user kit being developed under the Military GPS User Equipment (MGUE) program, he said. That program also has been one of the banes of the GPS program for more than two decades — as reported ad nauseam by the Government Accountability Office and the Pentagon’s Office of Test &amp; Evaluation. Under that program, the Space Force is in charge of developing the microchips and microelectronics cards that interface with the M-Code signals, although each individual service is responsible for building service-specific receivers/radios that use those components. MGUE has two phases. MGUE Increment 1 is developing the baseline military-unique ASIC chips and cards for initial integration with platforms across the services, including Army Strykers land vehicles, Marine Corps Joint Light Tactical Vehicles (JLTVs), and the Navy’s DDG-class destroyers — as well as, until recently, the Air Force's B-2 bomber. MGUE Increment 2 will deliver a smaller, more powerful ASIC chip for use by handheld radios and precision-guided munitions. 'Military GPS User Equipment Increment 1? &#8230; We've got to finish that program,' DeLaPena said. 'We've completed the certification for the terrestrial domain. The Army is buying it big time for their users, for their for their Strykers. The Marine Corps for their JLTVs. In September, I certified the maritime platform, which is the Navy destroyer, the DDG,' he added. 'The final APB milestone on MGUE Increment 1 is certification for the aviation platform. We did something very interesting over the past two weeks,' DeLaPena explained. After it became clear that the Air Force 'could not make a B-2 available for this program,' SSC made a proposal to the Department of the Air Force's space acquisition czar, Frank Calvelli, that an Army aircraft — a Gray Eagle unmanned aerial vehicle — be used as a test vehicle instead. (A September GAO report found that the Air Force's internal effort to develop the radios for the M-Code chips has fallen significantly behind schedule.) After coordinating on the proposal with the Defense Department Office of the Director of Test &amp; Evaluation, the Army, and the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Calvelli signed off on that change in lead test aircraft on Thursday, DeLaPena said. 'We are pressing ahead with MGUE Increment 1, and we're going to meet that final milestone in 2025,' he vowed.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/space-force-scrambling-to-get-gps-ground-system-upgrades-done-by-2025/	2024-10-28T06:16:59-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/GPS-on-Stryker-scaled-e1729893191673.jpg
Better user interface and experience create faster decision-making in multi-domain operations	Teague works with partners like Overland AI, a company on the leading edge of autonomous land systems, on user experience for navigating complex, off-road terrain at operationally relevant speeds. (Photo courtesy of Overland AI). The Defense Department’s focus on joint and multi-domain operations is rapidly increasing the pace of technology development – everything from tactical radios and hand-held controllers for first-person-view quadcopters to command and control consoles for ISR platforms. To be most effective, those systems and many others need to be designed in such a way that they speed decision making for multi-domain operations, for example, not hinder it. In other words, users need well-designed visual elements like buttons and screens, what’s known as User Interface (UI), and well thought out system processes to help them solve problems, commonly called User Experience (UX). We discussed how UX/UI can be an enabler for future operations with: Tim Heiser, director of defense programs, and Matt McElvogue, vice president of design, at Teague, a firm with 98 years of experience pioneering human-centered design within complex systems and emerging technologies. Breaking Defense: How is UX/UI defined through a military lens? Tim Heiser is Director of Defense Programs at Teague. Heiser: When I hear military customers speak, they need two things: capacity and capability, and they need it now. At Teague, we view good UX design as being able to translate technology to the human who needs to use it, allowing prioritized and simplified decision making in an already stressful and demanding situation. That’s the lens that the military is starting to see through as well. The days of training to an asset with a three-inch thick binder are starting to wane. There’s a place for the binder, but supplementing or replacing that approach with intuitive systems and design helps field capability quicker. McElvogue: There are also usability issues when it comes to automation and the amount of data that's generated by new sensing technology. There's more information to sort through than there has been in the past. Software has to evolve to allow the human user to have some agency – to understand what's happening, know when they need to plug in and direct something, and understand the repercussions of their actions. The DoD is working to bring in non-traditional defense companies. What role does UX/UI play in the widening of this aperture? Heiser: If you think about the amount of technology that's coming to the military – from research labs across the multitude of private and government services, to companies on the commercial end – you no longer have just the three to five big primes developing the ‘next thing.’ Innovation is coming from different spaces within the market in the defense arena, and that's new for the military. It's no longer that you procure capability and technology developed over 20 years, mature it, and field it. It's coming much faster and from different angles. All of it has the same intent, which is to put the best technology in the hands of the warfighter faster than we've ever done it before. Matt McElvogue is Vice President of Design at Teague. McElvogue: Prioritizing decision making is probably more critical today than it's ever been. We’re at a moment in time when a new generation is coming into the military and entering command structures. They’ve grown up post-Internet, with smartphones being something they had in their pockets from an early age. They’re used to using products that have had millions of dollars put into their user experience to make them easy to use. Whether they realize it or not, they're bringing that perspective to the tools that they use at work. They’re asking for better UX as they're brought into the process of evaluating new equipment and interfaces. That’s leading traditional defense companies to seek out new partners to better serve the needs of the military and improve their product offering. Teague works with many of these partners, including Overland AI, a company on the leading edge of autonomous land systems. Their tech is used to navigate complex, off-road terrain at operationally relevant speeds. We've been helping them demonstrate their autonomy stack, OverDrive, through a custom UI that allows warfighters to intuitively interact with the platform’s capabilities – planning routes, executing missions, and providing feedback to the user when their input is needed. The UI we designed has allowed them to visualize and demonstrate their unique capabilities for senior stakeholders and end users in the military, which has sped up adoption of their products. What military systems could benefit the most from improved UX/UI? Heiser: Increasingly, traditional military systems are needing to connect to newer systems that were developed to do a singular task. It’s a very challenging job for someone to oversee, engage, and make decisions with those systems that have been connected, not only within a platform but even across domains. The trick is, how do you upgrade a legacy system that's already been certified, that has been trained on for years? One approach that avoids costly, time-consuming rebuilding is to create an interface that ‘sits’ like a layer on the front. This way, the interconnectivity happens behind the scenes and is seamless to the person who needs to engage with the system. This approach has been a hot topic for us, as many companies we work with are looking to ensure their systems are adaptable to emerging technologies. McElvogue: When you're introducing a new technology, that’s the right time to make sure that you have a human-centered design perspective. When you focus on UX early on, rather than first having technical requirements and then trying to build end-user requirements later, the two can inform one another. Imagine a day in the life of a JTAC (Joint Terminal Attack Controller) or someone that's moving between different systems and products from planning and executing a mission, to talking to intelligence and debriefing after the mission. They're moving through many different company experiences. I think the military is now becoming aware that they source products from all over the place and they need to bring those experiences together in a way that doesn't hinder the individual from doing their job efficiently and without needless mistakes. Human-centered design shows a proven advantage for the end-user – in this case, the warfighter – and can also be a competitive advantage for products in the defense sector. A custom UI developed by Teague allows warfighters to intuitively interact with the platform’s capabilities – planning routes, executing missions, and providing feedback to the user. (Overland AI photo). What’s the role of UX/UI in near-peer conflicts and multi-domain operations? Heiser: If you think about mission planning and execution, the mission planning phase often can take days to digest information, create a battle management plan, and then send that out to your battalions to execute. Because of the amount and speed of information that is coming in while you're executing, you need to have a strategy to quickly digest it and make it usable for the next action. Now the question becomes, do you want the human in or out of the loop regarding the decision to engage with that information? By segmenting and segregating that information and creating the ability to synthesize data and present it to the individual that is in the loop to make decisions, that entire information loop starts to become tighter and faster. In systems where multiple pieces of information are coming together for a ‘go button’ to be pushed, we have observed hesitancy because either there’s too much information, the user doesn’t trust it, or it doesn't look like it did yesterday. In their experience, it's not telling them what they think it should be. And that’s when the UX design becomes incredibly important – for simplification, prioritization, and management of that data. Autonomy is driving development of many DoD systems. What’s the role of HMI, the human-machine interface, in autonomy? McElvogue: We work with autonomous tech, both in defense and in the consumer space, and there's trends across both. When autonomy comes into the picture, you are asking a human to go from the frame of mind where they have direct control, like a gas pedal, to a world where they're operating the asset in a more removed way. It's puppet mastering; you're telling it to do something and then waiting to see how it did. It's a new form of control that requires new skills and interfaces to know how things are going. When I'm watching it execute, making alterations, that requires a new rebuilding of trust with a system when the user doesn’t have direct control. It’s about communicating in a manner that meets them on their level. For example, the systems that we have designed for autonomous vehicles feature multiple styles of communication such as visual, verbal, and written so people can receive communications in ways that are better for them and the tasks they’re trying to accomplish. You might have a map view, a view that shows the steps it's moving through, or have auditory verbal communication. You can dial one or the other back. Similarly, when you replace the usual controls with new modes of control, you can give the operator the ability to interrupt or change the behavior of the platform. Building up the user’s trust in the autonomous system is quite important for the system or technology to be effective. Final thoughts? McElvogue: Looking early at user requirements alongside the technical requirements improves your technology. Bringing in human-centered design early in the process is a competitive advantage for a product in the defense sector, just like it is in any sector. That's proven on the consumer side and companies are waking up to that fact on the defense side. Heiser: We must acknowledge that we are asking more out of our warfighters. The speed of technology is outpacing an individual's reasonable ability to digest all that information and be able to make difficult decisions in stressful situations. We have to recognize and design for those situations so that our warfighters can make the decisions they need to make at the time they need to make it.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/better-user-interface-and-experience-create-faster-decision-making-in-multi-domain-operations/	2024-10-28T05:35:15-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/BehindTeague.jpg
Lebanon receiving $1B in aid amid ongoing conflict	French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot speaks during the International Conference in Support of Lebanon's People and Sovereignty in Paris, France on October 24, 2024. (Photo by Umit Donmez/Anadolu via Getty Images) BEIRUT — A conference in support of Lebanon held in Paris has raised $1 billion for the country, according to French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot. 'We have collectively raised $800 million in humanitarian aid and $200 million for the security forces, that’s about $1 billion,' he said Thursday at the International Conference in Support of Lebanon's People and Sovereignty. The conference, which hosted 70 governmental delegations, follows previous sentiments from France that it would support the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) in security missions at the southern border. France is 'standing by the LAF, and we have been thinking of preparing different initiatives, always to support the political decision,' a French official told Breaking Defense back in May. The LAF haven’t yet taken part in the ongoing conflict in South Lebanon between Hezbollah and Israel, and even repositioned its troops farther north as the conflict intensified. In his speech at the conference, Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati assured the cabinet’s commitment to implement the 1701 Security Council Resolution — which put an end to 2006 war between Hezbollah and Israel. 'The Lebanese government's commitment starting with recruiting additional Lebanese soldiers in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 1701 shows a clear commitment to implementing this resolution,' Mikati said. 'The decision to recruit more soldiers constitutes an important step towards enhancing the ability of the Lebanese Armed Forces to maintain security and stability in the region.' He added that successful implementation of 1701 'will require the support of the international community. This assistance can come in various forms, including financial support, training, and technical assistance to ensure the recruitment process is carried out effectively and efficiently.' In addition to Resolution 1701, Barrot highlighted that the joint proposal made in September by France and the United States for a 3-week truce remains the basis for any potential ceasefire in Lebanon. Barrot noted that $300 million of the money raised for humanitarian aid came from the US, according to Reuters. The US has traditionally sent military aid to Lebanon, previously donating three Huey II and six MD-530 helicopters to the Lebanese air force, and three protector class boats to the navy.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/lebanon-receiving-1b-in-aid-amid-ongoing-conflict/	2024-10-25T12:25:33-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/GettyImages-2179882764-scaled-e1729876112662.jpg
Join the commercial space reserve: Get longer contracts, in-depth threat briefs; play wargames	Col. Rich Kniseley, head of Space Systems Command’s Commercial Space Office. (US Air Force photo by Cherie Cullen) WASHINGTON — When the Space Force contracts commercial companies to provide 'reserve' capabilities that could be 'surged' in times of conflict — and possibly denied to non-US customers for a period of time — those joining can expect a number of peacetime benefits in exchange for their willingness to serve, according to the head of the Space Force's Commercial Space Office (COMSO). Speaking to reporters on Thursday during Space Systems Command's annual Space Industry Days conference, Col. Rich Kniseley said these benefits could include: longer funding periods; in-depth threat briefings based on a firm's security clearance status; and opportunities to participate in Pentagon wargames. Kniseley, who is spearheading the work to develop a space version of the Civil Air Reserve, called the Commercial Augmentation Space Reserve (CASR), stressed that while the plan is still nascent, a number of elements are emerging based on industry feedback to sessions the Space Force held in August. '[O]verwhelmingly, I think industry is still very positive on CASR, we still have some runway to fix some of the concerns, and we're definitely on a path with what industry has been asking for,' he said. During a conference panel discussion, Kniseley said that his game plan is still to release the first set of initial CASR contracts to providers of space domain awareness data and analysis — though his timeframe has slipped a bit, moving from late this year to early next year. 'I'm very confident that we will have our first CASR contracts by early of next year, targeting space awareness,' he said. Kinseley told reporters his office already is working with US Space Command's multinational Joint Commercial Operations (JCO) cell, headed by Barbara Golf, to craft the contracts already in place through the Global Data Marketplace. The JCO gathers and disseminates commercial space monitoring data to augment military space surveillance, primarily through the National Space Defense Center, which in turn brings together military and Intelligence Community (IC) operators to determine how best to prevent adversary attacks on Defense Department space systems. 'The contracts that we will do with space domain awareness will be very much linked with what Ms. Golf is doing in the JCO. In fact, they will be building upon the current contracts that are already being utilized through the Global Data Marketplace,' Kniseley said. But based on feedback from industry, the Space Force 'would like to do longer periods of performance for would-be CASR members,' he said, noting that a lot of the JCO contracts currently are 'month to month.' Kniseley told the conference that his team also is working with the JCO to ensure that CASR services contracted actually will be useful to SPACECOM operators and properly integrated into joint force concepts of operations. 'I think sometimes industry is looking at CASR is like, I go to the grocery store and I slap organic on it, and, people automatically want to buy it. CASR is going to be aligned very well with the [Space Force] commercial strategy, and it's going to be mission areas that are on the commercial strategy that we're going to be going after,' he said. 'We are doing mission area assessments right now for commercial SATCOM [satellite communications] in the Indo-Pacific region. That's ongoing right now. We will do other mission areas for other combatant commands as well, and what that's going to show us is how much I need to have on contract. So I'm not buying commercial for commercial sake. I am filling a need for the war fighter and filling a gap or an area that we can augment with these commercial capabilities,' Kniseley explained. CASR agreements for other mission areas, such as tactical surveillance, reconnaissance and tracking as well as alternate positioning, navigation and timing will follow. 'Every mission area is different. Every company is different,' Kniseley stressed. 'So there's not going to be a one size fits all, and we will tailor that based on the mission area and sometimes also with the vendor itself.' He further noted that CASR participants won't be required to jump from doing nothing to suddenly providing services at a maximum capacity. 'This isn't a zero to 60 model. You will have a level set amount of capability on [tap during peacetime] in order for me to get this out to the warfighter to make sure that they know what they're doing with this capability, that it's stitched together into this overall space enterprise — and not this &#8216;military versus commercial' [situation where] commercial is automatically on the shelf because I don't know what to do with it,' Kniseley said. 'We'll be funding in peace time. The contracts will also have pre-price negotiations or a surge capability,' he added. One thing the initial contracts will not address, however, is the question of how, when and why the Space Force might demand that CASR participants turn over all their capabilities to the US government and deny service to other customers, potentially including foreign governments as commercial/civilian users. That issue long has been controversial; for example, a sticking point for the National Reconnaissance Office in the 2020-2021 timeframe when it negotiated contracts with commercial remote sensing providers. '[D]enial of service was a common concern across industry for CASR, and I think there's different ways to go about it without overtly calling it out in the contract. One idea that we received from industry is, if a country or an actor is on the sanctions list, automatically we would have to not provide service to them. So, that's not something that we've, you know, put our flag in, but these are additional ideas that we're looking at,' Kniseley told reporters. 'So, those initial contracts will be a step in the right direction, but they won't be the full pass or concept, if you will. We're kind of taking a slower-walk approach to it,' he added. Kinseley told the conference that the next step for CASR is another round of industry discussions planned for 'early December,' when COMSO will elaborate on what options the Space Force intends to adopt as part of the contractual agreements. 'The threats are not slowing down, so we need to move at action and speed. We do need to fight tonight,' he said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/join-the-commercial-space-reserve-get-longer-contracts-in-depth-threat-briefs-play-wargames/	2024-10-25T11:11:35-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/06/230606-F-XH843_COSMIC-105-e1686161814275.jpg
Ottawa should get serious about the Canadian-Korean defense partnership	Bill Blair, Minister of Defense of Canada, speaks to the press after his arrival at NATO headquarters on the first day of the NATO Defense Ministers' Meeting on June 13, 2024 in Brussels, Belgium. (Photo by Omar Havana/Getty Images) When Canadian Defense Minister Bill Blair visited South Korea in September, the delegation did the usual diplomatic niceties like visiting the Korean Demilitarized Zone, meeting Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) personnel serving in the United Nations Command, boasting about bilateral defense collaboration on weapon and asset procurement and reaffirming Ottawa’s commitment to maintaining peace on the peninsula. Canada’s desire to deepen its defensive partnerships also extends to the broader region. Following the trip to Seoul, the minister visited Japan to affirm the same diplomatic nuances as communicated in South Korea. Coupled with Ottawa’s pursuit for a membership in AUKUS’s second pillar, Canada appears to be doubling down on its Indo-Pacific Strategy that showcases Ottawa’s commitment to be a reliable and trustworthy partner on defensive matters in the Indo-Pacific. It's classic visiting-a-partner stuff, but the problem is, like so much of the discussion around Canadian defense spending these days, the visit came with little real military commitment. And if Canada wants to get serious about the Indo-Pacific, that needs to change. During the meeting in Seoul, both ministers emphasized the need to strengthen their defensive bond, citing the Action Plan that will implement the newly elevated relationship with Seoul into a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. The meeting also inaugurated more avenues for staff-level military discourses and launched the creation of a High-Level Foreign and Defense Policy Dialogue — a 2+2 diplomatic mission that enables reviews of progress on cross-cutting aspects of defense and diplomatic cooperation. These initiatives constitute a reasonable effort by Ottawa in demonstrating a genuine interest to deepen its defensive partnership on the Korean peninsula. However, Canada’s regional deployments are summed up by a single CP-140 Aurora, a long-range patrol aircraft, deployed to the Korean peninsula, as well as three withering Halifax-class frigates balancing maritime commitments in the South China Sea, across the Taiwan Strait and in waters bordering South Korea. Far from a display of military might, the only thing on display is Ottawa’s perishing combat-capacity to fulfill its commitments to regional defense. This is where Canada missed an opportunity to genuinely deepen its defensive engagement with an Indo-Pacific partner. To amplify its engagement on the Korean peninsula, Canada must build upon current and future capabilities of CAF. This is an area where Ottawa is out of step with Seoul and other like-minded allies, all of whom are increasing their joint combat effectiveness and deterrence capabilities through bilateral and multilateral endeavors. Acknowledging CAF’s limited force generation abilities, Ottawa should have pursued a Status of Force Agreement with Seoul to permanently station Canadian land, air, and sea personnel, equipment, and assets in South Korea. If agreed upon, Ottawa and Seoul would be better positioned to hold frank discussions on items like how CAF can deploy military platforms and future assets, like the River-class destroyer and the F-35 fighter jet, to the peninsula for future drills and active deployments — all of which can align Canada’s military capabilities and force posture with regional allies. Following this, Ottawa should have also pursued a Memorandum of Understanding for co-manning lacking military domain areas belonging to South Korea. With shortages caused by downsizing in the Republic of Korea Armed Forces, an agreement of this type would complement both militaries by deepening tactical synergy, enhancing force interoperability, and guaranteeing the operationality of collective sea, air, and land domains. If Canada were to undertake these efforts to the Korean peninsula, Ottawa would be better suited to demonstrate its resolve to further deepen its military presence in the Indo-Pacific while also offering CAF a detailed assessment of military domains needed to be a more reliable and trustworthy defense partner. RELATED: Don’t miss the boat — Canada and AUKUS should be partners Given their vibrant democratic societies, a shared defense interests for a rules-based order and a historical military relationship that dates back to the Korean War, Canada and South Korea are logical partners. More importantly, they both are impacted by the immediate threat that arises from North Korea. Despite a carefully crafted ceasefire in place since 1953, the armistice on the Korean peninsula is not guaranteed to last. Should the ceasefire unravel, Canada will be obliged to supply stationed military personnel with needed equipment, armaments, and additional military forces to help defend South Korea and allied forces. Since coming to power, Kim Jong Un has exacerbated Pyongyang’s longstanding ideology of confronting its enemies — South Korea, the US, and Japan. Given Ottawa’s strong bilateral relations with all three nations, North Korea has described Canada as a 'bat-blind US follower.' With Pyongyang’s growing capabilities in nuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles and first-strike policy, this characterization should not be dismissed and should serve as a reminder for Canadians of the military threats abroad. Canada wants to show it has a major role in the Indo-Pacific, and South Korea would clearly welcome such an increased presence. Ottawa should take advantage and move to increase its defense capabilities deployed in the region while that is a choice and not a necessity driven by conflict.

‘Not Enough’: US Coast Guard’s new ops posture statement raises alarm on need for more money	The Coast Guard icebreaker Polar Sea works the ice channel near McMurdo, Antarctica. (USCG photo by Rob Rothway) WASHINGTON — Faced with an increasing number of missions, personnel and materiel readiness shortfalls, and 'finite resources,' the US Coast Guard today published its first 'Operational Posture' document [PDF], which a senior officer said is intended to convey to lawmakers and the public how stretched his service has become. 'What we're finding is, as we are operating our current fleet to accomplish missions [and] &#8230; recapitalizing to make sure that we have readiness in the future to do our missions, we quite simply do not have enough funding to do all of that at the same time,' Vice Adm. Peter Gautier, the service's deputy commandant for operations, told an audience today during an event at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. The new 11-page document largely serves as a list of the various missions the service is tasked with — ranging from marine safety to cybersecurity — and the regions around the world the service operates in. Although Gautier explicitly said the statement is not 'a pitch for money,' he also made it clear the USCG cannot continue on its current trajectory indefinitely without a budgetary boost — ideally to the tune of $6 billion annually. 'We only have funding to do maintenance on roughly half of what we need to do on the maintenance inventory to keep our cutters functional,' he said. 'We have small boats that are aging out and &#8230; our aircraft fleet is getting old. Spare parts are no longer manufactured for some of these types [of aircraft].' 'We really, really do struggle, and our path is going to be really challenged unless we get the kind of budget support that we need to keep ourselves on a sustainable track,' he continued. Earlier this year, the Coast Guard's ship maintenance woes caught up with the service at an inconvenient and coincidental time. As Breaking Defense reported, while the leaders of the United States, Canada and Finland were preparing to meet in Washington, DC, to sign the new ICE Pact agreement, the USCG's icebreakers were both sidelined from heading north to patrol Arctic waters — one of the service's key missions. RELATED: ICE Pact: Why the US had to recruit help in race with Russia, China for Arctic icebreakers When asked about the message the Coast Guard wants lawmakers to take away from the new operational statement, Gautier emphasized that the maritime environment is 'changing rapidly.' 'That’s just increasing the demand for Coast Guard services exponentially. We have the right people and the right workforce and the right missions and authorities to do wonderful things, but we need the support of our stakeholders in Congress in order to overcome the challenges that we have in sustaining readiness of our current capabilities, while we build the readiness of the future,' he said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/not-enough-us-coast-guards-new-ops-posture-statement-raises-alarm-on-need-for-more-money/	2024-10-25T09:00:57-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/08/1071546-e1729870102948.jpg
Embraer facing production ‘gap’ at Florida-based A-29 facility	An A-29 Super Tucano from Moody Air Force Base, Ga., stops for crew rest and refueling July 17, 2015, at Little Rock Air Force Base, Ark. (U.S. Air Force photo by Senior Airman Stephanie Serrano) WASHINGTON — Brazil’s Embraer is hunting for new A-29 Super Tucano orders to keep its American final assembly line humming, with 2025 seen as a critical year to parry back a production gap, its defense CEO told Breaking Defense. Embraer stood up an A-29 final assembly line in Jacksonville, Fla., in 2013 to produce the turboprop plane for the US military and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers, most prominently for Afghan air force pilots trained by US troops. But with US involvement in Afghanistan at an end, production at the facility has slowed to its 'minimal pace,' said Bosco da Costa Jr. in a recent interview. 'We are running the facility without big orders coming from FMS,' da Costa told Breaking Defense. 'We are facing a gap of production there. We are still fighting for some orders coming from FMS case[s] and even — why not — from the US government.' The Jacksonville factory is tooled to produce about 24 Super Tucanos per year, da Costa said, but the company currently only has four A-29s in various stages of production. (A Embraer spokesperson said those planes are 'allocated to current and near-term customers,' but declined to name what countries had ordered them.) Jacksonville could face an uphill battle for orders due to its unique setup. Most orders for the Embraer plane, also known as the EMB 314 Super Tucano, run through the company’s Brazil-based production plant. But the A-29 variant produced in the United States is assembled by Embraer in Florida, before US prime contractor Sierra Nevada Corp. outfits the baseline aircraft with US-specific mission systems and communications gear in Colorado. That production line caters only to US customers or Foreign Military Sales brokered by the Pentagon, a much slimmer portion of the Super Tucano customer base. That means that while Embraer has garnered new Super Tucano orders this year from countries such as Paraguay and Uruguay, those contracts cannot be used to pad out a lapse of orders for Jacksonville. 'I think we have 2025 as a year to fix it, trying to find another possibility regarding orders,' da Costa said. Otherwise, the company will be forced to reevaluate 'everything around Jacksonville.' 'The option is to find orders,' he added. 'That's the only option.' A spokesperson for Sierra Nevada Corp. deferred questions on the Jacksonville plant to Embraer. 'SNC is a proud partner with Embraer providing A-29s and subsequent logistical support worldwide,' the spokesperson said. 'SNC is pursuing multiple campaigns with Embraer, and our companies are well-positioned for a number of opportunities with international customers to provide mission-focused and agile A-29 solutions.' Currently, Embraer sees the US military as a potential customer, with da Costa pointing specifically to the Air Force. In the late 2010s, the Air Force explored buying light attack aircraft that it could operate in the Middle East as a low-cost alternative to more expensive fighter jets. Although the service bought a handful of A-29s and AT-6 turboprop planes for test purposes, it ultimately scrapped plans to move forward with a full program of record in 2019. Earlier this month, three of the A-29s purchased as part of that evaluation effort were transferred to Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., where they will be used as a test platform for sensors and weapons, the Air Force said in a news release. 'We still believe that this platform could serve … [the] US Air Force, and we are fighting to keep this facility. But again, we are facing problems without orders and without demand,' da Costa said. Embraer did not deliver any Super Tucanos in 2023, but built about a dozen planes that year — including four in Jacksonville — to be delivered to customers once contracts were signed, Aviation Week reported in February. (Embraer clarified that the four Jacksonville planes mentioned in that report are the ones currently on the production line.) The company expects to book another two orders for A-29s this year, but da Costa said that both orders are expected to be produced in Brazil.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/embraer-facing-production-gap-at-florida-based-a-29-facility/	2024-10-25T07:58:57-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/2073037-scaled-e1729792787763.jpg
Aussie, US test wide range of naval drone tech, C2 during AUKUS-centric exercise	The Australian-built Ocius BlueBottle Unscrewed Surface Vehicle (UCL) (D. Burkey of ProUAV for the ADF) SYDNEY — Australia and the United States today wrapped up the 'signature' stage of a three-week naval drone exercise at Australia's Jarvis Bay, part of an effort to show how the AUKUS partners can jointly operate unmanned vessels in the Pacific. The overarching exercise, dubbed Maritime Big Play (MBP), fall under the agreement's Pillar II, which covers the rapid development, testing and deployment of new technologies in the realms of autonomy, hypersonics, cyber, electronic warfare and underwater systems. MBP 'allows AUKUS partners to practice fielding and maintaining thousands of uncrewed systems, gaining valuable experience operating in coalitions to solve realistic operational problems such as improving undersea situational awareness,' Madeline Mortelmans, acting assistant Defense Secretary for strategy, plans and capabilities, said today in a statement released by the US embassy here, after observing the exercises. 'This year,' Mortelmans said, 'we're advancing our undersea warfare capabilities by expanding our ability to launch and recover uncrewed underwater systems from torpedo tubes on current classes of British and US submarines, that will increase the range and capability of our undersea forces.' Exercise Autonomous Warrior, which finished today, was described by Mortelmans as 'the signature MBP event in 2024.' RELATED: Australian defense minister Richard Marles on AUKUS, China and industry concerns The technologies contributed by the US included software-defined acoustic modems, autonomous underwater and surface vessels, and low-cost unmanned surface vehicles. The tests, according to a statement from the US Embassy, also featured a low-cost balloon with a gondola that 'supports operations in the upper stratosphere with minimum manpower or logistics requirements,' and high-altitude T-200 balloons for communications when other sources are jammed. At the higher level of command and control, the allies tested several systems to eventually build what the statement called 'an AUKUS-wide Common Control System, fusing best elements of the three countries’ existing systems.' They included a software-defined network architecture with another excellent acronym, the Multi-Domain Uncrewed Secure Integrated Communications (MUSIC). It is designed 'to enable seamless communication and coordination across diverse unmanned systems and operational environments,' according to the statement. The second system, the Common Control System (CCS), meant to help pave the way to an AUKUS-wide system, using a now almost mandatory open architecture, to provide drones with hardware and software that works across different systems. Working together like this, with many different systems from multiple countries has its benefits. 'This collaborative approach enables us to reduce acquisition, maintenance, and training cost by creating economies of scale,' Heidi Shyu, undersecretary of Defense for research and engineering, said in the statement. Of course, the home country brought its own set of technologies to the test. Among the promising Australian systems used: a long-range loitering strike glider by Innovaero called OWL-B; an uncrewed surface vessel by Ocius Technology known as the Bluebottle; Anduril's extra-large autonomous underwater vehicle the Ghost Shark; and a large underwater drone by C2 Robotics known as Speartooth. 'This is another example of the ingenuity of Australia’s companies and innovators to partner with Defence to and reflects the Albanese Government’s commitment to investing in a defense future made in Australia,' Pat Conroy, minister for defense industry, said in a statement released today. 'The Maritime Big Play stands to advance the development of cutting-edge maritime capabilities that provide strategic advantage and strengthen collaboration between AUKUS partners.' While the United Kingdom, the third partner in AUKUS, has taken part in a previous portion of MBP, it's unclear what technology they brought for Autonomous Warrior. Notably, during that part of MBP, Japanese observers were there to look into 'improving interoperability with Japan’s maritime autonomous systems as an initial area of cooperation under AUKUS Pillar Two,' a British Navy statement from Oct. 4 reads.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/aussie-us-test-wide-range-of-naval-drone-tech-c2-during-aukus-centric-exercise/	2024-10-25T07:07:38-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/DSC09996.JPG-e1729858077916.jpg
Pentagon info officer’s top priority: Upgrading cryptography ahead of quantum-enabled hackers	Department of Defense CIO for Cybersecurity David McKeown records a message for the RSA conference, the Pentagon, Washington, D.C., April 28, 2021. (DoD photo by Lisa Ferdinando) 'We've got to think ahead as to what the adversary might be working on and develop algorithms that are there in time to meet the adversary's ability to crack those [older] algorithms,' David McKeown, who is dual hatted as the Pentagon’s Deputy CIO and the DoD’s senior information security officer, said during a keynote speech at the AFCEA Tech Summit Thursday. He said a vital part of protecting Pentagon data is building cryptographic systems that are resistant to quantum computing in what's called Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC). Quantum computing techniques are so advanced that they could, in theory, crack just about any existing encryption. Most encryption for digital communication uses algorithms based on a security framework known as RSA, invented in 1977, that allows two parties to communicate securely without having to exchange secret keys beforehand. Scientists have theorized that quantum computing, when fully developed, could use an exponential jump in calculation speed and complexity to crack the code. Creating specific quantum-hardened algorithms falls under the National Security Agency’s list of responsibilities since they handle cryptographic modernization as a whole, based on standards under development by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. McKeown acknowledged that quantum computers are still probably '10 years away,' but, he said, the time is now for the Pentagon to do a sprawling review to determine where it might be vulnerable. 'There's going to be a year where [quantum computing] is not going to be 10 years away, and it's going to be nine years, and eight years and seven so we gotta work on this together,' McKeown said. 'We need to look through our whole inventory and look at all the encryption that we're using on everything, and then figure out what needs to be replaced there, and then get to work with the vendors and our community to get the upgrades and field the upgrades so that that new quantum-resistant cryptography is employed throughout the department,' he later added. Even after PQC algorithms come online, the Pentagon won't be able to rest, McKeown said, as they'll need to be updated constantly to fend off novel attacks. 'In some cases, we may have to use the old algorithms unencrypted or re-encrypted with the new stuff that we just came out with. So you see it's an extremely long timeline. You can't put your head in the sand thinking that our algorithms are going to be good forever, and so we constantly have to be working at this,' he said. 'This is a gigantic life cycle of encryption algorithms and encryption of hardware that has to be maintained.' After modernizing cryptographic algorithms, McKeown said the next biggest priority for the department is to implement zero trust, a security system in which a user's activity on a network is regularly checked, rather than letting anyone who gets through a login/password screen run free. McKeown said that the Pentagon is still on track to move to a zero trust-based cybersecurity model by 2027. 't doesn't stop all attacks, and hopefully nobody thinks that that is the case, but what it does do is it's limits the success of the attacker, and allows us to detect the attacks quicker and respond quicker and eradicate the bad guys from our network,' he said. 'Lots of times before we had zero trust, the adversary could live on our network for long periods of time. I had one instance of 18 months before we discovered that [the adversaries] were on our network.' The third priority for the CIO is to enhance the cybersecurity of the defense industrial base, McKeown said. This mainly includes enforcing the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) 2.0, which sets new standards for contractors who handle controlled unclassified information. (The final rule for CMMC 2.0 came out earlier this month.) The number three priority also includes making production pipelines more 'cyber resilient and survivable,' McKeown added, citing the Colonial Pipeline attack that occurred over three years ago. 'You remember the Colonial Pipeline, when it got shut down, no gas on the East Coast for like a week. You know, we didn't want that to happen with some of these key weapon system manufacturing,' McKeown said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/pentagon-info-officers-top-priority-upgrading-cryptography-ahead-of-quantum-enabled-hackers/	2024-10-25T05:12:08-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/McKeown_CIO-scaled.jpg
Industry partners announce PEGASUS first flight, tout additional buy	A modified Bombardier 6000 affiliated with the Persistent German Airborne Surveillance System (PEGASUS) program, makes its maiden flight (Bombardier) BELFAST — A trio of industry partners involved in the $1 billion Persistent German Airborne Surveillance System (PEGASUS) program have revealed the first of three modified Bombardier Global 6000 business jets made its maiden flight at the manufacturer’s Flight Test Centre (BFTC) in Wichita, Kan., in the second half of September. Bombardier, along with German collaborators Lufthansa Technik Defense and Hensoldt announced the first flight milestone on Wednesday, noting that the aircraft was not outfitted with the signals intelligence (SIGINT) mission system central to the platform’s airborne surveillance role. Hensoldt’s Kalaetron Integral package has been selected for integration, but in line with plans to first concentrate on an aircraft modification phase and first flight, the SIGINT system will only be fitted by Lufthansa at the company’s special-mission center in Hamburg, Germany, next year. 'Since then [the first flight in September] we've been flying the aircraft on a regular basis,' Steve Patrick, vice president of Bombardier Defense told reporters on Wednesday. 'The aircraft is performing very well. &#8230; the test pilots confirmed that the aircraft handles as expected.' He noted that all three of the PEGASUS affiliated aircraft will be transferred to Hamburg 'over the coming months,' ahead of mission systems integration and a military certification process. It will likely take 'one to two years' for the airframes to be outfitted with the Kalaetron system, according to Jürgen Halder, vice president of airborne SIGINT at Hensoldt. He added that additional flight tests with 'entire systems' will follow, before deliveries to the German Air Force take place. 'Lufthansa Technik has completed its design activities for the integration of the mission system, the additional civil and military avionics systems as well as the aircraft cabin,' said Bombardier in a Wednesday statement. 'The production process of interior parts has also already started in order to ensure the components’ readiness for immediate installation when the aircraft arrives in Hamburg.' Berlin awarded Hensoldt a contract for PEGASUS development, production and SIGINT integration, including the three Global 6000 airframes in 2021, but the electronics supplier is confident that the German Air Force will agree to a follow-on buy, based on growing geopolitical instability. 'If you look at the current geopolitical situation … even though any aircraft can persistently monitor a vast area there are unfortunately too many hotspots globally,' to cover, said Halder. 'We expect additional rise [an additional order] will be coming up eventually. Discussions are starting in a very early phase, but it's apparent that three aircraft is not sufficient.' Germany opted for PEGASUS to end an airborne SIGINT capability gap that emerged when a fleet of five Breguet BR1150 Atlantic aircraft were retired in 2010. After initially settling on a plan to acquire Northrop Grumman MQ-4C Triton SIGINT-configured, high altitude long-endurance (HALE) unmanned aerial systems valued at $2.5 billion, Berlin scrapped it, amid concern over spiraling costs and safety standards for flight in European airspace. Instead, the Global 6000 crewed aircraft was decided on.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/industry-partners-announce-pegasus-first-flight-tout-additional-buy/	2024-10-24T13:12:39-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/Bombardier.jpg
Fighting underground: The US military must learn from Israel’s experience	A photograph, taken during an embed with the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) and reviewed by the IDF censorship office prior to publication, shows Israeli soldiers guarding the entrance of a tunnel. (Photo by Ilia Yefimovich/picture alliance via Getty Images) As Israel conducts limited ground operations against Hezbollah in Lebanon, it already has encountered tunnels similar to the dangerous unseen combat it has fought for a year beneath Gaza. Not for the first time, Israel is engaged in a new kind of fight that the United States will face in its future conflicts. Just as the United States has learned from Israel’s wars in the past, the risks of tunnel warfare and how Israel is overcoming those challenges through coordinated troop maneuvers and technological adaptations should drive a shift in the US approach to subterranean combat. The United States has a long history of learning from Israel’s wars. The 1973 Yom Kippur War had such a transformational effect that the US Army made the largest change to its doctrine since World War II. The Egyptian and Syrian armies’ use of new Soviet weapons and tactics that were more lethal and rapid, the ability of anti-tank weapons to neutralize more tanks in the first six days of the war than the United States had deployed throughout all of Europe, and tank battles occurring at much greater ranges than ever before shocked American defense planners preparing for a Soviet invasion of Western Europe. After the war, the US Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) sent a team to Israel, whose findings led to the adoption of the AirLand Battle doctrine that would guide decades of thinking about winning a conventional war in Europe through close coordination between ground forces and aircraft. Similarly, the wars under Gaza and southern Lebanon have shown how the subterranean environment poses challenges that US troops must be better prepared to fight. Tunnels will be a growing problem for Western-style militaries because they provide physical protection and create challenges for differentiating and isolating fighters from civilians. Recognizing those advantages, Hamas spent nearly two decades fortifying Gaza with more than 350 miles of interconnected underground tunnels. They intentionally designed the urban landscape to enable attacks, protect Hamas fighters, and thwart IDF advances. Hezbollah built similar underground fortifications in southern Lebanon but over a much larger expanse of land. Indeed, searching Hamas’s vast, subterranean labyrinth for terrorist fighters and hostages has been among the most difficult aspects of the war and has already proved a time-consuming process in southern Lebanon. Fighters have appeared suddenly from tunnels to quickly target Israeli soldiers before escaping through hidden passageways. Deep and fortified tunnels also held command-and-control centers, weapons production facilities, storage depots, and hostages. Hamas and Hezbollah also constructed tunnels for strategic purposes as well. Building tunnels inside and below residential buildings, hospitals, schools, mosques, and United Nations facilities leveraged civilians as human shields to discourage Israeli operations. Despite Israel’s pledge to use precise military efforts to minimize collateral damage by distinguishing between terrorists and civilians, hiding fighters beneath civilian sites enabled the willful blindness about who Israeli strikes had targeted that fueled Hamas’s disinformation campaign, contributing to international pressure for Israel to stop the war prematurely. Early in the war, Israel adapted after it became evident that its initial plan to collapse the tunnels with airstrikes or destroy the entry points would not be widely effective because of how expansive and deep the tunnels were and because such operations could be dangerous to the hostages. Instead, Israel utilized cameras mounted on drones or dogs and AI technology to detect threats so that Israeli forces could analyze the best means of responding. In Gaza, the IDF quickly transformed its approach to subterranean operations while in contact with enemy fighters. A key adaptation was its implementation of new tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) for its troops to maneuver underground simultaneously with those moving above ground to use explosives that either completely destroy or render tunnels impassable. After isolating the area around a tunnel entrance and establishing a secure perimeter to ensure there were no hidden entrances that terrorists could use to mount a surprise attack or escape, the IDF then sent in ground troops to defeat any threats, including with a liquid emulsion explosive that avoided the risk of inadvertent detonation on the surface. Building on the decades of US experience in subterranean warfare in places like Afghanistan, Iraq, and Vietnam, examining Israel’s underground warfare could help the US and partner militaries prepare for operations against adversaries like Iran, Russia, China, and North Korea, who are growing increasingly close and learning from one another. As a senior Pentagon special operations official put it, it would be 'foolish' to assume future fights won’t consist of a similar operational environment. Borrowing from the IDF’s efforts to coordinate ground troops above and below ground as well as air assets, US doctrine and TTPs for subterranean warfare should emphasize the necessity to detect, analyze, differentiate, isolate, and defeat threats. With the US military also seeking to transform while in contact with an enemy, just as the IDF continues to do, the US Defense Department should emphasize subterranean combat during collaborations with Israel about the future of warfare, expand the US-Israel anti-tunnel cooperation program to fund technologies that explore or collapse tunnels, and conduct regular subterranean warfare exercises with Israeli forces. Joint drills that focus on maneuvering troops simultaneously above and below ground and utilizing emergent technologies would have immense value to US missions from counterterrorism to hostage rescue. Fighting underground is challenging in any scenario. Yet, Israel’s successful adaptations have once again provided a transformational model for the US military to study.

Clear guardrails mean faster progress on AI: Biden signs sweeping guidance for DoD & IC	White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan speaks during the annual meeting of the Arms Control Association at the National Press Club on June 2, 2023 in Washington, DC.(Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images) WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden has just signed a sweeping National Security Memorandum (NSM) to guide military and intelligence use of artificial intelligence, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said this morning. The new plan’s guiding principle is a big bet that adhering to American values — like accountability, legality and individual rights — won't slow the US down in the AI arms race with China, but help move it faster. The memorandum will also boost cybersecurity defenses against Chinese theft of American AI secrets and strengthen government collaboration with the private sector and foreign allies, Sullivan and other officials said. And it will be accompanied by an extensive 'Risk Management Framework' to help officials distinguish proper from improper use of AI. The essence of the administration's argument is that government bureaucrats will move slowly and cautiously to adopt AI as long as they’re uncertain about what’s permissible and what’s prohibited, what’s safe to try and what’s too dangerous. Only by establishing comprehensive guidelines, rigorous testing and strict prohibitions on unacceptable uses of AI — notably, that humans, not algorithms, must make the decision whether or not to launch nuclear weapons — can the US government empower its agencies to experiment boldly and advance rapidly within those clearly defined guardrails. RELATED: ‘AI gold mine’: NGA aims to exploit archive of satellite images, expert analysis 'It's a little bit counterintuitive, [but] ensuring security and trustworthiness will actually enable us to move faster, not slow us down,' Sullivan told an audience of military officers and civil servants at National Defense University. 'Uncertainty breeds caution. When we lack confidence about safety and reliability, we're slower to experiment, to adopt, to use new capabilities — and we just can't afford to do that in today's strategic landscape.' 'Preventing misuse and ensuring high standards of accountability will not slow us down,' Sullivan emphasized, comparing it to how trains were able to travel faster once government regulation ensured the rails would be safe. 'It will actually do the opposite.' Senior administration officials stressed this apparent paradox in a briefing for reporters Wednesday evening. 'We are directing that the agencies gain access to the most powerful AI systems and put them to use, which often involves substantial efforts on procurement,' one of the briefers said. But in that context, they continued, 'one of the paradoxical outcomes we’ve seen is, with a lack of policy clarity and a lack of legal clarity about what can and cannot be done, we are likely to see less experimentation and less adoption than with a clear path for use — which is what the NSM and the framework tries to provide.' The NSM includes 'very specific requirements' for agencies to conduct 'classified testing' of AI systems, while the accompanying Risk Management Framework lists specific applications of AI that either warrant special caution ('high impact' cases) or are outright prohibited. RELATED: Empowered edge versus the centralization trap: Who will wield AI better, the US or China? The prohibitions are meant to protect against a wide array of abuses, from a War Games or Skynet-style nightmare scenario where a computer orders the launch of nuclear weapons, to Chinese-style employment of AI to repress dissidents and minorities. 'There are clear prohibitions on use of AI with intent or purpose, for instance, to unlawfully suppress or burden the right to free speech or the right to legal counsel,' one official said. 'There’s also prohibited use cases around, for instance, removing a human in the loop for actions critical to informing and executing decisions by the President to initiate or terminate nuclear weapons employment.' 'We actually view these restrictions … as being important in clarifying what the agencies can and cannot do,' one briefer explained. 'That will actually accelerate experimentation and adoption.' All this guidance builds on prior policy, officials emphasized, citing the Pentagon's extensive revisions of DoD Directive 3000.09 on autonomous weapons and the State Department-led Political Declaration on Responsible Military Use of Artificial Intelligence and Autonomy, now signed by over 50 nations. 'We have built, over the course of the last couple of years, I think, a pretty good set of markers, right and left, rules of the road, that try to get at these questions of fundamental values,' Sullivan said at NDU. 'Then what the National Security Memorandum tries to do is say, ‘here's our guidelines now, here's how they have to be implemented with special care in the national security space.’' Biden took a personal interest in ensuring the memorandum would have real impact, not just lofty aspirations, Sullivan emphasized. 'We had multiple meetings with him about this, because he didn't just take it and say, ‘Okay, fine,'' Sullivan said. 'We went back and forth on this over the course of two or three months, [and] this was one of his questions: &#8216;How do we really make sure on a rigorous basis, not just that we've set forth standards that make sense to us, but how can we have confidence through thick and through thin, through crisis and contingency, they're actually going to be enforced?' 'That is a big part of what this NSM is trying to achieve,' Sullivan said. One key point the officials made was that the guidelines need to be not only clear, but flexible, able to adapt rapidly to new problems discovered in testing, new technologies from the private sector, or new challenges from China. RELATED: New Pentagon AI &amp; data chief plans big initiatives for fall, from back office to battlefield (EXCLUSIVE) The detailed Risk Management Framework in particular will 'have to be continuously updated,' one official emphasized, so it's been explicitly designed to allow rapid changes as experiments and pilot projects discover new technical complications or ethical dilemmas. Adaptability is even more important with artificial intelligence than it was in past technological revolutions like the nuclear weapons or the Internet, Sullivan said, because AI is moving much faster and its future is more uncertain. 'A specific AI application that we're trying to solve for today &#8230; could look fundamentally different six weeks from now, let alone six months,' he argued. 'The speed of change in this area is breathtaking.' 'The good news is that &#8230; America is continuing to build a meaningful AI advantage,' Sullivan said. 'But here's the bad news: Our lead is not guaranteed, it is not preordained, and it is not enough to just guard the progress we've made, as historic as it's been. We have to be faster in deploying AI in our national security enterprise than America's rivals are in theirs.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/clear-guardrails-mean-faster-progress-on-ai-biden-signs-sweeping-guidance-for-dod-ic/	2024-10-24T11:36:01-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/06/230602_sullivan_arms_control_GettyImages-1258375495-scaled-e1685724331637.jpg
SDA creates new contractor pool to bid for future demos, tags 19 initial vendors	Space Development Agency chief Derek Tournear (R) addresses the audience at the Space Foundation's 2024 Space Symposium. (Space Foundation) WASHINGTON — The Space Development Agency (SDA) has selected 19 companies to join its newly created vendor pool, called Hybrid Acquisition for Proliferated Low Earth Orbit, or HALO, designed to allow rapid contracting for demonstrations and experiments to support its fledgling low Earth orbit (LEO) constellations. 'HALO is an Other Transactions (OT) agreement modeled after an indefinite-delivery-indefinite quantity (IDIQ) approach, where each member receives an initial agreement valued at $20,000 to defray administrative and travel expenses and is then eligible to compete for future HALO demonstration prototype orders,' SDA explained in an announcement on Wednesday. 'Future prototype orders under HALO will focus on rapid end-to-end mission demonstrations with launch of two identical satellites 12-18 months after award,' the agency release added. SDA Director Derek Tourner on Wednesday told the SatNews MILSAT 2024 symposium that HALO is a 'new idea' and will serve as an 'acquisition contracting vehicle we're using for our developmental and experimentation systems.' Tournear explained that each one of SDA's 'tranches' — the moniker the agency has given to each new configuration of its data transport and missile warning/tracking satellites — 'has a developmental and experimentation system that goes alongside of it. On Tranche 1, it was T1DES, Tranche 1 Developmental Experimentation [System].' The first planned prototype orders using HALO will be for the Tranche 2 Demonstration and Experimentation System (T2DES) projects, 'which will reduce risk and demonstrate feasibility of proliferation for future tactical data links and optical communication missions,' the agency's announcement elaborated. Pool members selected include: While these are the initial firms given the green light to compete under HALO, Tournear said that there will be future chances for companies that didn't make the first cut. 'Don't worry, we're going to continue to onramp people in another year and make sure we have a vendor pool that we can choose from,' he said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/sda-creates-new-contractor-pool-to-bid-for-future-demos-tags-19-initial-vendors/	2024-10-24T11:03:16-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/04/240411_space_symposium_tournear_space_foundation-e1712859283861.jpg
Space Force grants Northrop Grumman $1.8B to build missile warning birds for polar orbit	As part of the Next Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared System (Next-Gen OPIR), two polar satellites will provide coverage over the northern hemisphere. (Graphic: Northrop Grumman) WASHINGTON — The Space Force's multibillion-dollar Next Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared (Next-Gen OPIR) missile warning constellation has taken another step forward with Northrop Grumman getting the green light, and almost $1.8 billion, to finalize development of its two polar orbiting satellites. Under the modification to the company's original 2020 contract, the company will 'complete the effort through satellite build, launch, and transition to operations,' the Space Systems Command (SSC) said in an announcement Wednesday. The modification brings the total cumulative face value of the contract to nearly $4.2 billion, it added. The two Northrop Grumman satellites, which will take highly elliptical orbits over the Earth's poles, are expected to be launched in 2028. They are one half of the overarching Next-Gen OPIR constellation, which also includes two satellites to be stationed in geosynchronous Earth orbit (GEO) being built by Lockheed Martin. Those satellites are scheduled to be launched in late 2025, although there is some concern that date may slip. Together, the satellites will replace the current missile warning constellation, the Space-Based Infrared System (SBIRS). All six dedicated SBIRS satellites in GEO are operational as of last March. There also are two SBIRS sensors operating as hosted payloads on classified satellites in highly elliptical orbits over the poles. The total cost for the new satellites is estimated at $14 billion, making Next-Gen OPIR the Space Force's most expensive program. The effort also includes developed of a new ground system, called Future Operationally Resilient Ground Evolution (FORGE), to provide day-to-day operations and command and control (C2) for the four Next-Gen OPIR satellites, and eventually of all the service’s missile warning constellations. FORGE, led by RTX (formerly Raytheon), long has been suffering from developmental problems, with the Government Accountability Office last June warning key pieces of the multi-faceted ground system would not be ready in time to provide C2 for the first of the Next-Gen OPIR satellites. In April, SSC announced [PDF] that a first cybersecurity software package for FORGE system was put into operations at the Overhead Persistent Infrared Battlespace Awareness Center at Buckley SFB in Colorado. 'We're going to deliver another instantiation later this this year, and anticipate operational acceptance next year of FORGE,' Lt. Gen. Philip Garrant, SSC commander, told Breaking Defense in an exclusive interview in September.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/space-force-grants-northrop-grumman-1-8b-to-build-missile-warning-birds-for-polar-orbit/	2024-10-24T08:53:09-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/eprocs_NGP_SVs.0011-scaled-e1684950221702.jpg
SSC picks Millennium to replace RTX for missile warning satellites	Millennium Space Systems is now developing all 12 satellites for the initial configuration of the Space Force's missile warning/tracking constellation in medium Earth orbit. (Courtesy Image: Millennium Space Systems) WASHINGTON — Space Force Space Systems Command (SSC) today announced a $386 million award to Millennium Space Systems for six satellites to fill out the baseline configuration of its future missile warning constellation in medium Earth orbit (MEO) — in effect replacing an earlier contract with RTX that was terminated in June. The six satellites will be launched to a different orbital plane than the first six birds in SSC's planned Epoch 1, also being built by Millennium under a contract granted last November. 'This action successfully completes the Epoch 1 program’s intent to deliver two planes of satellites for a total of 12 space vehicles.' SSC said in a press release today. The delivery of the first Epoch 1 birds is planned for the end of fiscal 2026, the release added, 'and the second plane is expected in early FY28.' Each spiral of satellites under the Resilient Missile Warning/Missile Tracking — Medium Earth Orbit program are called Epochs, and will be delivered every two to three years. Epoch 1 in essence transitions the SSC’s 2021 study of MEO-based missile warning capabilities, first reported by Breaking Defense, to a program of record with Raytheon Intelligence &amp; Space, now RTX, and Boeing’s Millennium Space Systems contracted in January 2023 to build MEO MW/MT Epoch 1 prototypes. But when RTX's effort fell behind schedule and over budget, SSC terminated the contract. 'When one of our two industry partners struggled with delivering on cost and schedule, we were able to quickly pivot and still maintain program progress by turning to the performing vendor,' Col. Rob Davis, program executive officer for SSC's Space Sensing Directorate, told the Space Industry Days conference in Los Angeles today. Speaking to reporters following his presentation, Davis explained that while RTX had been on contract for three satellites, those were larger birds in a higher altitude and a different design than those now being developed by Millennium. The capability being provided, however, 'so everything balances out there,' he said. Epoch 2, the next configuration of MEO birds, is expected to be up and running circa 2029, and will provide 'initial warfighting capability,' the SSC press release explains. The command released a Request for Prototype Proposal for Epoch 2 in August.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/ssc-picks-millennium-to-replace-rtx-for-missile-warning-satellites/	2024-10-24T07:15:22-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/image002.jpg
US Army takes on most effective counter-drone system yet: Red tape	US Army National Guard soldiers with 1st and 4th Battalion, 118th Infantry Battalion, 218th Maneuver Enhancement Brigade, South Carolina Army National Guard, conduct training on the Black Hornet Nano UAS on Aug. 10, 2024. (US Army/Staff Sgt. Brian Calhoun) WASHINGTON — The US Army is looking to reclassify some of its small drones because of a concerning flaw that hinders their effectiveness in the field: soldiers who don't want to fly them for fear of the red tape that comes with losing one. Currently, every time a US Army soldier loses or breaks a drone — regardless of its size or price tag — they are saddled with reporting paperwork, a mandatory investigation and possibly a loss of pay. 'If you lose [a drone] or crash it or break it, you have to do this full-on investigation, an investigating officer has to be appointed,' Col. Nick Ryan, director of the Army Capability Manager for Unmanned Aircraft Systems, told Breaking Defense in a recent interview. 'They do a full investigation [and] a report, to determine if the soldier is liable, and if the soldier … has to get docked pay.' That's because the service deems every unmanned aerial system (UAS) 'nonexpendable property,' meaning each and every one must be strictly accounted for and tracked. If a soldier does lose a drone, even in combat, it triggers a Financial Liability Investigation of Property Loss, or FLIPL. It's such a hassle that some soldiers are hesitant to fly smaller drones that are meant to give units an edge in contested environments, fearing the paperwork that an errant tree branch or comms breakdown would spawn. 'It's an Army supply policy problem,' he told Breaking Defense during a recent interview. Ryan said one drone was known as 'the flying FLIPL and they never wanted to fly it.' That soldier hesitancy is a challenge, especially at a time when the service replaces the RQ-11 Raven and RQ-7B Shadow with more drones at every echelon to include: To make sure soldiers actually want to use some of those smaller drones or aren’t afraid to fly and train with them, Army Chief of Staff Gen Randy Geroge is asking for a policy change, Ryan explained. Although still in the works and likely two to three years away, the idea is to deem all drones weighing in at less than 55 pounds as expendable. If approved, when soldiers lose or break those Group 1 and 2 UAS, they could simply sign a 'memo' and get another one off the shelf. No investigation, no docked pay. 'Group 3 [drones], like the FTUAS, we're still trying to kind of figure out where that falls because it is a little bit more expensive and more exquisite,' Ryan said. 'Now something as big as a Gray Eagle, that definitely is something we want to come back or want to go find if we crash it.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/us-army-takes-on-most-effective-counter-drone-system-yet-red-tape/	2024-10-24T05:06:32-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/Black-Hornet-e1729713907710.jpg
New Space Force effort focused on ‘closing C2 kill chains’	Lt. Gen. Philip Garrant, commander, Space Force Space Systems Command (left). (US Space Force photo by Senior Airman Kadielle Shaw) WASHINGTON — The Space Force's primary acquisition command has established a new effort to build integrated command and control (C2) networks — that is, machine-to-machine capabilities to seamlessly feed data from multiple sensors through battle management systems that process data to 'shooters' — focused on four high priority, classified weapon systems, according to senior officials. Lt. Gen. Philip Garrant, head of Space Systems Command, said today that his primary focus over the next five years 'is on the C2 and closure of the kill chains to actually use the effectors,' based on priorities set by the head of US Space Command Gen. Stephen Whiting. The new initiative, he told the Space Industry Days conference in Los Angeles, is aimed to overcome current stovepipes and ensure that in a crisis or conflict, 'we can actually employ these effectors and have a kill chain that that closes and actually employ the kit that we're building.' In an exclusive interview with Breaking Defense in September, Garrant elaborated: 'We've got things in this space. We've got things on the ground. We have a spectrum of reversible and irreversible [weapon systems]. But we need to be able to command and control those.' The focus, he added, is on 'four specific weapon systems' that are classified, 'four specific capabilities that we want to ensure that our operators can use.' The 'Joint Enterprise Integrated Federated C2 For Space' effort is being managed by SSC's recently revamped and elevated Space System Integration Office, headed by Claire Leon. Garrant noted that Leon's office is working closely with Brig. Gen. Luke Cropsey, the integrating program executive officer for Air Force Command, Control, Communications and Battle Management, to ensure that the space C2 networks can connect with the larger Department of the Air Force Battle Network. The DAF Battle Network, created last year, is the latest overhaul of the Air Force's Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS). It is a framework for connecting sensors and shooters from the air all the way up to space — and represents the department's contribution to the Pentagon’s Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) initiative. Leon told the Space Industry Days conference today that the 'C2 integration activity' is 'a huge pivot' for SSC being led by her deputy Kris Acosta — and involves not just her shop, but also other Space Force and SPACECOM units, plus outside organizations including the Missile Defense Agency and the National Reconnaissance Office. She explained that the effort to 'put a laser focus on four different effects' was kickstarted by Whiting, who 'went to' Space Force Chief Gen. Chance Saltzman, Air Force Space Acquisition Czar Frank Calvelli, and Cropsey 'and said: &#8216;I need you to shift your focus and really look at four specific weapon systems and having them end-to-end, built, tested, ready to operate by 2026.' 'And so it's really all about being ready for contested space by 2026 and having the people, the processes, the tools, the doctrine, everything in place so that we can operate effectively,' she said. A chart presented Oct. 23 at the Space Industry Days conference in Los Angeles by Claire Leon to illustrate the byzantine space C2 universe of sensors, data lakes, battle management systems and organizational players that make creating fully integrated networks linking sensors to shooters difficult. For decades, the Air Force, and now the Space Force, has struggled to modernize and mesh together the myriad space C2 systems that range from individual satellite constellation ground systems to the computers and software that gather data from radars and telescopes keeping tabs on the heavens. According to a June 2023 report by the Government Accountability Office, the Defense Department between 2000 and 2022 spent $1.7 billion on various space C2 efforts — and that sum doesn't count up what was spent on on previous programs that date back to the 1990s. For example, SSC's previous incarnation in 2018 created Space Command and Control (Space C2) program to modernize, via incremental upgrades, outdated hardware and software used to track and control satellites. It was supposed to replace the ill-fated Joint Space Operations Center Mission System (JMS) that ran from 2009 to 2018, which in turn was aimed at replacing the 1980’s-era Space Defense Operations Center (SPADOC) computer system. Space C2 also was to add in threat assessment capabilities that can tell a commander the function of an adversary spacecraft and whether it is targeting a US satellite. Following a damning report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in 2019, Space C2 was restructured in fiscal 2022 — but GAO again in 2023 cited problems with the program, including unclear requirements and delays in planned upgrades. And a subsequent report by the Pentagon's Director of Operational Test &amp; Evaluation showed that Space C2's primary software updated needed to replace SPADOC had fallen at least two years behind schedule to late this year. In his interview with Breaking Defense, Garrant said that SSC is now aiming to finally switch off SPADOC late next year.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/new-space-force-effort-focused-on-closing-c2-kill-chains/	2024-10-23T14:26:46-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/8303146-1-scaled-e1716311389831.jpg
Department of the Air Force appoints Susan Davenport as new chief data and AI officer	Low poly brain or Artificial intelligence concept. Symbol of Wisdom point. Abstract vector image of a human Brine. Low Polygonal wireframe blue illustration on dark background. Lines and dots. (Getty images) WASHINGTON — The Department of the Air Force announced Tuesday that Susan Davenport will be the new chief data and artificial intelligence officer taking over for Chandra Donelson, who has been the DAF’s acting CDAO since April. Prior to Donelson, Eileen Vidrine held the position, and before that the post belonged to Gen. John Olson, DAF's first CDAO. 'Her expertise driving innovation and managing complex programs will be instrumental in shaping the future of Data and AI for the Air Force and the Space Force,' a LinkedIn post from the Department of the Air Force Chief Information Officer, said of Davenport's appointment. In her new post, Davenport will be responsible for developing and implementing strategies for analytics, digital transformation, enterprise data management and responsible and ethical artificial intelligence. She will also lead the DAF’s effort in becoming 'AI ready' by 2025 and 'AI-competitive' by 2027, per the DAF’s CDAO webpage. Davenport has over 30 years of experience working in the intelligence realm, including her most recent post as the Senior Advisor for Defense Innovation at the Secretary of the Air Force’s office and a few other roles within the Air Force and the National Reconnaissance Office. The DAF has made strides in implementing AI and was the first service to launch a generative AI tool, called the Non-classified Internet Protocol Generative Pre-training Transformer, or NIPRGPT. The tool was launched in June, and as of last month, over 80,000 airmen and guardians have used the system. The goal of NIPRGPT is to help the DAF learn how AI can advance access to information and determine if generative AI is necessary within the DAF.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/department-of-the-air-force-appoints-susan-davenport-as-new-chief-data-and-ai-officer/	2024-10-23T11:54:55-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/220524_AI_digital_brain_GettyImages-1331059443-scaled-e1698953895258.jpg
Boeing CEO says defense is ‘core’ to business, doesn’t preclude sell-off of ‘fringe’ assets	A T-7A Red Hawk trainer aircraft from the 416th Flight Test Squadron, takes off from St Louis Lambert International Airport (Boeing) WASHINGTON — Boeing’s defense business is 'core' to the company, its new CEO said today, in a sign that the embattled aerospace giant will not conduct a complete sell-off of its defense segment as executives consider an overhaul of the company. Kelly Ortberg, who took the chief executive position in August, said he is conducting an evaluation of Boeing’s portfolio with the intent of narrowing the company’s focus and improving execution. 'Clearly our core of commercial airplanes and defense systems are going to stay with the Boeing Company for the long run, but there's probably some things on the fringe there that we can be more efficient with, or that just distract us from our main goal here,' he said in an earnings call this morning. 'I think that we're better off being doing less and doing it better, than doing more and not doing it well,' he said, adding that the goal is for Boeing to understand what it sees as nonessential business by the end of the year. Analysts had speculated whether Boeing would sell off some or all of its defense unit, known as Boeing Defense Space and Security (BDS), as it looks to improve its balance sheet, contend with a quality and safety crisis in its commercial airplanes unit and stave off ongoing losses on defense programs. Last month, Boeing announced the departure of Ted Colbert, who had led the defense unit since 2022, with BDS Chief Operating Officer Steve Parker taking over in an interim role. In mid-October, the company disclosed $2 billion in losses for the defense unit during the third quarter on fixed-price programs including the KC-46 tanker and T-7 training jet. At the same time, Ortberg announced layoffs of 17,000 employees, a move meant to 'reset our workforce levels to align with our financial reality and to a more focused set of priorities,' he said in a letter to employees then. Those sweeping changes have occurred as Boeing deals with an ongoing strike of its Seattle-area machinists union, which has impacted production of its bestselling 737 MAX jetliner as well as defense assets like the KC-46 and P-8 maritime surveillance aircraft. (The union will vote on whether to end the strike and accept a new contract with Boeing later this evening.) Asked whether Boeing will replace Colbert with an executive from outside the company, Ortberg demurred. 'We'll take a look at internally, do we have the right candidate? And if so, that's the way we'll head. If we need to supplement from the outside and bring some outside skills, then it will head that direction,' he said. 'I'm certainly not averse to bringing in some additional resources to help the team, and I don't think the teams are averse to that as well.' Since the COVID-19 pandemic, Boeing’s defense unit has been plagued by cost overruns from fixed-price defense contracts, where the company is responsible for covering all costs above an agreed upon level. As the pandemic and inflationary pressures increased the cost of materials and wages, the planemaker has struggled to keep losses in check. Ortberg acknowledged there is no 'magic bullet' for Boeing’s fixed-price programs, which will take time to become profitable. 'Having said that, the discipline about what we can control on those contracts needs to get better,' he said, adding that Boeing’s defense unit hasn’t done enough work with its customers to keep program risks from developing into a potential cost overrun. 'That's what I've got the team focused on doing a lot more: A lot more deep dives, a lot deeper look at the programs, a lot more looking around the corner [and] not just dealing with what today's problem is going to be,' Ortberg said. Boeing must also ensure it enters into future contracts with a clear view of a program’s risk, and its defense unit leadership needs to work more closely with its engineering and factory workforce to better understand problems as they arise, he said. 'I want to be the leader in the aerospace and defense market,' he said. 'I want to be setting the standard for the products that we deliver. I want our customers doing our marketing for us.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/boeing-ceo-says-defense-is-core-to-business-doesnt-preclude-sell-off-of-fringe-assets/	2024-10-23T11:00:28-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/11/T-7A-scaled-e1699436176928.jpg
Germany, UK strike ‘first-of-its-kind’ defense deal prioritizing deep strike weapons and drones	Under the Treaty House Agreement, German P-8A Poseidon aircraft will 'periodically' operate from RAF Lossiemouth, Scotland (UK MoD) BELFAST — A new bilateral defense agreement between Germany and the UK, inked today, will see the two European nations develop new deep-strike weapons, naval uncrewed aerial systems and other drones that 'could' fly alongside fighter jets. Marked in a statement by the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) as a 'first-of-its-kind' defense pact between London and Berlin, the Trinity House Agreement was formally signed in London by Boris Pistorius, German defence minister, and John Healey, UK defence secretary. The accord, built off a joint declaration in July to establish closer defense ties, 'marks a fundamental shift in the UK’s relations with Germany and for European security … [and] will strengthen national security and economic growth in the face of growing Russian aggression and increasing threats,' added the MoD. A number of 'ground-breaking defence projects' across all domains have been committed to, led by an effort to develop 'brand-new extended deep strike weapons that can travel further with more precision than current systems,' including MBDA’s Storm Shadow long-range air launched cruise missile. In a supporting joint communique, London suggested that 'common requirements and military doctrine' for the future long-range systems still have to be developed. No funding details were shared but as a general rule and per Trinity House Agreement stipulations, the pact binds both signatories to equally share 'all costs and benefits' across related projects 'unless otherwise provided for in related agreements or arrangements.' The joint UK-German long range weapons project arrives on the heels of the UK committing to the European Long-range Strike Approach (ELSA) programme – a multinational line of effort with Germany but also including France, Italy, and Poland. 'It is particularly important to me that we cooperate even more closely to strengthen NATO’s eastern flank and to close critical capability gaps, for instance in the field of long-range strike weapons,' Pistorius is quoted as saying in the MoD statement. Regarding drones, Berlin and London have agreed to explore and develop new maritime UAS 'capabilities' and collaborate on platforms that 'could operate alongside our fighter jets' — not unlike the US Air Force's high-profile Collaborative Combat Aircraft effort. Germany and the UK both operate Eurofighter Typhoon fourth-generation fighter jets. Additionally, London has a fleet of Lockheed Martin F-35B fifth-generation jets, while Berlin awaits a first F-35A delivery from an order for 35 aircraft, valued at $8.8 billion. Under the new bilateral pact, German P-8A Poseidon MPA's will also 'periodically operate' from RAF Lossiemouth, Scotland, to protect the North Atlantic and amid Russian threats to the region. Boeing expects to deliver a first of eight of the submarine-hunting aircraft to Germany next year, while the UK currently operates a fleet of nine units out of Lossiemouth. Additionally, the agreement provides for the UK to locally manufacture artillery gun barrels for the first time in a decade. Germany's Rheinmetall will open a new production facility for the equipment, based around British steel produced by Sheffield Forgemasters. In a bid to strengthen land industrial cooperation, the pact also underscores a 'long-term commitment to manufacturing' Boxer armoured vehicles. Britain rejoined the Boxer program in 2019, pledging £2.8 billion ($3.6 billion) to it, and has ordered 623 vehicles, which are due to be integrated into new Armoured Brigade Combat Teams, alongside Ajax armored fighting vehicles and Challenger 3 main battle tanks.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/germany-uk-strike-first-of-its-kind-defense-deal-prioritizing-deep-strike-weapons-and-drones/	2024-10-23T10:33:37-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/LOS-20241023-0911-P-8A-0003.jpg.iCevoqnpMXvXS9NjYBMA.PpjVMECP-x-1-e1729695291152.jpg
Supply chain issues slowing down General Dynamics sub construction, CEO says	USS Hyman G. Rickover (SSN 795) is moored pierside during a commissioning ceremony at Naval Submarine Base New London in Groton, Connecticut on October 14, 2023.(U.S. Navy photo by Chief Petty Officer Joshua Karsten) WASHINGTON — General Dynamics Electric Boat isn’t getting what it needs from its supply chain on time, a fact that could put its remit to deliver two Virginia-class attack submarines per year under 'considerable pressure,' the CEO of parent company General Dynamics said today. 'The supply chain is not getting better at a fast enough rate as we had hoped,' said Phebe Novakovic during an earnings call with investors. 'Through our internal efficiency, we have now outpaced them. This is the reality of the post-COVID environment for many of our most important suppliers.' While the health of some pockets of the submarine industrial base are improving, Electric Boat continues to be 'severely impacted' by late deliveries from suppliers of major components, which is driving up costs and lengthening production schedules, Novakovic said. She added that the Navy’s most recent delivery schedules reflect the supply chain delays. Specifically, Novakovic pointed to out-of-sequence work as one major cause of cost increases and schedule changes. Shipbuilders like Electric Boat plan out a specific order in which they assemble the countless parts and pieces that ultimately make up the hull form of a submarine. It’s not unusual for a shipbuilder to occasionally receive a late delivery and adjust their plans accordingly. But, Novakovic said today the number of out-of-sequence deliveries Electric Boat is receiving is leading to work costing as much as eight times more than it would have under normal circumstances. 'We're going to control what we control,' Novakovic said. 'We're going to adjust our pace to align with what we now see is more of a predictable supply chain schedule that is elongated. We'll take cost out of our business, and we'll continue to work productivity on the deck plates with an increasingly capable and skilled and experienced workforce.' RELATED: GD Chief Says Navy's 1 Sub Buy Won't Impact Company Short Term, But Out Years Less Certain Novakovic acknowledged that the Navy and Congress understand the industrial base challenges and have directed funding — to the tune of $11 billion planned for the immediate upcoming budget cycles — in order to help shore up manufacturing capacity, but said that further investments may be necessary. 'Costs are increasing — fact of life costs or economic realities — and funding is going to have to adjust to these fundamental changes in input, and that will need to happen over time,' she said. Asked what components are driving the supply chain issues, Novakovic declined to lay out specifics but cited two areas of concern: small parts made by small suppliers, who are often the only source, and large complex parts, which are difficult and expensive to make, and have grown more so due to rising labor and material costs. Since the inception of the AUKUS trilateral security pact, the Navy and its submarine prime contractors Electric Boat and HII have come under increasing pressure to ramp up their construction cadences to deliver two Virginia-class boats per year. Recent historical trends show the industrial base producing closer to 1.2 boats annually on average. Adding to that pressure, the service anticipates it will need to reach a 2.33 boats-per-year cadence to support both the US Navy’s needs as well as the obligations associated with AUKUS. (That schedule is in addition to at least one Columbia-class ballistic missile submarine being delivered annually, a cadence the Navy refers to as '1+2.') Asked whether the supply chain issues will harm the company’s ability to achieve that goal, Novakovic said it will remain a topic Electric Boat must work through with the Pentagon. Former Under Secretary of the Navy Erik Raven announced during the service’s budget rollout earlier this year the Navy believes its efforts to bolster the industrial base will put it on track to achieve its desired cadence by 2028. More recently, Raven told Breaking Defense he believes supply chain and workforce inexperience remain the two biggest obstacles standing in the way. Pentagon officials have characterized the jump from historical cadences to their goal in 2028 as being an increased 'workload equivalent factor of five.' As for General Dynamics, its executives have previously been optimistic about eventually reaching the Pentagon’s goal. Jason Aiken, then the company’s chief financial officer, last year told investors the company was on the cusp of achieving that threshold prior to COVID-19. 'So it is eminently doable in terms of the industrial base,' he said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/supply-chain-issues-slowing-down-general-dynamics-sub-construction-ceo-says/	2024-10-23T09:11:52-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/11/8071283-scaled-e1699556348565.jpg
China tightens ‘counter-stealth’ military radar net around South China Sea, says report	Triton Island in September 2024. Satellite imagery disputes earlier assumptions that Beijing was building a 600-metre runway, revealing instead the development of a sophisticated counter-stealth radar system and a suspected launching point for an anti-ship missile battery. (Photo:Maxar via Chatham House) SYDNEY — As China increasingly engages in what the US calls dangerous behavior against its regional neighbors in the contentious South China Sea, Beijing also aims to raise its situational awareness there with new radar facilities on a tiny island, according to a report by Chatham House researchers. 'New satellite images reveal how the Chinese military is dramatically expanding its capabilities on Triton Island, which looks set to become a one of Beijing’s key signal intelligence bases in the South China Sea,' noted the Oct. 17 report. 'Once completed, the radar system would significantly increase China’s signals intercept and electronic warfare capabilities across the disputed Paracel Islands archipelago and add to a wider surveillance network spanning much of the South China Sea.' Authors, Chatham House's John Pollock and Damien Symon, added, 'The enhanced facility on Triton is likely to offer a challenge to China’s competitors in the region and internationally.' The new facilities are not, as had been previously reported, the likely beginnings of a runway, they say, noting that it sports what they believe to be 'construction of a new radar system, known as SIAR — synthetic impulse and aperture radar — which purportedly detects stealth aircraft.' The radar 'will form what is believed to be a wider network of at least three overlapping counter-stealth radars built across Chinese bases in the South China Sea over the past decade, including on Hainan Island, home to several Chinese naval bases,' the Chatham House analysts write. In addition to the radar and other facilities, the Chatham House authors say some of the facilities appear to be for signal intelligence gathering. 'For Vietnam, which is rapidly expanding its own bases in the South China Sea, the intelligence structures on Triton would significantly diminish its capacity to operate undetected in the area,' the Chatham report says. 'Alongside existing radar on Triton which can detect sea-going vessels, Beijing will likely have the potential to track Vietnamese air movements and gain forewarning of Hanoi’s maneuvers in the area, including efforts to access oil and gas deposits.' The positioning of the radar on Triton, less than 200 miles south of Hainan, is telling, says J. Michael Dahm, an expert at the Mitchell Institute. 'SIAR radars cannot see over the curve of the Earth, which means there is a gap in China’s air surveillance coverage between Subi Reef and Hainan Island. The Triton Island site will help close that gap,' said Dahm in the Chatham House report. The aim, he suggests, is to give China contiguous counter-stealth radar coverage of the South China Sea. Malcolm Davis, a China and defense expert at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, acknowledged to Breaking Defense the possible risks of the new Chinese facility but suggested the capabilities it provides could be better judged once the facility is completed. Much will depend on the counter-stealth value of the radar in particular and which individual platforms it can track, he explained — specifically drawing on F-35A, B-21 and F-22 aircraft as examples, not to mention coming sixth-generation platforms. 'The station will probably complicate military operations in peace time across the South China Sea but simply prove to be a juicy target in time of war,' he noted. 'Also, it would need to be defended against a full range of land-attack munitions, or even hypersonic weapons that could emerge in western arsenals in coming years. No matter how sophisticated a radar, it is, at the end of the day, a stationary target that can be destroyed, and [air defense systems] can be overwhelmed,' Davis said. 'The application of advanced loitering munitions and swarming drones might make what is probably a very expensive investment a poor one. The radar doesn't look that well defended to me.' He said loyal wingman aircraft, known as Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA), and armed drones would be 'the obvious counter-response here.' Chatham House authors write that the radar on Triton boasts a 'distinctive octagonal structure, which resembles another SIAR system built by China on Subi Reef in the Spratly Islands, south of the Paracels, in 2017. A half-completed tower also sits near the SIAR radar on Triton, which is likely to be the operations center.' That design could make it even easier to find and destroy in war time. There may be defensive works installed soon, the analysts say: 'The satellite images reveal other building projects on Triton. One is a large pad at the end of the road network which will probably be used as a launching point for a mobile anti-ship missile battery. The building at the northeast end of the road is probably a storage building for missile transport vehicles.' '&#8216;The desire to strengthen control over these resources may explain why China is fortifying Triton Island,'' said Bill Hayton, an expert at Chatham House's Asia-Pacific program, in the article. 'The developments might be a warning that China is planning to mount another drilling expedition,' he suggested.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/china-tightens-counter-stealth-military-radar-net-around-south-china-sea-says-report/	2024-10-23T08:51:10-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/2024-10-15-twt-winter-2024-osint-triton-image-01_0.png
DoD, SBA announce first group of funds for small business investments to shore up tech innovation	The US is investing heavily in microelectronics. (Photo by Rudolfs Klintsons via Pexels) WASHINGTON — The Department of Defense and the Small Business Administration (SBA) on Tuesday announced the first of its kind set of approved licenses and investment funds for small businesses under the Small Business Investment Company Critical Technology (SBICCT) Initiative. Together, the government plans to invest over $2.8 billion in more than1,000 companies in the defense supply chain to help them bolster their private capital so they can more easily transition from prototypes to products. The SBICCT Initiative was created in 2022 and began taking applications in fall of 2023 with the goal of attracting and scaling private investment into 14 DoD Critical Technology Areas that are vital to economic and national security, Jason Rathje, the director of the Office of Strategic Capital, said during a media roundtable Tuesday. Specifically, he said this program aims to expand access to capital for manufacturing and production. He explained that nearly two decades ago, venture capital was investing heavily in hardware, but this drastically changed about ten years later. Because of this, the DoD started this program to help supplement the gap. Investing in hardware is critically important when creating tech like semiconductors, Rathje said. 'Now [these companies] have access to capital that they otherwise wouldn't have access to, because as those dollars went away from investing in capital intensive industries, the availability of capital for companies who are developing these technologies has also decreased. With this program, we're now swinging the pendulum back the other way,' Rathje said. 'Now this provides us an opportunity to bring back capital to invest in to these hardware intensive, critical technology areas and allows us, the department, to really see value in terms of the products and component technologies that are vital for national security,' he added. At the beginning of July, the SBA allocated the first SBICCT Initiative license. (The SBICCT Initiative aims to utilize SBA funding to provide loans and loan guarantees to investors interested in financing companies developing advanced technologies that support national security.) About three months later, there are now four funds that are licensed and nine that are 'green light approved.' The latter means a business is invited to submit a final license application once sufficient capital has been raised and they have been 'vetted' to raise private capital and make a 'first close'(when a fund launches after initial investor commitments are made), explained Bailey DeVries, associate administrator and director of the SBA Office of Innovation and Investment, during the roundtable. 'What the SBA does is, we will perform our due diligence on funds, and in partnership with the DoD, they will conduct their vetting and security analysis of this fund as well. And when we are at the point where we have completed our due diligence and have legal sufficiency, we are able to then approve those funds to go raise private capital,' she said. It is projected that these 13 funds, which the department declined to say who they belonged to, will 'collectively project' to invest over $4 billion in 'nearly' 1,700 portfolio companies, according to a DoD press release. The $4 billion figure fuses $2.8 million, which combines $1.8 billion in private capital raised by 13 licensed and approved funds, with the SBA leverage. These funds combined with the funds nearing the end of the due diligence process, which derive from the SBA's Debenture programs — a way that small businesses access long-term, fixed-rate capital —amounts to a total of over $4 billion, a US official clarified after the roundtable. (Each fund can access up to $175 million in loans through the same system, according to the press release.) SBA, unlike the Pentagon, can legally leverage 'the full faith and credit' of the federal government to guarantee loans to innovative firms. The same would not be true of an OSC effort, but since that Pentagon office is working with SBA, it is able to use the same legal guarantees. Rathje said such partnership between the SBA and the Pentagon allows the US to prioritize its 'enduring advantage' over adversaries by combining innovation with investment. 'Making investments that not only drive the growth of these technologies but also drive more interest in developing these technologies, since there’s capital now available, is an ecosystem opportunity that we see really increasing US long term enduring advantage,' he said. This story has been updated to reflect a clarification sent by the DoD after the roundtable on the total amount of private capital expected to be raised.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/dod-sba-announce-first-group-of-funds-for-small-business-investments-to-shore-up-tech-innovation/	2024-10-23T07:20:26-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/220420_pexels_chip_processor.png
Turkish firm STM unveils indigenous unmanned autonomous underwater vehicle	STM NETA 300, an unmanned autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) developed by Defense Technologies Engineering and Trade Co AS, exhibited at the SAHA Expo, Turkiye's flagship defense and aerospace event, organized by the Istanbul Defense and Aerospace Cluster Association (SAHA) in Istanbul, Turkiye on October 22, 2024. (Photo by Serhat Cagdas /Anadolu via Getty Images) BEIRUT — Turkish shipbuilder STM unveiled today a new unmanned autonomous underwater vehicle (UUV), dubbed STM NETA 300, saying it is the first in what will be a 'family of platforms.' 'The first deployment of STM NETA 300 will be for mine detection and destruction missions,' STM General Manager Özgür Güleryüz said in a statement from the first day of the SAHA expo in Istanbul. 'The system operates autonomously when deployed for Mine Countermeasure (MCM) Operations, making use of side-scan and gap-filling sonar technologies to identify mines in suspected high-risk areas. This enables the user to classify and identify mines or mine-like objects as quickly and effectively as possible,' the statement specified. But the company said the STM NETA is expected to perform a number of missions including intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, anti-submarine warfare, explosive disposal, and pipeline and geophysical surveys. Güleryüz stressed in his statement that the platforms are being developed to fulfil requirements for the Turkish armed forces 'with high export potential among friendly and allied nations.' The company said the UUV has a maximum speed of five knots and can operate at a depth of 300 meters. The system, which can operate for up to 24 hours on a single battery charge, is now in the sea-testing phase. The NETA is a shallow-water vessel, but STM expects to develop medium- and large-sized UUVs to operate deeper in the sea in the future. In addition to the NETA 300, at the exhibition STM is displaying its Turkish national frigate dubbed TCG Istanbul (F-515), the Ada-Class corvette, as well as models of several of its ships and submarines. STM has other ongoing export projects, the latest of which is a contract to equip the Malaysian navy with three Littoral Mission Ships. It also has the lion's share in Turkish national projects. This year it delivered the Istanbul, TCG Derya cargo ship, TCG Lt. Arif Ekmekçi Logistics Support Ship, as well as the armed unmanned surface vessel Marlin.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/turkish-firm-stm-unveils-indigenous-unmanned-autonomous-underwater-vehicle/	2024-10-23T06:25:03-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/GettyImages-2179460835-scaled-e1729612368806.jpg
Saronic unveils latest, largest unmanned vessel, with eye on mass production	Saronic’s Corsair autonomously navigating open waters in the Gulf of Mexico. (Photo provided by Saronic.) WASHINGTON — Defense tech startup Saronic announced today it is launching its newest autonomous surface vessel, dubbed Corsair, the company’s third and largest unmanned maritime asset aimed at satisfying the Pentagon’s desire for expendable drones produced en masse. The new unmanned vessel is 24 feet long and, according to the company, can travel 1,000 nautical miles at a top speed of 35 knots with a payload capacity of 1,000 pounds. Saronic also produces 6-foot and 14-foot model vessels that, as company officials describe them, fit the US Navy’s future vision for a hybrid manned/unmanned fleet. Dino Mavrookas, co-founder and chief executive officer at Saronic, told reporters ahead of the public announcement the company is already planning to manufacture 'hundreds' of the new vessel to 'meet the demand' the company is predicting, without naming any specific deals. 'We’re building five prototypes, all of which are currently in development,' he said. 'We have done live demonstrations already with end users, and we are moving and ramping into high-rate production and manufacturing as we speak. So, we will be building hundreds and hundreds of Corsairs next year with the ability to scale that into the thousands.' RELATED: With Navy exercise, unmanned surface vessel firm Saronic sees ‘next step’ The startup, which was formed in 2022, has largely focused its efforts on developing and manufacturing unmanned surface vessels implicitly aimed at the Pentagon’s Replicator initiative, which seeks to mass produce affordable, unmanned drones that could be deployed in a fight against China. As Mavrookas described it, Saronic’s advantage in the unmanned vessel market, which has become increasingly saturated in the defense industrial base in recent years, is vertical integration. 'The thing that matters to the Navy … is scale. The first thing that matters is, can you manufacture these at scale in very, very large quantities?' he said. 'In order to scale autonomous platforms, you have to be vertically integrated from start to finish. You have to bring the hardware, the software and the manufacturing and production all together under one roof.' Earlier this year, the Austin, Texas-based firm secured $175 million in series B funding in a round led by venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. Other firms included 8VC, Caffeinated Capital, Elad Gil and NightDragon. When pressed by reporters on if the company’s production was getting too far ahead of the Pentagon’s interest, Mavrookas argued investors would not be cutting checks if the demand signals weren't clear. 'The Navy has to go in this direction. The buying behavior is changing as we speak, and we’re scaling manufacturing and production with [independent research and development] to meet that demand. So, when the contracting catches up, we’re there to meet it,' he said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/saronic-unveils-latest-largest-unmanned-vessel-with-eye-on-mass-production/	2024-10-22T21:01:21-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/CORSAIR_STILL-07_v002-scaled.jpg
Australia to award 155 shell production contract in coming ‘weeks,’ minister says	Pat Conroy, Australian minister for defense industry and capability delivery, and Maj. Gen. Richard Vagg, the Army's head of land capability at the 2024 Land Forces conference in Melbourne. (ADF Cpl. Janet Pan) WASHINGTON — Australia is poised to award a contract to produce 155mm shells domestically in the next few weeks, defense acquisition minister Pat Conroy told Breaking Defense today. 'All I can say is an announcement will be made shortly. So look out in the next little while for that announcement,' Conroy said in an interview during his visit to meet with American defense officials. Pressed for more specificity, Conroy said the timetable is within 'weeks.' Currently, Australia imports its 155mm shells from a South African subsidiary of Rheinmetall. While there is domestic production via a joint venture between a local company, NIOA, and Rheinmetall, those shells are only for export to Germany. Few details have been made public about the pending 155mm contract from the MoD, including dollar amounts and quantity. Conroy confirmed that the NIOA-Rheinmetall team pitched on the deal, with French firm Thales also competing. However, the minister indicated that there is a third, currently unidentified, competitor as well. 'There was a — I won't get into it — but there was a third option that was approached as well,' he told Breaking Defense. Since the start of the Ukraine war, 155mm shells have become a hot commodity, with international demand far exceeding production. Speaking to Breaking Defense last week, Australian Army Maj. Gen. Richard Vagg, the service’s head of Land Capability, said building up domestic 155 production is vital for Australia’s defense. 'I think our government’s been really clear. You just look at the investment they put into guided weapons and explosive ordnance in Australia,' Vagg said on the sidelines of the AUSA conference. 'I know we’re looking at 155; it’ll be crawl, walk, run. I don’t need to say it’s important — I think the government’s actions, the amount of money and effort they’ve invested in that area makes that pretty clear.' Conroy is also hopeful that Australia can play a role in the broader supply chain globally — meaning that as Canberra invests in building up domestic production of munitions for its own use, it is building in 'scalability beyond our domestic need' to be able to help supply international customers. Overall, Australia has committed up to $21 billion AUD ($14.1 billion USD) for what it’s calling the Guided Weapons and Explosive Ordnance Enterprise (GWEO) over the next decade to increase its domestic munitions production. Part of that includes a planned investment in solid rocket motor production. 'I think that's going to be a key focus, is to develop an Australian capability around solid rocket motors, recognizing that that's sort of the pace setter for a lot of the global supply chains around missiles,' Conroy said. Australia has a request for information out to industry for solid rocket motor production, so any competition is in the early stages, though some companies are already signaling their interest. During Conroy’s visit to Washington, Canberra announced a plan to spend $7 billion AUD on SM-2 IIIC and SM-6 missiles for its Navy. While Conroy declined to go into quantities or delivery timelines due to 'operational security reasons,' he said that part of his conversation with US Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro during this trip was to firm up production plans, given concerns about availability of the weapons. 'I'll just say that we're comfortable with our nominated slots in the delivery [queue] and the US Navy have been very cooperative with us in terms of how we access inventory,' Conroy said. 'So I'm satisfied that the delivery schedule meets our strategic needs, and the US Navy has been very supportive of working with them on understanding the capability.' Colin Clark in Sydney contributed to this report.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/australia-to-award-155-shell-production-contract-in-coming-weeks-minister-says/	2024-10-22T16:45:55-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/20240913adf8642611_0157-scaled-e1729192099256.jpeg
Space Force lauds ‘in-country’ subcomponents in Indo-Pacific, aiding allies ‘aggressive’ space plans	Brig. Gen. Anthony Mastalir, US Space Forces Indo-Pacific Command commander, delivers opening remarks during an activation ceremony for the U.S. Space Forces Korea at Osan Air Base, Republic of Korea, Dec. 14, 2022. (US Air Force photo by Airman 1st Class Aaron Edwards) WASHINGTON — The US Space Force's expanding footprint in the Indo-Pacific region will help allies like South Korea and Japan as they pursue 'aggressive plans to develop military operations where the space domain is concerned,' while ensuring their capabilities will play nice with the US military's, according to a senior US military official there. 'So, as they build their capabilities, having a component right there in country, working with them, having them exercise with us,' helps inform them about 'how they might consider building those capabilities so that they can integrate across the joint force,' Brig. Gen. Anthony Mastalir, commander of US Space Forces — Indo-Pacific, told the Mitchell Institute today. US Space Forces — Indo-Pacific was established as a component command under US Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM) in November 2022, and the next month it stood up a subcomponent in Osan, Korea, creatively dubbed US Space Forces — Korea. Now Mastalir said it is his 'intent to activate' a second subcomponent in Japan by 'the end of the calendar year.' '[T]here's all kinds of excitement, both on the [Korean Peninsula] and in Japan, about what the Space Force can bring those allies,' he added. When US Space Forces — Indo-Pacific was stood up, Space Force leaders explained that its job would be to serve as a single point of contact advising INDOPACOM about what space forces and capabilities are available not just from the service, but also other organizations such as the National Reconnaissance Office, US Space Command, commercial firms and US allies and partners — and in turn relay INDOPACOM needs back to the Space Force. Mastalir said that one of INDOPACOM chief Adm. Samuel Paparo's key goals, as well as that of his predecessor Adm. John Aquilino, is to move from a focus on 'bilateral engagements and exercises to more multilateral' activities to strengthen deterrence. '[D]emonstrating on a daily basis with your allies and partners that you're prepared to fight and win a war, if you need to, is really the ultimate way to deter a war. So that's really important,' he said. In the space arena, Mastalir said, multilateral exercises are especially useful for helping individual allied nations understand where they can best contribute to a combined fight. '[O]ur partner nations and allies are in different places in their own journey, and we can engage with those partners where they're at, and really kind of bring them along,' he said. Mastalir said that another key advantage of the Space Force having components in the various combatant commands is that embedded Guardians and their commanders can work directly with 'terrestrial warfighters' coordinate defense of US space assets in the face of adversary attacks. He noted that in the INDOPACOM region, Gen. Stephen Whiting, leader US Space Command, is 'certainly is very focused on China's counterspace capabilities that are designed to take out US satellites.' Mastalir elaborated using a scenario of directed energy anti-satellite weapons, noting that exercises have shown the value of having Space Force commanders having 'a voice at the table' in prioritizing a response and figuring out ways across domains to 'neutralize' those targets. 'You really have to take into account all of the capabilities — whether it's space or cyber or air, maritime, land — to understand what that looks like, and then the key is the timing and tempo of how you prosecute those operations,' he said. 'And the adversary gets a vote.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/space-force-lauds-in-country-subcomponents-in-indo-pacific-aiding-allies-aggressive-space-plans/	2024-10-22T12:55:12-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/Gen.-Mastalir-2022-US-Space-Force-stands-up-Korean-component-scaled-e1729625096986.jpeg
Saab braces for ‘couple of years’ of ‘stop-and-go’ production instability on T-7A trainer fuselage	The T-7A Red Hawk, which will become the Air Force's training jet for fighter pilots. (Boeing) BELFAST — It will take as much as two years before production woes on the Air Force T-7A Red Hawk trainer aft fuselage stop dragging down profits for Swedish sub-contractor Saab, according to the company's CEO. Micael Johansson told investors during a third quarter earnings call today that problems with 'start-up costs and under absorption [fixed manufacturing costs]' aligned to low-rate production of the T-7 will only correct themselves 'over time.' 'We are still burdened by that a bit,' he said. 'During the next couple of years, I would say it will take before we get back to sort of really good numbers' in the company's Aeronautics division. Saab's Aeronautics division, which also counts prized aircraft like the Gripen fighter jet and GlobalEye AEW&amp;C platform within its portfolio, recorded quarter three sales of 3.3 billion SEK (297 million USD). Saab is responsible for providing aft fuselages for the T-7 trainer to prime contractor Boeing, and Johansson said his company plans to deliver 'many' fuselages to its American partner from a contract covering '35ish' units. The aircraft is on order by USAF to replace the service's aging T-38 Talon. RELATED: Saab teases future fighter demonstrator concepts, awaits direction from Sweden In January, Saab received a $102 million order for the parts, which are produced out of the company’s West Lafayette, Ind., facility. 'Boeing have estimated there will be a couple of thousand of these aircraft out there training pilots around the world and many in the US, so we just need to get through this' low volume production phase, said Johansson. 'I'm confident in the [T-7A] capability such that we have the facilities. It's not technical problems. It's more &#8230; stop-and-go in production that we need to get the flow going right.' He did not identify any supply chain bottlenecks linked to the 'stop-and-go' production trend, but one bump in the road came when the Air Force decided to slash its T-7 fiscal 2025 procurement from 14 to seven aircraft. If the Air Force continues to slow roll production, both Saab and Boeing will feel the effect, especially the US planemaker as it looks to iron out development phase issues and break the cycle of costly quarterly losses. Boeing declined to comment. Safety risks linked to T-7 flight control software and escape system flaws have previously been shared by the Government Accountability Office, though Boeing has pushed back on such criticism, arguing that company-led flight tests have opened the way for smoother aircraft development. Elsewhere in the call Johansson said it was a 'surprise' when the company's North American arm received a formal request for information related to Brazil's acquisition of 36 Gripen E/F fighter jets. He stressed that the manufacturer will 'collaborate with the authorities and provide information as they request.' He noted that Saab had similarly cooperated with Brazilian and Swedish authorities over the matter and 'no wrongdoing' was found.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/saab-braces-for-couple-of-years-of-stop-and-go-production-instability-on-t-7a-trainer-fuselage/	2024-10-22T12:21:40-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-01-at-10.16.32-AM-e1635361460500.png
Army awards Leidos $331 million to deploy unified network capabilities to different sites	The ultimate goal of the Army's Unified Network is to give soldiers the same network capabilities while deployed as they have at posts, camps, and stations. Photo courtesy of the US Army. WASHINGTON — The Army has awarded Leidos a contract worth up to $331 million to bolster its unified network initiative — the service’s goal of breaking down the dozens of siloed legacy networks, mostly separated by tactical and enterprise portions, to create a more cohesive singular network. The award comes from the Army’s Program Executive Office for Command, Control and Communications-Network (PEO C3N), which is the program executive office responsible for modernizing the Army’s network capabilities. More specifically, the award comes out of the Global Enterprise Network Modernization – OCONUS (GENM-O) program office within PEO C3N, which provides network modernization in the Southwest Asia, Pacific and Europe theaters. 'We are proud to partner with the Army in deploying the Global Unified Network, which will enhance interoperability and security across all levels of operations. This initiative not only aligns with the Army's Network Modernization Strategy but also aims to position us at the forefront of advancing military communication capabilities in an increasingly complex global landscape,' Steve Hull, president of Leidos' digital modernization sector said in a press release. A spokesperson for PEO C3N told Breaking Defense that Leidos is the main award winner of the contract, but there are a handful of subcontractors involved as well. According to the press release, the contract has a one-year base period of performance with four one-year option periods, and has a total value of $331 million 'if all options are exercised.' Leidos will deploy the unified network to different Army sites to 'deliver a standardized, orchestrated modern network architecture, aiming to make applications, data, and enterprise services are accessible, trusted and interoperable across the globe,' the press release stated. The Army announced its Unified Network Plan nearly three years ago. At the time, the Army had 69 individual networks and announced the goal of getting down to one by 2027, something Program Executive Officer of C3N Mark Kitz, recently told Breaking Defense was 'ambitious,' yet possible. 'This vision of a unified network is very ambitious. For a very long time, the Army has been building tactical and enterprise infrastructure in two very different ways,' he said. 'And so how do we identify those opportunities? How do we identify the challenges, and how do we identify the roadblocks?'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/army-awards-leidos-331-million-to-deploy-unified-network-capabilities-to-different-sites/	2024-10-22T11:32:33-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/The-ultimate-goal-of-the-Armys-Unified-Network-is-to-give-soldiers-the-same-network-capabilities-while-deployed-as-they-have-at-posts-camps-and-stations.-e1697476883722.jpg
Prolonged F-35 negotiations take a bite out of Lockheed Martin’s third quarter results	U.S. Air Force Capt. Melanie 'MACH' Kluesner, F-35A Lightning II Demonstration Team pilot and commander, flies an aerial demonstration certification flight at Hill Air Force Base, Utah, on Feb. 22, 2024.(Staff Sgt. Kaitlyn Ergish/US Air Force) WASHINGTON — Protracted contract negotiations between Lockheed Martin and the Pentagon on the next two lots of the F-35 have begun to eat away at the company’s bottom line, with Lockheed executives reporting a $700 million lapse in revenue for the program in the third financial quarter. The Defense Department and Lockheed have yet to finalize a deal on F-35 Lots 18-19, which was initially expected by the end of 2023. Funding from an initial contract that allowed Lockheed to begin work on the planes ahead of a final agreement ran out during the third quarter, forcing the company to reach into its own pockets to keep production work going for those jets, company executives said during an earnings call with investors. 'As a result, the company was unable to recognize revenue and profit on approximately $400 million of costs incurred on the program in the third quarter of 2024, with at least an additional $300 million of impacts across the supply chain,' Lockheed said in a news release. 'Additionally, the company was prevented from invoicing and receiving cash of approximately $450 million through the third quarter of 2024.' Lockheed said in the release that it expects that it will reach a deal with the Pentagon in the fourth quarter, allowing it to recover by the end of 2024. However, the company warned that until a final contract is reached or the Pentagon provides additional funding, its financial results could be negatively impacted. 'Should the negotiation timeline be extend beyond year end … we could see about 3 percent or $2 billion of our sales shift into 2025, along with associated impacts to profit and about $1 billion dollars of free cash flow,' said Lockheed Chief Financial Officer Jay Malave during the call. Lockheed CEO Jim Taiclet said it was 'essential for the health of [its] lower tier suppliers' to keep F-35 production going at pace, even if Lockheed and its major subcontractors cannot book revenue on the program until a contract is finalized. Despite the headwinds to the F-35 program, which drove a 3 percent reduction in net sales for Lockheed’s aeronautics unit compared to the same period last year, the company boosted its financial outlook for the year. Earnings per share rose to $26.65 from the previously predicted $26.10 to $26.60 level. Net sales, which had been expected to be between $70.5 billion and $71.5 billion, are now estimated to be $71.25 billion for the year. Rob Stallard, an analyst with Vertical Research Partners, said in a note to investors that the results amounted to 'a decent quarter from Lockheed despite the F-35 hit.' Last month, Malave warned investors that the company could see a $1 billion 'impact' to third quarter results due to dwindling funds on the most recent F-35 contract. At the time, Lockheed was engaged with the F-35 Joint Program Office and Congress on securing additional funding that could bridge the gap until a final Lot 18 and 19 contract could be reached, Malave said then. Aside from the ongoing contract negotiations, the company is still recovering from a year-long F-35 delivery pause stemming from delays in an upcoming upgrade package known as Technology Refresh 3 (TR-3). The Pentagon began accepting F-35s with an interim version of TR-3 in July, but is withholding payment until the upgrade package is complete. Lockheed expects about $600 million in financial impact this year resulting from the pause and resulting withholding, but it could recover up to $400 million next year as it makes progress delivering parked F-35s. The company expects to deliver 90 to 110 F-35s in 2024, with 48 jets delivered through the third quarter. For the next three years, deliveries will increase to about 180 F-35s, including new production jets and F-35s that were held back during the delivery pause, Malave said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/prolonged-f-35-negotiations-take-a-bite-out-of-lockheed-martins-third-quarter-results/	2024-10-22T10:47:56-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/04/240401_f35_clouds_8270083-scaled-e1711999276822.jpg
