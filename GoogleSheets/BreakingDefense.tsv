Protest stalls Army $990M loitering munitions contract	AeroVironment’s Switchblade 600 bares its teeth at Sea Air Space. The loitering munition has gotten real-world practice during the Ukraine conflict, as a number of the weapons have been sent from the US to Kyiv. (Aaron Mehta/Breaking Defense) WASHINGTON — A US Army contract award to AeroVironment for $990 million-worth of Switchblade loitering munitions is on pause following a protest filed by Mistral Inc. The protest, which was revealed by AeroVironment in an SEC filling earlier this week, has resulted in the Army filing a stop work order, meaning that production on the order has to halt while the Government Accountability Office (GAO) reviews the case and makes a ruling. According to a GAO docket, the protest was filed Sept. 6. Defense One first reported on the filling. The GAO is expected to rule by Dec. 16, per the filling. If the GAO denies the protest, work will continue as expected; if it sustains the protest, it could force the Army to re-open a competition for the program, formally the directed requirement for Lethal Unmanned Systems (LUS), which was awarded on Aug. 28. AeroVironment has had a successful run of contracts with Switchblade, which comes in two variants, over the last calendar year. In Oct. 2023, the Army announced it was buying a small tranche of the Switchblade 600. Then in May, the program made headlines when it became the first publicly announced winner of a contract from the Replicator program, while the weapon has also seen action in Ukraine. Days after the Replicator announcement AeroVironment CEO Wahid Nawabi told Breaking Defense that the company is expanding production given the expected growth demand. Although not a household name, the Bethesda, Md.,-based Mistral has won at least one contract from DoD this year: a May 17 order from US Special Operations Command with a maximum value of $73.5 million for its GOLAM II loitering munitions. A spokesperson for AeroVironment could not be immediately reached. Voicemails left at Mistral's office and a note sent via its website were not returned by press time.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/protest-stalls-army-990m-loitering-munitions-contract/	2024-09-20T12:13:25-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/04/230405_SAS_underwater_drone_Mehta_crop.png
Secrets don’t make friends: Space Force making strides on allied info sharing, Canadian general says	Vice President Kamala Harris greets Canadian Armed Forces Brig. Gen. Kyle Paul, Space Operations Command then deputy commanding general, transformation, at Peterson Space Force Base, Colorado, May 29, 2024. (US Space Force photo by Staff Sgt. Natalie Rubenak) AMOS 2024 — While challenges remain, the Space Force has made visible progress in recent months in hurdling classification barriers that traditionally have blocked real-world integration of US and allied operations, according to the senior allied officer embedded with Space Operations Command (SpOC). Canada's Brig. Gen. Kyle Paul, who serves as SpOC deputy commander for operations, plans, training and force development (S3/5/7), said on Wednesday that top Space Force leaders are actively pushing for reducing classification levels, and that is showing results. 'I'm now working on my 13th year being integrated with either the [US Air Force] or the Space Force. So, I've seen it evolve over time, from when I was a captain all the way now being a general officer. I am optimistic with now we have strategic level leadership that are driving and mandating that we look at this deliberately,' he told Breaking Defense on the margins of the annual Advanced Maui Optical and Space Surveillance Technologies Conference (AMOS). US officials have publicly warned in recent years that overly onerous classification has delayed or stymied US outreach to allies, preventing the kind of rapid and robust information sharing they say would be critical in the event of a major conflict. The Defense Department's Office of Space Policy in January finalized a rewrite of classification policy that, while not opening much new information to the general public, called for a reduction in the use of Special Access Programs (SAPs) that dramatically limit clearances to handful of senior US officials, and a review of current SAPs to establish whether they could be downgraded to Top Secret or Secret. The policy also calls for minimizing other classification levels, such as Not Releasable to Foreign Nationals (NOFORN), that prevents sharing with non-US citizens, whenever and wherever possible. Paul said that another factor spurring measures to allow more information sharing and better work integration has been an uptick in foreign officers serving with the Space Force. 'I think the fact that we have allied leadership in certain key positions is actually a forcing function to be able to declassify information and ensure that I have what I need to be able to make decisions and advise the commander within headquarters, Space Operations Command,' he added. 'I've heard from our Five Eyes — so, Three Eyes I guess — [partners] on some of the challenges that they've had to be able to integrate their people at the tactical level, and that falls on my shoulders, to be able to push.' (Five Eyes refers to the tight intelligence-sharing relationship between the US, the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand; Paul is referring here to fellow non-US officers from the UK, Australia and New Zealand.) For example, Paul explained, one area of low hanging fruit has been simply looking at how physical spaces and 'secure areas' are set up so as to encourage the widest areas of co-location for combined operations. 'How do we look at configuration challenges, accesses just within a certain area where not everything is classified NOFORN? And so, what if we were to take those entities that are considered to be US-only and put them in a configuration within a physical space where it can be US-only, and still have access for the larger group to be able to operate and integrate. We can do that that. That doesn't hurt my head,' he said. Paul said SpOC already is 'taking steps in that direction' at the 'strategic level in terms of intent,' and is now trying to adapt the concept at the tactical level — 'and actually we're showing some promise to that over the last three months.' He further noted that rather than being a problem, technology now is helping the Space Force to find 'opportunities' to enable wider information sharing through the ability to 'compartmentalize' data within computer systems — rather than having systems and networks that are restricted to foreign or lower-level security level personnel. 'As long as we tag that data, we can pull it appropriately with your credentials that you own, per the individual. And that has been a real step forward that I've seen in the technology area,' Paul said. 'f I have a different credential, I can log into that system, and I can pull the information that only I'm allowed to see. It's no longer a barrier.' That said, Paul acknowledged that there are still challenges with regard to access to US computer networks and data, with regard to federating and expanding networks. For example, he said, one issue is how can the Space Force allow foreign nationals to be able to leverage data from their home stations rather than be forced to travel to the US on temporary duty to do so? 'And I think once we get there — and there is a deliberate effort to do that — it also sends a message of strategic deterrence. Because now we federated that mission, we've no longer got a strategic target on each geographical location, right? You can take out any one of them, and we're still going to operate,' he said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/secrets-dont-make-friends-space-force-making-strides-on-allied-info-sharing-canadian-general-says/	2024-09-20T11:50:42-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/240920_canadian_space_paul_harris_8452321-scaled-e1726846995712.jpg
Exploding pagers, major strike: Israel turns its war aims north in ‘new phase’	Chief of the General Staff of the Israel Defense Forces Herzi Halevi (2nd L) meets with the Commanding Officer of the Northern Command, Major General Ori Gordin (L) in Israel, on September 20, 2024. (Photo by Israel Defense Forces (IDF)/Anadolu via Getty Images) JERUSALEM — Four days in September have transformed Israel’s northern front with Hezbollah. For 11 months since Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack, the Israel Defense Forces and the Lebanese group have traded strikes, a slow drumbeat of occasionally deadly violence that has terrorized locals on both sides of the border but largely played out in the background of Israel’s offensive in Gaza. But then this week Israel is believed to have executed an unprecedented bombing attack against Hezbollah using hundreds of boobytrapped pagers, with walkie-talkies exploding the day after that, killing several people. And today the IDF said it killed a top Hezbollah commander — along with more than a dozen of others in senior command. 'I can now confirm that Ibrahim Aqil was eliminated together with other senior terrorists in Hezbollah’s Radwan Forces,' IDF Spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said in a statement. In the meantime Hezbollah launched 120 rockets and missiles towards Israel today, according to the IDF, after killing two Israeli soldiers in barrages earlier this week. Though the pager operation happened three days ago, a formal change in Israel’s strategy can be traced to a day before that on Monday, especially in retrospect, when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant held separate meetings with US special envoy Amos Hochstein, during which both emphasized that Israel was intent on altering the situation on the northern front. (US officials said the Israelis warned US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin the same day as the pager operation that Israel was going to take some kind of military action, but wasn’t given details, according to The Associated Press.) The new focus on the north comes with an official new war goal: the return and safeguarding of Israelis who had evacuated the north. Today Gallant repeated his prior description of the current fighting as a 'new phase.' 'In the new phase of the war there are significant opportunities but also significant risks. Hezbollah feels persecuted. The sequence of our military actions will continue,' he said. As military operations continue in Gaza and the West Bank, the overall posture of the Israeli military appears to have shifted north. Israel has shifted its 98th Division, which contains the Commando and Paratroop Brigade, to the north. This is a key division that played a major role in Gaza fighting between November 2023 and July 2024. It is joining a number of IDF divisions already deployed there. But beyond the new war goal, Israeli leadership has not detailed exactly how it plans to ensure Hezbollah does not threaten citizens in the north — and Hezbollah has vowed to respond to the pager attack. (A French official told Breaking Defense this summer that Paris would support a deployment of Lebanese military forces to the south, though developments since then, especially this week’s, are likely to have changed the calculus on what was already a preliminary idea.) Whatever the plan, today US President Joe Biden said the US, too, is working on a strategy to allow Israeli citizens to return to their homes, and for Lebanese citizens in southern Lebanon to do the same. 🚨President Biden said at the top of the cabinet meeting that he is working on a solution that will allow civilians in Northern Israel and Southern Lebanon to go back to their homes. He said the secretary of state, secretary of defense and the intelligence community are working… &mdash; Barak Ravid (@BarakRavid) September 20, 2024	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/exploding-pagers-major-strike-israel-turns-its-war-aims-north-in-new-phase/	2024-09-20T10:58:14-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/240920_israeli_commander_north_GettyImages-2172407139-e1726854515144.jpg
Sixth-generation fighter at F-35 costs? ‘That’s not going to happen,’ industry predicts.	A Boeing rendering of a next-gen fighter. (Boeing photo) AFA 2024 — As the US Air Force reassesses its plans for a sixth-generation fighter jet, its top civilian said the service wants to get the price per plane down to F-35 levels, about a third of what it originally projected it would pay. The problem, analysts and defense industry officials told Breaking Defense, is that it may not be realistic or even possible without a complete reimagining of how fighters and drones will fight together in the future. While the Air Force has yet to set a final unit cost target for a manned Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) fighter, Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall said the F-35 represents the 'upper bounds' of what the service wants to pay per aircraft, adding that the F-15EX is 'roughly' in the same price category. 'I'd like to go lower, though,' he told reporters this week at the Air and Space Force Association’s air space and cyber conference. 'Once you start integrating CCAs [Combat Collaborative Aircraft] and transferring some mission equipment and capabilities functions to the CCAs, then you can talk about a different concept, potentially, for the crewed fighter that's controlling them. So there's a real range in there.' For those in industry, Kendall’s comments represent a major break from the Air Force’s original vision for a manned NGAD fighter. 'That’s not going to happen,' one defense industry official told Breaking Defense, adding that there are 'distinct differences' in design parameters, materials and fleet sizes that drive higher costs for a sixth-generation fighter versus older, more prolific jets like the F-35 and F-15. Currently, unit costs for the Lockheed Martin F-35 ranges from about $80 million to $100 million per copy, depending on the variant, while the flyaway cost of a F-15EX is about $90 million. Conversely, Kendall originally estimated unit prices for NGAD would be about $300 million per copy. If the Air Force wants to field an optionally-crewed sixth-generation fighter jet at a price around that of an F-35 or F-15EX, the only plausible option is by taking out most of the aircraft’s key mission systems — things like radar, other sensors and datalinks — and putting them into the CCAs that will fly near the jet, said a second industry official. That would allow the service to focus on optimizing the range, improved stealth and aerodynamic performance of the sixth-generation fighter, but would have a few major downsides, the official said. First, there is a 'pretty significant' expense associated with all of those attributes, even if costs can be cut by segregating the NGAD fighter’s mission systems, the official said. And because the fighter will be reliant on those CCAs for mission capability, those drones may also need to have a similar level of stealth and range, potentially increasing CCA unit costs as well. Potentially even more important, that concept would make the NGAD pilot much more dependent on the survival of the CCAs hosting critically needed subsystems like datalinks and electronic warfare systems, as taking down those drones could erode the fighter jet’s own chance of completing the mission and making it home. In essence, offloading systems from the fighter to CCAs means the two have to be seen as one inseparable package – one which comes with potentially greater risk for the mission and possibly greater cost overall, as CCA prices could swell as a result. 'It's natural to want a Rolls-Royce for the target price of a Cadillac,' said Jeremiah Gertler, senior analyst at the Teal Group. 'The question is whether you get either of those, or wind up with Frankencar.' While aerospace companies are not permitted to confirm their involvement in the ultra-secretive NGAD program, Breaking Defense understands that Lockheed Martin and Boeing were vying for the NGAD contract before the Air Force hit pause on the program this summer. (Northrop Grumman CEO Kathy Warden acknowledged last year that Northrop no longer planned to compete for NGAD, though she has since said the company could reassess that decision depending how the Air Force rescopes the competition.) RELATED: As Air Force deliberates sixth-gen fighter plans, much is at stake for Boeing Asked about Kendall’s comments, Lockheed said its Skunk Works advanced development is adept at delivering both innovative and cost-effective solutions to meet urgent national security requirements. 'As we learn more about the requirements for NGAD, we’ll assess what it will take to meet the need,' the company said in a statement. Boeing declined to comment. Northrop did not respond to a request for comment. Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst with AeroDynamic Advisories, said the focus on the cost-element of Kendall’s comments is burying the more significant acknowledgement from the Air Force — that it no longer needs a 'super fighter' like NGAD and is more interested in disaggregating capabilities and networking them together. Which raises the question about whether it needs a manned fighter altogether if it can just put those capabilities into drones, said Aboulafia, who joked that the Air Force may be 'quiet quitting' the NGAD program. 'The idea of backing away from a next-gen super fighter is just anathema to the service’s DNA,' Aboulafia said. 'There's no doubt about its utility in all military scenarios… it's the formula that's always worked. No drawback at all, except, oh Jesus, it costs $300 million. And we don't want to spend that because you'll never get the mass you need.' While it was 'always the plan' to offload some NGAD mission requirements to CCAs, 'it's possible that the Air Force has learned that more is possible than its earlier assessments,' Byron Callan said in a note to investors on Tuesday. Callan added that the emphasis on lower cost hints that the reworked concept for NGAD will have to be easier to produce and upgrade than an F-35, another potential challenge. Assuming that the Air Force actually can get the price down to what Kendall wants, Callan noted there could be one significant benefit: lowering the price per unit significantly, and offboarding some of the most sensitive and presumably export-controlled systems, would potentially open the door for the Air Force to position it for foreign sales. Previously, experts told Breaking Defense that the $300 million price point for NGAD was totally unaffordable for export customers. While the Air Force has never indicated it would be willing to sell NGAD to allies and partners, if its price dropped to about $100 million, the sixth-generation jet would be on an equal playing field as the F-35, which hasn't lost an fighter competition so far. (Currently, there are two sixth-generation fighters in development by American allies, one by a Franco-German team and one by the UK, Italy and Japan.)

Iraq boosts air defenses with reported $2.8B deal for South Korean Cheongung-II	A joint force of the Iraqi Army and Hashed al-Shaabi (Popular Mobilisation Forces) paramilitaries patrols an area of the the Baaj desert in Iraq's northern Nineveh province, near the Syrian border, during a security operation in search of reported remnants of the Islamic State (IS) jihadist group on September 15, 2024. (Photo by ZAID AL-OBEIDI/AFP via Getty Images) BEIRUT — As Iraqi and US officials negotiate the details of the withdrawal of US forces from the region, Baghad could soon get some air defense reassurance courtesy of a new reported $2.8 billion deal to buy South Korean missile systems. Iraq's Ministry of Defense announced Thursday that it signed a contract with a South Korean company to procure a number of advanced medium-range batteries, 'which will support the capabilities of the Iraqi armed forces and military forces to maintain peace and Iraq’s sovereignty.' In the ministry statement Iraq's defense chief said he considered the deal a 'qualitative strategic breakthrough for [the country’s] air defense as it covers all Iraqi airspace and achieves the regional balance of the country.' The Iraqi statement didn't reveal specifics, but South Korean and international press have since reported that South Korea's LIG Nex1 defense firm said it will provide the Cheongung-II air defense system for $2.8 billion. RELATED: How South Korea's defense industry transformed itself into a global player The deal comes as Iraqi armed forces are conducting counter-terrorism operations, mainly against ISIS, and as they've seen armed drone attacks against coalition bases, blamed on Iran-backed militias. With Iraq's purchase, LIG Nex1 has secured its third export deal for the Cheongung-II system — all three Arab countries: the United Arab Emirates, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and now Iraq. South Korean news outlet Yonhap described the system as designed to intercept missiles and aircraft, with an effect range of 40 kilometers against targets up to 15 kilometers in the sky. (In South Korea, the Cheongung-II reportedly operates as the middle layer in a three-layered system with US-made Patriots handling lower tier threats and THAAD handling the upper tiers.) LIG Nex1 is expected to manufacture the missile and integrated system, Hanwha Systems will supply the radar, and Hanwha Aerospace will supply the launchers and vehicles, according to Yonhap. The purchase comes after Iraqi officials have said they have negotiated with the US for an extensive drawdown of foreign troops, a move that experts say is bound to test the Iraqi military's ability to maintain security in the country.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/iraq-boosts-air-defenses-with-reported-2-8b-deal-for-south-korean-cheongung-ii/	2024-09-20T08:42:36-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/240920_iraq_soldier_GettyImages-2171594553-e1726843185359.jpg
B-21, Columbia-class among programs hit under longterm CR, military leaders warn	The B-21 Raider continues to progress in ground testing with the commencement of engine runs at Northrop Grumman’s facilities in Palmdale, Calif. (Photo Credit: Northrop Grumman) WASHINGTON — Increased production of munitions, initial fielding of the B-21 stealth bomber and Columbia-class submarine construction could all be jeopardized by a long-term continuing resolution in fiscal 2025, according to a parade of top Pentagon officials. Congress has about a week to pass a stopgap funding bill by the end of Sept. 30, when FY24 ends and government money runs out. However, after the House rejected a plan by House Speaker Mike Johnson that would have provided federal agencies a bridge until March, House and Senate leaders are scrambling to hammer out a last minute deal. Johnson’s continuing resolution was soundly rebuffed by Democrats, who objected to his addition of the right-leaning SAVE Act to the bill. It was also opposed by more than a dozen Republicans on fiscal grounds or due to concerns that a six-month CR could harm national defense. On Thursday, The Hill reported that Johnson could release a new CR proposal as early as Sunday. 'The aim here is to be pretty minimal, as close to a clean CR as we can do,' House Appropriations Committee Chairman Tom Cole said, according to the report. Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Thursday took procedural steps that would allow the upper chamber to advance its own version of a CR, despite the precedent that spending bills first move through the House. RELATED: Harris administration's Pentagon should focus on defense innovation, top HASC Dem says The Pentagon’s ability to execute its strategy — including its deterrence of China — hinges on getting the funds it needs for innovation and modernization, 'which cannot happen under a CR,' wrote Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in a Sept. 7 letter to Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee. 'Asking the Department to compete with the [People’s Republic of China], let alone manage conflicts in Europe and the Middle East, while under a lengthy CR, ties our hands behind our back while expecting us to be agile and to accelerate progress,' he said. 'We cannot buy back this time, but we can stop digging the hole.' In particular, Austin warned that a six-month CR would leave Congress with little time before an April 30 deadline, when across-the-board sequestration cuts will go into effect unless lawmakers have passed full-year appropriations bills. Austin’s letter to has since been followed by several others by defense leaders, urging Congress to keep a CR short and pass an annual defense appropriations bill as soon as possible. Here’s what officials are concerned about: Army Secretary Christine Wormuth sent lawmakers a letter Wednesday warning that a six-month CR would have 'significant consequences' on the service’s ability to 'maintain national security' and the quality of life for soldiers and their families. 'The Army’s inability to start new programs or realign funds to match emerging needs would reduce our purchasing power and create meaningful costs as well as schedule risk to Army program,' Wormuth continued. More specifically, she said that up to $8.2 billion in 'critical investments' for recruiting, training and weapons development would be delayed, and a subsequent letter said that under a six-month CR, 13 new start procurement programs and three development increases would be delayed. A six-month CR would also impact two planned production rate increases and eight military construction projects When it comes to air and missile defense, for example, that half-year CR would postpone a $403 million award for a Patriot intercept order, and delay development of the Integrated Battle Command System. Plans to buy two new Company-Level Small Uncrewed Aircraft Systems would be halted, while Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) production would be delayed because the service would not move ahead acquiring long-led items like solid rocket motors and guidance kits. For the Department of the Air Force, which encompasses both the Air Force and Space Force, Secretary Frank Kendall warned that a six-month CR would harm personnel. For example, Kendall said a CR would adversely affect basic pay, housing and other routine payments service members need. A prolonged budget impasse would additionally stall efforts to implement recommendations on sexual assault and suicide prevention and response from the Pentagon’s Independent Review Commission, as well as reduce aircraft mission capable rates and aircrew readiness, he added. Modernization projects from both services would also be hampered, Kendall said. For the Air Force, that could mean 'prevent[ing] production increases' of key munitions like the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile-Extended Range (JASSM-ER), Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM) and the service’s new Stand-In Attack Weapon (SiAW). Initial operational capability for the Air Force's B-21 Raider would additionally be delayed, according to Kendall, and there would be impacts to other programs like the recapitalization of the nation’s nuclear ballistic missiles. The Space Force would similarly see development of 'launch and range test system software' halted, Kendall said. And if the CR dragged on for a year, the secretary said his 'operational imperatives' would take a hit, such as efforts to shift tracking capabilities to space. Other high-profile programs to field new space systems like modernized GPS and missile warning/missile tracking would also suffer setbacks, according to Kendall. Writing for the Navy and Marine Corps, Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro said a prolonged CR could delay construction of Virginia-class attack submarines and Columbia-class ballistic missile submarines, as well as inhibit investments needed for the submarine industrial base. The Navy would also not be able to award a contract for a new medium landing ship. A six-month CR would have 'profound' impacts on the Marine Corps' force design efforts, 'slowing key acquisition programs,' Del Toro wrote. For instance, increased procurement of the CH-53K helicopter, amphibious combat vehicle and joint light tactical vehicle would be limited by a CR. In her own letter, Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Lisa Franchetti asserted a six-month CR 'would cause profound, damaging impact' to the service and 'impos[e] unnecessary hardship on our Sailors, civilians and their families,' including the elimination of most new bonus awards. The CR could also impact maintenance of the aircraft carrier Harry S. Truman (CVN-75) and impede the service’s marquee hypersonic weapon program, she wrote.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/b-21-columbia-class-among-programs-hit-under-longterm-cr-military-leaders-warn/	2024-09-20T07:35:09-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/09/b21-northrop-scaled.jpeg
Lasers on ships by 2030: Rheinmetall and MBDA launch joint bid	Germany's Rheinmetall and MBDA have unveiled plans for joint development of a naval based laser weapon (Rheinmetall) BELFAST — Germany’s Rheinmetall and European missile firm MBDA announced a laser weapons cooperation agreement today, in a bid to jointly develop a maritime-based system and bring it to market 'within the next five to six years.' Rheinmetall provided the timeline in a company statement and added that the future solution 'opens up new possibilities, particularly in relation to drone defence on ships.' Both industry partners, 'are convinced that their complementary skills in the field of laser weapon technology will enable them to successfully develop a military laser weapon system,' said Rheinmetall. The cooperation agreement builds off steps taken by both parties in September 2023 to set 'prerequisites' for the development of a 'first laser weapon,' including a commitment to make 'internal preparations' for the new platform’s development phase. The companies have previously teamed for a demonstration onboard the German navy's F124 air defense Sachsen frigate, which fired over 100 test shots. The demonstrator delivered on 'all aspects' of 'combat effectiveness' ranging from, 'detection and tracking…the interplay of sensors, command and weapon engagement systems and effectors; possible rules of engagement,' through to target engagement, according to Rheinmetall. Laser weapons are considered a cost effective alternative to naval based missiles being expended to shootdown cheap drones, with the UK’s in development DragonFire high energy laser, for example, said to cost £10 ($13) a shot. There are obvious applications for that given what is happening in the Red Sea over the last year, where US ships are using expensive rounds to take down small cruise missiles or drones. Though the promise offered by laser weapons is clear, they typically have long research and development phases, largely because of design challenges involving beam stability and power sustainment, both of which are critical to stay on target and destroy it. There's a reason there's an old joke in defense circles that 'lasers are the weapon of the future, and always will be.' US Navy Rear Adm. Fred Pyle, Director of the Surface Warfare Division, or N96, and responsible for managing the service’s laser technology weapon efforts, said in January that the US Navy and industry should be more 'intellectually honest' with one another about capabilities of laser systems. He also criticized a 'tendency to over promise and under deliver.' Still, there is a growing sense that lasers are becoming real utility, particularly for missile defense. For instance, Israel’s Rafael, manufacturer of the 100kW class Iron Beam ground-based laser air defense system, told Breaking Defense in March that the new system is expected to be fielded 'by the end of 2025.' The company claims, there is 'almost zero cost per interception' when employing the high energy solution, which is also said to be capable of destroying a 'wide array of threats from a range of hundreds of meters to several kilometers.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/lasers-on-ships-by-2030-rheinmetall-and-mbda-launch-joint-bid/	2024-09-20T06:55:55-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/Foto-Credit_Miroslav-Gyurosi-2-scaled-e1726836535955.jpg
Debris and a deadly mission: The vital context around Ukraine’s lost F-16	The rite of burial of Ukrainian F-16 pilot Oleksiy Mes, on the Day of Remembrance for Fallen Heroes, as hundreds attended a farewell ceremony for the deceased tactical aviation pilot in the central square of the city on August 29, 2024 in Shepetivka, in Khmelnytskyi Oblast (province) Ukraine. Oleksiy Mes, an F-16 pilot, died on August 26 as a result of an air crash during one of the largest massive missile attacks on Ukraine. On that day, Oleksiy reportedly shot down three enemy missiles and one UAV. (Libkos/Getty Images) FT. LAUDERDALE, Fla. — When Ukraine’s first F-16s finally arrived in country at the start of August, it was cause for much celebration by Kyiv’s supporters. And so the loss of one of those F-16s just weeks later hit especially hard, and immediately launched questions about what went wrong. Some questioned whether the pilots were rushed through training. Others wondered if the crash showed that the F-16 wasn’t even fit for Ukraine’s mission. Meanwhile, the families and friends of Col. Oleksiy 'Moonfish' Mes, the jet’s pilot who had travelled to the US previously to meet with members of Congress and encourage them to send F-16s to Kyiv’s defense, were left to mourn the loss. Information has been locked down about the incident, given its high-profile nature for the Zelneskyy government. The loss of an F-16 so soon after having received them means the issue is 'doubly sensitive, if not more so, and no one is talking officially,' according to one high-ranking defense industry executive. But some details of the incident have come out, and sources have helped fill in some gaps for Breaking Defense, including around the theory that the loss was the result of shrapnel that hit the plane. With it comes a picture of an incredibly dangerous mission where the loss of jets may have been more a question of when, not if — a deadly reality that, Ukrainian experts say, is being exacerbated by the patchwork of capabilities Kyiv has been forced to use in its defense. First, some context. Moonfish’s mission, according to several sources and public reports, was to operate alongside other F-16s, in conjunction with US-made Patriot and other air defense batteries on the ground. The assignment was to take down missiles and drones being fired by the Russians against targets in Ukraine. It’s important to understand how complex that operating environment is. In Aug. 2022, Breaking Defense talked with several pilots and officers from the Ukrainian air force (PSU) who explained how the fleet of aging MiGs and Sukhois have been performing the air defense mission. They recalled successfully shooting down incoming Russian cruise missiles with the Russian-designed, semi-active air-to-air missiles originally designed to be fired from these aircraft. But, they said, the mission was by its nature a hazardous one. 'You have a split-second, if that much time, to decide to lock on and fire one of the air-to-air weapons against these incoming missiles,' said one of the pilots. 'They are coming at high speeds, and they have to be intercepted before they have passed you. Catching them in a tail chase is not possible in many cases.' In these same meetings the PSU discussed how they specifically needed the F-16 for this mission. The American-made jet comes with more agile flight controls, better radars and fire-and-forget weapons that would in theory be more effective against the Kh-32 and other long-range cruise missiles being launched against targets in Ukraine. On the night that Moonfish was lost, he and his squadron were apparently engaged in precisely this kind of operation. According to a statement by the Ukraine General Staff 'during the aerial battle, the F-16 aircraft demonstrated their high efficiency, four enemy cruise missiles were shot down by airborne weapons.' What happened next, according to the statement, was 'during the approach to the next target, contact with one of the aircraft was lost. As it turned out later, the plane crashed, the pilot died.'

Ukrainian defense industry specialists, who are closely intertwined with the military and support both the air defense units and F-16s, told Breaking Defense that these missile intercept missions involving fighter aircraft and air defense batteries operating jointly require precision coordination. Complicating this coordination, multiple sources said, is the fact that neither the PSU fighters nor the air defense units on the ground are using IFF in these engagements. In the beginning of the war, confusion about IFF with both the Russian and Ukraine sides operating some of the same aircraft presented concerns about mistaking one side’s aircraft for another. This practice of not utilizing IFF has been continued with the F-16s now in service. (The MoD and PSU did not return requests for comment on the use of IFF by press time.) This caused several industry and military sources — and even a member of the Ukraine parliament — to claim the F-16 was a victim of friendly fire. A PSU representative, speaking to multiple outlets, later stated, 'different versions [of the crash] are being considered, including the ‘friendly fire’ of their air defence systems, a technical malfunction and pilot error.' (That doesn’t rule out friendly fire, but stops well short of confirming it; a final answer is likely to only come out following a thorough review.) One scenario floating among the Ukrainian defense community is that the F-16 flew inadvertently through a cloud of debris created by the successful intercept and destruction of one of the incoming Russian missiles. These fragments of the destroyed missile may have caused damage to the engine and other parts of the aircraft, causing the F-16 to break apart and/or the death of the pilot before he could eject. This version is emerging as one of the more plausible scenarios, due to past precedence, as one of the same industry executives told Breaking Defense that 'earlier in the war we lost four other fighters to this same cause of airborne foreign objects disabling the aircraft.' 'There were two MiG-29s and two Sukhoi models lost in this way,' he continued. 'It is very possible that this F-16 now makes it aircraft No. 5. The previous losses did not generate this kind of attention because they were not expensive, modern fighters in the class of the American jet.' Normally, Ukraine gives clear descriptions of what caused jets to be lost, but there are a handful of incidents where the descriptor given is vague and fit what the industry executive described, including the loss of Mig-29s on March 13, 2022 and Oct. 12, 2022, a Su-24 on May 19, 2022, and two Su-27s on June 5, 2022 and March 28, 2023, respectively. Neither the PSU or MOD responded to a request for comment on this claim. The only way to ensure that a similar tragedy does not occur again, said one military officer, 'is to provide us with the additional air defence assets we have been asking to be given for more than two years. 'Until the ground-based air defence network is extensive and redundant enough on its own we will have to keep using fighter jets to protect our cities, our people, our power plants, our hospitals, etc. from Russian missile strikes. It is a dangerous mission, and I fear more aircraft will be lost in this same tragic manner.'

(Vitalii Nosach/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images) Supporters of Kyiv have complained about how long the US has taken to train Ukrainian pilots, while the US has in turn emphasized the dangers of rushing pilot training. Moonfish’s death immediately reignited that back and forth, despite the ongoing lack of clarity on what happened in the air that day. Certainly, there are numerous differences in its overall design of the F-16 compared to the Mikoyan MiG-29s and Sukhoi Su-27s that have been the mainstay of the PSU fighter force. These represent 'challenging hurdles that have to be overcome in the course of a training regime,' said a NATO member-nation test pilot who spoke to Breaking Defense in response to the event. Some of the more significant among these are: Despite these difficulties, however, the record to date was that the Ukrainian pilots had acquitted themselves well in learning to operate the F-16, and despite regular sorties in the month since Moonfish’s death, there have been no reports of pilot difficulties. An unnamed source who spoke to CNN and other media stated, 'the Ukraine Armed Forces do not believe pilot error was behind the incident.' The lack of experience with the F-16 could certainly have contributed in a situation where the pilot, unused to the intricacies of flying the American-jet, was unable to react as he would have with another jet. But the reality is the answers may never be found as to what role, if any, the speed of training had on the mission’s deadly outcome. Speaking this week at the annual Air and Space Forces Association conference outside Washington, Gen. James Hecker, the head of US Air Forces in Europe, said that 'As far as the aircraft accident with the F-16 and unfortunately losing a pilot, there's an ongoing investigation that Ukraine is conducting. We've offered our help in that investigation. We'll see if they take us up on that offer. 'But anything that comes out of that, and any preliminary things that we're taking a look at to develop into training, both in Denmark as well as the US, to see if there's any changes that we need to make to the training to make sure that this doesn't happen again.'

(Photo by Vitalii Nosach/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images) If there has to be a top-level 'lesson learned' from this loss, it may be that integrating a new platform into a military that is engaged in a high-intensity conflict needs to be understood as a gradual process. There are specific examples in the past of post-Soviet militaries operating both western and Russian-designed fighter aircraft, but where they differ from the Ukrainian approach is that those air forces tend to employ those new aircraft in complementary, but distinctly different, missions. Most new F-16 users would not want to immediately put the aircraft into a role that has been filled for more than two years by the MiG-29 and Sukhoi models, as the PSU did when it put the F-16 aircraft into a missile-hunting assignment. More broadly, the situation also serves as a reminder that the F-16s are not a cure-all for the ongoing conflict. But this downing also doesn’t mean the F-16 is a failure. Speaking at an event in July, Hecker stated that it would be unrealistic to expect the F-16s to have an immediate and dramatic impact in the air power dimension of the war. 'It’s not going to be the … golden bullet, that all of a sudden, they have F-16s, and now they’re going to go out and gain air superiority,' he said. What will make a difference in the long run, he explained, is the ability to more effectively employ US air-launched weapons. Up to now the PSU has been 'dropping them off MiG-29s and Su-24s. Now they’re going to have the opportunity to actually drop them off of an airplane that they were designed to come off of, which will give them more capability to change the targets in flight and things like that.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/debris-and-a-deadly-mission-the-vital-context-around-ukraines-lost-f-16/	2024-09-20T06:12:30-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/ukraine-pilot-f16-funeral-scaled-e1726836593725.jpg
EXLUSIVE: Pentagon making ‘significant push’ for money to upgrade Satellite Control Network	BlueHalo's deployable ground system, based on a multi-band phased array antenna design, will replace the Satellite Control Network's old parabolic dish antennas. (BlueHalo) AMOS 2024 — Military commanders and Pentagon officials are pushing for extra funds to speed up the Space Rapid Capabilities Office's Satellite Communications Augmentation Resource (SCAR) program to field modernized antennas for the antiquated Satellite Control Network (SCN), according to Space RCO Director Kelly Hammett. 'There is a significant push for more [funding] currently in discussion with the Congress, with CAPE [Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation office], with others,' he told Breaking Defense on Tuesday on the margins of the annual Advanced Maui Optical and Space Surveillance Technologies (AMOS) conference. Hammet said that though the SCAR program has been in the works for a couple of years, it is being seen as more urgent for keeping satellite communications flowing as top brass have begun to worry more about possible great power conflict with China and/or Russia. 'In the last six months, the importance of SCAR to the future comms architecture for space has been significantly elevated. Why? It's recognized that in a time of conflict, the legacy SCN does not have the capacity to be able to see to the necessary assets to fight the fight when when things go from a peacetime footing to a dynamic space operations environment,' he said. 'When we shift to that footing, the necessary cadence of commanding and controlling satellites to move, hide, run, and fight goes up significantly.' 'It's no longer we're pushing SCAR on everybody else,' he said. 'It's like, &#8216;give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, and give to me as fast as you can.' The current system under SCN includes 19 old-style parabolic antennas located at seven locations around the world. and performs control functions consisting of tracking (determining where a satellite is located), telemetry (collecting information about its health and status) and command (transmitting signals to control subsystems and maneuvering satellites if necessary). SCAR would replace those old antennas, which can only connect with one satellite at a time, with modern phased-array antennas that are capable of simultaneously contacting between 18 to 20 satellites. With the Space Force planning to field more and more satellites, that extra capacity is necessary to keep them all flying, according to officers at the 22nd Space Operations Squadron responsible for that mission. 'Parabolic dishes, you know, have a lot of moving parts. You gotta steer them around. You got motors, you got gears, you got all that, and those are typically the things that wear out and break in corrosive environments,' Hammet explained. 'And so with the phased array, you don't have that. You have electronically steerable beams.' Space RCO — created by Congress in the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act as a semi-independent agency to rapidly field capabilities to US Space Command — launched SCAR in May 2022 with an Other Transaction Authority award worth up to $1.4 billion to BlueHalo. The contract covers delivery of up to 12 of the company's BADGER ground system units, which are based on a multi-band, software-defined, phased-array antenna design, by the early 2030s. Already, first deliveries have been 'accelerated,' Hammet said, with two extra units funded in the fiscal 2025 budget request to be deployed in the Indo-Pacific region rather than a single prototype, bringing the total of funded systems up to three. And, he suggested, there might be an appetite for even more units than originally planned. To that potential end, BlueHalo has invested to ensure it can produce more units at a faster pace, Mary Clum, portfolio president and corporate executive vice president, told Breaking Defense. 'We set up the manufacturing line ready to build at a capacity that's greater than the need. So, 20 per year is the capacity. So we're ready to say we can bring that with the dual lines in the factory and the option to scale to a third, if there is more demand signal,' she said. Clum said that BlueHalo at this point could further accelerate deliveries, for example to provide up to six units by around 2028. 'That's the acceleration we're advocating for,' she said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/pentagon-making-significant-push-for-money-to-speed-satellite-control-network-upgrade-effort/	2024-09-20T04:41:22-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/badger-production-floor-scaled.jpg
‘They run on information’: SAIC nabs $229M NORAD, NORTHCOM modernization contract	An 149th Intelligence Squadron airman conducts training in a computer training lab at Mather Field, California Dec. 2, 2023. (Tech. Sgt. Joseph Courtney, 195th Wing) 'The combatant commands like NORAD, NORTHCOM, they run on information. Their ability to have situational awareness with regards to, I'll say current events, as well as emerging threats, and especially with the intensifying challenges we have from an overall national security standpoint up around the Arctic region [where] we're getting tested more and more by China, by Russia,' Executive Vice President of the company's Air Force and Combatant Commands Business Group Vinnie DiFronzo said. 'This is both with regards to testing near our air borders, as well as the evolving cyber threat. 'If we do not secure this properly and make sure that their systems are operating effectively, then their decision-making is going to be degraded,' he said of the commands. 'And you know, overall US national security will be degraded accordingly.' On Wednesday the company announced it had received the $229 million contract as part of the NORAD and NORTHCOM Information Technology Enterprise Services (NITES) program, which is designed to provide the two combatant commands with IT management services, delivery and maintenance. Though the original request for proposal to industry was pretty 'generic,' SAIC executive Vinnie DiFronzo told Breaking Defense, the needs would likely revolve around moving the combatant commands to the cloud and building a more 'resilient' cybersecurity architecture in line with where the Pentagon sees zero trust principles going. DiFronzo added that the modernization efforts will also likely include artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies. The idea is that this will help the commands efficiently sort through their data so it can be leveraged more easily. He said having AI and ML baked into their systems will also help bolster cybersecurity concerns. 'As a trend going forward, we will be using more AI and ML to be able to address emerging cyber problems, both to mitigate them, as well as to detect those problems as they emerge, because that's an evolving threat as well,' he said. DiFronzo also said SAIC’s recent work on the Air Force's Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS) Cloud Based Command and Control (CBC2) program will help the company provide more advanced IT capabilities for NORAD and USNORTHCOM. The Pentagon awarded SAIC a $112 million contract in January 2023 to develop the ABMS cloud-based command and control software integrator program for NORAD, USNORTHCOM and the Pacific Air Forces. 'We were able to in part leverage the experience that we've had with the Advanced Battle Management System cloud-based C2 program, ' DiFronzo said. 'So [there is] a lot of potential synergy there between this current mission IT system that they have, what we've already done there, to be able to marry that and allow them to modernize more quickly.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/they-run-on-information-saic-nabs-229m-norad-northcom-modernization-contract/	2024-09-19T12:49:45-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/240919_DVIDS_northcom_computer_8201957-scaled-e1726767561824.jpg
Harris administration’s Pentagon should focus on defense innovation, top HASC Dem says	U.S. Rep. Adam Smith of Washington, the ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee, questions Deputy Secretary of Defense Ashton B. Carter, not shown, as Carter testifies during a hearing of the House Armed Services Committee on Sequestration Implementation Options and the Effects on National Defense: Administration Perspectives Aug. 1, 2012, in Washington, D.C. (DoD photo by Glenn Fawcett/Released) WASHINGTON—The top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee would like to see a Kamala Harris administration tackle defense innovation, honing in on how the Pentagon can speed up the purchase of emerging technologies, he said today. 'I'd like to see in a Harris administration, a commitment to the innovation reform agenda at DoD,' said Washington Rep. Adam Smith during The Hill’s future of defense conference. 'That really has, I think, stalled a little bit since Ash Carter left, frankly,' he said, referencing Obama-era Defense Secretary Ashton Carter, who made interfacing with Silicon Valley and harnessing commercial technology a priority during his tenure. Smith’s statements could carry some weight with a future Harris White House, as he is the forerunner to take over the House Armed Services Committee if the Democrats take back the House in November elections. Asked about his agenda if named HASC chairman next year, Smith — who previously led the committee from 2019 to 2022 — said 'number one' is to induce the Defense Department to more rapidly adopt critically-needed technologies, especially in the realm of secure communications, information systems, drones and counter-drone tech, missiles and missile defense 'How do we speed up that process?' he said. 'Overlaying all of it is, get DoD to be better at buying software. And we've got a lot of different ideas for how do we do that.' Other key areas of focus would include personnel-related initiatives — the priority of the HASC’s FY25 National Defense Authorization Act provisions — as well as building on the AUKUS agreement to improve defense cooperation with other allies and partner nations, Smith said, adding that those priorities will likely remain the same regardless of whether he or current chairman Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Ala. leads the committee next year. Earlier this week, HASC members traveled to Silicon Valley for a hearing on defense innovation and fielding technology — the first field hearing the committee had conducted in 40 years, Smith said in opening comments for the hearing. Lawmakers heard testimony from executives at defense startups including Palantir, Saildrone, Skydio, Shield AI and Applied Intuition. During today’s event, Smith added that his intent was not to 'pick nits' about current Pentagon leadership, noting that the wars in Ukraine, in Gaza and other geopolitical issues had directed department interest away from defense innovation. 'What [Defense] Secretary [Lloyd] Austin has been really good at is building coalitions,' he said. 'They've been busy. But I do think that we've lost that central focus on how to change the way the Pentagon does business so it can move more quickly in buying software and new technology.' Congress has little more than a week to pass a stopgap bill to fund the government before money runs out at the end of Sept. 30. Last night, the House voted down a continuing resolution — named because it maintains government funding for a new fiscal year at the same level as the previous one — in a 202-220 vote. A total of 14 Republicans, including Rogers, voted against the draft CR helmed by House Speaker Mike Johnson. The proposed bill would have extended government funding through March, adding about $2 billion for submarines as well attaching a controversial voter ID bill. 'I thought of it as sort of fanatic-on-fanatic violence,' Smith said. 'You had one group of people who were insisting that we had to have this ridiculous anti voting law and a six month CR. You had another group of people insisting, no, we have to dramatically slash the budget. They couldn't even get on the same page.' The Senate will probably vote on its own version of a CR bill, filed by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, sometime next week, said Nebraska Sen. Deb Fischer, the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services strategic forces subcommittee. Fischer said she would be supportive of a shorter CR bill that does not extend into calendar year 2025. 'I would like us to be able to address the needs we have in this current year, get it done before the end of the year, so no matter who wins the presidency, we can start moving ahead and start planning for what we need soon as possible in January,' she said. Virginia Rep. Rob Wittman, the No. 2 Republican on HASC, said the most likely outcome is a CR with very few funding exceptions or additions that extends until some time in December. 'I think we have to get something done fairly soon — that would be by the middle of next week,' he said. 'If the House doesn't, I think the Senate is going to act, and the Senate will send over theirs.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/harris-administrations-pentagon-should-focus-on-defense-innovation-top-hasc-dem-says/	2024-09-19T12:01:45-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/639710-scaled-e1646326785598.jpg
EXCLUSIVE: Space Systems Command head’s ‘action plan’ to focus on command structure, outreach	Lt. Gen. Philip Garrant, commander, Space Force Space Systems Command (left). (US Space Force photo by Senior Airman Kadielle Shaw) AMOS 2024 — Ahead of a formal rollout in coming days, the head of Space Systems Command revealed to Breaking Defense three new 'major efforts' detailed in his 'action plan' — an initiative he hopes will hone the command during his time in the hotseat and beyond. In an exclusive interview on the sidelines of the annual Advanced Maui Optical and Space Surveillance Technologies (AMOS) conference, Lt. Gen. Philip Garrant identified the three efforts as shaping the command's structure to meet the needs program leaders, developing the workforce and reaching out to SSC's 'stakeholders,' including commercial industry and allies. The plan, which he intends to reveal in full during SSC's next set of 'industry days' Oct. 23-24 in Los Angeles, 'will absolutely cover my tenure into '26, but it's designed to be even a little bit more &#8216;future' than that,' he said. But the discussion was not only about the future of SCC. Garrant also weighed in on two key embattled Space Force development programs — the next-generation GPS ground system, and the ATLAS software necessary to update the service's 1980's-era command and control computer network for space domain awareness — citing progress on both. While SSC is fundamentally an acquisition command, Garrant himself has no direct buying power. Instead, the purse strings are controlled by five program executive officers (PEOs) who report to the Air Force's space acquisition head, Frank Calvelli. However, Garrant explained that he does have the responsibility for ensuring that PEOs are properly resourced and staffed. 'As the commander, I'm responsible for the quality of the work that gets delivered, because I'm responsible for the workforce,' he said. Thus, the 'first focus' of his 'commander's plan' is 'making sure that we're structured right, so that the PEOs can do their job,' Garrant said. This includes moving people around to ensure that each of the acquisition leaders are fully supported with the right types of staff. Secondly, he intends to put energy into 'workforce development' for both military and civilian personnel to ensure they are trained in how to manage acquisition programs with a keen eye on getting space capabilities to the field as quickly as possible to meet the looming threats from China and Russia. This includes 'creating the culture and developing acquisition leaders' to truly take to heart the SSC motto developed by Garrant's predecessor, Lt. Gen. Michael Guetlein: 'Exploit what we have, buy what we can, and build only what we must.' Garrant acknowledged that this is easier said than done, in particular with regard to increasing Space Force's reliance on commercial providers by buying available products and services. The goal, he explained, is to make commercial buys 'inherent in the acquisition process' by feeding those programs into the budget planning cycle upfront — 'then that is success.' 'It's really hard,' he said. 'We are very comfortable in the old ways of doing business,' he said. Garrant's final focus for his tenure is 'is a commitment to better connection with our &#8230; external stakeholders, an engagement and a meaningful, almost a back-to-basics approach to when we used to have agreements with the operators on &#8216;here's the capability we're going to deliver',' he said, as well as 'a commitment to be transparent.' Part of that approach to working more closely with operators is being addressed by the Space Force's plan to create Integrated Mission Deltas, or IMDs, that are co-led by acquisition officers under SSC and operations personnel from Space Operations Command, and have responsibility for sustainment of associated kit. The service stood up the first two last September, and is working to expand the concept to all of its mission areas. (Deltas are the Space Force equivalent of Air Force wing and group commands.) Accompanying the IMDs, which are focused on operations, are the Integrated Systems Deltas. The latter, Garrant explained, are focused on development programs. 'You can think of a very traditional, large, Major Defense Acquisition Program,' he said, 'that is still in development early in the acquisition lifecycle.' (A Major Defense Acquisition Program is a research and development program valued at more than $525 million in fiscal year 2020 dollars, or a procurement program worth more than $3.065 billion in FY20 dollars.) In addition to SSC's Space Force stakeholders, Garrant noted that the command also is working on outreach to allied and partner nations. 'We also recognize that there is significant value in engaging with our international partners. Our nation's integrated deterrence strategy requires robust collaboration and information sharing with our allies,' he said in his keynote address at the AMOS conference. 'International partnerships are critical to our long term SDA [space domain awareness] posture, unfortunately, allied partners were traditionally on the sidelines due to a lack of data sharing infrastructures.' SSC is looking to fix that, he said, by creating a new 'standardized interface' to the Unified Data Library (UDL), called the 'Allied Exchange Environment or AXE,' designed 'to facilitate near real-time two-way operational data exchange between the US and foreign allied partners.' AXE, Garrant told Breaking Defense, will be a 'technical infrastructure' that will allow allies and partners to tap into the UDL's space monitoring database. 'We're going to expose the data to the allies, and then the allies can use the data. They can put their own tools on the data. They can ingest the data to their national databases if they want. They can contribute back,' he said. Elsewhere in the discussion, Garrant also addressed two of the Space Force's troubled developmental programs that have been called out by Calvelli for their continued shortfalls: the GPS Next Generation Operational Control System (OCX); and the Advanced Tracking and Launch Analysis System (ATLAS) software. OCX is needed for the Space Force to have 'full control' of the jam-resistant, military-only GPS signal, as well as provide command and control of the latest model GPS satellites. Developed by RTX (formerly Raytheon), the OCX program has been a poster child for broken acquisition, having been originally planned to begin operations more than a decade ago. But now, Garrant said, OCX now is 'on track' toward 'operational acceptance.' 'The site acceptance test is the last milestone for OCX acceptance by the government. We anticipate that this winter. We have had some delays since the last baseline, but frankly, those are attributable to external bases and resources, frankly, outside our control. I won't say it's an excuse, it's an explanation. But we are on track to complete site acceptance tests and formally accept OCX,' he said. ATLAS is being designed by prime contractor L3Harris as the latest Pentagon effort to replace 1970s-era Space Defense Operations Center (SPADOC) computer system for managing data from the military’s network of radar and telescopes that detect and track objects on orbit to provide space domain awareness (SDA) to operators. It too is making progress, Garrant said, after a series of delays. 'So First Lt. Garrant was working on a system to get us off of SPADOC 30 years ago,' he said, referring to the long and storied history of the failed Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC) Mission System (JMS). (Garrant started his career as a systems engineer.) 'We anticipate doing delivery of a minimum viable product for ATLAS this winter, and go into the trial period. Presuming success out of trial period, it would be operational at the end of next year, with the intent of turning off SPADOC' Garrant said. The Space Force originally planned the ATLAS minimum viable capability to debut in 2022. Garrant said that one of the things the Space Force has come to realize about software-heavy command and control programs such as OCX and ATLAS is that they are used differently by operators at different levels. 'A lot of the tools we've been developing, we're realizing are employed by different operational organizations at different levels of command. So, that's a big focus for us is to make sure that we don't have diverging tech baselines,' he said. 'Or maybe we do need diverging operational baselines, but if we do, it's deliberate and informed.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/exclusive-space-systems-command-heads-action-plan-to-focus-on-command-structure-outreach/	2024-09-19T11:19:10-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/8303146-1-scaled-e1716311389831.jpg
France and Italy order new SAMP/T air defense systems	A Eurosam SAMP/T air defense system repels a simulated air attack by NATO fighter aircraft (NATO) BELFAST — France and Italy this week announced separate orders for SAMP/T NG (Next Generation) air defense systems, giving the two nations the capability to intercept hypersonic missiles and neutralize aircraft threats at greater range with the European-made system. Sebastien Lecornu, France’s defense minister, said in a translated social media post on Tuesday that Paris 'will have the first of 8 SAMP/T NG systems' in 2026, as originally committed to in the Military Programming Law — a long-term defense spending plan. He also noted that France will receive 12 of the upgraded systems by 2035. Lecornu was attending a two-day European air and missile defense conference held in Rome where his Italian counterpart Guido Crosetto also shared, per local reports, that Italy has ordered 10 SAMP/T NG systems. Neither Lecornu nor Crosetto disclosed acquisition costs. French manufacturer Thales, which makes the air defense platforms under the Eurosam joint venture with European missile house MBDA of which Italy's Leonardo is a part, welcomed the French order, calling it 'an additional step towards the renewal of the European Medium-Range Air Defence ground capabilities.' Despite the obvious boost for local industry, France remains strongly opposed to the German-led European Sky Shield Initiative (ESSI), centered around development of a common ground-based air defense (GBAD) capability. Berlin has proposed German-made IRIS-T short-range air defense equipment and the US medium-range Patriot PAC-3 system for ESSI. French President Emmanuel Macron has, however, openly criticized non-European solutions, calling them, 'less manageable, subject to timetables, queues, priorities … and too dependent on the outside world.' Paris continues to back SAMP/T for a European-wide requirement, and in parallel refuses to join ESSI. Similarly, Italy has not signed on. Thales also noted that during the air and missile defense conference, Lecornu had 'officialised a contract' with the Organisation for Joint Armament Cooperation (OCCAR) to launch production of seven additional SAMP/T NG sections for the French Air and Space Forces. It added that the sections to be constructed for France will be based on its GF300, multifunction, active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, together with the company’s New Generation Engagement Module (ME-NG). 'The ME-NG is based on a common core hardware and software architecture able to integrate specific national requirements and different radars, to coordinate or to integrate various weapon systems based on diverse munitions,' said the manufacturer. According to Eurosam company literature [PDF], SAMP/T NG is 'capable of simultaneously engaging any combination of air and missile threats further than 150km,' and works off a detection range greater than 350km. The truck-based system is also equipped with six vertical launchers, each fitted with eight Aster missiles. The NG configuration will be specifically equipped with newer Aster 30 Block 1 New Technology munitions. A production contract for the weapon was signed for last year by Eurosam and OCCAR, on behalf of Italy and France. An entire SAMP/T NG platform, compromising launchers, missiles, an AESA radar (GF300 or Leonardo’s Kronos Grand Mobile High Power type in the case of Italy) and an engagement module, can be deployed in under 30 minutes. Standard SAMP/T systems supplied by France and Italy to Ukraine and since deployed against Russia are capable of striking targets in excess of 100km.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/france-and-italy-order-new-samp-t-air-defense-systems/	2024-09-19T08:44:24-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/221123-mamba_rdax_775x440s.jpg

(U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Jackson Adkins) WASHINGTON — Rolls-Royce announced today it has reached an agreement to sell its Naval Propulsors and Handling business to Fairbanks Morse Defense for an undisclosed amount of money. The sale will see Rolls facilities in Pascagoula, Miss., and Walpole, Mass., as well as its Canadian location in Peterborough, Ontario, transfer over to Fairbanks Morse. According to the company announcement, the divested business 'supports a range of specialist propellers and waterjets for naval applications, as well as specialized handling systems that enable the deployment and recovery of manned and unmanned craft, and other cargo, from naval vessels.' Rolls says products rolled out of these facilities are on a number of US Navy vessels, including 'Frigates, Destroyers, Combatants, Submarines, Aircraft Carriers, Amphibious ships, Fleet Support and Auxiliary Ships, as well as U.S. Coast Guard Cutters.' Fairbanks Morse, headquartered in Wisconsin, is focused primarily on providing components, including engines, for naval vessels, meaning the Rolls business unit should fit snugly into its portfolio. 'When you look at the 150-year history of Fairbanks Morse Defense, you will find a handful of distinctive moments that completely transformed this company. We believe the acquisition of Rolls-Royce naval propulsors and handling businesses will become one of those moments,' George Whittier, CEO of Fairbanks Morse Defense, said in a statement. 'Rolls-Royce Naval Propulsors &amp; Handling is an industry leader and trusted supplier to navies around the world. We are pleased to collaborate with Fairbanks Morse Defense, who recognizes the value of this business and the outstanding opportunities for its strong future.' added Adam Riddle, chairman and CEO of Rolls-Royce North America. A timeline for when the deal will be closed was not disclosed by either company.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/rolls-royce-selling-naval-propulsion-business-to-fairbanks-morse-defense/	2024-09-19T07:16:43-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/10/7987135-e1696858610380.jpg
Lockheed nearing test of sea-launched JAGM, pitches for US and Australia	Concept art of a Lockheed Martin JAGM flying over water. (Lockheed Martin) MELBOURNE — Lockheed Martin plans to conduct a vertical launch, live fire demonstration of the Joint Air-to-Ground Missile (JAGM) next year as it rolls out a plan to evolve the munition into a family of 'multi-domain missile systems,' one the company hopes to sell to both the US and Australia in the future. At the Land Forces exhibition in Melbourne, Australia, last week, the company displayed a model of a generic vessel which resembled the US Navy’s MkVI Patrol Boat, equipped with four JAGM Quad Launchers (JQLs) — Lockheed Martin’s vertical launch system which enables JAGM to be launched from medium and large surface vessels as well as tactical ground vehicles such as the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle. The JAGM includes the warhead and 'back-end' of the AGM-114R (HELLFIRE Romeo) but also the integration of additional multi-mode seekers including a fire-and-forget millimeter wave (MMW) radar for moving targets which allows it to rapidly engage multiple 'slow-moving fixed wing aircraft, helicopters and UAS simultaneously,' according to company literature. Any integration of the JQL on board a surface vessel will mark the first time JAGM has been fired at sea. Currently, Lockheed’s out-of-production AGM-114 Longbow Hellfire missile is integrated on board LCS ships in the Middle East, designed to engage small surface craft. Obviously, the region has seen an influx of threats that a more up-to-date weapon could be useful in countering. Potential applications, a defense source told Breaking Defense, could include the engagement of uncrewed surface vessels (USVs) and uncrewed aerial systems (UAS) which continue to be operated by Iranian-backed groups against US and international naval vessels and commercial shipping in the Red Sea since last year. Media coverage of the JQL configuration was first reported in 2020, but since then the effort has gone quiet. But speaking to Breaking Defense at the conference, Patrick Sweeney, Lockheed’s senior manager for international business development, confirmed the effort was still moving forward. Sweeney said the JAGM munition itself requires no hardware changes to be launched in the maritime environment, before stating 'load exercises' had already been conducted with the JQL. 'We are still in the development phase of the vertical launch capability and demonstrating to US DoD which is our near-term goal,' he said. 'JQL brings the JAGM family of missiles and M299 launcher to vehicles and surface ships using designs and technologies from the MK 41 Vertical Launching System,' Lockheed documents read. The JQL currently features a pair of naval variants which could see it integrated above or below decks for patrol boats and frigates/corvettes respectively. Lockheed Martin is also pitching JAGM to international partners including the Australian Defence Forces (ADF) in a move which would provide 'certain levels in commonality' with the DoD, Sweeney added. The ADF is preparing to receive its first AH-64E Apache attack helicopters from Boeing next year, with JAGM being proposed as a potential armament solution for the platform, which would require no additional integration given it remains in service with US Army Apaches. Sweeney also confirmed to Breaking Defense that Lockheed is proposing it’s next-generation JAGM Medium Range (MR) missile for the ADF — a capability which remains in development as an internal effort within the company but has already proven its ability to double range from eight to 16km. Additional opportunities in Australia include the Land 8710 Littoral Manoeuvre Vessel program which could see landing craft equipped with JAGM for over-the-beach fire support. 'Everyone wants increased range,' Sweeney concluded.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/lockheed-nearing-test-of-sea-launched-jagm-pitches-for-us-and-australia/	2024-09-19T06:38:11-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/JAGM-e1726751726585.png

Anduril announces IVAS team-up with Microsoft	A US Army soldier detects small drone threats through Lattice IVAS integration. (Anduril) WASHINGTON — Oculus founder Palmer Luckey is officially throwing his defense firm Anduril's hat into the ring to help develop a combat-suitable mixed-reality device for soldiers, announcing a new partnership with Microsoft. After teasing his tech startup's broader entrance into the military mixed-reality space, Palmer is now disclosing at least one entry point: the integration of new sensors and the firm's Lattice platform into the US Army’s latest version of the Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS). 'This is Anduril's bread and butter, and we’ve been building the backbone for this for years,' Luckey said. Robin Seiler, Microsoft’s corporate vice president for mixed reality, said the aim is to 'expand the impact' the system could have on the battlefield. 'Soldiers using IVAS get instant alerts and can track movements in real-time, without needing to be involved in the detection process. This speeds up the early warning system, which is critical for improving response times and increasing soldier survival,' a Microsoft told Breaking Defense. While the collaboration sheds new light on Microsoft’s plans to upgrade its current IVAS offering, a host of questions remain about the path ahead for the tech giant's mixed-reality program and just which alliances are forming to compete anew if the Army greenlights a new competition. In 2018, the Army first selected the Washington-based tech company for its coved IVAS program and tasked the team with militarizing the commercially available HoloLens 2. By 2021, the service awarded Microsoft with a production deal valued up to $22 billion with plans to begin fielding the device that same year. But behind the scenes, soldier testing suggested it was a technology not suitable for combat, leading Army leaders to pause development and reset the program. After several false starts, the Army rolled out an iterative development plan based around three different versions — 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2. That 1.2 version was billed as the big leap ahead and one that could potentially push past tech and user complaints that had ranged from software glitches to physical side effects like dizziness and nausea. Microsoft overhauled the 1.2 form factor by ditching the helmet-like display that soldiers were not able to easily take off and replaced it with a display that could be flipped up. The field of view was also shrunk from 70-degree down to around 60-degrees to provide more clarity and better alignment with a user’s eyes. As a result, Army leaders including Chief of Staff Gen. Randy George have tasked Army Rangers with racking and stacking all of the service’s night vision devices to include IVAS. That analysis is expected back this fall and could help decide how the Army envisions soldiers using IVAS and just which units and individuals should have it. The feedback may also help drive requirements for a new IVAS form factor. Service officials have been preparing tech companies for an upcoming IVAS Next competition that could replace Microsoft as the prime contractor, and multiple industry sources have told Breaking Defense they are waiting for the service to release a formal solicitation, possibly before the end of the year. That solicitation is expected to shine a light on the Army’s path ahead for the program and could be a key marker as potential competitors set themselves on the starting block. (For now, most are remaining tightlipped about their exact plans, although both Microsoft and Kopin have said they will compete.) As for Anduril's IVAS Next ambitions, the company has not released any details. But during AWE 2024 in June, Luckey teased a new headset underdevelopment saying he is 'still very much in the hardware space.' 'I'm actually building a new headset right now,' Anduril's founder told the audience. 'It's driven … by military requirements, but it's also going to be used for non-military stuff.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/anduril-announces-ivas-team-up-with-microsoft/	2024-09-18T21:01:33-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/IVAS-partnership.jpg

B-21 Raider bomber shows off in new video, flying up to twice a week	A B-21 Raider conducts flight testing, which includes ground testing, taxiing, and flying operations, at Edwards Air Force Base, California. The B-21 will interoperate with our allies and partners to deliver on our enduring commitment to provide flexible strike options for coalition operations that defend us against common threats. (U.S. Air Force photo) AFA 2024 — The flight test program for the Air Force’s newest stealth bomber is heating up, with the Northrop Grumman-made B-21 Raider sometimes taking to the skies as much as twice a week, program officials said today. Tom Jones, president of Northrop's aeronautics sector, said the bomber’s progress during testing will pave the way for the system to be 'a daily flier' later into the program. 'We’re very pleased with how it’s going… We’re actually able to generate two test flights sometimes within a week, which, if you think about how far ahead we are, that’s great,' he said. After the bomber’s first flight in November, the Air Force and Northrop have focused on 'expanding the operating envelope' for the aircraft and testing its various mission systems while in the air, said William Bailey, director of the Air Force’s Rapid Capabilities Office, which oversees the B-21 program. In addition to the flight test aircraft, the Air Force also has two B-21s undergoing ground-based evaluations. One of those has completed structural testing, which is helping the Air Force and Northrop understand how the aircraft is performing and to validate the digital models of the B-21, Bailey said. It is also conducting fatigue tests on another aircraft, which informs the team on how the bomber will age and perform over time, he said. The process is 'not as flashy' as flight test, 'however if you intend to build a lot of these and operate them for a long time, this is very important.' Testing continues for the B-21 Raider, a dual-capable penetrating strike stealth bomber capable of delivering both conventional and nuclear munitions. Ellsworth Air Force Base, Whiteman Air Force Base, and Dyess Air Force Base are expected to receive the B-21.

Last week, the Air Force approved Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri, and Dyess AFB, Texas, as the second and third basing locations for the Raider. 'Potential consideration for forward facing, either temporary or permanent, of this weapon system to be able to deter the various actors around the globe, I think, might be of interest to the senior policymakers,' Gen. Thomas Bussiere, Air Force Global Strike Command commander, said during the panel.

Air Force special ops CV-22 Ospreys could be ready to deploy in weeks, commander says	A CV-22 Osprey prepares to take off Feb. 8, 2019 at U-Tapao airfield, Thailand. (1st Lt. Renee Douglas/ 353rd Special Operations Wing) AFA 2024 — Within a few weeks, Air Force CV-22 Ospreys will be ready to deploy for the first time since a fatal Osprey crash in November, the head of Air Force Special Operations Command said today. About 60 percent of AFSOC’s CV-22s are back to being fully operational, with the rest to follow by late 2024 or early 2025, said Lt. Gen. Michael Conley during a roundtable at the Air Force Association’s Air, Space and Cyber conference. The CV-22 units in Japan and the United Kingdom 'are almost back to full mission readiness. We will deploy out here in the coming weeks, back to support other geographic commanders,' he said. 'My whole fleet is not operationally running yet, but I have enough capacity and the right crews training to provide the capabilities on the battlefield.' Conley, who took the helm at AFSOC in July, declined to comment on where specifically the Ospreys will deploy, stating only that it will not take place in the Indo-Pacific or European theaters, which already have permanently stationed V-22 squadrons. The Pentagon grounded all versions of the Osprey in December after a CV-22 flying a training mission crashed off the coast of Japan on Nov. 29, killing eight crewmembers onboard. The Pentagon in March gave the services the green light to begin returning the Bell-Boeing-made tiltrotor to flight, putting into action a phased approach that involved retraining crews, reviewing maintenance records and instituting changes to emergency procedures meant to improve flight safety. In August, the Air Force released its accident investigation report on the crash, which found that it was caused by a 'catastrophic failure' of the Osprey’s proprotor gearbox, but also listed decisions made by the aircrew as a factor that contributed to the accident. In particular, the report pointed to the aircrew’s actions in light of multiple 'left-hand proprotor gearbox (PRGB) chip burn' advisories. Per Air Force guidance at the time, crews were directed to land as soon as possible if they receive that warning three times during a flight, but service regulations also provide commanders some discretion based on their circumstances and mission. Conley said that guidance has changed so that crews are now advised to land 'as soon as practical' after a single chip burn warning, and to land 'as soon as possible' after two warnings. 'At the end of the day, there will always be aircraft commander and crew discretion. It's the nature of what we do. The environments are unique, depending on where we’re flying, what we're dealing with,' he said. 'But we have tightened up the guidance to make it less ambiguous to the crews up there.' The Air Force has sometimes taken a different, and perhaps more cautious approach to Osprey operations than the Marine Corps, having previously suspended V-22 flight operations due to safety concerns at times where the other service kept flying. Last week, Aviation Week reported that the Air Force is considering assuming airworthiness authority for the CV-22 from Naval Air Systems Command, which manages Osprey procurement and support for the US military through the PMA 275 program office. Asked about the potential move, Conley said it was a question for Air Force Materiel Command head Gen. Duke Richardson, and that AFSOC’s relationship with NAVAIR, the Marine Corps and PMA 275 'is probably as strong as it's ever been.' 'I'd say that over the last eight or nine months, we've had the time, and we've kind of looked at the program in a holistic view. We've considered lots of things, and there's been lots of ideas, lots of recommendations, and we're still kind of calling through those on what is feasible, what makes sense,' he said. 'I don't think anyone's close to a decision on whether we need to break from the current construct.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/air-force-special-ops-cv-22-ospreys-could-be-ready-to-deploy-in-weeks-commander-says/	2024-09-18T13:53:01-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/5104340-scaled-e1726689615943.jpg
After apparent mass pager attack, Hezbollah has few avenues for response, experts say	Mourners carry the coffins of people killed after hundreds of paging devices exploded in a deadly wave across Lebanon the previous day, during their funeral procession in Beirut's southern suburbs on September 18, 2024. (Photo by ANWAR AMRO / AFP) (Photo by ANWAR AMRO/AFP via Getty Images) BEIRUT — As Hezbollah contends with what appears to be a second wave of exploding personal devices today, experts here said that the armed Lebanese group has been dealt a 'severe blow' and will likely struggle to respond to what's suspected to be an unprecedented, sophisticated attack by Israel. 'If Hezbollah will retaliate, it won't be soon,' retired Lebanese armed forces Gen. Maroun Hitti told Breaking Defense, adding that the group would likely need at least a month to gather itself. 'Israel has managed to interject an element of doubt and mistrust between Hezbollah fighters, potential Hezbollah recruits and the Hezbollah leadership,' Des Roches, associate professor at the Near East South Asia Center for Security Studies, told Breaking Defense. When Hezbollah does respond, Des Roches said he expected it to mirror previous responses to Israeli attacks, namely firing rockets and missiles south toward Israeli targets. Even then, 'now that their communications are compromised they'll be less capable of conducting coordinated operations,' he said. Hitti agreed that Hezbollah would have to 'review its methods and security before undertaking any military action.' Beyond that, he said, Hezbollah 'is incapable to respond in a large military operation, or it will have to deal with a larger blow from Israel.' But Andreas Krieg, a senior lecturer at King's College London, pointed out that Hezbollah isn't necessarily bound by geography to retaliate at the southern border or even in the Middle East. Krieg, also CEO of risk consultancy MENA analytica, said that since the purported Israeli operation was done in the 'grey zone' without public attribution, Hezbollah could respond in kind, using 'black ops' to strike at Israeli or Jewish targets overseas. (Hitting targets inside Israel, he said, would be 'very difficult at this stage' considering the level of vigilance Israel's security services are likely to have.) Hezbollah is believed to have an extensive overseas capability, specifically through its sub-group known as the Islamic Jihad Organization. The US Intelligence Community says the IJO is a 'highly compartmented unit that is primarily responsible for overseas terrorism operations, including against Western targets.' Krieg also suggested Hezbollah could use proxies to carry out a retaliation operation for it. An overriding consideration, however, remains escalation. Since Hamas's Oct. 7 attack, Hezbollah and Israel have been trading fire, but for the most part — until this week — stopping short of conducting the kind of strikes that are likely to spark a wider regional war. 'There may be one or two [attacks on] of Israeli interests or perceived Israeli interests abroad, just because they feel they have to do something in order to keep control over their base,' Des Roches said. For now Hezbollah announced in a statement on Tuesday that it is conducting a wide-ranging security investigation 'to find out the reasons that led to these simultaneous explosions.' The public could learn more about Hezbollah's next move Thursday when Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah is scheduled to make a public address.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/after-apparent-mass-pager-attack-hezbollah-has-few-avenues-for-response-experts-say/	2024-09-18T12:58:35-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/240918_hezbollah_pager_funeral_GettyImages-2172014476-e1726689211855.jpg
CDAO opens big door for small biz with $15 billion, 10-year Advana recompete	Futuristic monitor showing information data on a dark background. (Yuichiro Chino/Getty Images) WASHINGTON — The Pentagon’s prized platform for big-data analytics, Advana, is about to become a high-stakes test case for the Defense Department's ability to keep up with Silicon Valley. After seven years of operating the platform through consummate DC consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton, the DoD wants to open the 'walled garden' of Advana to a wide array of vendors, including small businesses and 'non-traditional' contractors with no experience running the maze of defense procurement. To make that happen, today the Chief Digital &amp; AI Officer (CDAO) announced plans for a 15-year, multi-vendor contract worth up to $10 billion. 'One thing we want people to take away is you don’t have to do everything,' said Bonnie Evangelista, the deputy CDAO for acquisition, in a sidebar with select reporters at the Sept. 18 industry day for the new approach. 'You don’t have to do every part of the tech stack &#8230; if you do a single piece and you do it really well, you can have a contract.' Opening up Advana is a pillar of CDAO Radha Plumb’s yet-larger plan, called Open DAGIR, to overhaul Pentagon AI from the back office to the battlefield. The other pillar announced to date is a similarly ambitious opening-up of Palantir’s Maven Smart System, a AI toolkit in high demand by military planners at commands worldwide. RELATED: GIDE goes wide: Defense AI chief seeks host of industry players for global battle network While Maven ignited controversy early on over the use of AI for military targeting, Advana has quietly made itself essential. Originating as an obscure Pentagon comptroller project to help track financial transactions ahead of an audit, it proved capable of helping more and more officials manage more datasets for more missions. In 2021, Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks issued a 'data decree' memorandum [PDF] that declared 'The Advancing Analytics (Advana) platform is the single enterprise authoritative data management and analytics platform for the Secretary of Defense' — and required specific approval before using any competing platform. That official status means CDAO is tinkering with one of the most high-profile pieces of software in the Pentagon, one relied on daily by decisionmakers from the Secretary of Defense down. So any missteps on this new path will be very visible — but so were the growing pains of the existing system as Advana struggled to keep with rising demand. The new approach, first described in detail today, calls for an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract vehicle that can handle up to $15 billion in total awards. While the overall IDIQ will be in place for a decade, CDAO made clear today that there will be many opportunities along the way to bring in new vendors or kick out companies that no longer perform. 'There will be multiple awards,' Evangelista told reporters. 'We are planning for on-ramping and off-ramping [vendors] over the ten years, because technology change.' How many companies does CDAO hope to bring on board? 'I don’t know the right number,' Evangelista said frankly. 'Part of today is to help us understand what is the right number.' CDAO expects further rounds of back-and-forth with industry before it settles on specific contract language and technical standards, each of which is tricky enough to figure out on its own but which must also work together smoothly to allow multiple contractors to plug-and-play in the same system. 'This is the first industry day of this scale,' said Garrett Berntsen, the recently hired deputy CDAO for mission analytics. 'We also have an RFI [Request For Information] that’s public that we’re seeking feedback on, [and] there will be additional future events.' 'You can’t just plop something this massive down,' Berntsen told reporters. 'We’re getting lots of feedback.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/cdao-opens-big-door-for-small-biz-with-15-bilion-10-year-advana-recompete/	2024-09-18T12:29:55-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/GettyImages-1331215115-e1726684328825.jpg
Lot full? In an increasingly crowded orbit, MITRE studies how many LEO sats are too many	The orbital population of active and inactive satellites continues to grow, especially in low Earth orbit. (Image credit: NASA) AMOS 2024 — Space is supposed to be big, 'vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly big,' as a wise man once said. But low Earth orbit (LEO), where most satellites now linger, is not as big as it may seem. And with thousands of satellites floating there now and tens of thousands more on the way, there will be, eventually, no room left. When that will happen is unclear, but a new study by MITRE takes a stab at establishing a framework to determine at what point does the sheer volume of space traffic in LEO overwhelm the environment — making it impossible for satellites to function due to interference and the risk of collision with each other and orbiting debris. The study, called 'Integrating Orbital Carrying Capacity into International Policy Constructs: Leveraging Best Practices from Aviation's Risk-Based Norms,' is based on adapting the approach the international air traffic control system uses to manage airspace to prevent planes from colliding, said Kevin Toner, vice president of MITRE's Center for Government Effectiveness and Modernization. Toner, along with several other MITRE officials, spoke with Breaking Defense on Monday on the margins of the annual Advanced Maui Optical and Space Surveillance Technologies (AMOS) conference. The paper, the officials explained, will be presented in full at the 75th International Astronautical Conference in October. As the number of satellites in LEO, roughly 300-2,000 kilometers above the Earth, continues to skyrocket global concerns are growing about what is known as 'carrying capacity' in the orbital regime have also grown. Like any physical space, LEO has a limited capacity, meaning there's only so much room for satellites without significantly increasing the chance deadly on-orbit crashes — which in turn create more space junk that can crash into other things. For example, the issue of LEO crowding and concerns about equitable access for developing countries came to the fore at the March meeting of the Science and Technical Subcommittee of the UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS). The primary source of worry is the plethora of mega-constellations comprising thousands of satellites being launched by commercial companies and governments, including militaries, around the world. SpaceX alone has already put some 6,000 Starlink satellites in LEO, and hopes to expand its broadband network to over 40,000. The company also is launching hundreds of its militarized Starlink, called Starshield, for the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) and has Space Force interest as well. Amazon's Kuiper Project in 2023 launched the first two of a planned 3,000 satellite constellation, and OneWeb has 630 of its planned 648 satellites on orbit. Not to be left out, China's state-owned Shanghei Spacecom Satellite Technology (SSST) on Aug. 6 launched the first 18 of a planned Starlink clone, called Thousand Sails (G60), that it hopes eventually will include some 15,000 satellites. China also reportedly has plans for another mega-constellation called Guowang, to include some 13,000 satellites. Meanwhile, the Space Force's Space Development Agency is on its way to orbiting up to 500 satellites in LEO for its planned Transport Layer of data relay satellites; and another 100 or so for its Tracking Layer of missile warning/tracking satellite. MITRE's study suggests that the key to managing LEO in a way that allows the maximum number of users lies breaking the problem down into specific altitude bands and considering not just macro-numbers but the timing of when congestion occurs. 'Broadly, there are lots of definitions of carrying capacity. Some are a number: this is the max. I think one of the points we try to make in the paper is that there are other aspects, like time, for example. At what time and in which orbits comparatively do carrying capacities vary?' Tone said. With those considerations at hand, along with an understanding of how and when satellites are moving around, the next question the MITRE paper looked at is 'how do you optimize [the amount of space traffic] by thinking about it the same way air traffic controllers think about airspace, whether it's Class A, Class B, or Class C,' he said. The most 'heavily congested' air corridors are Class A, 'where you always have aircraft moving down these highways,' Toner explained. Class B are certain areas where large numbers of aircraft converge, such as airports; and Class C are less populated air traffic lanes. To translate to space terms, the orbital region between 700-900 kilometers is an already crowded danger zone akin to Class A air corridors. The Earth's poles, where most LEO sats converge at one time or another, could be compared to Class B. And the more lonely orbits of above 1,000 kilometers are like Class C. The goal of the MITRE framework proposal is to help 'facilitate international collaboration and standard-setting' according to a fact sheet provided to Breaking Defense. 'It provides a pathway for developing globally harmonized policies that ensure the safety and sustainability of space activities,' the fact sheet adds.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/lot-full-in-an-increasingly-crowded-orbit-mitre-studies-how-many-leo-sats-are-too-many/	2024-09-18T10:41:39-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2013/07/spaceDebrisnbasa-e1644614491811.jpg
In new ‘Navigation Plan,’ CNO puts Navy’s targets on China’s 2027 deadline	Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Lisa Franchetti participates in a wreath laying ceremony at the Anitkabir &#8211; Atatürk Mausoleum, in Ankara, Türkiye, June 3, 2024. (US Navy photo by Chief Mass Communication Specialist Amanda Gray) WASHINGTON — The Navy's top officer today released a new Navigation Plan, placing the service's strategic focus squarely on preparing for a future conflict with China, potentially within the next few years. 'The challenge posed by the [People’s Republic of China] to our Navy now goes well beyond just the size of the PLA Navy fleet. Ships matter greatly but gone are the days when we assessed threats based purely on the number of battle force ships or tonnage,' Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Lisa Franchetti wrote in the new document, published today. 'Through operational concepts like multi-domain precision warfare, grey zone and economic campaigns, expansion of dual use infrastructure (e.g., airfields) and dual use forces (e.g., Chinese maritime militia), and a growing nuclear arsenal, the PRC presents a complex multi-domain and multi-axis threat.' The 'Navigation Plan,' or NAVPLAN, is an overarching strategic document routinely published by the Navy’s top admiral. (Prior to today, the most recent NAVPLAN was published in July 2022.) Similar to the Marine Corps’ Commandant’s Planning Guidance, the document provides an outlet for the Navy’s top officer to share their vision for the future with the fleet. Franchetti’s new NAVPLAN is heavily focused on the 2027 timeline that Chinese leadership have said they’ve given to their military to be prepared for a conflict — likely over the status quo of Taiwan — with the United States or any American allies who might intercede. It highlights long-range fires, non-traditional sea denial, counter C5ISRT, terminal defense and contested logistics as 'key capabilities.' An integral part of the Navy's efforts to counter China will be what the CNO has dubbed 'Project 33.' (Thirty-three alludes to the fact Franchetti is the 33rd officer to serve as the chief of naval operations.) Key aspects of Project 33 include eliminating ship, submarine and aircraft maintenance delays; scaling the use and integration of robotic and autonomous systems; boosting recruitment and retention; and 'train[ing] for combat as we plan to fight, in the real world and virtually.' Franchetti’s document also alludes to the financial pressures the Navy is under and how the service will 'eventually face deep strategic constraints' on its ability to simultaneously conduct daily operations and invest in future modernization short of any budgetary boost. 'This 2024 Navigation Plan reflects our current emphasis on readiness and capability considering near-term budgetary and industrial realities, while continuing to advocate for the resources needed to expand all aspects of the Navy’s force structure necessary to preserve the peace, respond in crisis, and win decisively in war,' she wrote. The document also makes a lesser mention of Russia, stating the 'wounded and isolated' country 'remains dangerous,' as well as the ongoing attacks by Hamas and the Houthis in the Middle East. 'Moscow, Beijing, Tehran, and Pyongyang have strengthened their linkages and are actively targeting the U.S., our allies, and our partners in the information domain,' the document said. 'Damage to undersea pipelines and cables underscored how seabed infrastructure has become targetable.' The NAVPLAN sets several goals for the larger service and designates a 'single accountable official' for each target with a 2027 deadline. The vice chief of naval operations for example will 'achieve and sustain an 80 percent combat surge ready posture for ships, submarines and aircraft.' The service’s top requirements officer, also called the N9, will integrate robotics and autonomous systems for 'routine use' by operational commanders, according to the document. 'We must meet all the objectives in this Navigation Plan to field the people and capabilities needed to fight and win today, in 2027, and beyond,' Franchetti wrote. 'As we accelerate where possible, we will also continue the crucial work already underway to enhance the critical capabilities and enablers laid out in prior Navy guidance.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/in-new-navigation-plan-cno-puts-navys-targets-on-chinas-2027-deadline/	2024-09-18T09:00:54-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/8446820-scaled-e1726655704624.jpg
Norway’s Kongsberg to build new missile factory in Virginia	A Naval Strike Missile produced by Kongsberg. (Photo courtesy of Kongsberg.) WASHINGTON — The aerospace and defense arm of Norwegian contractor Kongsberg announced Tuesday it's building a missile production facility in James City County, Va., that will boost capacity for the Naval Strike Missile and Joint Strike Missile. 'The new missile production facilities in the U.S., Australia and Norway address the strong and long-term demand for our unique technology and the critical need to strengthen collective defense capabilities,' Geir Håøy, CEO of Kongsberg, said in a company statement. 'Kongsberg has a proud history in the U.S. and we are delighted to continue to invest in the country to support American interests while creating jobs locally.' The factory will bring 180 jobs to the region and include a $100 million investment over the next several years, according to the company. Kongsberg also has a factory in Johnstown, Pa., which it said this week will expand to include hiring 20 additional employees. The company's new Virginia factory will focus on producing the Naval Strike Missile and Joint Strike Missile. NSM is an anti-ship missile used by the US Navy and produced jointly by Kongsberg and RTX. It carries a 500-pound class warhead, advanced seeker and a programmable fuze, according to RTX. The Joint Strike Missile is derived from NSM and is being integrated for use onto the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter in conjunction with Lockheed Martin. Air forces from Norway, Japan, Finland, Australia and the United States have all placed orders for the weapon. 'Today’s announcement by Kongsberg Defense and Aerospace represents a significant investment in our local community,' said Rep. Rob Wittman, a senior member on the House Armed Service Committee, in a written statement. 'Kongsberg’s decision to expand their U.S. presence and build a new missile production facility in James City County was made with the goal of helping meet increasing global demand for the Naval Strike Missile and Joint Strike Missile,' he continued. 'This new facility will create nearly 200 new jobs locally while investing over $100 million into the economy of the Commonwealth in the coming years.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/kongsberg-to-build-new-missile-factory-in-virginia/	2024-09-18T08:28:06-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/image001-e1726668794703.jpg
Air dominance requires first establishing a layered approach	CJADC2 requires connected layers of communications, networking, intelligence, and cybersecurity. In this brief video we connected with Northrop Grumman&#8216;s VP &amp; General Manager, Networked Information Solutions, Jenna Paukstis and discussed: the layered approach for establishing air dominance; the capabilities needed to do so; and a new, resilient suite of solutions for theater interoperability at the tactical edge called NG InSight that increases survivability with faster, multi-level secure networked data sharing and resilient line-of-sight and beyond-line-of-sight communications links.

Italy plans out $15B-plus spending on dozens of F-35s and Eurofighters	An Italian air force F-35A Lightning II assigned to the 32nd Wing, Amendola Air Base, Italy, prepares to land at Aviano Air Base, Italy (US Air Force) BELFAST — Italy expects to dole out billions more in defense spending on Lockheed Martin F-35 fifth-generation and Eurofighter Typhoon fourth-generation combat jets under targets laid out in a new multi-year military spending document. Published on Monday, the defense ministry paper [PDF] sets out 2024-to-2026 funding plans and notes that 25 additional F-35 aircraft will be procured at an estimated value of €7 billion ($7.8 billion). The new order, which also includes related items like engines and logistics support is split between 15 F-35A conventional takeoff and landing (CTOL) models for the Italian Air Force and 10 Italian Navy F-35B short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) platforms. The document says the move will be made to meet the 'operational needs' of the Italian armed forces and will bring the country's total fleet up to 115 aircraft, according to an online translation. Though that's still short of a targeted 131-plane fleet, it says the buy will 'improve Italy's geopolitical positioning' in the context of European security. (F-35 maker Lockheed Martin says that Rome currently has 60 F-35As and 30 F-35Bs.) Funding of €1.9 billion ($2.1 billion) has already been allocated to support the F-35 order, alongside €60 million ($67 million) for 'adaptation' at Grottaglie air base, which is being prepared to host Italian Navy F-35B jets. Additionally, 24 Eurofighters, built to the new Tranche 4 configuration, are to be procured as a replacement for 26 older Tranche 1 models, designated F-2000 in Italian service, at an estimated cost of €6.9 billion ($7.7 billion). The older Typhoons are set to be phased out in 2029. Approval for a ministerial decree for such an acquisition is currently 'in progress,' the spending document says. The plan to acquire additional Typhoons formally commenced in July, based off a government motion to do so, reported Janes. Elsewhere, the spending document reveals that a payment of €550 million ($611 million) has been committed to by Italy for the sixth-generation Global Combat Air Programme (GCAP) with the UK and Japan, though there is no indication of how the funding will be spent exactly. That investment in GCAP R&amp;D 'aims to guarantee' Italy's position in the international program and to allow local industry access to 'final development,' of the future fighter, the document says.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/italy-plans-out-15b-plus-spending-on-dozens-of-f-35s-and-eurofighters/	2024-09-18T07:20:04-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/6665223-e1726662155775.jpg
Air Force cyber official says AI could help DAF sort through nearly 2.5 million daily cybersecurity alerts	U.S. Air Force Lt. Gen. Thomas Hensley, 16th Air Force commander, is greeted by Col. Craig Bailey, 9th Maintenance Group commander, on Beale Air Force Base, California, Aug. 24, 2023. Maj. Gen. Hensley visited the 9th MXG during an infrastructure tour of Beale AFB and was briefed on how the U-2 Dragonlady functions. (U.S. Air Force photo by Senior Airman Alexis Pentzer) Lt. Gen. Thomas Hensley, commander of the 16th Air Force, the service’s information warfare organization, said the Department of the Air Force (DAF), which includes the Space Force, receives an overwhelming nearly 2.5 million cybersecurity alerts each day. And, he said, that number will only grow as the DAF connects more weapon systems and more battle management systems. 'So AI/ML, [will] take all of this data, do the metadata analysis, do the content triage and filter up the information that only human beings can do, and that's the nuanced, focused, analytical work,' Hensley told Breaking Defense in an interview at the Air, Space and Cyber Conference Tuesday. Regarding the popular concern that AI is going to succeed in taking over human jobs, Hensley said, 'this is not the case.' 'It's going to help human beings do their job better,' Hensley said, adding that hiring more people to monitor and analyze the millions of cyber alerts a day is not a viable solution. 'What I tell people is we're not going to mass [hire] our way out of this. We're not going to be able to hire more people to monitor all the sensors, and so we've got to be smarter with the technology that we have,' he said. The idea of an AI or ML platform that could sort through and analyze data at a basic level may not be too far fetched for the DAF. It previously released a large language model for Airmen, Guardians, civilians and contractors called the Non-classified Internet Protocol Generative Pre-training Transformer, or NIPRGPT, which serves as the DAF’s rendition of the popular public generative AI known as ChatGPT. NIRPGPT’s goal is to help users with communications and more mundane tasks on a secure system. While the DAF is focused on implementing AI and ML capabilities for speed and efficiency purposes, Hensley emphasized cybersecurity will remain a focused priority. He said the cutting edge systems must have cybersecurity 'baked in from the beginning' if they want to withstand today’s information warfare environment, a philosophy he mentioned has been a critical lesson learned from the war in Ukraine. 'I think the key there is starting with cybersecurity, protecting your information. That is the foundation of all that we do. So whether it's, you know, using our day-to-day computer to do day-to-day work, or it's the weapon systems that we employ, it's the battle management systems that we utilize, we have to protect the networks,' he said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/air-force-cyber-official-says-ai-could-help-daf-sort-through-nearly-2-5-million-daily-cybersecurity-alerts/	2024-09-18T06:02:08-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/7995666-scaled-e1726608345988.jpg
Space Force chief: Commercial imagery analysis aided Niger withdrawal — just don’t call it ‘intel’	U.S. Air Force Tech. Sgt. Thomas Chamberlain, 3rd Airlift Squadron loadmaster, conducts ground duties before take-off during the withdrawal from Air Base 201, Niger, July 13, 2024. (U.S. Air Force photo by Senior Airman Amanda Jett) AFA 2024 — A Space Force pilot program provided rapid 'situational awareness' reports, written by commercial imagery analysis firms, to security forces on the ground during the US military’s recently completed withdrawal from Niger, the Chief of Space Operations said here this morning. 'Last February, I told you we're kicking off a pilot program for tactical surveillance, reconnaissance and tracking for TacSRT,' he told a standing-room-only audience at the Air Force Association’s massive annual conference. 'This $40 million effort was intended to support AFRICOM requirements … [and] complement the exquisite work done by the intelligence community with unclassified operational planning products delivered on tactically relevant timelines.' Since then, the pilot has provided updates on flooding in Kenya and extremists in central Africa, Saltzman said. 'But,' he said, 'the thing that stands out most to me was the Space Forces Europe used TacSRT to support us forces as they completed their withdrawal from Air Base 201 in Niger [this] August.' 'Throughout the withdrawal, the team maintained overwatch of everything within five kilometers of the base,' he said. 'On average, the timeline from collection on orbit to delivery into the hands of security forces was about three and a half hours — but the team got it down to as little as one and a half hours … by the end of the event.' Peppered with reporters’ questions at a subsequent roundtable, Saltzman took pains to distinguish what TacSRT did from traditional intelligence provided by US spy agencies, let alone military targeting. 'This is not like traditional collection and purchase of imagery, It’s something different,' he emphasized. 'It’s not about targeting. This is about providing situational awareness.' Saltzman may have been treading carefully here because of ongoing tension over whether Space Force was treading on others' space imagery turf. EXCLUSIVE: GMTI emerges as new front in Space Force-NGA turf battle Under current law and policy, the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) has responsibility for buying imagery from private firms, while the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) buys commercial analytic products, such as computer models and digital maps. (In fact, NGA just announced a contract for them worth up to $290 million.) At least some officials at these long-established satellite intelligence agencies have pushed back against the Space Force's ambitions for commercial satellite imagery. Saltzman has touted how Space Systems Command has provided 'near-real time information and support' in earthquakes, floods, and wildfires around the world. TacSRT, he said, 'was a pathfinder, with the idea being that we could expand the program if it proved to be value added, and that's exactly what it did.' Through a virtual 'marketplace' of vetted commercial providers, Saltzman explained, the Space Force puts out broad requests and gets, not raw images, but situation reports. In the Niger case, he said, they asked for anything anomalous occurring within 'five kilometers' around the air base. 'TacSRT doesn’t buy imagery,' he said. 'What TacSRT has done, in this pilot in particular, is we simply ask a question into the marketplace: ‘Hey, what generally does it look like around Air Base 201? Are there any items of interest? Trucks that are massing, or do we see people that are milling around?' 'We simply ask the question, and commercial industry provides us products that try to help us answer the question,' he summed up. 'This is just situational awareness, again, operational planning products, not intelligence products.' Now that TacSRT has proved its value in real-world operations, Saltzman said, his plan is to scale it up. That could escalate a budgetary battle already underway in the appropriations committees on Capitol Hill. 'The next step is just giving [them] more money so we can expand,' he said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/space-force-chief-commercial-imagery-analysis-aided-niger-withdrawal-just-dont-call-it-intel/	2024-09-18T04:35:59-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/240917_DVIDS_niger_withdrawal_8576322-scaled-e1726602241808.jpg

Air Force’s interim tanker buy in limbo as service mulls next-gen refueler timeline	A KC-46A Pegasus aerial refueling aircraft connects with an F-15 Strike Eagle test aircraft from Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, on Oct. 29th, 2018. (U.S. Air Force photo by Master Sgt Michael Jackson) AFA 2024 — As industry eagerly awaits the Air Force's decision on an interim tanker plan, service officials now say the potential acquisition hinges on the fate of a different plane: the service's future next-gen tanker and, specifically, how quickly they can make it operational. In a briefing with reporters Monday, Air Force acquisition chief Andrew Hunter said the service’s efforts are now focused on completing an analysis of alternatives for the Next Generation Air-refueling System (NGAS), a future tanker concept that's currently in early stages but one that officials believe will be critical for refueling operations in contested environments like the Indo-Pacific. The results of that analysis, Hunter said, will ultimately determine the shape of the nearer-term tanker buy. The service’s most recent tanker strategy unveiled in March 2023, which called for an interim buy of roughly 75 tankers to continue recapitalizing the aging KC-135 Stratotanker, is broadly 'still the case,' Hunter emphasized during a roundtable at the Air, Space &amp; Cyber here in Washington. However, that 'construct' is 'critically dependent on getting after NGAS' and how quickly the service can field the aircraft. 'So we need to understand the NGAS part of the story to truly make additional progress on tanker recap,' Hunter said. Essentially, when the service unveiled its new tanker strategy — doing away with a three-pronged approach known as KC-X, KC-Y and KC-Z in the process — officials expected the interim purchase would buy time to field the NGAS by the mid-2030s. But as the NGAS analysis of alternatives proceeds, officials expect to get a better idea of what the NGAS program will look like, including what a realistic timeline could be. A longer timeline would, presumably, necessitate more interim capability, for instance. A congressional mandate requires the Air Force to maintain a minimum inventory of 466 tankers, the bulk of which are currently Eisenhower-era KC-135s, also known as Stratotankers. Some of that fleet is currently being replaced by Boeing’s KC-46 Pegasus, and the potential interim tanker buy, perhaps for more KC-46s or for another airframe, would continue that process and enable more KC-135 divestments. Asked whether the Air Force would be challenged to maintain KC-135s in the event the service dramatically changes the interim tanker buy or skips it altogether, Hunter replied that KC-135R variant of the aircraft would be maintained 'as necessary until we are able to replace them.' Additionally, Hunter said the service does not currently intend to propose altering the tanker inventory requirement. In a roundtable with reporters today, US Transportation Command chief Gen. Jacqueline Van Ovost stressed that she needs the Air Force to ensure KC-135s remain 'credible' in the event they need to be relied on. Van Ovost’s command formulates the number of tankers needed to fulfill war plans. 'The crews need to be trained for the high-end fight, to this contested logistics fight. And I need the capabilities to fight [with these] airplanes in the environment I intend to fly them in,' she said. As for NGAS, the Air Force has released a small number of requests for information (RFI) to industry in a bid to gather feedback on the service’s plans, the most recent coming last week for the aircraft’s mission systems. Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall said the RFI will help establish a 'competitive vendor pool' and that results could be incorporated into the rest of the tanker fleet. Hunter said that RFI demonstrated a new approach with industry, allowing the Air Force to engage vendors earlier in the process. A separate RFI for the NGAS airframe will be issued after the analysis of alternatives completes, he added. Any downward revision in the interim tanker plan, including an outright cancellation, would likely be a blow to Boeing. Hunter himself originally suggested the Air Force was leaning toward the company’s KC-46 for the interim buy, and analysts told Breaking Defense at the time that the beleaguered aerospace giant’s position only strengthened when Lockheed Martin bowed out of a partnership with Airbus to compete for the effort. Boeing’s current contract with the US Air Force for 183 KC-46s is set to complete deliveries in 2029, and a fixed-price development contract for the Pegasus has forced the company to eat over $7 billion in losses on the program. A sizable new round of procurement for the tanker, Boeing officials have said, offered a chance to help recover losses.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/air-forces-interim-tanker-buy-in-limbo-as-service-mulls-next-gen-refueler-timeline/	2024-09-17T15:42:17-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/03/4957126-scaled-e1710866898956.jpg

Boeing encountering workforce challenges amid F-15EX, Super Hornet production line changes	Boeing's F-15EX features fly by wire flight controls and new electronic warfare equipment (Boeing) WASHINGTON — Workforce fluctuations as Boeing ramps up F-15EX production and sunsets the F/A-18 Super Hornet line are driving up cost and inefficiency, and recovery from those challenges will not be immediate, the head of the company’s fighter programs told Breaking Defense today. 'It will take time — we’re rebuilding a workforce that needs the experience,' said Mark Sears, Boeing’s vice president for fighters. '[In] aviation, the learning curve is steep in terms of how people learn how to do this work — F-15 in particular [and] these older platforms is even harder. And so for F-15, you can be a good mechanic, but it's mostly about the number of times you do a job that makes you a good mechanic.' Over the past year, Boeing has decreased the number of mechanics working on the Super Hornet from 300 to 200 workers as production of the aircraft slows down, Sears said. That has forced the remaining employees to take on an additional portion of the workshare. Conversely, on the F-15EX where production is increasing from a rate of one aircraft to about 1.5 aircraft per month, Boeing has added about 150 new mechanics this year, who are working on the aircraft for the first time and are still building proficiency. 'There's a significant learning curve on F-15,' Sears said. 'If you walk the F-15 [production] line, it's kind of like a museum of what aerospace manufacturing is. You start in the back of the line, looks like it did in 1969. You go to the forward part of the line, where we just digitally remastered the forward fuselage, and that's advanced modern manufacturing techniques.' Last week, Boeing Chief Financial Officer Brian West said that the company expects margins to be negative at its defense division for the third quarter due, in part, to higher-than-expected costs associated with the shifting production outputs on the F-15EX and F/A-18 lines. Boeing eventually intends to increase production of the F-15EX to two fighters per month, but the company won’t see output at that level until around 2026, Sears said. Meanwhile, the Super Hornet line is set to close down in 2027. Sears noted that the production issues at Boeing are further complicated by its supply chain, which has seen a similar shift in its blue-collar workforce since the COVID-19 pandemic, with some suppliers noting that the average level of experience has dropped from around 20 years to six years. The company is taking some steps to try to drive up production efficiency on the F-15EX line. First, the company is redesigning certain portions of the airplane that are difficult to build, bringing those elements in line with modern manufacturing techniques. The balance there, however, is ensuring that those design changes are significant enough to improve ease of assembly while not triggering the need for the Air Force to perform additional flight testing, Sears said. One example is the F-15’s center fuselage, which is broken into five main sections. The company is redesigning one of those segments — the most complex part of the structure because of how the plane’s landing gear is affixed to it, he said. 'It’s area where, when we make a defect, if we have a defect … it is the most complex part of the airplane for us to have to analyze, to disposition it, to tell them how to fix it,' Sears said. Boeing is also rewriting all its production and technical manuals to simplify instructions for new mechanics, but it will take a couple years to get through all 14,000 jobs on the line, Sears said. 'We're starting in the most complex areas first with the oldest engineering that we're trying to simplify, and then we'll work our way up to the most modern parts and engineering, which shouldn't be as much of a change,' he said. Earlier this year, Boeing announced plans to buy GKN Aerospace’s St. Louis-area facility and absorb its workforce. The plant, which was once part of McDonnell Douglas before that company was acquired by Boeing, is the sole source of about 100 parts used on the F/A-18 and F-15. 'We've always had kind of a shared destiny with that site, and now that it's part of The Boeing Company again, the merger of that back into the organization has gone well,' Sears said. 'The performance has not degraded and probably improved, and the collaboration between us and the site has gone really well.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/boeing-encountering-workforce-challenges-amid-f-15ex-super-hornet-production-line-changes/	2024-09-17T13:23:30-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/DSC_4278-scaled-e1725903116738.jpg
Sweden moves to ramp up defense spending by $1.3 billion in 2025	A US Air Force MC-130J Commando II conducts surface ship rendezvous with a Swedish Visby-class corvette and the USS Ross as the ships exercise anti-surface and anti-submarine warfare (US Army) BELFAST — Sweden plans on increasing defense spending by 13 billion SEK ($1.3 billion) next year by adding a proposal for the new funds to its 2025 state budget. The uplift will take the Nordic nation's annual military spending in 2025 to 138 billion SEK, equivalent to 2.4 percent GDP, which is above NATO's minimum defense spending target. Additionally, Stockholm is proposing a long term ramp up in spending, amounting to more than 170 SEK billion in extra funding between 2025-2030. The new pledge also includes a forecast of reaching 2.6 percent GDP spending on defense in 2028. The latest commitments are in line with recommendations made in a Swedish Defence Commission report earlier this year, which advocated for 'increased ambition' militarily, in light of Russia's war in Ukraine and Stockholm's entry to NATO. In a statement today, the Swedish government was clear about the need for the spending plan. 'The security situation demands a stronger defence,' it said. 'Russia’s war against Ukraine is a defining factor for security in Sweden’s neighbourhood. As the Budget Bill makes clear, the Government proposes significant resource increases to strengthen Sweden’s defence capabilities and enable extensive growth of the country’s total defence.' Stockholm also added that as part of proposals for a total defense bill it plans on proposing 'significant resource increases for the country's armed forces between 2025-2035, 'in accordance' with the Defence Commission’s report on strengthening national defense capabilities. Today we announce that the 🇸🇪government will increase the Swedish military budget next year by 13 billion SEK (+10%), bringing the total amount to 138 billion SEK. Sweden’s military budget will therefore reach 2,4% of GDP in 2025. (1/7) pic.twitter.com/anrreLNljM &mdash; Pål Jonson (@PlJonson) September 17, 2024 Sweden's new statement did not single out any acquisitions that will receive new investment or service level modernization, but as Stockholm is set to honor the Commission's guidance, changes on the way are likely to include the Swedish Army moving to three mechanized brigades and one infantry brigade by 2030; upscaling air defense capabilities to counter drones; and additional orders of air-to-air and cruise missiles. In a series of posts related to the spending plan on X (formerly Twitter), Pål Jonson, Sweden's defense minister, urged NATO-affiliated 'European allies' to 'assume a larger responsibility for Europe’s security.' Sweden has already started contributing to the alliance, and subject to parliamentary approval, noted today's statement, will also play a role in future alliance air surveillance missions and add to standing maritime forces. Improvements to funding for Ukraine will also see a new 'framework' established for 2024-2026, with total military aid for Kyiv pushed to 25 billion SEK per year. Meanwhile, Jonson said that the Swedish government is 'adding funds' to the Swedish Defence Research Agency so the organization can look further into disruptive technologies. He further stated that the total defense bill will be presented to parliament 'next month.' Bloomberg reported Monday that Sweden had agreed to lead a new NATO base for forward land forces in Finland in partnership with its Nordic neighbor. The location of the base was not disclosed by Stockholm or Helsinki.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/sweden-moves-to-ramp-up-defense-spending-by-1-3-billion-in-2025/	2024-09-17T12:25:10-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/6424417-scaled-e1726593315486.jpg
More than a ‘paperwork exercise’: Air Force reoptimization plan moving forward	AETC head Lt. Gen. Brian Robinson in a file photo (DVIDS) AFA 2024 — The Air Force’s overall plan to reorganize under the heading of 'reoptimization' for great power competition is inching forward, with officials using this week’s Air and Space Forces Association to make the case for why stark organizational changes are needed. The reoptimization should, as Air Education and Training Command (AETC) chief Lt. Gen. Brian Robinson put it, emphasize 'mission over function,' breaking down longstanding stovepipes that separate warfighters — and the associated training, wargaming and experimentation — with acquisition. At a panel today, Robinson told a story about a visit by Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall to AETC in November 2022. At one point during the visit, Kendall 'looked over at me in the conversation, [and asked] ‘How are we going to train on the CCAs?' And my answer back was, Mr. Secretary, what is a CCA?' The visit would have taken place before the Collaborative Combat Aircraft concept came to dominate public discussion as the future of American airpower, but Robinson acknowledged the nervous laughs from the crowd as the right reaction. At the time, Robinson said, CCA was more of an acquisition issue and not yet something for which airmen seemed to need to be trained — the kind of assumption the reoptimization hopes to dispel. 'We've got to be holistically integrated in that way, thinking about the entire mission setting,' Robinson said, adding that the CCA program has now done a much better job of integration across the service. One key effort under the Air Force’s reoptimization drive is the creation of a new Integrated Capabilities Command (ICC), which officials have said will assume the role of crafting the service’s requirements. A related Integrated Capabilities Office, opened by the Air Force in July, will largely advise senior leaders on acquisitions with a specific focus on Kendall’s operational imperatives. Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Allvin intended to stand the office up this year, and made a step toward that goal during the conference here. The service has now opened a 'provisional' ICC with a staff of about 100 people working from their current locations, Allvin said Monday, and aims to eventually bring on about 800. The provisional command will be led by Maj. Gen. Mark Mitchum, though the full ICC is expected to be led by a three-star general. 'We have to have the full manning documents understood. Have do the full strategic basing process, full congressional notification, full nomination of the leadership, which is, if it's going to be a three star, has to be nominated, confirmed. So all of that will happen,' Allvin told reporters. 'I would like to have it done, the full one, within calendar year 2025.' Lt. Gens. David Harris and Dale White, who have key roles in standing up ICC, both emphasized a sense of 'urgency' to stand the office up and get work underway. Industry, operators and acquisition form a 'trinity' that will be needed to keep the Air Force up to speed to counter potential threats in the future, Harris said, with the new organization mixing experimentation, acquisitions and warfighting. 'I think those that believe this is just a paperwork exercise or org chart exercise, I think you're going to see something very different. Warfighter integration means something' real, added White. Any great power conflict, said White, is 'going to be a technologically based war. And capability development is clearly a warfighting function. We have to embrace that. We have to operate that way, and we have to organize that way.'

Honeywell to demo new kinetic, soft-kill C-UAS for Air Force	The 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment and the Threat Systems Management Office operate a swarm of 40 drones to test the rotational units capabilities during the battle of Razish, National Training Center on May 8, 2019. (US Army/Pvt. James Newsome) AFA 2024 — Early next year, the US Air Force will see a demo of a new Honeywell system that combines kinetic interceptors, directed energy and electronic warfare capabilities to protect high-value targets from swarms of inbound drones. The company used this year’s Air &amp; Space Forces Association conference outside of Washington, DC, to announce its Stationary and Mobile Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) Reveal and Intercept capability that cobbles together host technologies from other vendors. In a subsequent statement to Breaking Defense, a Honeywell spokesperson said the system marries up radar, electro-optical/infrared, and artificial intelligence detectors, and then knocks the drones down by either launching a kinetic interceptor, using a directed energy weapon or severing the radio contact back to the controller. 'This system’s multi-layered defensive capabilities set it apart in the industry and enable it to not only track and detect, but also defeat multiple threats,' Milas said in the press release. The Air Force Global Strike team has now tasked Honeywell with demonstrating the system in January 2025, at which time the C-UAS system will be used to first detect an unspecified number of drones moving at a high speed before disabling them. The growing role of drones on the battlefield inside Ukraine and in the Middle East has not only pushed the US military to ramp up its hunt for new capabilities, but also systems to defeat them. Part of that focus has revolved around existing kinetic options like Stinger missiles, while also testing out new directed energy ones like high-energy laser and high-powered microwaves that may one day drive provide a cheaper per unit kill option.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/honeywell-to-demo-new-kinetic-soft-kill-c-uas-for-air-force/	2024-09-17T11:32:35-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/220309_DVIDS_drone_swarm_5356116-scaled-e1664320365372.jpg
Northrop releases new software, hardware ‘ecosystem’ aimed at CJADC2-style integration	Hardware components of Northrop Grumman's NG InSight suite of integration and communication products. (Carley Welch / Breaking Defense) AFA 2024 — Northrop Grumman says it has developed a new product line, coined NG InSight, that it's calling a 'modular ecosystem' of software and hardware designed to connect, well, just about everything. 'So the key is really integrating across different domains, services, partner nations, so it brings together capabilities,' Jenna Paukstis, vice president of the networked solutions division at Northrop, told Breaking Defense on the sidelines of the Air, Space and Cyber Conference Monday. Paukstis said the new line, which is essentially a system of systems, includes physical hardware components like open system processors, multifunction apertures and modules that can be plugged into both new and legacy platforms manufactured by anyone, not just Northrop. These hardware components can go on airborne platforms, ground-based terrestrial systems, maritime systems and some of the cryptologic and advanced intelligence capabilities which are part of smaller components, can go into space on payloads, she added. On the software side, the product line includes tech dedicated to signals intelligence, communications, networking and other non-kinetic effects like electronic warfare capabilities, which Paukstis said can operate in a secure, 'resilient' manner, allowing for information sharing in contested and congested environments. 'Now the Air Force, ground and maritime forces, if they can rely on high-speed, low-latency connectivity from space, what missions can they now do with that connectivity?' Pauksitis asked. 'So now you can get access to critical data when and where you need it in a secure and adaptable setting.' These software components also serve both defensive and offensive purposes. Offensively, NG InSight is capable of non-kinetic effects that are 'essential for disrupting, deceiving or neutralizing adversarial capabilities, allowing forces to weaken enemy operations while protecting friendly assets,' a Northrop press release read. On defense, the release says the ecosystem enables 'the rapid interception, processing and analysis of adversaries, providing critical intelligence that can shape battlefield outcomes with speed and precision.' For all Northrop says the family of systems can do, Paukstis highlighted its flexibility as a selling point. 'So you can think about developing this product line of capabilities that you can then reuse, which helps with the speed. It also helps with affordability. But of course, every customer needs it slightly different, right? So you can put that together and tailor it based on their mission needs.' The US military has long sought simpler ways to connect countless assets around the world, a key demand of its sprawling Combined Joint All-Domain Command and Control (CJADC2) program, which works to create an all-seeing, all-connected battle network. Northrop is positioning NG InSight as a one-stop shop solution for CJADC2's 'information layer.' 'To achieve CJADC2 we have to seamlessly integrate 4th and 5th generation platforms and be able to communicate across services and domains with a focus on speed and scalability,' a Northrop spokesperson said in an email to Breaking Defense. 'NG InSight does just that — we increase the ability to &#8216;Fight Tonight' by rapidly upgrading existing platforms with near-term technology enhancements for electronic warfare, communications, networking, geolocation, targeting and multifunction sensors.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/northrop-releases-new-software-hardware-ecosystem-aimed-at-cjadc2-style-integration/	2024-09-17T10:49:22-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/240917_northrop_insight_box_WELCH-scaled-e1726595250934.jpg
Russia ‘should know better’ than to put an anti-satellite nuke in space, NORAD chief says	Russian President Vladimir Putin delivers a speech during his visit at the Vostochny cosmodrome, some 180 km north of Blagoveschensk, Amur region on April 12, 2022. (Photo by YEVGENY BIYATOV/Sputnik/AFP via Getty Images) AFA 2024 — A senior US military official said today that it's 'highly concerning' that Russia is apparently considering putting an anti-satellite nuclear weapon in space — a threat that, if realized, 'would affect virtually every man, woman and child on Earth.' 'Russia is the OG [original gangster] space power. They put up Sputnik, the first man, the first woman in space. They know better; they should know better,' NORAD commander Gen. Gregory Guillot said, saying the weapon would be a 'violation' of the 1967 Outer Space Treaty. 'Secondly, it's indiscriminate. It's not just going to potentially affect US satellites. It will affect Russian satellites, Chinese satellites, Indian satellites, European satellites, Japanese satellites. Those kind of impacts will have real repercussions for those of us here on planet Earth. 'So, the world can’t and shouldn't accept that somebody would place a nuclear weapon in orbit,' he told an audience at the Air, Space &amp; Cyber Conference in Washington. This spring the Biden administration, citing 'credible information,' accused Russia of using a satellite in orbit to conduct tests that could presage the placement of a nuclear-armed anti-satellite weapon. 'The United States has been aware of Russia’s pursuit of this sort of capability dating back years, but only recently have we been able to make a more precise assessment of their progress,' Mallory Stewart, assistant secretary for the Bureau of Arms Control, Deterrence, and Stability, told the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in May. Stewart noted that Russia claimed the satellite already in orbit was only there for 'scientific purposes,' but the US government suspected otherwise based in part on the satellite's unusual altitude. In earlier testimony before Congress, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Space Policy John Plumb said a Russian space-based nuclear capability 'could pose a threat to all satellites operated by countries and companies around the globe, as well as to the vital communications, scientific, meteorological, agricultural, commercial, and national security services we all depend upon. Russia has dismissed the accusation as 'fake news,' but the denial does not appear to have changed the conclusions of US space officials. On Tuesday Lt. Gen. Douglas, the commander of US Space Forces — Space, listed various threats that have emerged to US assets in orbit since the founding of the Space Force in 2019. Among them, he said, 'we have a possible threat from Russia on maybe a nuclear capability in space.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/russia-should-know-better-than-to-put-an-anti-satellite-nuke-in-space-norad-chief-says/	2024-09-17T10:37:53-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/240917_putin_rocket_GettyImages-1239929978-scaled-e1726593428608.jpg
Not a one-way street: DoD will receive, not just give, data to Commerce’s space traffic system	The Satellite Dashboard is an example of an open source tool to monitor close approaches of satellites and debris in space, produced by the Center for Strategic and International Security, the Secure World Foundation, and the University of Texas at Austin. (Satellite Dashboard) AMOS 2024 — While the Commerce Department's new space monitoring system for non-military users will rely heavily on data from the Defense Department, especially in its initial stages, the Pentagon also will eventually benefit from commercial data obtained by the Traffic Coordination System for Space (TraCSS), according to Commerce officials. 'DoD is going to be a TraCSS user, and they're going to have rule-based access to the data that they need to extract — which mainly at this point is the owner/operator ephems [ephemeris]. Because we're ingesting owner/operator ephems, they won't be ingesting them in Space-Track.org anymore,' Sandy Magnus, chief engineer at the Office of Space Commerce (OCS) said Monday. A satellite ephemeris is a set of data that provides the location of a satellite at specific times. based on observations and analytical models, and are used to provide space situational awareness (SSA). Space Force's 18th Space Control Squadron manages Space-Track.org, which currently provides rough ephemeris of the some 47,000 satellites and dangerous space junk tracked by US Space Command (SPACECOM) via telescopes and radar. Speaking to Breaking Defense along with several other OCS officials in the margins of the annual Advanced Maui Optical and Space Surveillance Technologies (AMOS) Conference in Hawaii, Magnus explained that her office will provide all the software Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) the Space Force and SPACECOM will need to 'extract' that unclassified commercial data from TraCSS. But DoD will be responsible for ensuring that data is translated into formats usable by military operators. 'They're going to do whatever magic thing they have to do on the DoD side to get it back in their classified catalog, or wherever they keep it,' she said. Commerce officials stressed that DoD is providing only its unclassified data about the whereabouts of space objects to TraCSS, although some of that information also might be 'controlled unclassified information,' of CUI. Under DoD policy, which is somewhat controversial, information dubbed as CUI isn't shareable with private operators for various reasons, including national security concerns. So, while satellite ephemeris data and other basic data about satellite functionality will be freely available once the TraCSS website is up and running, the full TraCSS database of collision warnings won't be, the OCS officials said. Instead, TraCSS will provide what are known as 'conjunction data messages' or CDMs — essentially, warnings that a satellite is likely to come close to another space objects and thus there may be a possibility of a collision — to the commercial or foreign government owner/operators involved. That said, TraCSS will go above and beyond DoD's current CDM process by publicly providing the specifics of a potential crash in what are deemed emergency situations, explained Mariel Borowitz, OCS director of international SSA engagement. 'When those events are above some threshold of risk, so they get termed to be emergency events, then we're going to make those open and so that's a change from what's been in the past,' she said. 'I think that is a significant difference from the status quo today.' OCS has a study ongoing to figure out what the threshold for an emergency is, which, for example, would include the predicted probability of a collision. The study is bouncing off of NASA research done about a decade ago, but using updated information about the environment, the Commerce officials explained. It is expected to be finished by the end of the year. OCS Director Richard DalBello noted that developing criteria to judge what makes sense and how to 'value what exists' before determining operational parameters for TraCSS is 'the logic that has underpinned all of the work we've done.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/not-a-one-way-street-dod-will-receive-not-just-give-data-to-commerces-space-traffic-system/	2024-09-17T07:59:38-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/220126_csis_space_dashboard.png

(Image credit: Planet) WASHINGTON — The National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGA) has tapped 10 commercial space and data crunching companies to provide unclassified computer vision and artificial intelligence-based analytic services under a contract vehicle worth up to $290 million over five years. Under the Luno A indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) award, each of the vendors will compete for tasking orders from NGA designed to help agency personnel improve its intel products — which then are disseminated to users in the national security community from the president to Pentagon leaders to military commanders in the field. 'Luno A provides national security community users with access to the commercial data and analytic services that add new context to analytic assessments by characterizing things such as worldwide economic, environmental and military activities. Deliverables will be driven by validated user requirements, mission-specific and responsive to the community’s needs,' NGA said in a Sept. 13 press release. RELATED: Ursa Major wins, matches $12.5M investment from DoD to improve solid rocket motor production Information gathered primarily from commercial remote sensing satellites will include, for example, data about economic development around the world and environmental crises as well as information about foreign military capabilities.

Ursa Major wins, matches $12.5M investment from DoD to improve solid rocket motor production	Navy Strategic Systems Programs (SSP) conducted a successful test of the Second Stage Solid Rocket Motor (SRM) on August 25th in Promontory, Utah as part of the development of the Navy’s Conventional Prompt Strike (CPS) offensive hypersonic strike capability and the Army’s Long Range Hypersonic Weapon (LRHW). (US Navy photo) WASHINGTON — Ursa Major, a Colorado-based privately funded defense contractor, announced today it will match a $12.5 million investment from the Pentagon to begin work on maturing its solid rocket motor manufacturing process. The initial Defense Department investment stems from the Office of Strategic Capital, a Pentagon office focused on strengthening critical supply chain technologies, and the work will be done in conjunction with the US Navy’s Program Executive Office for Integrated Warfare Systems. Breaking Defense sought a comment from the Navy, which deferred to the Office of Strategic Capital. A spokesperson for OSC did not respond to a request for comment by press time. 'We are proud to work with OSC on their mandate for expanding the defense industrial base by bringing new innovations into the DoD ecosystem,' Dan Jablonsky, Ursa Major CEO, said in a company statement. 'Ursa Major is revolutionizing manufacturing approaches used in propulsion development in the United States, building flexibility of production and scalability into manufacturing for our defense customers.' The work, which was initially awarded in July, will focus on propellant manufacturing, additive manufacturing and composite case winding, the statement added. Separately, Ursa Major announced in April it was working with the Navy to apply its manufacturing process for the Mk104 Dual Thrust Rocket Motor, which is used on the service’s SM-2, SM-3 and SM-6 missiles. The announcement comes as numerous defense tech companies are all eyeing the solid rocket motor industry. Breaking Defense previously reported that Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics struck a deal to partner on the technology, Anduril made acquisitions to enter the space, and Northrop Grumman launched an innovation campaign around SRMs. It’s also among the first big public pushes by the Office of Strategic Capital, a relatively new office introduced by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin during the 2022 Reagan National Defense Forum and aimed specifically at infusing private capital into defense tech startups. 'Our partners in the private sector have flagged a consistent problem,' Austin said at the time. 'Even when they can see a way to deliver a promising technology to a military customer, securing the necessary capital to scale is hard — and sometimes impossible. So we’ve listened, and we’ve acted.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/ursa-major-wins-matches-12-5m-investment-from-dod-to-improve-solid-rocket-motor-production/	2024-09-16T21:01:16-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/08/210825-N-NO191-0002-e1726510358325.jpg

CCA drones may not be tied to NGAD, need line-of-sight control: Kendall	Frank Kendall, secretary of the US Air Force, speaks during the US Chamber of Commerce's Global Aerospace Summit in Washington, DC, US, on Tuesday, Sept. 10, 2024. (Ting Shen/Bloomberg via Getty Images) AFA 2024 — As the US Air Force goes back to the drawing board to decide what it wants from its much-anticipated next-gen fighter jet, the Air Force secretary revealed today the plane may not be called on to play quarterback for a coterie of loyal wingman drones as originally envisioned. Frank Kendall said that while his service is 'moving towards greater reliance on uncrewed aircraft,' it was a 'question mark' as to whether the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) fighter would control the Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) drones. Kendall made the remarks at a roundtable at the Air and Space Forces Association Air, Space & Cyber annual conference here in Washington, where last year he described NGAD and CCA in terms that suggested nearly intertwined programs — with aircraft numbers based in relation to one another. CCAs were also envisioned operating with current fighters like the F-35. But since then the Air Force has paused development of NGAD and reexamined basic assumptions about the aircraft — even, apparently, absolute certainty it would have a human pilot on board. ('We're probably going to do one more version, at least, of crewed, more traditional aircraft,' he said today.) Kendall did say that any fighter jet controlling CCAs would be manned, noting 'I don't see us going away from that combination anytime soon.' Kendall also revealed new details about how CCAs, expected to be fielded before the end of the decade, will operate. He said the Air Force previously envisioned a single fighter controlling roughly three-to-five CCA drones, but the service is 'talking about bigger numbers than that now.' The secretary also has previously told Breaking Defense the Air Force is still working out thorny ethical issues associated with employing the drones, and explained today that some operational limits should be expected as a result. 'One of the things you have to have if you're going to use CCAs and have them be armed and lethal is that they have to be under tight control. And for me, one of the elements of that needs to be line-of-sight communications,' Kendall said. Line-of-sight communications refers to direct links between a transmitter and receiver without obstructions like the curvature of the earth. 'We're not going to have aircraft going out and doing engagements uncontrolled, so the default, if they lose communications, would be for them to return to base, which takes them out of the fight,' he continued. 'So we don't want that to happen. And when they do do engagements, we want them under tight control.' NGAD Cost While work on NGAD remains stalled, Kendall said today a decision on what to do with the fighter should be reached within the next few months, despite numerous variables that officials have to weigh. One key factor officials have to balance is price, as more expensive options could prevent the service from fielding the fighter in sufficient numbers. Kendall today doubled down on aiming for a cost target roughly in the ballpark of an F-35, arguing that — assuming NGAD does, in fact, control loyal wingmen — 'once you start integrating CCAs and transferring some mission equipment and capabilities functions to the CCAs, then you can talk about a different concept, potentially, for the crewed fighter that's controlling them.' Air Force acquisition chief Andrew Hunter stressed in a later roundtable with reporters today that the service is 'looking for an affordable design concept' for NGAD that in turn would enable the jet to be fielded 'in sufficient numbers.' Hunter conceded that it’s possible the cost target can’t be reached, though he emphasized that analysis has to finish first. And, Kendall said, the Air Force will field the fighter even if a more expensive option proves to be the most cost-effective. A team of advisors led by Tim Grayson, a special assistant to Kendall, is looking at the NGAD platform in a wider context to include the role for a next-gen tanker and future tranches of CCA, Kendall said. Yet even after all of those questions are settled, underlying technological concerns may not be the biggest challenge. 'Then by the way, we’ve got to figure out how we’re going to pay for it, which I think may, at the end of the day, be our biggest problem,' Kendall said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/cca-drones-may-not-be-tied-to-ngad-need-line-of-sight-control-kendall/	2024-09-16T16:33:57-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/240916_kendall_global_aerospace_GettyImages-2170543390-scaled-e1726528408175.jpg
Del Toro warns appropriators of widespread delays for Navy if 6-month CR passes	The Virginia-class attack submarine Minnesota (SSN 783) is under construction at Huntington Ingalls Newport News Shipbuilding. (U.S. Navy photo courtesy of Newport News Shipbuilding/Released) WASHINGTON — Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro warned congressional appropriators that numerous high-profile shipbuilding efforts — Columbia and Virginia-class submarines as well as certain aircraft carriers — would suffer programmatic setbacks if lawmakers pass a six-month continuing resolution. 'This lengthy delay in new funding would force the Department of the Navy to operate at last year's funding levels with the negative consequences lasting far beyond the time frame of the CR, impeding our ability to field the force needed to defend our nation while imposing unnecessary stress on our sailors, Marines, civilians, and their families,' he wrote in a letter dated Sept. 12 and made public by Del Toro's office today. Under a six-month CR, according to Del Toro, both the Virginia- and Columbia-class programs would face schedule delays or postponed construction cycles. 'A six-month CR risks delaying critical investments in the submarine industrial base and the Australia, United Kingdom, and United States (AUKUS) partnership,' he wrote. The half-year CR would also further delay the John C. Stennis (CVN-74), an aircraft carrier that has been undergoing its mid-life overhaul for more than five years and is past due to return to the fleet. The secretary further wrote there would be delays to the 'ongoing and planning Nuclear Command, Control and Communications engineering activities' being done in conjunction with US Strategic Command as well as development and procurement of conventional munitions. In total, Del Toro said 20 construction projects, five research and development efforts, up to 58 ship maintenance availabilities, as well as procurement of five ships and various aircraft and munitions programs would also be set back under the six-month CR. 'The Department of the Navy stands ready to assist Congress in any way possible to ensure it has the information and resources to pass this essential legislation' he wrote.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/del-toro-warns-appropriators-of-widespread-delays-for-navy-if-6-month-cr-passes/	2024-09-16T15:13:21-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/11/231108_DVIDS_submarine_construction_820194-e1699443296744.jpg
Space Development Agency eyes laser link between different contractors’ birds	A trail of a group of SpaceX's Starlink satellites passing over Uruguay. (Photo by MARIANA SUAREZ/AFP via Getty Images) AFA 2024 — As of this weekend, York Space Systems has gotten the laser communications system working on their recently launched satellites for the Space Force’s nascent Low Earth Orbit network, the director of the Space Development Agency said this morning. The next step, Derek Tournear told reporters, is to get York’s satellites linked by laser to SpaceX’s birds. The two contractors have gotten their tech to connect successfully in extensive, rigorous tests on the ground, he said, which gives him confidence that they can now make it work in space. But it really had better work, because the stakes are make-or-break for SDA’s ambitious Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture (PWSA). 'I'm excited to report that, over the weekend, York was able to get optical communication networking working on their satellites,' Tournear told reporters. 'Now we have both a set of transport satellites and a set of tracking satellites with the optical connectivity.' 'The next step on that, obviously, is to have the York and SpaceX satellites talk to one another and form a complete mesh network,' he said. 'It’s critical that it works.' Why so serious? 'The whole idea' of PWSA, he said, is to move away from traditional Pentagon 'stovepipes,' where different government agencies and armed services hire different contractors to build different systems using different protocols that can’t share data without elaborate kludges or painstaking manual re-entry. Instead, PWSA is meant to use what’s known as open architecture, where everything can talk to everything else and any company can plug-and-play its products as long as they meet certain common standards. This kind of seamless machine-to-machine exchange of data is critical to the Pentagon’s emerging global battle network, known as CJADC2. In more civilian terms, PWSA’s open architecture is meant to function a lot like the app store on a smart phone – except it (a) includes hardware, not just software, and (b) has to work in wartime while hurtling through space at just under five miles per second. 'I describe PWSA, the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture, as the Android model, right?' Tournear explained. As the government, he said, 'we endorse interfaces and standards between them, we set up a test bed, [specifically] our optical test bed that’s at Naval Research Laboratory, [where] vendors have to bring their equipment, plug it into NRL, and show that they can talk to the gold standard – the government gold standard – as well as the other vendors to make sure all that works.' As long as a company’s tech meets the compatibility standards so it works when plugged in to the wider network, Tournear emphasized, the government doesn’t care how it works or need to know any sensitive trade secrets, a perennial sticking point in Pentagon IT contracts. 'We don’t care what’s in the black box behind that interface,' he said. 'The whole point of this PSWA [approach] is to build up a market, where we have multiple vendors to keep the price low [and] keep the innovation pushing forward. So if we get vendor lock, if only one works, or if they can't talk to each others, that falls apart pretty quickly.' Tournear said he is confident the tech will work on orbit, because it’s been tested so thoroughly on the ground. 'I deem this pretty low risk is because that has been where the focus of most of our systems engineering has been day to day,' he said. 'That's why we have forced them to go to NRL, to demonstrate this interoperability, to make sure it all works.' 'Obviously you want to make sure,' he said. 'But I think that the risk that it actually fails is pretty low.' Spokespeople for York and SpaceX did not immediately respond to Breaking Defense's request for comment, but assuming the laser link does work as planned, Tournear has an ambitious schedule to build out the network of numerous (aka 'proliferated') Low Earth Orbit satellites for a wide range of missions. The initial set of PWSA satellites now on orbit is called Tranche 0, and while relatively few, he said, they’re demonstrating the core capabilities all work. On the communications side, those capabilities include not only laser links — both satellite to satellite and space to ground — but also the traditional and internationally ubiquitous Link-16 protocol, which uses radio waves. 'One hundred percent of our links work' for Link-16, Tournear said. 'We've demonstrated that a lot of different platforms, including aircraft [in flight] and down to aircraft carriers at sea. All that works.' Tranche 0 surveillance satellites have also successfully tracked an array of real-world events, from missile launches to the SpaceX Starship’s reentry. 'We demonstrated that with our first set of launches, the SpaceX birds with the Leidos sensors,' Tournear said. 'We expect the L3Harris birds with the L3Harris sensors to be online and collecting data later, probably in early October.' Overall, 'Tranche 0 is an unmitigated success,' Tournear exulted. 'We've been able to check out all the boxes that we needed to prove the concept works, and then Tranche One with approximately 160 satellites — that will all be launched next year — will actually make this operational.' After that, 'Tranche 2, obviously, is in build,' he went on. '[For] Tranche 3, we passed the Warfighter Council, which is the body we use to vet all requirements. … We expect the solicitation for the integrator portion of that later this year, with the satellite solicitations to go out early next year, so we can get Tranche 3 ready to launch by the end of calendar year '28.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/space-development-agency-eyes-laser-link-between-different-contractors-birds/	2024-09-16T14:34:34-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/220830_starlink_sky_streak_GettyImages-1231167449-scaled-e1661980807658.jpg
Lockheed announces new ‘extreme range’ version of JASSM cruise missile	A model of Lockheed Martin's AGM-158 XR. (Valerie Insinna/Breaking Defense) WASHINGTON — A new 'extreme range' prototype of Lockheed Martin’s AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile could be ready for flight testing in one or two years, a company official said today. The Pentagon has not committed to buying the new weapon, known as AGM-158 XR, said Michael Rothstein, Lockheed’s vice president of air weapons and sensors. However, Lockheed is putting its own funds toward early development work on the missile, which he said could 'significantly' expand the missile’s reach past the JASSM and the Long-Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM) variants currently being produced for the Air Force and Navy. 'I can't give you any numbers at this point from a classification perspective' on the range of the weapon, Rothstein said. 'It's not minor. It's not on the edge.' Lockheed envisions the XR variant as the natural follow-up to the JASSM-D and LRASM-C3 currently in development for the Air Force and Navy. The most visible difference between AGM-158 XR and previous variants is its stretched design, but Rothstein noted that there are other 'smart' modifications internal to the missile to increase modularity. The most obvious benefit of the AGM-158 XR’s longer range is that it keeps the pilot further away from a threat. And because operators won’t have to drive in close to a target in order to strike it, it also cuts down the distance it takes for a combat aircraft to refuel and rearm — saving fuel and allowing it to conduct additional strikes over a given time period, Rothstein said. The larger, heavier size of AGM-158 XR means that it cannot be carried by the F-16 and that other aircraft like the F-35 or F-15 that could use it will not be able to fly as far, Rothstein said. But in the latter case, that impact is negated by the longer range of the weapon itself. The AGM-158 XR is still 'several years out' from being ready for fielding, Rothstein said, adding that the timing would also depend on the services’ own budget priorities. Looking at 'the operational benefits, I think the war fighters go, 'It makes perfect sense.' And then leveraging, rather than a new weapon, leveraging a hot production line [and] mature supply chain, all that makes sense, too,' Rothstein said. 'So the initial feedback we think is positive.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/lockheed-announces-new-extreme-range-version-of-jassm-cruise-missile/	2024-09-16T13:44:36-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/IMG_1718-scaled-e1726518720288.jpg

‘Partnership of convenience’: PACAF chief sees ‘potential limits’ in Chinese, Russian military ties	Chinese Vice President Han Zheng meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Vladivostok, Russia, Sept. 4, 2024. (Photo by Wang Ye/Xinhua via Getty Images) AFA 2024 — Despite China and Russia's pledges of a 'no limits' partnership and a 'new era' of cooperation, the top US air commander in the Indo-Pacific isn't quite buying it, saying there do, in fact, appear to be limits and that it's more akin to a 'partnership of convenience.' 'In terms of the exercises between [China] and Russia, I do see that there are potential limits to that cooperation,' Pacific Air Forces Commander Gen. Kevin Schneider said in a roundtable with reporters at the Air and Space Forces Association Air, Space and Cyber conference today. 'Politically, it is unclear to me their long-term goals and objectives other than to counter what the United States and allies and partners are doing.' He said he 'would describe [their cooperation] a little bit more as a partnership of convenience, vice a deep-seated connection the way that we have a connection of values with our allies and partners.' In the time since declaring their partnership just prior to Russia's invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, Beijing and Moscow have sought to deepen military ties, with the West accusing China of being a 'decisive enabler' in Russia’s ongoing war against Kyiv. Russia and China have since launched a joint, world-spanning military exercise that includes air and naval drills, which Russian President Vladimir Putin reportedly said was underway 'in the context of growing geopolitical tensions.' Schneider said today it’s too soon to offer assessments of the exercises and that full intelligence readouts would be available later. Beijing's Aggression Holds Opportunities For US Outside the Moscow connection, one key US ally in the region, the Philippines, has also had to grapple with escalating tensions with China, most recently culminating in events like when Chinese vessels rammed Philippine ships. Echoing comments from Gen. Romeo Brawner, chief of staff of the Philippines armed forces, Schneider slammed Beijing’s alleged 'illegal, coercive, aggressive and deceptive' activity that he said is conversely driving more countries to cooperate with the US. 'Allies and partners around the region are seeing with incredibly clear eyes how these challenges, how these impingements on sovereignty, how these these attacks in the diplomatic and information space are affecting them,' he said. 'More and more doors are being opened across the region and the world, as like-minded allies and partners continue to find opportunities to do more together.' Washington and Beijing recently wrapped the latest meeting of a regular security summit, where US officials have said they directly raise concerns on Chinese activity in the South China Sea, among other topics. Besides a run-in with the Philippines, which the US is treaty-bound to defend, officials have said they are concerned that China may attempt to invade Taiwan in the coming years, in turn inviting a US response. Officials say open lines of communication like these talks offer a critical venue to lower the risk of conflict, though the Air Force’s top civilian warned today that the risk of war between the US and China only rises as Beijing’s military prowess grows. 'I am not saying war in the Pacific is imminent or inevitable. It is not.' said Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall. 'But I am saying that the likelihood is increasing, and will continue to do so.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/partnership-of-convenience-pacaf-chief-sees-potential-limits-in-chinese-russian-military-ties/	2024-09-16T10:22:34-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/240916_putin_china_vp_GettyImages-2169636318-scaled-e1726505313220.jpg
Return to Key West? Solving the DoD spacepower roles and missions debate	U.S. Army and U.S. Space Force Spur holders and candidates pose for a photo after a Spur Ride at Fort Bliss, Texas, April 30, 2024. Spur Rides are a time-honored tradition in cavalry units throughout the U.S. Army and typically involve cavalry soldiers, though cavalry Soldiers welcome fellow U.S. servicemembers to the challenge when possible. (U.S. Air Force photo by Senior Airman Nicholas Paczkowski) In recent weeks, several editorials and online comments have been traded regarding whether the Army should have its own space forces or whether all space forces should reside within the US Space Force. Emotions run high when military services fight over roles and missions, but it’s important to remember that these fights are part of a longstanding clash between services over capabilities. The good news is that there is a historical solution we can draw from in order to resolve the question which service should control what spacepower functions and capabilities: A new Key West agreement. In the late 1940s, then-Secretary of Defense James Forrestal directed that the Joint Chiefs meet in Key West, Florida, to work out the issues between the Navy, Army, and Air Force, or else, as he warned, 'I shall have to make my own decisions.' This conference was necessary because the National Security Act of 1947, which had recently become law, created a separate Air Force pulled from the Army — but did not fully sort out whether the Navy’s air arm should be moved over as well. The Key West conference decided on keeping a naval air arm for fleet-related matters and maritime campaigns, and that the Air Force would lead most every other major airpower function, such as airlift and strategic bombardment. This arrangement, as imperfect as some may find it, has remained for the last seven decades. When the Space Force was established in 2019, circumstances were somewhat different than 1947. The guidance in law was very broad, the direction from the White House was not much clearer, and the budget and personnel numbers were and still are largely insufficient to organize, train and equip a Space Force as it was conceptualized by the president and a bipartisan group of members of Congress. Due in part to the compromise position that placed the new service within the Department of the Air Force, rather than in its own separate department, many of those in the Army and Navy who were open to transferring personnel and space systems to the new service changed that stance to one of opposition and protectionism. They perceived that additional funding for the Air Force and its increased influence in the Joint Chiefs meetings and in requirements forums was an existential threat. Thus, the Army, as one example, began to push for more resources and personnel while transitioning some capabilities to the new service. Now, the Army sees the need to do more with space to ensure it has the spaceborne effects needed for supporting land warfare. On the other hand, the Space Force’s strongest supporters argue that the Army should not be allowed to have any space forces of their own. To resolve this argument requires a Key West-type conference. And to ensure focus for the discussion, several foundational actions must be accomplished: First, identify the problems to be solved. Are they doctrinal, legal, policy, or technical? Should the Space Force be responsible for all in-space and from-space warfighting functions such as anti-satellite warfighting, while the Army or other terrestrial services control ground-based counterspace systems? These questions can be subjective to the services and even in sub-groups within the services. Second, what are the core space capabilities or space-derived effects that the Army, Navy, and Air Force believe are absolutely vital for them to control? The Space Force and its combatant command cousin US Space Command were created to address the threats in the space area of responsibility. As each service wants to have control over everything that touches their operating domain (air, land, sea), would a mixed approach be better than an 'all in one basket' approach? Consensus on this question has critical implications for the organizing, training, and equipping functions as well as requirements for the combatant command itself. Third, what is the political landscape surrounding these topics, especially given that a new administration is coming in. One administration might believe that supporting the other military services should be the sole purpose of the Space Force, while others might believe that achieving space superiority is as vital to the nation as are air superiority and sea control. Knowing the views of the political masters is vital to the service chiefs knowing their boundaries in policy as they address this issue. Once these questions have been answered, preferably by policy guidance and direction from the White House (and preferably in partnership with Congress), then an agenda can be set to maximize the chances of an organizational construct for space that all of the military services can support. This issue needs to be resolved soon, and it needs to be hashed out at the highest level of military leadership so that the questions are sorted once and for all. Adversaries are deploying weapon systems that target our critical space infrastructure. We cannot afford to be duplicative or otherwise distracted by inter-service squabbling. We instead must be unified to deter attack in space and to protect our vital critical space infrastructure.

General Atomics is ready to rewrite the rules of airpower … again	Artist rendering of GA-ASI’s Collaborative Combat Aircraft. Tough new threats to the U.S. Air Force and its allies mean air combat must evolve. Prospective adversaries are fielding more capable combat aircraft than ever and are also building more of them. Air superiority will remain central to national power, but the old American orthodoxy around it can’t keep up. Human-flown fighters are essential, but they’re also expensive and time-consuming to design and produce. Complicating the challenge is the need to recruit, train, and retain human pilots. Today, current-model fighter production in the United States is all but maxed out. Even a miraculous rain shower of new money—which isn’t in anybody’s forecast—could not build many more aircraft quickly or add many more pilots to result in a substantially larger fighter force soon. As for future-model fighter production, the defense establishment has balked at the cost, complexity, time, and even basic philosophy associated with a new platform. All this means that it’ll be years before the Air Force, the joint force, and international allies can field an exquisite new 'sixth-generation' fighter. Daunting as these challenges are, the good news is that the Air Force and its partners have an answer: the Collaborative Combat Aircraft, or CCA. The new school of air superiority These highly capable autonomous jets fly alongside, or far ahead, of traditional combat aircraft formations. They sense, communicate, and act just like traditional warplanes, but also in some ways that no previous class of aircraft could. Following months of test and evaluation, it’s clear that the strongest contender to become the U.S. and international CCA is the model offered by General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, Inc. CCAs solve several problems at once. Because they’re smaller and don’t need onboard accommodations for a crew, they’re much less expensive per copy than a fighter. This—and the freedom from having to match every aircraft with at least one pilot—also means they can be put into large-scale production quickly. Large numbers of CCAs then can give 'mass,' as military planners call it, to the U.S. and allied air forces—sheer numbers of aircraft that can outmatch hostile forces. This means the friendly aircraft sent to make first contact with hostile ones can be unmanned, keeping precious human pilots back from danger. It means air component commanders can take on more risk with those aircraft and those engagements. And it means that, in the event of a conflict, the U.S. Air Force and its allies and partners can quickly replace units lost to attrition—something that cannot be said about traditional fighters and certainly human pilots. The task now before the Defense Department, military services, and international allies is what specific Collaborative Combat Aircraft to produce. GA-ASI’s proven status as the leader in uncrewed aircraft makes it the obvious answer. Experience matters Having spent more than 30 years inventing, testing, proving, and operating unmanned systems, no one has more experience. The company has delivered more than 1,100 aircraft and built a fleet for U.S. and international users that has recorded more than 8 million flight hours, many of them in combat. Autonomous combat jets have been a big part of that experience. The company’s MQ-20 Avenger® has been operating since 2009 and contributed heavily toward Air Force and other programs that support operationalizing combat aircraft autonomy. GA-ASI has logged more than 37,000 hours of jet flights of every kind, including detailed air combat simulations, and the company has more than 1,000 software engineers dedicated to further refining the artificial intelligence, machine learning, and other systems that make these aircraft work. Most recently, the Air Force Research Laboratory commissioned GA-ASI to build the XQ-67A Off-Board Sensing Station, an unmanned jet that proves out many of the key concepts for new-generation aircraft. XQ-67A validates that an aircraft can be built from a highly producible common core, which enables not only high rates of production but great variation in models. Think of the core like the base model of a vehicle used in automotive production. Factory workers build a steel cage, common chassis, and other components, and can then turn that into a family car or a luxury sedan, depending on customer orders. This lowers unit costs, speeds production, and provides greater choice for buyers. No other aerospace and defense manufacturer is poised to deliver a CCA as capable as the one built by General Atomics, or one as economical, producible, and flexible. This is important because the builder for this program must be able to deliver a high-performing aircraft at scale on time and on budget. Only a well-established manufacturer with deep expertise and active production could do so. GA-ASI is already ahead of its time. Another thing the Air Force must guard against are calls to turn CCA into an ever-fancier, ever-whizzier, ever-more-expensive boutique aircraft. Some in the aerospace world likely feel this type of platform gives them the advantage, but the risks are so great that it would put the Air Force right back where it started: not with agile mass for air combat but with a handful of silver bullets too precious to actually use—and unable to even the odds against prospective adversaries. When the city police department needs a new fleet of patrol cars, it doesn’t buy Lamborghinis. The virtue of CCA is that it can be good enough to get the job done for U.S. and international military forces, but also be practical and cost competitive. General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, Inc., offers all that and is ready now to start delivering this new wave of aircraft, which will rewrite the rules of airpower.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/general-atomics-is-ready-to-rewrite-the-rules-of-airpower-again/	2024-09-16T05:25:15-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/Cam_FromRight_02.jpg
Trust but verif-AI: Army will let genAI draft acquisition documents, with guardrails	Members of the 56th Air and Space Communications Squadron at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam operate cyber systems at Alpena Combat Readiness Training Center, Alpena, Michigan, July, 12, 2021. (U.S. Air Force photo by Tech. Sgt. Amy Picard) WASHINGTON — Generative artificial intelligence startup Ask Sage recently announced it had deployed its genAI software to the Army’s secure cloud, cArmy. The press release touted a host of processes the new tech could automate, such as software development, cybersecurity testing, and even parts of the federal acquisition system — 'to include drafting and generating RFIs, RFPs, scope of work, defining requirements, down-selecting bidders and much more.' That last litany of tasks may prove one of the most delicate the Department of Defense has yet asked algorithms to tackle in its now year-long and deeply ambivalent exploration of what's called genAI. It's also an area where both Ask Sage and the Army told Breaking Defense they will be watching closely, monitoring the effectiveness of several layers of built-in guardrails. Automating acquisition is an especially ambitious and high-stakes task. Protests by losing bidders are so common that program managers often build a three-month buffer into their schedules to account for a 'stop work' order while GAO investigates. Flaws in official documents — such as the 'RFIs [Requests For Information], RFPs [Requests For Proposal], scope of work, [and] requirements' mentioned in the Ask Sage release — can lead to court battles that disrupt a program. And early experiments in using genAI for matters of law have been less than successful, with multiple lawyers facing sanctions after using ChatGPT and similar software for legal research only to have it 'hallucinate' plausible but completely fictional precedents. RELATED: Pentagon should experiment with AIs like ChatGPT — but don’t trust them yet: DoD’s ex-AI chiefs The first and last line of defense, Ask Sage and Army officials said, is the human using the technology. But there are also algorithmic protections 'under the hood' of the software itself. Instead of simply consulting a single Large Language Model (LLMs) the way ChatGPT does, Ask Sage uses multiple programs — not all of them GenAI — as checks and balances to catch and correct mistakes before a human ever sees them. 'All contracts will still go through our legal process and humans will remain in the loop,' said the Army, in a statement from the office of the service Chief Information Officer to Breaking Defense following Ask Sage's announcement last week. 'We are exploring ways to use LLMs to optimize language in contracts [because] LLMs can analyze vast amounts of contract data and understand requirements for compliance with complex legal frameworks. This cuts down on the human-intensive work required to research and generate the language and, instead, uses LLMs to get to an initial solution quickly; then humans work with the LLMs to refine the output. … The human workload can then focus on applying critical thinking.' The old arms-control principle of 'trust but verify' applies, said Nicolas Chaillan, the former chief software officer of the Air Force, who left the service in frustration over bureaucracy in 2021 and founded Ask Sage in a burst of genAI enthusiasm just last year. 'It’s always reviewed by a human,' he told Breaking Defense in an interview. 'The human is going to read the whole thing.' RELATED: SOCOM acquisition chief: AI will be 'key to every single thing' But anyone who’s ever mindlessly clicked 'Okay' on pages of tedious privacy policies and user agreements knows very well that humans do not, in fact, always read the whole thing. AI ethicists and interface designers alike wrestle with a problem known as automation bias, in which everything from poor training to subtle perceptual cues — like highlighting a potential hostile contact in threatening red rather than cautionary yellow — can lead operators to blindly trust the machine instead of checking it. So Ask Sage does try very hard to build error correction, hallucination detection, and other safeguards into the software itself, Chaillan said. AI Checks And Balances First and foremost, Chaillan told Breaking Defense, the Ask Sage software doesn’t just consult a single Large Language Model. Instead, it’s a 'model-agnostic' intermediary or 'abstraction layer' between the human user and their data, on the one hand, and a whole parliament of different AI models — over 150 of them. 'You don’t want to put all your eggs in one basket,' Chaillan said. 'We're never getting locked into Open AI or Google' or any other specific 'foundation model' developer, he said. 'We can add models and even compare models and see which ones behave the best,' even picking different models as for different tasks. For some functions, there are also non-AI algorithms — old-school, predictable, determnistic IF-THEN-ELSE code — that doublecheck the AI’s work. 'I always want to have .. those right guard rails — and it took way more than just genAI to solve,' Chaillan emphasized. 'So it's a mix of genAI with traditional code and special training of the models and guards rails to get to a right answer. You couldn't do it just with genAI.' 'We make it self-reflect,' he said. 'When it generates a piece of document, we then pass it again to another model to say, ‘Hey, assess this language. What could be the potential legal risks? Is this compliant and following the FARS and DFARS requirements?'' 'It's not just a ‘one pump and go’ like you do on Chat GPT, where you type a piece of text and you get a response,' he said. In fact, even the human input is constrained and formalized to prevent errors: 'Writing an RFI is not just one prompt,' he went on. The software guides the user through a whole checklist of questions — what type of contract is best here? What’s the scope of work? How should we downselect to a winner? — before generating the output. That output can include not only the draft document, Chaillan said, but also commentary from the AI highlighting potential weak points where the algorithms were unsure of themselves. (That’s a far cry from the brazen self-confidence of many chatbots defending their errors). 'They get a report before reviewing the document to say, ‘Hey, you should pay attention to these sections. Maybe this isn't clear,’' he said. 'You give them a list of things that could be potential issues.' In fact, Chaillan argued, the AI is often better at spotting problems than human beings. For software development, 'the code is actually better than it is when written by humans,' he said, 'with the right models, the right training, and the right settings.' The software is even superior, he claimed, when it comes to parsing legal language and federal acquisition regulations — which, after all, are not only voluminous but written in convoluted ways no human brain can easily understand. 'Humans can’t remember every part of the FARS and DFARS — and there’s conflicting things [in different regulations],' he said. 'Ask 10 people, you’d get 10 different answers.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/trust-but-verif-ai-army-will-let-genai-draft-acquisition-documents-but-with-guardrails/	2024-09-16T04:20:54-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/240716_gide_finger_computer_6733216-e1721160785247.jpg
Navy awards General Dynamics NASSCO contract worth up to $6.7B for 8 new fleet oilers	The John Lewis-class fleet replenishment oiler is designed and built by General Dynamics NASSCO. (Photo courtesy of GD NASSCO.) WASHINGTON — The Navy today announced it has awarded General Dynamics NASSCO a contract worth up to $6.7 billion for the construction of up to eight John Lewis-class fleet oilers, a block buy deal the service anticipates will save $491 million. Tom Rivers, executive director for amphibious, auxiliary and sealift for program executive office ships, told reporters the contract also extends an ongoing shipbuilding capability preservation agreement the Navy has with NASSCO meant to incentivize shipbuilders to seek out commercial work. 'The way this works is … if NASCO is successful in getting the commercial work, the Navy will share some of the burden cost of overhead,' he told reporters shortly after the contract announcement was published. 'What happens is NASSCO becomes more competitive, and then the Navy, by bringing in additional commercial work, reduces our overhead, so our costs will go down.' He added that the statute dates back to the 1990s and has been in use with NASSCO for several years now, but the new contract extends the agreement into the mid-2030s. The service in 2016 awarded General Dynamics NASSCO a $3.2 billion contract for the design and construction of the first six ships of the John Lewis-class fleet oilers. Subsequently in 2022, the Navy bought two additional ships and then a third in 2023. With the addition of today's contract, the service will have agreements for up to 17 of the planned 20 ships in the class. Replenishment oilers carry jet fuel, diesel fuel and lubricating oil, and small quantities of fresh and frozen provisions, stores, potable water and other items, according to a Navy description of the Kaiser class, the legacy class of ships the newer vessels will replace. NASSCO is the San Diego-based shipbuilding arm of General Dynamics and is a staple Navy shipbuilder for various support and auxiliary vessels such as the John Lewis-class oilers and the expeditionary sea bases, as well as a ship repair yard. 'We are pleased to continue building these ships, with seventeen of the Navy’s twenty-ship program of record now on contract. This will make the T-AO program the longest Navy production series in NASSCO history,' Dave Carver, president of General Dynamics NASSCO, said in a statement. 'The NASSCO team is honored to continue working with our Navy customer and thankful for their unwavering support.' The Navy's current class of replenishment oiler ships were first constructed and launched in the 1980s by Avondale Shipyards, an independent shipyard that was acquired by several larger firms over the years but ultimately closed in 2014.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/navy-awards-general-dynamics-nassco-contract-worth-up-to-6-7b-for-8-new-fleet-oilers/	2024-09-13T15:03:25-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/image002-e1726262130539.jpg
State clears potential $4.1B KC-46 refuelers sale to Japan, $7.2B F-35 stealth fighters sale to Romania	A U.S. Air Force KC-46 Pegasus, right, refuels a U.S. Air Force F-16 Fighting Falcon, center, assigned to the 80th Fighter Squadron, over the Indo-Pacific, Oct. 22, 2023. (U.S. Air Force photo by Senior Airman Karrla Parra) WASHINGTON — The US State Department today approved a possible $4.1 billion sale for up to nine KC-46A Pegasus tankers for Japan — a buy that would more than double Tokyo’s currently planned Pegasus fleet — as well as a potential sale of 32 F-35A stealth fighters for Romania at a price of $7.2 billion, the Defense Security Cooperation Agency announced today. While the Romanian F-35 deal has been long expected, Japan's apparent interest in additional tankers comes as more of a surprise. Tokyo is already one of two international operators of the KC-46A, which is built by Boeing. Lockheed Martin manufactures the tri-variant F-35 and boasts an 18-member international customer base for the jet. The US Air Force is the largest customer for both platforms. Both announcements, issued in the form of a congressional notification from the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA), are not final. Quantities and dollar totals often shift during negotiations, and these announcements essentially permit the acquisition process to move forward. And today’s announcements technically tee up an opportunity for lawmakers to block the buys within a 30-day period, though such a step would be unlikely in either case. The KC-46A sale to Japan would appear to greatly expand Tokyo’s aerial refueling capabilities, critical for extending aircraft ranges over the vast stretches of ocean in the Indo-Pacific. Besides the refuelers themselves, the sale would include up to 18 PW4062 engines made by Pratt & Whitney, along with associated subsystems and support equipment. The announcement does not say when the aircraft would be expected to be delivered. A Boeing official, speaking on background, confirmed the potential sale of up to nine aircraft would add to six Pegasus refuelers already on contract with Tokyo, four of which have been delivered. Boeing referred further questions to the Japanese Ministry of Defense and the State Department. The State Department similarly referred questions to the MoD, which did not immediately respond to an off-hours request for comment. Japan does not appear to have previewed such a large potential buy publicly, though The Wall Street Journal reported recently that it had put aside some $1.4 billion in its newest defense budget for new KC-46s. RELATED: Boeing defense programs to feel the pinch as Seattle-based union votes to strike For its part, Romania announced in April 2023 that it intended to buy the F-35, adding Bucharest to a burgeoning international network of Joint Strike Fighter operators. The sale cleared by State today is reportedly the first of two planned tranches, with a second order of 16 jets expected sometime in the future. Romania, a NATO ally that borders Ukraine, previously said it was moving ahead with the purchase in a bid to deter Russian 'aggression.' The sale announced today includes 33 F135 engines made by Pratt & Whitney, as well as associated support equipment, according to DSCA. The DSCA release did not include an expected delivery date, but the Romanian Ministry of National Defence has previously said the first aircraft should be delivered in 2030.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/state-clears-potential-4-1b-kc-46-refuelers-sale-to-japan-7-2b-f-35-stealth-fighters-sale-to-romania/	2024-09-13T14:03:38-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/240913_DVIDS_kc46_japan2_4866234-scaled-e1726259237975.jpg
Anduril moves its AI focus to the heavens, planning new space monitoring sats	Anduril intends to develop new space surveillance satellites, using its AI-powered Lattice software. (Illustration: Anduril) WASHINGTON — Defense startup Anduril Industries, perhaps most known for its artificial intelligence applications for drone warfare, is setting its sights farther up — using its own funds to develop new satellites for monitoring the heavens. In an announcement released today, Anduril's Senior Vice President of Space and Engineering Gokul Subramanian said the company intends for the satellites to be launched by the end of 2025 — with the Space Force clearly the target market. Top brass from both the Space Force and US Space Command repeatedly have said that improved space domain awareness is a first-order priority. Anduril is looking to design multiple payloads, all based on its AI-powered Lattice software, the same platform used to power the counter-drone capabilities currently in use under the company's nearly $1 billion contract with Special Operations Command. 'Anduril will design, manufacture, and integrate modular mission payloads designed to enable unique mission requirements, leveraging our extensive expertise across imaging, electronic warfare, command and control, and mission autonomy. These payloads will provide warfighters with real-time data exploitation, autonomous coordination of satellites, and resilient communication capabilities,' Subramanian said. The first launch 'will serve as a testbed for maturation of multiple Anduril and third party payloads which we will be announcing in the coming months,' he added. Anduril quietly has been building experience in the space domain awareness arena. Subramanian explained that the company has 'multiple hardware and software payloads already deployed on orbit,' and is 'delivering advanced systems that range from on-orbit edge processing of sensor data to resilient satellite command and control.' Anduril's new satellites also will build off of work in November 2022 to demonstrate the application of its Lattice software for communications with the radars and telescopes making up the military's Space Surveillance Network. 'This expeditionary effort required multiple unique, site-specific software integrations that transformed the legacy SSN sites from a legacy system of communication to a resilient, high speed and integrated operational mesh network,' the company said in a July 2023 press release. In addition, the release said, Anduril's mesh network was used to restore the communications system of the Ground-Based Electro-Optical Deep Space Surveillance (GEODSS) System site in Maui, Hawaii, following a severe Kona Low storm. GEODSS is a network of telescopes — three at each of three sites in the US and at US Pacific Command — operated by Space Force Delta 2 as part of the overarching Space Surveillance Network. The company also has extensive experience in developing cameras and infrared sensor systems for its drones and counter-drone systems, having announced in February a new family of passive, long-range sensors, called Iris, for missions such as 'infrared search and track,' missile warning, and targeting.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/anduril-moves-its-ai-focus-to-the-heavens-planning-new-space-monitoring-sats/	2024-09-13T13:20:40-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/andurial-image-of-sat-e1726257864753.png
False start? DoD IG ‘terminated’ NGAD next-gen fighter review, but may revisit down the road	A Boeing rendering of a next-gen fighter. (Boeing photo) WASHINGTON — The Defense Department's Inspector General has quietly shelved a review of the Air Force's high-profile Next-Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) fighter program after it emerged that the service wasn't actually as far along in development as Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall had suggested in public remarks. The odd saga started in June 2022 when Kendall made headlines in announcing that the NGAD program had already entered the engineering and manufacturing development (EMD) phase, kicking off intense speculation about which defense prime pulled in the lucrative contract. But on Sept. 19 that year Kendall reversed himself, saying he was only speaking in a 'colloquial sense' to indicate the plane was in the design process. 'I’ve been around doing this stuff for a long time, and I still think of engineering and manufacturing development as a phase in which you are working on the new design,' he reportedly said at a Defense News conference earlier in September. Despite the walkback, later that month the DoD IG announced it was reviewing the program 'to determine the extent to which the Air Force demonstrated that the critical technologies used in the [NGAD] fighter aircraft were mature enough' to enter into the EMD phase. The review was to involve 'site visits as necessary.' But then a few months after that, sometime in 2023, the IG 'terminated' the review 'because of other priorities at the time,' IG office spokesperson Mollie Halpern told Breaking Defense this week. She added that '[t]he project will be reconsidered in the future.' An Air Force spokesperson referred questions about the review to the IG’s office. Whatever work was done during the review, it evidently didn’t get very far. Kendall and service acquisition chief Andrew Hunter both told Breaking Defense at the RIAT air show in July that they were unaware of the IG’s review, adding that it had no impact on the recent decision to pause work on NGAD. 'They’re doing a very quiet review,' Kendall quipped at the time. With NGAD Reevaluation, Northrop Sees Potential Window Like the review of the plane, the fate of the NGAD fighter itself has been thrown into doubt in more recent months as the Air Force has paused the program to reconsider its options. Kendall has maintained the Air Force will field a sixth-gen fighter, and possibly make it optionally manned. Budgetary constraints combined with fundamental questions about the fighter’s design — meant to perform across the vast stretches of the Indo-Pacific against sophisticated Chinese air defenses — have driven the service’s hesitancy, Kendall has said. Delays with the NGAD decision have now cast considerable doubt on the prospect of awarding an EMD contract this year, a goal the Air Force established in May 2023. The contest is thought to be between Lockheed Martin and Boeing after Northrop Grumman publicly pulled out. RELATED: As Air Force deliberates sixth-gen fighter plans, much is at stake for Boeing Still, the reevaluation of NGAD could present new opportunities, at least according to Northrop CEO Kathy Warden. At the Morgan Stanley Laguna conference on Thursday, Warden suggested that, based on what the Air Force does, Northrop may rejoin the fray. (Boeing, Lockheed and Northrop are all separately vying for a next-gen Navy fighter, with engine primes GE Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney actively competing in both Air Force and Navy efforts as well.) 'The Air Force has taken a strategic pause on that program and are revalidating requirements and the path forward for it. If they determine that there will be a material change to the program, we would go back and reevaluate, just as we would any new opportunity, whether we think that it is a program that we're well differentiated to perform, whether we view the business case as one that makes sense for a company and our investors, and we would look at new alternatives,' she said. 'So we're monitoring that one.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/false-start-dod-ig-terminated-ngad-next-gen-fighter-review-but-may-revisit-down-the-road/	2024-09-13T12:21:00-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/Boeing-R1-scaled-e1718985449640.jpg

Boeing defense programs to feel the pinch as Seattle-based union votes to strike	KC-46 under construction at Boeing's factory. (Boeing) WASHINGTON — Boeing’s machinists union in Washington state voted to strike late Thursday evening, putting near-term deliveries of the KC-46 and P-8 military aircraft in limbo. Members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM), which represents about 33,000 Boeing workers in the region, rejected a proposed deal that was endorsed by union leadership. Union members across the Seattle area, as well as some in Oregon and California, began striking at midnight local time. IAM said that 94 percent of its members voted to reject the contract, with 96 percent voting to strike. A two-thirds majority was required to strike. A strike at two of Boeing’s major commercial plane factories near Seattle threatens to plunge the company into further financial disarray as it grapples with a safety crisis that has hampered airplane production this year. The strike stops production of Boeing’s 737, 767 and 777 jetliners as well as military derivatives of those aircraft, which include the 737-based P-8 Poseidon maritime aircraft and the 767-based KC-46 tanker. 'The tanker program is going to be impacted by the BCA [Boeing commercial airplanes] factory disruption and now work stoppage,' Boeing Chief Financial Officer Brian West said during the Morgan Stanley Laguna conference today. 'That is going to flow through the tanker [production] rates, which is going to be more cost pressure [on Boeing’s defense unit].' Specifically, the strike could hamper Boeing’s ability to deliver 15 KC-46 tankers to the Air Force by the end of 2024, depending on the length of the work stoppage. Over the first half of the year, Boeing delivered three P-8s and five KC-46s, the company said in July. Boeing delivery data shows an additional two 767s were delivered to its defense unit in July for conversion into KC-46s for the Air Force. West said Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg is 'already at work' to get an agreement that addresses workers’ concerns, and that the company is focused on conserving cash during the strike. 'Kelly has been in Seattle all week getting first-hand information about the situation on the ground, and his priorities are to reset, reengage and rebuild,' West said. 'So how that plays out, in terms of timetable that will be up to the union the bargaining table participants to decide upon, but our intent is to get back to table and try to get an agreement.' IAM headquarters will make 'every resource available' to the local union groups now on strike, the union said in a statement. 'We are incredibly proud of the hard work and dedication shown by the negotiating teams from District 751 and W24 and the unwavering solidarity of our membership,' the union stated. 'Their tireless efforts have been on display throughout this entire process. Now, they will regroup and begin planning the next steps on securing an agreement that our membership can approve.' The Pentagon, Air Force and Navy did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Strike Comes Despite Earlier ‘Reset’ Pledge Ortberg has sought to ameliorate the company’s relationship with its Puget Sound-area union, which deteriorated under the leadership of previous executives who publicly and sharply criticized the union in prior negotiations. Ortberg met with local IAM leaders shortly after taking the reins of the beleaguered company in August, pledging to 'reset' relations with the machinists, Aviation Week reported then. On Sunday, Boeing and IAM leadership endorsed a deal that promised a 25 percent general wage increase, reduced health care costs, improved terms on retirement benefits and a promise to build the next commercial airplane in the Puget Sound area, if announced during the life of the contract. The agreement fell short of IAM’s original objectives, which included boosting wages by 40 percent and reinstating Boeing’s pension plan, which was cut in 2014 in order to assure 777X production in Puget Sound. Analysts were optimistic that the backing of IAM’s leadership would get the deal over the finish line, but it quickly became clear that rank and file membership was not supportive. On Monday, IAM 751 President Jon Holden told the Seattle Times that he expected members to reject the contract and vote to strike. 'We have achieved everything we could in bargaining, short of a strike,' Holden said in a message to union members posted to the organization’s website on Monday. 'We recommended acceptance because we can't guarantee we can achieve more in a strike. But that is your decision to make and is a decision that we will protect and support, no matter what.' In a Wednesday letter to the workforce, Ortberg said a strike would put Boeing’s recovery in jeopardy, calling it a path 'where no one wins.' 'I know the reaction to our tentative agreement with the IAM has been passionate,' he said. 'I understand and respect that passion, but I ask you not to sacrifice the opportunity to secure our future together, because of the frustrations of the past.' Depending on the length of the strike, the work stoppage in Seattle could further squeeze margins at Boeing’s defense unit, which West said are expected to be negative again in the third quarter, with financial performance on par with the previous quarter when the company booked $527 million in losses. West said the results were a 'disappointment' and driven by cost pressures in two areas. First, the costs of winding down F/A-18 Super Hornet production and ramping up F-15EX production is proving to be more expensive than previously estimated. Cost overruns on fixed-price development programs — long a bane of Boeing’s defense earnings — also continue to be a problem, with West calling out 'development hurdles' on the Air Force’s T-7 trainer and Navy’s MQ-25 tanker drone. Based on the duration of previous strikes, it is 'realistic' to assume that the current strike will last about 50 days, ending before the strike fund runs low ahead of the holiday season, Cai von Rumohr, an aerospace analyst with TD Cowen, wrote in a note to investors earlier this week. A strike of that length would cost Boeing about an estimated $3.5 billion in cash flow. Ron Epstein, an aerospace analyst for Bank of America and a former Boeing engineer, said that while previous strikes have hovered around the 60-day mark, last year’s strike at Boeing supplier Spirit AeroSystems could offer a precedent for a much more rapid negotiation — one that could end in as little as a week. 'We see it likely Boeing would have to make further concessions and move closer to the IAM's initial proposal of 40 [percent] wage gains,' Epstein said in the note to investors this morning.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/boeing-defense-programs-to-feel-the-pinch-as-seattle-based-union-votes-to-strike/	2024-09-13T10:59:01-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/03/KC-46-Boeing-factory-tanker-750xx960-541-0-55.jpg
Outgunned, outranged: The Ukraine war illustrates where fires modernization is needed	ARTEC RCH 155 - automated artillery firepower with shoot-on-the-move capability. Photo courtesy of KNDS. It’s not often that anyone would think of the U.S. as being outgunned in this day and age, but in the realm of artillery it’s likely true. While most NATO countries, much of Europe, and near-peer adversaries like Russia and China went to longer L52 cannon barrels years ago that provide greater range, the U.S. Army still uses and only manufactures the smaller L39 barrel that provides what can only be called 'last-generation' capability for 155mm field guns. The Ukraine war has made it clear that less artillery range is always going to be a losing proposition against an adversary with longer-range firepower. 'The U.S. field artillery fleet has been an L39 caliber length tube based cannon system for the last 60 years.' said Jon Milner, director of business development, Weapon and Ammunition, American Rheinmetall Defense. 'NATO and most of the world moved on to L52 length 155mm systems two decades ago because an L52 can shoot further than an L39. That's where the U.S. is literally outgunned and outranged by allies and adversaries.' This isn’t to say, though, that the U.S. Army hasn’t made significant investments and strides in fires modernization. The first increment of the Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) is being developed to replace the MGM-140 Army Tactical Missile System. The service is also introducing the Mid-Range Capability, also known as Typhon, to strike targets with SM-6 and Tomahawk missiles at ranges from 300-1,725 miles that aren’t covered by PrSM and under-developmental hypersonic missiles. Rocket artillery has also enabled important advancements in precision strike, but lacks in mass. The Army has invested in advancing cannon projectiles and has gained significant advances in longer range solutions as seen with the XM1113 and XM1155 programs. But even with these important programs, tactical fires modernization continues to lag behind the threats. In one prominent example, earlier this year the Army canceled the Extended Range Cannon Artillery (ERCA) program, keeping the M1299 self-propelled 155mm howitzer prototype an S&T effort. This has left the Army with an enduring, and problematic gap in its extended range tactical fire solutions, exacerbated by the fact that legacy artillery systems had already fallen behind our allies and adversaries. And there’s an additional challenge – the Army artillery fleet had also shrunk. 'In addition to the smaller caliber of the cannons in the Army’s existing fielded systems, the U.S. has not kept up with the threat in increasing the number of artillery units,' noted Milner. 'Since the Cold War, the U.S. has shrunk the artillery corps significantly, while our pacing threats, China and Russia have only increased their artillery number alongside giving it cannons with more range than U.S. systems.' Closing gaps in tactical fires can potentially be accomplished more quickly and cost effectively by following a time-honored acquisition method right out of the program-management playbook that calls for adopting rather than adapting systems that are already in production – and adopting a common moniker used since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, 'buy Allied.' Filling the Fires Capability and Capacity Gaps Army Futures Command Concept for Fires 2028 has validated the need to move away from certain existing systems in the arsenal that 'lack sufficient capacity, lethality, and range to deter and defeat peer threats.' The report went on to state: 'Peer threats have already demonstrated the ability to organize a highly effective fires complex (UAS, rocket artillery, and IADS) to detect targets, mass fires, and protect themselves. Enhanced threat capabilities will enable engagement of friendly fire support elements at standoff weapon ranges, precluding or pre-empting friendly fire support operations.' The U.S., Ukraine, and NATO also must have the capability to operate fires from standoff distances. Most NATO and European countries already have certain standoff ability because they all employ 52-caliber cannons, as mentioned. That leaves only U.S. systems with L39 barrels vulnerable due to their limited range. 'The term the Army uses is that our tactical fires lack capability and capacity,' said Michael Milner, vice president for business development and strategy, American Rheinmetall Vehicles. 'The capability is the range that we can fire and the capacity is the number of rounds we can put down range in a given amount of time. 'No one in the rest of the world wants or is buying a 39 caliber capability. Of course, Ukraine will take what it can get. Anything we can give Ukraine is good. However, what that means for the Ukrainians who have to operate these L39 U.S. systems is that for the guns to be able to range the enemy, they will always have to be in range of the enemy’s artillery. This is not the equation we want for our ally Ukraine in this fight nor for American Soldiers in any fight we might have in the future.' That’s arguably one of the most glaring tactical gaps in U.S. fires, and one that’s also tailor made for acquisition by adoption. In the case of artillery, adopt means acquiring a system that’s already in production and being fielded. There will be certain straightforward integration elements necessary such as different radios or fire control systems like Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS). What you want to avoid though, is the adaption of that system, e.g., changing a fundamental architectural element such as adding armor, which increases weight and could require a new suspension, or inserting a different cannon. 'Adapting rather than adopting a proven system takes you from an off-the-shelf system to something that becomes bespoke and will take time, money, and effort to get it to where it’s what you need,' said Michael Milner. 'The priority, on the other hand, is rapidly fielding capability, which is what the Army's looking for with its desire to get capability into the field by 2030 that meets as much of the ERCA requirements as possible.' Achieving ERCA requirements requires not only an improved armament but the ability for heightened self-protection through mobility and self-propulsion, as well as automation of the firing system. Today’s advanced self-propelled, automated systems can fire eight to nine rounds per minute and then pick up and move immediately. Before the first rounds even hit the ground, that vehicle is moving to another location before the enemy can pick up the firing on radar and launch counter fires. 'This also plays into the new capability of battlefield drones where you're under persistent surveillance,' said Michael Milner. 'If you pick up an enemy drone, you’ve got to be able to move quickly. Current U.S. towed systems lack that capability because once the towed system is in place, it takes about a minute and a half to two minutes to get it moving while you're sitting there stationary.' A survey of artillery systems around the world shows several existing systems that could fit the bill and fill the gap, including the PzH 2000 and RCH 155 from KNDS Deutschland (formerly Krauss-Maffei Wegmann). Both are equipped with Rheinmetall’s combat proven, world-class main armament L52 artillery cannon. Both would also fill the Defense Department’s gap for a self-propelled 155mm howitzer with improved range, survivability, technology, and firing rates. Given the scale such a program would take on, the DoD would be expected to want such systems built in the U.S., but that would take several years at a minimum to stand up the factory and supply chain – leaving the capability gap in place for longer than defense leaders want. There’s a way, however, to both build them domestically and also start receiving and fielding them years sooner. 'U.S. Army leadership has said they are willing to accept a foreign-built system for the first two years of production and then it has to be moved onshore,' said Michael Milner. 'That third year of production, you have to have a facility and supply chain established, transition all the intellectual property to U.S. shores, and bring that cannon capacity, vehicle capacity, and artillery gun module capacity into the United States. 'That's no problem for American Rheinmetall; that's already an approach built into our business model,' he said. American Rheinmetall has the ability to design and build in the U.S., as it is doing for the turret on its XM30 Combat Vehicle which was 100 percent designed domestically by Rheinmetall’s U.S. engineers and being built in the U.S. It also has the ability to quickly receive a transfer of technology from its European parent and partners and execute localization of supply chains, production, and design updates inside the U.S. The same approach can help the Army not just in rapidly fielding a new ERCA capability, but for adding critical capability to its substantial M109A7 self-propelled howitzer fleet. American Rheinmetall, with key partners, can provide for 52 caliber cannon insertion in the M109A7, which would remove the out-gunned nature of these important systems and also bring valuable commonality in the cannon system if an ERCA solution like the RCH 155 were adopted. Rheinmetall and BAE developed just such an Independent Research and Development (IRAD) M109A7 L52 demonstrator, which the team test fired last year, showcased at AUSA 2023, and has a robust fall live fire schedule planned. Rheinmetall has, in fact, moved manufacturing capabilities to customer locations multiple times, including in Australia and Hungary where Rheinmetall took the opportunity to build state-of-the-art manufacturing capabilities to support those nation's needs. Said Michael Milner, 'Compare that to how it’s done here where we are still building combat vehicles very similar to how we did in World War II.' The production of U.S. cannons is currently at a state that can be considered a single point of failure. The only U.S. capability for producing ground forces/Army and Marine Corps cannons today is at Watervliet Arsenal, NY. The Army is in the process of modernizing the facility, however, with the addition of the L52 cannon into the U.S. fleet, capacity is an issue. Rheinmetall, as the world’s premier supplier of L52 cannons is ready to apply their successful approach to localizing cannon production to augment Watervliet’s capability issue and fill the gap of capacity. Innovation at the round: Assegai V-LAP and Extended Range Charge for L39 and L52 systems. Image courtesy of American Rheinmetall. Innovation at the round Another reason to adopt is so the U.S. and others can take advantage of the latest innovations at the round. This was also one of the outputs of the tactical fires study from Army Futures Command. It’s an area where Rheinmetall, a global leader in large caliber munitions technology, is always working to evolve projectiles and propellants so operators can squeeze more range out of their systems – whether they’re L39 or L52 based – and includes portfolio munitions like the Assegai Velocity-enhanced Long range Artillery Projectile (V-LAP), DM92 propellant, and extended range charge. The Assegai family of 155 projectiles is ballistically matched so all the projectiles behave the same and are state-of-the-art for long range. Assegai V-LAP set world records during a 2019 test for ranges at well beyond 70 kilometers. The DM92 propellant, which is the current propellant for the German Army and its PzH 2000 fleet, is tuned for the Rheinmetall L52 barrel. If the U.S. adopted that caliber and integrated the L52 on the M109 or in its ERCA program, there’s a ready, high performing propellant that can be adopted by the U.S. for that purpose. Rheinmetall has also qualified an extended range charge, the Supercharge, for several howitzers, including the Australian M777. The Supercharge allows operators to fire at longer ranges from the L52 cannon and adds 10 percent longer range from the L39 cannon. It was developed to 'buy back' the drag – the penalty that happens when using course-correcting fuzes, which are important for armies and precision fires. Additionally, the Supercharge is extremely clean burning and leaves little residue in the barrel which assists in extending the life of the barrel. Strengthening the Defense Industrial Base to close the gaps 'American Rheinmetall is a committed partner for the U.S. Army, fully focused on their field artillery requirements and localizing next-gen technology,' said Jon Milner. 'U.S. Cannoneers have been pulling lanyards and swabbing breaches since the Revolutionary War, and it’s time to get beyond that paradigm. 'The RCH 155 and M109-52 along with Rheinmetall’s family of ammunition provide real modernization solutions adoptable now to restore tactical fires overmatch, enhance the U.S. industrial base including bringing new jobs and capability, and delivering fast by sequencing delivery of proven systems from an allied base and then effectively and rapidly transitioning the technology and its production into the U.S. This is a proven capability at Rheinmetall.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/outgunned-outranged-the-ukraine-war-illustrates-where-fires-modernization-is-needed/	2024-09-13T10:20:01-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/Artillery-Main-Image-600x300-V04.jpg
The Army doth protest too much: In Space, jointness must come first	Col. Mark Cobos, commander, 1st Space Brigade, US Army Space and Missile Defense Command, thanks Chief of Space Operations US Space Force Gen. Chance Saltzman and Chief Master Sgt. of the Space Force John F. Bentivegna for visiting the brigade headquarters at Fort Carson, Colo., April 10. (US Army photo by Dottie White) Our Aug. 13 op-ed on the Army’s overreach to create a new space career field and expand its space control capabilities struck a surprising chord, and generated a robust and frankly overdue debate about the Army’s role in space. After reading the Army’s formal rebuttal, visiting soldiers doing space missions, and having many conversations with members of the US Space Command, our takeaway is clear: The need to clearly understand the distinctions in roles and functions of the various services and combatant commands is foundational to the success of joint operations, and the conversation around the Space Force and its relationships needs to continue for all stakeholders to really understand each other’s stances. In our discussions since our first op-ed, we have concluded that there are three broad reasons behind the Army’s desire to increase its organic space expertise and capabilities. While these may make sense from a pure Army perspective, it does not mean they fit into the integrated warfighting construct now being pushed by top Pentagon leaders, who understand that joint collaboration is the best way to maximize effectiveness and efficiencies to win. First, the space missions are just the latest in a pattern of Army actions stemming from what appears to be deep-seated mistrust of other services providing tactically relevant cross-domain support. This sentiment goes back decades and spans multiple military functions. This is why the Army maintains its own uninhabited aerial vehicles for its own 'organic' use, of the same class that the Air Force operates for joint force application. This is also why the Army is now spending over $990 million on long-range fixed-wing intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft. At the heart of these efforts is the desire to maintain control. The underlying mindset seems to be that if the Army doesn’t directly control it, they can’t trust it to deliver their desired effects. While it is understandable that an Army commander would feel this way, this is the antithesis of joint integration at a time when no one service will ever fight by itself. The second major factor is money, and maintaining funding priority in a new warfighting environment. This is clearly the case with the Army’s pursuit of very long-range, theater-capable hypersonic missiles (at over $50 million a shot) in response to China becoming the Department of Defense’s 'pacing' threat. Over two decades following 9/11, the Army received $1.3 trillion more than the Air Force, largely thanks to the focus on counter-insurgency operations. Given the nature of the threat and the priority to our nation, this was a justified expenditure. As the preponderance of forces in Afghanistan and Iraq, the Army used these funds for missions critical to our defense strategy at the time. They also used this money to modernize their equipment across the entire Army. But this was not without negative impacts to the other services. A 2022 Mitchell Institute paper describes how other services that were the source of the funding for the Army severely atrophied. As our nation and its military’s attention now shift to China, the relative priority and corresponding funding should likewise shift from the Army back to the Air Force, Space Force, and Navy, to reflect the preponderance of forces that will be involved in a China fight. Third, there is a breakdown in the joint lexicon for space missions and functions. For example, the Army states its systems are for space control, to 'interdict' adversary use of space against their soldiers in combat, as a service-unique requirement. But all service components that comprise a joint task force require protection from adversary space-enabled attacks. This is, in fact, a key element of space superiority and the central role of the Space Force, along with the continued delivery of capabilities and effects such as missile warning, satellite communication, space-based environmental monitoring, and position, navigation, and timing. The Space Force must secure our nation’s ability to deliver space capabilities and effects while denying the same to adversaries. The Army component of a joint task force—just like every other service component—may have requirements to interdict adversary use of space, but national leaders must clearly understand that space interdiction is simply a facet of space superiority. Trying to achieve it piecemeal would be like trying to achieve localized air superiority with fighters assigned to Army units—it doesn’t work. The current Army rationale is anachronistic when today, the Space Force and US Space Command are now assigned and responsible for performing this mission. Modern War Requires A Modern Joint Construct A long-standing mistrust of joint operations, improper budget prioritization, and terminology that is confusing and outdated is a recipe for failure against a peer adversary like China. The Department of Defense must take steps to better align and synchronize joint efforts if initiatives like Combined Joint All Domain Command and Control (CJADC2) and the delivery of overwhelming cross-domain effects are to be realized. The following suggestions are aimed at increasing collaboration and ensuring future joint and coalition operations have the tools and skills to win against any adversary. 1) Most simply, all services should develop new space capabilities consistent with existing joint processes. Right now, that means the Joint Requirements Oversight Committee must validate an existing requirement. Then an analysis of potential non-materiel solutions must conclude that a materiel solution will be necessary to adequately address the requirement. Finally, the Space Acquisition Council must then determine which material solution(s) are necessary and which service will lead the efforts. As the DoD lead for space integration, the Space Force, through the Space Acquisition Council, must have a leading role in defining the integrated space architecture. Once fielded, regardless of the service operating the system, US Space Command must centrally coordinate space superiority effects. This approach ensures the appropriate allocation of taxpayer dollars, synchronizes operations, and avoids unintentional redundancy. 2) Additionally, all services must prioritize the execution of their existing assigned responsibilities that are critical for joint force operations over those that are parochial. For example, the Army is responsible for base defense and must deliver an effective suite of air and missile defense capabilities essential for all the service component requirements for future conflict. This is an Army mission, and they should fund it. Failing that, the other services should be funded to field active defense systems for their forward operating bases, and the Army budget reduced accordingly. 3) The Department of Defense should conduct a review of existing service and joint publications to ensure doctrine, policy, and organizational roles and responsibilities are consistent with service core missions and appropriate joint agreements. Previous updates conducted immediately after the stand-up of the Space Force had accelerated timelines and happened during a period when the Space Force's presence in the Pentagon was woefully understaffed. Now five years later, it is time to reassess these documents to ensure they accurately reflect the relationships and responsibilities of all services as they relate to space missions. Guardians assigned to the Pentagon, on the Space Force Staff, Joint Staff, or Office of the Secretary of Defense Staff, should scrutinize the language in policy and ensure service equities are properly addressed. 4) To improve cohesion and trust, the DoD should ramp up joint and coalition exercises and training events that specifically address the role of space operations. It takes practice and repetition to develop trust and refine the operational and tactical effectiveness of joint and coalition operations. When possible, these exercises should employ live jamming and coordination of joint fires to increase realism and refine employment tactics, techniques, and procedures. 5) Congress must ensure the resources and organizations within the Department of Defense are consistent with the spirit and intent of the guidance that created the Space Force and US Space Command. Congress should review joint space programs to verify the DoD is developing them with joint operations in mind and that they have followed the appropriate processes to ensure the most effective and efficient use of taxpayer dollars. 6) The current overlap in perceived service roles in space operations with the Space Force is reason enough for Congress to direct the establishment of a commission, independent from the Department of Defense, to conduct a review of service roles and missions. The last such commission conducted this kind of review in 1994/95, well before the standup of the Space Force. While longstanding agreements should remain in place, new functions and authorities related to space and cyber would benefit from an updated evaluation and agreement. These are dangerous times. Organizing the DoD to ensure the United States is prepared for future challenges is vital. The discussion on Army overreach highlights the need to properly steward our nation’s resources to maximize effectiveness and lethality in a fiscally responsible and coordinated manner. There is undoubtedly a role for the Army and all services when it comes to space security. However, the DoD must identify and develop these approaches in a deliberate and coordinated manner, not passively allowing the services to independently and parochially pursue what only they determine is necessary for their own service component purposes.

Aussie military inks contracts for quantum clocks to aid ‘maritime domain awareness’	LANDFORCES — The Australian military has awarded a physics startup two contracts for a quantum clock designed to provide greater accuracy and a week or more of GPS coverage if conventional GPS is jammed or attacked. The deals, announced here this morning, mean Australia will buy QuantX Labs' quantum optical atomic clocks 'to support superior decision advantage and enhanced maritime domain awareness' for the Australian Defense Force, an ADF statement said. The head of operations for QuantX, Sandy Sinclair, said the announcement of the $2.7 million ($1.8 million USD) in deals 'is worth writing about because it's the first demonstration of quantum technology under AUKUS Pillar II.' ​The ADF statement carefully notes that these 'are key objectives under AUKUS Pillar II,' but it does not claim that they are being done as part of the second pillar, which focuses on a range of advanced technologies, including quantum, artificial intelligence and autonomy. 'Defense will increasingly leverage emerging disruptive technologies such as quantum to provide a capability edge for the warfighter,' Chief Defence Scientist Tanya Monro said in a statement. 'This is the first sale for QuantX Labs and a prime example of the collaborative relationships needed to transition leading-edge sovereign research into advanced operational capabilities for the Australian Defence Force.' Last year, the US Air Force Research Laboratory, the US Navy, and foreign partners from the Five Eyes alliance collaborated to test quantum tech at sea during the annual Rim of the Pacific exercises. Few details were released at the time. The portable atomic clocks are the result of more than seven years of research and development at the Institute of Photonics and Advanced Sensing at the University of Adelaide. 'So we're offering very similar performance to a hydrogen maser, which already exists, but in a much smaller form factor,' Sinclair told Breaking Defense. 'We will be accelerating that performance over the next couple of years in future iterations of the clock to a much better performance.' QuantX's clock uses a laser on rubidium molecules, targeting one to 'excite' it and then the 'physics package' emits a persistent radio frequency signal. ​Testing for the tech, the ADF statement said, will focus on 'operational resilience in global positioning systems (GPS) degraded environments.' In the event of attacks on the GPS network the Quantx clock should be able to provide signals for a week or more, Sinclair said. Militaries the world over have been racing to find alternatives to GPS, assuming that in the next conflict they're be operating where GPS is unavailable, whether naturally or due to enemy interference. ​The box containing the clock and its lasers will be part of a mobile test and measurement system, delivered in early 2025. The size of the clock is a major part of the company's success. They've reduced it to the size big enough for four servers and it will soon, Sinclair said, shrink to only three server slots in size.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/aussie-military-inks-contracts-for-quantum-clocks-to-aid-maritime-domain-awareness/	2024-09-13T07:45:33-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/QuantX-Quantum-GPS-clock-box.png
‘Biggest thing … for years’: Industry eagerly awaits next phase of Australian Army network contract	Project Currawong SATCOM trailer. (Boeing Australia) LANDFORCES — Multiple industry players appear to be positioning themselves here in Australia for what one executive called 'the biggest thing in town regarding comms — and will be for years to come.' The Australian military is expected to begin the competition to pick a winner for what some in industry believe will be a contract worth hundreds of millions to build and maintain the Army's new battlefield communications network early next year. Boeing Australia, builder of the Currawong tactical radio program, believes it has the inside track to win what is called Land 4140 because of that experience. But Boeing is not uncontested. 'It is a program we are tracking closely,' a Hanwha Defense Australia spokesperson said today. Executives here were closed lipped about the program, but the Australian arms of L3Harris, Leidos and Lockheed Martin are all believed to be similarly tracking the program. The Australian military released a request for information related to Land 4140, also known as the Land C4 Modernisation Project or the LC4 Program, in June 2022, saying it 'will modernise and enhance Land C4 systems in order to deliver decision-making superiority and improve the Command and Control, intelligence, sensors, and weapon system effectors, essential for the conduct of Joint Land Force operations.' Earlier this week the military requested that defense firms raise their hand if they're interested in Tranche 1 of the project, and said they expect the delivery timeframe for the tech to run from 2025 to 2030. The acquisition approach appears different from standard Australian programs where a prime contractor would design and build the system. Eager to ensure the software-heavy communications system would be regularly upgraded to cope with new cyber and electronic warfare threats, the government wants what it is calling a 'program integration partner.' It would be supplemented or augmented by at least one panel that apparently would approve the upgrades. Boeing executives, clearly hopeful they might win based on their Project Currawong work, spoke with reporters here about the program. 'So they're looking for a company that has the pedigree, the relationships, the right behaviors, the right experience, the right capabilities to partner with them over the next 10 years to help them effectively build the next generation of networks,' Darcy Rawlinson, a senior IT and cyber executive at Boeing Australia. It will be a challenging venture, according to the scope Rawlinson described. 'It's all the communications that army needs, from the forward rifleman, who's walking around carrying his pack, who's really just talking on a radio right the way through to a big Joint Task Force headquarters with heaps of people in it, a field hospital with big logistics sort of node — everything that's deployed,' he said. The executives who spoke with Breaking Defense made it clear the program is still evolving. The formal request for tender, when companies will have to decide whether to bid and how, is scheduled for the second quarter of 2025.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/biggest-thing-for-years-industry-eagerly-awaits-next-phase-of-australian-army-network-contract/	2024-09-13T06:40:04-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/Currawong-SATCOM-trailer-e1664974372918.jpeg
Take off ‘handcuffs’ and make DoD information technology buying more ‘agile,’ DISA official says	The US and China are in a technology arms race. But which side has the best path forward? (Wong Yu Liang/Getty Images) WASHINGTON — The Department of Defense must streamline its information technology procurement and acquisition policies if the US wants to stay ahead of its adversaries in coming years, according to John Hale, the chief of cloud services at the Defense Information Systems Agency. With the current policies, the DoD has to plan its budget so far in advance that it has trouble being flexible and adaptable to new technologies, Hale said during a General Dynamics Information Technology event Thursday. 'We still buy IT as if it was a weapon system. You have to do your planning and your budget cycles in such a way that don't really facilitate agile capabilities,' he said. 'It’s September of 2024. I just submitted my budget for 2026, and in that budget I had to submit my five year plan. So not only did I submit my budget for 2026, I had to also plan what I was going to spend all the way through to 2031. 'In today's world with with how rapid things are changing and how agile technology and capabilities are, those are the handcuffs that we're playing against,' he added. RELATED: Pentagon lacks 'comprehensive' strategy for buying AI tech, GAO warns Speaking to Breaking Defense on the sidelines of the event, Hale emphasized his concerns around falling behind China and other adversaries because the US’s current defense procurement and acquisition policies don’t account for unknown emerging technologies. 'What I don't want to have happen is for some new capabilities to come available that we simply can't get to in a timely fashion,' he told Breaking Defense. 'We're following policies that our adversaries don't. So a lot of the capabilities that we're talking about when we talk about AI, machine learning, our adversary is taking full advantage of them, and we are too for the extent that we can get access to. 'But the acquisition timelines that we have to deal with in the US are much longer than what our adversaries are doing. If we can streamline our acquisition processes, then we're going to be able to put capabilities in the hands of the warfighter quickly,' he added. Hales said US tech procurement is 'rooted in 1945 thought and and we're just, we're way beyond that.' Specifically, the stagnation is hindering one key process that's under Hales immediate purview: the transition of DoD data to the cloud. When asked how he’s trying to fix this, Hale joked, 'I pretty much just banged my head against the wall on a regular basis.' In reality, he said that he works 'very closely with the department's acquisition arm, and we're working diligently to try to change those policies where we can, but it is a long road.' Hales's frustrations are nothing new for the Pentagon, which for years has attempted in fits and starts to streamline emerging tech acquisition, especially when it comes to quickly evolving software, including through rapid development initiatives. RELATED: 3 steps towards fixing the acquisition insanity at the Pentagon As far as the cloud goes, the Pentagon is in the midst of a massive migration to the Joint Warfighting Cloud Capability (JWCC), an initiative launched in 2022 to provide cloud services for the Pentagon and each military branch. The contract is worth up to a collective $9 billion. 'We just crossed the $1 billion mark this last month of consumption of that contract vehicle, and so that provides an easy contract vehicle for the access to the four large, hyper scale cloud providers,' Hale said during his panel.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/take-off-handcuffs-and-make-dod-information-technology-buying-more-agile-disa-official-says/	2024-09-13T05:25:39-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/china-us-chip-scaled-e1716994085963.jpg
CCA: The operational concepts driving the Air Force’s future drone program [VIDEO #2]	WASHINGTON — The Air Force's Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) program could prove to be the heart of America's future airpower — but even as the technology is slowly developing, the service has a lot of questions to figure out how, exactly, it to wants to use these things. To get to the heart of what CCAs are and how they will work, Breaking Defense assembled a panel — featuring reporters Michael Marrow and Valerie Insinna, alongside Stacie Pettyjohn of the Center for a New American Security think tank — to break down what every reader needs to know. Above, you’ll find the second of four videos from that discussion. This one is focused on the kinds of complex questions Air Force planners are trying to sort out right now about concepts of operations, from how these wingmen can fly, to whether they need stealth capabilities, to how to get a pilot to actually trust that a CCA will do what they want it to. Down below you can see our first video, which serves as a primer on just what the CCA program is. In the coming weeks, we’ll publish further videos, one on international efforts to replicate a loyal wingman program from both partners and potential adversaries, and another on the technology that will make CCA fly.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/cca-the-operational-concepts-driving-the-air-forces-future-drone-program-video/	2024-09-12T14:52:43-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/ai-f16-scaled-e1726165319459.jpg
Lockheed could see $1B financial ‘impact’ this quarter as F-35 negotiations drag on	Airmen assigned to the Wisconsin Air National Guard's 115th Fighter Wing complete post-flight inspections on U.S. Air Force F-35A Lightning II aircraft Aug. 13, 2024. (U.S. Air National Guard photo by Airman 1st Class Josh Kaeser) UPDATED on 9/13/24 at 12:53 pm ET with comment from the F-35 Joint Program Office. WASHINGTON — Lockheed Martin and the Pentagon are unlikely to reach a deal on the next lot of F-35 stealth fighters by the end of this month, potentially leading to a $1 billion cost 'impact' for the defense giant this quarter, a top Lockheed executive said today. 'Given where we are in that negotiation, we don't expect to be completed by the end of this quarter, and that will cause an impact in the quarter — up to about $500 million in sales, and potentially about $500 million of cash flow in the quarter,' Chief Financial Officer Jay Malave said during the Morgan Stanley Laguna conference. The Pentagon’s F-35 Joint Program Office (JPO) and Lockheed have been engaged in talks over F-35 Lots 18 and 19 for more than a year, and had initially hoped to wrap up contract negotiations by the end of 2023. However, there are still 'key terms that are yet to be negotiated' by the parties, which will drag discussions out into the fourth quarter, Malave said. If Lockheed and the JPO are able to hammer out an agreement on 'several outstanding issues' over the next couple of months, the Pentagon will be able to award a contract in early fiscal 2025 , the JPO said in a statement to Breaking Defense. Lockheed is currently seeking a cash injection, as the department’s initial funding for Lot 18 has 'pretty much been exhausted,' and the company has already invested some of its own funds to keep F-35 production running smoothly ahead of the contract, he said. 'We're working with our Joint Program Office partners as well as with congressional constituents so that we can get some funding in so that we don't really disrupt the production system,' Malave said, adding that the money could come in the form of reprogrammed funds approved by Congress. The JPO said it was 'closely monitoring' Lockheed’s execution of previously awarded funding for F-35 production and is working with the Pentagon and Congress 'to mitigate any impacts associated with negotiation delays.' Overall, Lockheed's latest financial guidance estimates sales between $70.5 billion and $71.5 billion this year, with free cash flow for 2024 between $6 billion and $6.3 billion. As part of the latest round of F-35 contract negotiations, the department is currently reviewing pricing information submitted by Lockheed that breaks down the costs borne by the aerospace prime and its supply chain, said Malave, who acknowledged that the company is still struggling with inflation, high labor costs and extended lead times. 'They have to go through that, get comfortable with that, make sure the data supports what we provide to them,' he said. Greg Ulmer, the top executive at Lockheed’s aeronautics unit, previously told Breaking Defense that unit costs for the upcoming batch of F-35s could continue to be negatively influenced by inflation as well as a lower annual buy rate from the US military. On top of the costs associated with contract negotiations, Lockheed expects up to $300 million in impact this year due to financial withholdings the Pentagon is making as it accepts F-35s that are being delivered without a full hardware and software upgrade known as Technology Refresh 3, or TR-3. In August, the Pentagon acknowledged it was withholding about $5 million per jet upon delivery. However, Malave and the JPO said that number will be reduced as Lockheed achieves specific targets. 'We expect to complete some of those milestones this year,' Malave said, adding the withholdings will determine where Lockheed lands on free cash flow.

(US Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Grace Lyles) WASHINGTON — The US Navy this week said it had awarded a $587 million contract to L3Harris for the engineering and manufacturing development phase of its Next Generation Jammer – Low Band (NGJ-LB) system, a move that comes four years after the service initially attempted to advance that program in 2020. 'NGJ-LB will meet current and emerging electronic warfare threats and increase the lethality of 4th and 5th generation platforms and strike weapons,' Rear Adm. John Lemmon, program executive officer for tactical aircraft programs, said in a Sept. 10 statement. 'The Navy will partner with L3Harris to get this key capability into the hands of the warfighter.' The new pod is one element of the larger NGJ system scheduled to be installed on the Navy's EA-18G Growler aircraft and is expected to reach early operational capability in 2029. The new contract is for the engineering and manufacturing development phase, which is essentially when DoD asks industry to produce a handful of initial prototypes prior to full-scale production. It is intended to allow industry to be certain its manufacturing processes are satisfactory and gives the Navy a chance to test out a product before entering into serial production. 'Our Next Generation Jammer – Low Band solution provides the U.S. Navy with the latest digital, software-based technologies to address advanced and emerging threats from peer adversaries,' Christopher Kubasik, chair and CEO of L3Harris, said in a statement today. L3 said it will deliver eight prototypes to Naval Air Systems Command for assessment and additional testing over the next five years. The service initially awarded a contract for NGJ-LB in 2020 but faced Government Accountability Office protests from Northrop Grumman. That protest was eventually settled in 2022 with the Navy agreeing to amend its request for proposals and re-compete the contract in 2023. NGJ-LB is a joint cooperative program between the DoD and the Australian Department of Defence; the Royal Australian Air Force will eventually receive the capability, according to the US Navy statement. Raytheon is responsible for the mid-band capability associated with the NGJ program, and Flight Global reported the first production pods of that capability were delivered to the Navy in 2023.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/navy-awards-l3-587-million-contract-for-next-gen-electronic-warfare-pod/	2024-09-12T14:41:33-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/04/230404_DVIDS_fighers_emals_7676875-scaled-e1680626490687.jpg
Aussie startup’s small box turns drones into swarm commanders	A four-legged robot mugs for the camera in a video on the website for Australian robotics firm Breaker. (Screengrab via Breaker) LANDFORCES 2024 — In a room full of large ground vehicles, the small box — roughly the size of a thick deck of cards — showed off by Australian startup Breaker doesn't stand out. But, the company says, this little box is chock full of artificial intelligence algorithms that can be easily integrated onto a variety of unmanned platforms for a wide range of mission sets. 'We build robots that act like humans. We want them to make it as easy as possible to control multiple autonomous systems across multiple domains,' co-founder Matthew Buffa told Breaking Defense at their tiny boothlet at the biennial Land Forces conference, echoing the firm's website which features a video of a medium-sized, four-legged robot. The company, which has been partially financed and assisted by the University of New South Wales' Founders Defence 10x accelerator program, made its first appearance at Land Forces this year and has attracted a steady stream of the curious and intrigued. Buffa claims the company already has a defense customer, whom he would only describe as a foreign special forces organization that 'bought a number of our systems.' The box, which Buffa called an 'autonomy stack,' incorporates six different AI models that can be put into 'any autonomous platform.' He compared the effects of their box as similar to the Star Wars robot R2D2, who helps Luke Skywalker pilot and target and shoot, instead of just providing him with reams of information he must decide on. That natural two-way communication between an operator and a drone is the key of what the company hopes to get at. As Buffa noted, 'When you're under high cognitive load and high stress response, humans naturally tend to do voice.' That's a heavy cognitive load if a soldier on a ridge line is trying to control multiple drones. But Breaker's system, according to Buffa, is designed to have the operator designate a single drone as the leader, have that drone coordinate with the other sensors, and then have that drone come back for final instructions. For instance, picture a soldier on one side of a ridge line. That soldier gets on the radio and designates one drone the 'commander' of the other 10 drones in a swam. 'Drones will then aggregate all the sensors across all 10 platforms, and if they find something interesting, say it's a supply truck or a vehicle full of operators with weapons, it will inform the operator, we've found a vehicle full of operators with weapons this distance, this bearing from your current location,' Buffa explained. 'Would you like me to follow them?' Before deploying the company tries to train the AIs on as many mission types and threats as possible. When they are deployed, he said they 'brief the drones, just like any operators for a mission. They get given the brief of what they're supposed to be doing, and where they're going and any information. We literally give the same information as natural language text, if it's a document or a photo or scan of a document, to the drones. They then use that information to make those smart decisions.' The drone will decide if, say, an abandoned car near a road appears to be a threat or not. If it decides it's not then it wouldn't 'bother the operator. 'The operator is doing something important. I'm (the drone) not going to go on the radio and tell him about this random car I've seen, which is what autonomous systems do right now.' Buffa adds that offloading the command structure more to an unmanned system should limit the number of human forces needed in the field, which is important given what has been seen on the battlefields of Ukraine, where the RF signals going off drone operators can be traced for a counter-strike by an enemy. 'The issues we saw was that, for every one autonomous system you wanted to play on the field, there's almost always at least one person who has to carry a lot of equipment, [and] it has to be very loud on the RF spectrum, so these types of systems are just failing in situations such as Ukraine. 'I mean, if you rely on continuous data and continuous video, and that is the fundamental requirement for your autonomy to exist, the minute it goes out, the systems are not helpful.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/aussie-startups-small-box-turns-drones-into-swarm-commanders/	2024-09-12T13:03:17-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/240912_breaker_robot_dog_GRAB-e1726152978510.png
Commerce ‘on track’ for version 1.0 of space tracking system, using DoD data	On Dec. 13, 2023, Office of Space Commerce Director Richard DalBello testified before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, at a hearing on 'Government Promotion of Safety and Innovation in the New Space Economy.' (Photo: NOAA Office of Space Commerce) WASHINGTON — The Commerce Department is readying the final step towards launch of its space object tracking system for non-military satellite operators, a key new responsibility the department is taking over from the Pentagon. 'We are weeks away from launching the Traffic Coordination System for Space (TraCSS),' Deputy Secretary Don Graves told the US Chamber of Commerce's Global Aerospace Summit 24 on Wednesday. 'It’s time for us to migrate this to the Department of Commerce.' Graves and other senior officials said the department will meet its Sept. 30 roll-out deadline, although the debut product will represent only a minimal capability. The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration's Office of Space Commerce (OSC) has been working since 2018 on the effort to establish a new process for taking on what is now a Defense Department's mission to keep tabs on satellites and dangerous space junk and warn non-military operators of possible on-orbit crashups. Commerce leadership, working with Congress and the Office of Management and Budget, in 2023 set this fall as the deadline for achieving that goal. 'TraCCS is on track,' OSC Director Richard DalBello told the summit during a later panel. He explained that the final step, coming shortly, is to contract for 'what we call the presentation layer, or more commonly the webpage 'TraCCS.gov'.' OSC already has contracted with Amazon Web Services to provide its cloud services, and Parsons to provide systems integration. 'Over 2025 … we will build out the system. We'll open the TraCCS.gov website … to satellite owner operators and other users, and we'll begin the transition of all the people who are on [DoD's] Space-Track.org who are not national security customers. We'll begin that transition, with the goal of completing it at the end of 2025,' DalBello said. That said, DalBello stressed that the roll out will comprise a 'minimum viable product' — rather than a more fulsome operating system as OSC had previously planned. 'We will be using the DoD system, the DoD website, to store the data for operators. But we will be able to take DoD Information, we'll be able to take operator information, and we'll be able to use our system to create conjunction data messages and orbital determination for the satellites that we're covering,' he said. 'Operators that are working with this know that this is not operational data yet. This is not data that they should be relying on for safety services yet,' he added. DalBello explained to Breaking Defense that this first version of TraCCS will in essence duplicate the data that DoD currently provides, although the system will process incoming and outgoing data every four hours rather than DoD's every eight hours. But TraCCS will evolve and improve over time under an agile development process, he said. Commerce's goal is to eventually create a free, government-owned collision warning service accurate enough to provide a baseline of space tracking data for satellite operators to be able to ensure a modicum of safety if they decide to move out of the way of a potential crash — unlike DoD's current warning system that has a fairly big margin of error. The move will also free up Pentagon resources to focus more directly on military space matters, officials have said. The problem is that Commerce leaders at the same time want to promote the handful of domestic commercial providers of space situational awareness (SSA) data and collision warning analysis that have sprung up over the past decade or so. Thus, they do not want TraCCS to become a competitor or squeeze those companies out of the marketplace. 'The plan is to integrate our SSA providers to get basic data out there that is free of charge to operators,' Graves said. 'We want to give that basic service, but make sure our commercial SSA providers are able to continue to innovate and beat the pants off of other companies in the world. … We are going to help drive the commercial marketplace by being an acquirer of data … to grow the industry significantly over the next couple of years.' Meanwhile, OSC also is hoping to help industry help itself, by promoting the creation of voluntary standards for safe on-orbit operations as part of the TraCCS project. The office has initiated a new 'pathfinder' project, 'that will examine the efficacy of generating improved satellite ephemeris based on data provided by satellite owners/operators (O/O’s),' according to a Sept. 10 announcement. 'OSC is investigating this capability to help inform quality standards for satellite ephemerides, and means of achieving those standards, for the system. Ephemeris (plural: ephemerides) is a table indicating a space object’s position and velocity at specific times,' the announcement added. The solicitation via DoD's Global Data Marketplace is asking interested vendors to submit proposals for three different potential buys: An order to generate ephemerides for a given set of satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO); An order to generate ephemerides for a given set of satellites in geostationary Earth orbit (GEO); and An order for two companies to provide data quality monitoring services related to the above two orders Further, DalBello told Breaking Defense that OSC has been working closely with the European Union to try to align it's nascent Space Surveillance and Tracking System with TraCCS, in order to avoid the development of two different sets of measurement data that could result in operators working at odds in trying to avoid collisions. The eventual evolution of an international space traffic management system, however, will be a job for another day and another head of OSC — as DalBello intends to step down at the end of year. And this isn't a pro-forma, end-of-administration resignation, he told Breaking Defense, but actual retirement. 'I've done this three times. People are going to stop taking me seriously,' DalBello said, with a laugh.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/commerce-on-track-for-version-1-0-of-space-tracking-system-using-dod-data/	2024-09-12T12:30:58-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/02/2023-12-hearing-dalbello.jpeg
‘We will treat you better’: Commerce finalizes rule to incentivize industry to disclose export violations	U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Jared Faber, 23rd Maintenance Group AFREP technician, holds a circuit board at Moody Air Force Base, Georgia, Dec. 20, 2021. (U.S. Air Force photo by Airman 1st Class Briana Beavers) WASHINGTON — The Commerce Department today announced it has finalized new policies to incentivize industry to voluntarily disclose export control violations to the government and has appointed a 'first-ever' chief of corporate enforcement to coordinate between Commerce and Justice Department offices. 'We want [companies] to come tell us that [a violation] happened, and we provide incentives for companies to do that,' Matthew Axelrod, assistant secretary of commerce for export enforcement, said today. 'And for a long time, it’s been clear that if you come in to us, in other words, you knock on our door before we knock on yours, you get concrete benefits. We will treat you better. You get a reduction in penalty.' Specifically the new rule gives Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security 'increased flexibility to determine fair and appropriate penalty amounts while also making it less burdensome for companies to submit certain [voluntary self-disclosures],' according to a BIS statement. 'The rule revises the BIS Penalty Guidelines to change how the Office of Export Enforcement (OEE) calculates the base penalty in administrative cases and how OEE applies various factors to the base penalty to determine the final penalty.' Axelrod, speaking at an event hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said many of the changes were already in effect at his office as a matter of internal policy, but they will now be enshrined in law for future administrations. Axelrod’s office is responsible for enforcement of the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), which, in essence, dictate what kinds of technologies private industry can sell to actors outside the United States. (The EAR regulates the export of certain dual use technologies — meaning they have both civil and military applications, such as avionics and lasers — but are separate from the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, which is managed by the State Department.) RELATED: State Department, RTX reach $200M settlement for export violations Though the new rule doesn’t specifically apply only to defense firms, earlier in his talk Axelrod highlighted the importance of keeping defense tech out of adversaries' hands. 'Whoever gets there first on hypersonics has a huge advantage in the current and future battlefield tactics,' Axelrod said. 'That's why it's so important to … the United States, that those technologies be protected, because the US is the leader in a number of them.' Raj Parekh, a former US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, will serve as Commerce’s first chief of corporate enforcement. Parekh’s job will be to 'serve as the primary interface between BIS’s special agents, the Department of Commerce’s Office of Chief Counsel for Industry and Security, and the Department of Justice to advance significant corporate investigations,' according to the BIS statement. 'Today’s rule changes and appointment of Raj Parekh as chief of corporate enforcement are important steps in institutionalizing the progress we’ve made over the past three years to strengthen our administrative enforcement program,' Axelrod said, this time quoted in the department’s statement. 'The stakes of ensuring that we have the proper tools to deter export violations and — when that deterrence fails — to hold violators accountable could not be higher.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/we-will-treat-you-better-commerce-finalizes-rule-to-incentivize-industry-to-disclose-export-violations/	2024-09-12T10:27:43-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/240912_circuit_board_AFREP_7026419-1-scaled-e1726158432822.jpg
Hyundai Rotem expects delayed Polish K2 tank contract to be signed by November	Hyundai Rotem displayed the K2 main battle tank, on order from Poland, at the annual MSPO trade show (Breaking Defense) BELFAST — South Korea’s Hyundai Rotem is confident a second contract covering180 Polish Army K2PL main battle tanks and 81 supporting vehicles will be signed by November, amid reports an agreement has been postponed because of industry contracting and financial problems. The forthcoming agreement, known as Executive Contract 2 (EC2), opens the way for a number of the tanks to be manufactured in Poland for the first time and was set to be signed at the country's annual International Defence Industry Exhibition (MSPO) last week. Warsaw originally signed a framework agreement covering 1,000 K2 tanks in 2022, part of an extraordinary spending spree in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine that also included orders of 672 Hanwhai K9 self-propelled howitzers and 48 KAI FA-50 light combat aircraft. All told, the package came with an estimated $14.5 billion price tag.However, that total agreement is really broken up into a series of smaller tranches, and to this point only the first K2 tranche has actually been agreed to. Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz, Poland's deputy prime minister and defense minister, said after talks in July with his South Korean counterpart, that cooperation had been agreed on the transfer to Polish industry of 'all technical information' relating to the K2, so local suppliers, led by the state owned PGZ, could prepare to produce the vehicles. At that time, Kosiniak-Kamysz suggested EC2 would be signed at MSPO. 'This is the goal, so that tanks from this tranche are produced in Poland,' he noted. Ultimately, though, the signing of EC2 during MSPO, proved 'too ambitious' because there is 'so much work to be done,' Euiseong Lee, defense solutions senior vice president at Hyundai Rotem, told Breaking Defense. 'We are working on it, so we hope to sign it by October or November.' The K2 is equipped with a 120mm/55 caliber smoothbore gun, 7.62mm coaxial machine gun, an automatic loader capable of firing 16 rounds and self protection systems including automatic fire suppression technology, composite armor and a nuclear, biological and chemical (NBC) protection suite, according to Hyundai Rotem. The upgraded K2PL tank will, additionally, be equipped with a remote control weapons system, counter UAS jammer and an active protection system, though a final configuration could take 'several years' to develop, said Lee. Local manufacturer Military Automotive Works (WZM), based in Poznan, has proposed producing 12 components 'from PGZ companies' for the upgraded tank, according to Defence 24, a Polish military trade publication. Lee said that Hyundai Rotem and the Polish Armaments Agency are currently in talks about which components will be produced by 'Polish companies.' He declined to comment on any specific parts or subsystems under discussion. Pavel Bejda, Polish deputy minister of national defense and Euiseong Lee, defense solutions senior vice president at Hyundai Rotem, discuss the K2 main battle tank at MSPO, Poland (Breaking Defense) He noted Hyundai will collaborate with PGZ so that the Polish manufacturer 'will be able to establish the production line,' which will also include technology transfers for in-country maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) infrastructure. 'This [K2PL design] will really enhance survivability,' he added, stressing that the Ukraine war has demonstrated the need for new land vehicles to be able to 'confront' drones. 'Delivery time is also crucial, so what we need to do, step by step, is gradually increase performance,' of the K2PL. 'Otherwise it takes too long. So the first K2PL will be equipped with these advanced systems, we believe, and the next batch' is to receive additional upgrades, said Lee. 'We don’t know yet,' what that future configuration will look like, 'but nowadays, technology leads' the way. Despite the future roadmap for the tank shared by Lee, Poland’s new government continues to face criticism from opposition lawmakers over the pace of high profile arms deals, including the K2. In a translated Tuesday post on X (formerly Twitter), Mariusz Blaszczak, PiS (Law and Justice) party chair and former Polish minister of defense, said, 'Another contract is going to waste,' in response to a Rzeczpospolita report (Polish business newspaper) claiming an acquisition of 486 US-made High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) will be cancelled. 'This government is wasting a historic opportunity to build one of NATO's strongest armies in Poland. In less than a year, contracts for K2 tanks, K9 and Krab [self-propelled] howitzers were cancelled,' added Blaszczak. The Polish Ministry of National Defence and Lockheed Martin had not responded to a request for comment at the time of publication. The US State Department deferred questions about the HIMARS acquisition to the Polish government.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/hyundai-rotem-expects-delayed-polish-k2-tank-contract-to-be-signed-by-november/	2024-09-12T09:05:57-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/IMG_1744-e1726066303623.jpg
Where will Congress rank the nation’s security on its priority list?	The US Capitol. (Photo by Anna Rose Layden/Getty Images) It’s September, which means that it should be time for the annual Congressional rush to try and get the defense policy and funding bills through the House-Senate conference. But tragically, as Congress comes back into session, all the talk is actually about the length of the Continuing Resolution (CR). Some want it to be as short as possible, lasting until just after the November elections. Some want it to last until March, so the new administration — and Congress — have a chance to make a mark on final spending for the year. Some say it should last through the entire next fiscal year, thereby just admitting defeat now and be done with it. Sure, why not. Once you have completely shirked your duty and decided to just ignore the impacts, particularly on the nation’s competitiveness, security and military forces, why not just throw hands up in the air and work on other things? Here’s the reality: Hope is not lost. There is actually still time left in this fiscal year to get both defense bills passed and put American security on track — if leaders on the Hill are willing to fight for it. As a reminder, providing for the common defense is the only mandatory and exclusive job of the federal government and, even though domestic discretionary spending may still go into a CR, the national security consequences of delayed defense funding are the most costly and dangerous for the nation. First, let’s talk logistics. Only two of the four bills have gone through the entire pre-conference process, but that level of regular order is almost quaint these days. They could move quickly by taking the committee bills straight to conference; while that bypasses numerous elected representatives getting their chance to weigh in, they will still get a shot when the conference agreements come to the floors for a vote, which they actually must do before they can proceed to the president for signature. This type of process is not ideal, but it is better than a government shutdown or a lengthy CR that only incrementally extends last year’s money and priorities into the new year and wastes time and money. Despite the heated rhetoric of an election year, there are really only a half dozen big issues in play for the House-Senate conference to resolve to complete the bills on time: 1) the defense top line, 2) aircraft procurement, 3) equipment for the National Guard and Reserves, 4) military construction, 5) shipbuilding and 6) the pay raise for junior enlisted personnel. Once that first issue — the total amount of money the nation will invest in its security — is resolved, the others could quickly follow. Concerning the topline, the below breakout of the budget by Service shows that the major difference is between the House and the Senate. The Senate appropriators provided $21.5 billion more than their House counterparts, a sum that would increase the competitiveness and readiness of our military. Defense Toplines by Service Component Next are a few major issues concerning funding levels to specific appropriations. First, within the aircraft procurement accounts, the various committees are about $3.5 billion apart, with the House Armed Services Committee as the outlier. With three of the four committees marking above $40 billion, we can expect a final agreed-upon bill to include an increase over the request in aircraft procurement Next is equipment for the National Guard and Reserve Components. As usual, the administration requested no money for this account. However, Congress routinely provides about $1 billion in unrequested funds. Given appropriators in both chambers increased the account again this year, this should be easy to resolve in conference. On military construction, the House kept close to the president’s budget while the Senate added numerous projects it designated as emergency spending. A resolution on this issue will be tied tightly to the defense topline agreement. If spending is close to the Senate level, then military construction is the clear winner. If not, these projects will not happen. Next, and maybe the most consequential for the nation, is Navy shipbuilding. The House has marked at about $1 billion less than the Pentagon requested, a stinging rebuke in the confidence of the Navy to build ships. The Senate added several billion dollars, betting that the Navy, and the industrial base that supports it, can get its act together and produce the ships the nation needs. One can imagine that China is watching how this one will go. Top Defense Conference Issues The last major issue is the pay raise for junior enlisted military members. The Senate is taking a wait and see approach, with an additional one percent above the basic pay raise for these specific military ranks. They are waiting on the Secretary of Defense to release his Quadrennial Review of Military Compensation before taking action next year. The House is not waiting. Concerned with recruiting challenges and the effect of 20-plus percent of inflation over the past several years, they are recommending an additional 15 percent for the junior enlisted ranks. This could be resolved by simply splitting the difference with a 7.5 percent increase this year and the promise to review it again next year. Though CRs have become shamefully routine, their damage remains. The artificial budget caps related to a forgotten debt ceiling fight in the midst of supporting Ukraine and Israel, along with the threat of an aggressive China, is sending a message of weakness to our autocratic adversaries and providing them with the willpower to fight on. Yes, the deadline is close. But the issues simply are not that complicated. If Congress is willing to sit down and focus, rather than throw its hands in the air, America can be a more secure nation — not months down the line, but in a matter of weeks.

Bell launches campaign to sell Aussies V-280 Valor tiltrotor	Bell's V-280 Valor won the US Army's Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft competition (Bell) LANDFORCES 2024 — A top executive with Bell Textron will meet Friday with Australia's Army chief, Lt. Gen. Simon Stuart, to push forward what may be a long campaign to convince the Lucky Country it needs the V-280 Valor tiltrotor. It's an ambitious move by Bell, who won the right to produce the V-280 for the Army's Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) effort in December 2022. But Carl Coffman, vice president for military sales at Bell Textron, told Breaking Defense in an interview that the company believes Australia's geography and mission sets fit the Valor's capabilities perfectly. 'This is a huge country. And then you take a look at the force structure of the Australian Defense Force, and look at their posture, and there's two challenges you have. One is your deployment to secure the homeland, the Australian continent, and [two is] the movement of forces strategically to accomplish that,' Coffman said during the Land Forces 2024 conference. 'Most of your force structure is on the outer perimeter of the country, and in the middle of the country is a whole lot of very demanding terrain, and a lot of not very much, right? So I've got to be able to move my force structure internally very rapidly around this country in order to to defend it.' The executive noted that the Australians are already familiar with Bell's V-22 tiltrotor and the capability that brings, because of the US Marine force that rotates in and out of Darwin in the north of the country. Australia, faced with fires and floods across vast areas, often calls on its military to assist with those rescue and response missions. And it regularly provides assistance to countries across the Indo-Pacific. The V-280 responding to disasters and threats in the island archipelagos north of Australia would provide flexibility and lift that conventional helicopters can't provide, Coffman argued said. The V-280 is not ready for sale yet, of course. The program just entered the engineering, manufacturing and development phase in the United States, with the company hoping to get soldiers into the cockpit in 2030. Before that date, the company plans to build six prototype aircraft and two user test aircraft. 'We expect to fly our first prototype test vehicle (PTV) in 2026,' he said. The aircraft has been modified to incorporate changes requested by Special Operations Command, including a refueling probe capability in the nose. Coffman said that a potential sale would probably occur through the US Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program. He added that he'd already met this week with the chief of Army Aviation, Maj. Gen. Stephen Jobson, whom he said appeared to respond positively. Coffman didn't mention it, but Australia's Special Air Services often operates with US forces and might be attracted by an aircraft that can fly vast distances at speeds much faster than a helicopter and is already rigged for use by special operators.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/bell-launches-campaign-to-sell-aussies-v-280-valor-tiltrotor/	2024-09-12T07:20:30-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/221205_bell_valor_FLARA.png
Allies in acquisition: MITRE urges Pentagon to work better with partners in developing, buying weapons	AUKUS allies have trialled AI enabled drones to reduce enemy target identification time (US DoD) WASHINGTON — Working with partner nations is the norm for the US military when it operates around the globe, but the Pentagon is still far too alone when it comes to the business of defense acquisition, according to a new MITRE paper published today. Closer cooperation with allies and partner nations on acquisition could strengthen interoperability and better enable the Defense Department to harness breakthrough tech from outside the US, the research organization said in the report, called 'Buy the Way We Fight.' 'What we're proposing in the paper is that the US defense acquisition community should have connections and relationships and conversations and awareness with our international partners,' said Dan Ward, the military technologist who authored the paper. 'They [foreign nations] might have solutions that are available sooner, and we will find out about them by having those conversations.' International cooperation is a hallmark of certain weapons programs like the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, which was designed from the start to be produced in part by several partner nations that would eventually buy it, as well as in multi-lateral agreements like AUKUS, which was created to help enhance cooperation on defense technology among Australia, the UK and the US. However, a majority of US weapons development happens stateside, with acquisition and contracting officials working in isolation from counterparts in foreign countries that the US military will fight alongside. 'When we when we deploy, we deploy together,' Ward said. 'And doing that … without having first had some conversations about about the systems we're developing to deploy, I think is a pretty big risk.' To remedy the acquisition isolation, MITRE laid out three steps it says the Pentagon should take right now. First, it calls for the Defense Department to update its acquisition policies. Specifically, it should update DoD 5000.01 — the department's overarching acquisition ruleset — to require program offices 'explore connections' with partner nations. It also recommends modifying the guidance for middle-tier acquisition and software acquisition so that international cooperation and interoperability is considered as part of the acquisition process, the report states. Second, the report recommends that the department create new forums for US acquisition officials who work inside the military’s program offices to meet and engage with international counterparts. For example, representatives from the Defense Entrepreneurs Forum in March proposed creating a 'expeditionary diplomatic fellowship program' to increase international collaboration and build the networks of junior officers, enlisted and DoD civilians, and a similar model could be used for an acquisition fellowship, the report states. Finally, the Pentagon needs to build on those policy changes and new engagement opportunities by establishing 'new norms' for international collaboration — a recommendation Ward said the paper intentionally leaves open ended so that the Pentagon can experiment and see what works best. While the recommendations are designed to be applicable 'across the board' to acquisition programs of all shapes and sizes, Ward pointed to hypersonic weapons, AI and quantum as technologies from which the Pentagon might benefit from greater teamwork with its partners. (All of these are areas of focus within what's known as Pillar II of the AUKUS agreement.) 'It would be really useful to have some conversations across the alliance, with our coalition partners, to say, ‘Hey, we're starting to develop some stuff in this direction. What do you know? What can you contribute? What do you need? What do you have? How can we work together on that?’' he said. Even in programs where the United States does not plan to get directly involved, like the future French-German battle tank, the Defense Department could have production experience or data that it could share with its allies in order to make acquisition faster and cheaper or to enhance interoperability, Ward said. However, the Pentagon must also be careful not to course correct so hard that the pendulum swings the other direction, with DoD acquisition officers feeling hamstrung by onerous requirements to collaborate with foreign nations. The paper notes that its recommendations are 'not about granting other nations a veto over American acquisition policy nor allowing them to dictate elements of acquisition programs.' Ward acknowledged that including allies and partners in conversations about technology requirements and nascent acquisition programs might slightly increase time and complexity, but could also lead to technologies being fielded faster if a partner nation already has a solution under development. 'What's really going to take a lot of time and cost a lot and make things worse is if we don't have these conversations, if we're deploying alongside forces where we haven't had conversations about needs and capabilities and requirements and what the system can do,' he said. 'What we're not recommending is just that we spent all our time having conversations that don't go anywhere.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/allies-in-acquisition-mitre-urges-pentagon-to-work-better-with-partners-in-developing-buying-weapons/	2024-09-12T06:06:31-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/240312-A-XM236-1038_AUS_DSTG_UAV_launch_Credit_US_DoD_gov-e1723206393851.jpg
Anduril unveils new cruise-missile like weapon, plus voice-controlled drones	Anduril's Barracuda-250. (Anduril photo) WASHINGTON — Arguing that many of today’s options don’t do the trick, Anduril worked to make up something quick: a new family of air-breathing, autonomous air vehicles, akin to cruise missiles or one-way drones, which the company calls 'Barracuda.' Unveiled today, the weapon comes in three configurations — the Barracuda-100, -250 and -500 — with each increasing in size and payload. According to the company, the largest configuration can offer a range of greater than 500 nautical miles and over 100 pounds of payload. The two smaller configurations have lower ranges and offer a payload of 35 pounds. The company says each of the three variants can fly at speeds of up to 500 knots. 'The problem that we are seeking to solve here … is America and our allies and partners do not have enough weapons, full stop. And we are not capable of producing the volume of weapons that we're going to need to establish deterrence against a peer competitor,' Anduril Chief Strategy Officer Chris Brose said in a briefing with reporters ahead of the announcement. To do that, Anduril is striving to minimize defense-specific materials needed to produce the Barracuda and maximize the use of commercially available components. Depending on configuration, the weapon is compatible with different launch methods, the company says, such as from aircraft internal weapons bays, external rails, surface vessels, and ground-based systems. While the Barracuda may be new to the public, Anduril Vice President for Air Dominance & Strike Diem Salmon revealed the weapon has been selected for the early stage of a joint Air Force and Defense Innovation Unit effort to develop a low-cost air vehicle. Additionally, Salmon noted that the Barracuda can come in a -M configuration — denoting the qualities of a cruise missile or munition — and that modular features mean that the system is capable of 'a lot of different things.' Working together in either manned-unmanned or purely unmanned teaming, Brose said Barracudas could offer different capabilities like decoys, target detection and strike. At the core of the Barracuda enabling that autonomous collaboration is software, harnessing Anduril’s Lattice platform that serves as the foundation for much of the company’s weapons development. Called 'Lattice for Mission Autonomy,' the software could enable some ways to defeat adversary countermeasures, says Salmon, as well as smooth the way for upgrades. 'What we have sought to do with Barracuda is solve that problem [of limited production] at the level of design, to build a system that is simple, that is easy to manufacture, that is software-defined and mass-producible,' Brose said. Speak Now: Will Voice Commands Control Drone Wingmen? The Lattice software is also core to other high-profile efforts from the company. At a location in west Texas, the site of Anduril’s largest test range, company officials on Tuesday invited reporters to view a demonstration of what they think could be a step forward for programs like Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA), the Air Force effort to field drones that can join fighter jets in battle: voice commands to control drones in the heat of a fight. The demo consisted of four mid-size, jet-powered drones, which the company referred to as 'clay pigeon' jets. The drones took off from the company’s runway, then synched up in formation before being tasked to sweep virtual enemies from the area. A simulated adversary aircraft then crossed into their airspace. Once the threat was detected, the fleet of drones asked for permission to blow up the enemy. 'Authorization requested for approval,' an AI voice asked, somewhat akin to Apple’s Siri voice assistant. Armed with a laptop and microphone, an operator gave his consent for one of the four drones to eliminate the threat. 'Mustang 11, engage,' the operator replied. Within seconds, the Mustang 11 drone released a simulated missile — shown on a screen during the demo — downing the virtual enemy aircraft. Its job complete, the drone resumed its route alongside its fellow unmanned wingmen. Anduril officials say it’s testing like this that can help burn down risk for efforts such as the CCA program, where the company and competitor General Atomics are on contract with the Air Force to build prototypes. Using Anduril’s Lattice autonomous software, engineers here inserted voice command capabilities with the aim of reducing cognitive load on pilots and other potential operators. 'We want our pilots to be able to command uncrewed platforms. They're going to need to be able to do it inside the cockpit while they're doing other things, their hands and eyes are already very busy, the environment is shaky. And a voice command interface will allow them to work with these uncrewed platforms pretty easily,' Andrew Burke, an Anduril mission software engineer, explained ahead of the demonstration. (Like other media, Breaking Defense accepted accommodations from Anduril for the trip.) While this event involved the air domain, Anduril is developing the Lattice mission autonomy applications for other environments like the land and sea. Salmon said the software is 'open and hardware agnostic' including for platforms produced by other companies. That could make the software a candidate for programs like a parallel CCA autonomy effort that the Air Force says has five companies on contract, though Salmon declined to comment on whether Anduril is involved. And, according to Kevin Chlan, senior director for Air Dominance & Strike at Anduril, the company is exploring other tools like large language models — think ChatGPT — for drone operations. For example, Chlan said, an operator could ask a drone for a readout after a long patrol. The capability has been tested in simulations and could soon be introduced in a live environment, he said. While the ability for a single operator to control small fleets of drones showed progress, company officials acknowledged that challenges remain, such as overcoming adversary interference in guidance systems. Still, with a focused development and specific use case, Salmon said her goal for fielding the technology that enabled the demonstration would be only a couple years away. The voice command demo, which required the operator to give permission to a drone to fire, additionally highlighted debates around the permissible degree of autonomy for a lethal weapon system, a problem that Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall previously told Breaking Defense needs more work. Chlan acknowledged the issue and said Anduril is striving to abide by relevant DoD policies that guide the use of autonomous weapon systems. Still, he noted that policies can change over time, and it’s always possible to build in a type of dial into the software that governs degrees of autonomy and can essentially be turned up or down. 'So I think that as long as we think about the software that we're building that has the ability to kind of scale up and down with the policy, I think we're doing right if we do that,' he said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/anduril-unveils-new-cruise-missile-like-weapon-plus-voice-controlled-drones/	2024-09-12T03:48:27-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/Barracuda_250_Hero_2-e1726085328497.jpg
Army selects 2 ‘attritable’ UASs for company-level recon, surveillance and target acquisition	Soldiers fly Performance Drone Works's C-100. (photo courtesy of PDW via the US Army). This story was updated on 9/13/24 at 10:15 am with additional details from Army leaders. WASHINGTON — The US Army announced tonight that it has selected two drones, the Ghost X from Anduril Industries and the C-100 from Performance Drone Works, to proceed with its Company-Level Small Uncrewed Aircraft System program. 'The directed requirement for a Company Level Small [unmanned aerial system] UAS capability is a priority…based on observations from the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza,' Gen. James Rainey, the head of the Army Futures Command, said in the announcement. 'This requirement describes the importance of considering the UAS as a system, not just an air vehicle, and also highlights the importance of adaptability.' The dual contracts span a 10-year ordering period, with the first tranche valued at $14.5 million for up to 48 drones, Col. Danielle Medaglia, the project manager for uncrewed aircraft systems, subsequently explained. And although the service and companies are still hashing out the terms of their respective agreements, she soldiers could have those initial drones later this fall. 'This is the first tranche is going to really allow us to learn,' Medaglia told reporters during a Thursday call. 'We're going to develop those tactics, techniques and procedures, and then form programs of instruction,' she added. That learning period could drive design changes, drive down the per unit price tag, or lead to the selection of other drones for company formations. Both drones, described as 'attritable' by the service, will be headed for maneuver companies and are designed to carry various payloads for reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition missions. Anduril unveiled the Ghost X in 2023. The system is a dual battery UAS the company says has the ability to carry a 20-pound payload and fly up to 75 minutes with a range of 25 kilometers. Performance Drone Works's C-100 is a man-packable quadcopter designed to ferry up to 15 pounds, for missions up to 74 minutes. Both drones were on the Defense Innovation Unit’s Blue UAS List — an initiative designed to help the services more quickly select commercial systems that are fully-free of Chinese parts. 'By selecting approved platforms that have been on DIU’s Blue UAS List, this effort demonstrates the value of DIU’s approach to engaging with the commercial market and providing the DoD ready-to-scale solutions at speed,' said DIU Director, Doug Beck.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/army-selects-two-attritable-uass-for-company-level-recon-surveillance-and-target-acquisition/	2024-09-11T17:59:37-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/Army.mil_-e1726101030879.jpg
Lockheed, Thales team to produce Aussie-made GMLRS munitions	Soldiers assigned to 1st Battalion, 6th Field Artillery Regiment, 41st Field Artillery Brigade fire M31 Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Systems from their M270A1 MLRS during the Thunder Cloud live-fire exercise in Andoya, Norway on the night of Sept. 15, 2021. Thunder Cloud was designed to test out the targeting capability of the High Altitude Balloon system coordinated through the 2nd Multi-domain Task Force-Europe using long-range precision fires on a seaborne target 20 Kilometers off the coast on Andoya, above the Arctic Circle. (Official U.S. Army photo by Maj. Joe Bush) LANDFORCES 2024 — Australia is set to boost its capability for domestic manufacturing of precision guided munitions (PGM), by incorporating locally-made rocket motors and warheads into US guided multiple launch rocket system (GMLRS) missiles. Under an agreement announced at the Land Forces Expo in Melbourne on Wednesday, defense company Thales Australia, a subsidiary of the French parent, will manufacture rocket motors and warheads for Lockheed Martin’s GMLRS missiles. Earlier this year, Lockheed and the Australian defence department announced that GMLRS missiles would be assembled in Australia from solely US-sourced components. While derided by some as the equivalent of assembling flatpack furniture, that was a significant step in Australia’s journey towards a domestic PGM production line. Lockheed is standing up assembly of GMLRS at a defense facility at Orchard Hills, NSW, from US-made components, with the first wholly Australian-assembled round to be produced next year. Australian-made warheads and rocket motors from the Thales plants in Benalla, Victoria and Mulwala, NSW, are likely to be the first significant locally produced components for GMLRS. Ken Kota, Lockheed’s vice-president for international integration, said Lockheed was committed to finding Australian partners for missile production. 'The global supply of solid rocket motors is under stress. We need partners globally in order to be successful,' he said. 'We have very good plans in place. We have done a lot of engineering already. Our team in the US is designing and collaborating with the team here very regularly.' Thales chief executive officer Jeff Connolly said the deal was more than two years in the making. 'We started the discussion about, what would it take to make a rocket motor and warhead for GMLRS as a start point,' he said, stressing that this new agreement wasn’t just for Aussie needs but for global requirements. 'People would like to tell you that Australia can’t do – well it’s already there,' Connolly said. 'It’s enabled by AUKUS and propelled by AUKUS. The amount of cooperation between the states and Australia now because of AUKUS means we can really get going on certifications together, accelerate that through so that these weapons are the same as what would be produced by Lockheed and its partners in the US.' Connolly said Australian components would progressively be introduced to the GMLRS production line. All initial production rounds will feature only US-made components, including rocket motors and warheads, just assembled locally. Only once the Australian-made energetics are fully developed and certified will they be included in the new rounds, something the companies are hoping to see done before the end of the decade. Thales has already produced BLU series bombs which flew on US Marine Corps aircraft earlier this year, which helps with the development of the rocket motors. 'That’s the same chemistry involved in those type of aircraft bombs as in rocket motors, a cast compositive material with polymer chemistry,' said Duncan Watt, manager for the Guided Weapons and Explosive Ordnance (GWEO) enterprise for Thales. The strategic benefit of having domestic production capabilities on PGMs is obvious when looking at a map. Should Australia find itself in a conflict, relying on production lines in the US or Europe could prove disastrous. In addition, Australian industry stands to benefit if it can become the Pacific hub for supplying regional partners and allies with weaponry. Australia has previously announced plans for local production of Kongsberg Naval Strike Missile and Joint Strike Missile. Air Marshal Leon Phillips, head of the Australian defence department’s Guided Weapons and Explosive Ordnance Enterprise, said Australia wanted to do much more than assemble PGM from foreign supplied components. 'If all we did when we are sitting here in five years is bolting components together off extant foreign production lines, I will have failed in our ability to uplift our sovereignty,' he said. 'If all I am doing is taking rocket motors out of the US and trying to assemble more rocket motors, I will be hitting the same constraint supply point that already exists.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/lockheed-thales-team-to-produce-aussie-made-gmlrs-munitions/	2024-09-11T17:33:08-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/GMLRS-scaled-e1715360683573.jpg
DARPA ‘quantum skeptic’ challenges industry: Prove me wrong	Concept of quantum computing or supercomputer (Jackie Niam/Getty Images) WASHINGTON — As entrepreneurs, researchers, and executives gather this week at the Quantum World Congress outside Washington, how can anyone cut through the hype and figure out which nascent technology has real potential? That’s why DARPA has issued an open challenge to anyone developing a quantum computer to submit themselves to rigorous government testing, led by a self-described 'quantum skeptic.' The deadline to submit a brief abstract of one’s project is Sept. 19. That date is not negotiable, warned program manager Joe Altepeter, who’s heading what the agency announced in July as the Quantum Benchmarking Initiative (QBI). Contenders deemed promising will be eligible, for starters, for $1 million to help their testing, but DARPA expects them to be spending that much and more of their own money. 'I have a reputation in the DARPA building as a quantum skeptic,' Altepeter said in an interview with Breaking Defense. 'I was definitely the reviewer you absolutely did not want to get on your quantum submission, because I measured my success based on how much money I could save the US taxpayer by not funding dumb quantum ideas — and trust me, there are plenty of dumb quantum ideas to go around.' But over the last few years, Altepeter told Breaking Defense, he’s come around to the idea that there might be fire somewhere in all this quantum smoke, after all. So he’s prepared to be convinced, and to convince others. 'We're going to do our best to disprove anybody who steps through our door — we're going to be skeptical, by design, but we're also going to be a fair arbiter,' Altepeter said in an interview. 'So if you really think you can go the distance and you convince my team, we will be your advocate inside the government, in rooms you can't go, and say, ‘look, agencies A, B and C, we tried to break it and we failed.’' That kind of DARPA seal of approval could be a tremendous asset for quantum computing companies — as well as the feedback from the testing process itself. 'We offer something to companies that is unique,' Altepeter said. 'We are going to build the best verification and validation team in the world for quantum computing, [giving] unbiased feedback on what is right and what is wrong about your approach.' In the increasingly competitive quantum space, 'almost every other player is looking to get rich somehow and has a dog in this fight,' Altepeter said. But on government salaries, 'we are definitely not going to get rich,' he noted dryly. 'We’re looking for the answer.' Once a company or research lab submits its abstract, it needs to make an oral presentation to DARPA, one that sounds a lot like a PhD thesis defense. 'We want you to come in and have a conversation with us for half a day so we can ask really hard questions and see how you respond,' Altepeter said. A proposal that passes this gauntlet may receive an Other Transaction Authority (OTA) award of up to $1 million for a six-month review of their concept for the quantum computer they plan to build. But that’s just 'Stage A.' If the proposal survives those six months, it becomes eligible for Stage B, up to $15 million in DARPA funding for a year-long assessment of its R&D plan. Make it through that year, and the proposal will qualify for Stage C: up to $300 million and 'an army of engineers' will work 'as long as it takes' to validate the design, Altepeter said. DARPA will provide the core of this expertise but is soliciting participants from academia, Energy Department national labs and Federally Funded R&D Centers as well, he said. 'We are building an initiative that could be more than a billion dollars over five years,' Altepeter said. '[But] everything depends on what we find.' If none of the proposals pass muster, he said, 'we won’t spend anything.' Companies that do win DARPA funding should consider an adjunct to their own investments in testing, validation and due diligence, Altepeter emphasized, not a replacement for them. 'We're only going to play with someone in Stage C if [they’re] spending more than DARPA on this,' he said. 'Anybody who's serious about doing this is already planning on committing huge resources … If they're not already planning on spending big money, they probably are not serious about this.' That said, as a fan of the classic Back to the Future movies and their iconic mad scientist inventing time machines in his garage, Altepeter promised, 'We will carefully evaluate absolutely every submission, from Doc Brown and from a megacorporation.' But, he said, 'I would be very surprised if Doc Brown makes it very far.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/darpa-quantum-skeptic-challenges-industry-prove-me-wrong/	2024-09-11T11:06:02-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/GettyImages-1335905020-e1726063101640.jpg
Why would Russia need Iranian ballistic missiles? Experts point to tactics, industrial challenges	Military vehicles carrying Iranian-made surface-to-surface missiles take part in a military parade marking Iran's Army Day anniversary near the Imam Khomeini shrine in the south of Tehran, April 18, 2023. (Photo by Morteza Nikoubazl/NurPhoto via Getty Images) BEIRUT — On Tuesday the US leveled a new charge against Russia and Iran, alleging the Kremlin has received specific Iranian ballistic missiles for the first time and could employ them 'within weeks' in the war in Ukraine — what America's top diplomat called a 'dramatic escalation.' The purported move, denied by Iran, was condemned by Washington and its allies in Europe, but also served as a glimpse into Moscow's tactical thinking and, potentially, some deeper capacity challenges the Kremlin's war machine is facing, according to officials and experts. Tactically, US officials suggested the 75-mile-range Fath-360 missiles would be used in close-in fights, allowing Russia to 'preserv[e] its longer-range capabilities for use throughout the battlefield, thus deepening Russia's arsenal and also, again, giving it the ability to strike the kinds of targets that we've seen them striking, to include civilian targets,' as Pentagon Press Secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder put it. Jean Loup Samaan, a senior research fellow at the Middle East Institute, agreed. 'Over the past two decades, Iran has developed one of the most advanced ballistic arsenals and the bulk of them are either short or mid-range,' Samaan told Breaking Defense. 'I assume for Russia they are relevant for the kind of battles we see in the border area between Russian and Ukrainian troops, so at tactical level [they'll be used] to exhaust the Ukrainians.' But Samaan said Moscow's outreach to Iran could be the latest clue about internal production woes. 'It may also indicate, just like with North Korean involvement behind Russia, that the Russian defense industry is struggling to keep the pace with the production of weapons used by the Russian forces,' he said. RELATED: Russian 'conquest' of Ukraine on the table if US, allied military aid falters, study says The Kremlin may have cause to worry about the effectiveness of Iranian missiles after Israel and its allies were able to take down virtually all the threats launched towards Israel in a dramatic mid-April barrage, but Behnam Ben Taleblu of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies think tank said that's not as relevant an example as it may seem. 'The Fath-360 is a derivative of Iran’s most precise ballistic missile, the Fateh family of single-stage, solid-propellant short-range ballistic missiles,' Ben Taleblu told Breaking Defense. 'Much of what Iran fired on April 13 were liquid-propellant medium-range ballistic missiles never before employed in regional military operations. There is a considerable difference between the track records of these two systems. And lest we forget, for Putin, the perfect is not the enemy of the good at the moment.' Can Kasapoğlu, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, wrote in an analysis today that the Fath-360 is a 'textbook tactical ballistic missile' whose 'rapid launch cycle and low per-unit cost make it a formidable option, particularly when fired in salvos.' Sanctions And Skepticism In response to the purported Iranian missile transfer to Russia, France, Germany and the United Kingdom announced that they 'will be taking immediate steps to cancel bilateral air services agreements with Iran,' in addition to sanctioning Iran air and entities and individuals involved with Iran’s missile program. The US followed suit. While the sanctions and canceling economic ties are important, the experts said they did not consider them enough to deter Tehran. 'The sanctions have sometimes slowed down the nuclear and ballistic programs but over the past decades, the IRGC [Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps] has always found ways to circumvent those sanctions. They have a strong indigenous defense industry that is able to develop those ballistic missiles and they also relied on Asian partners such as North Korea so that also weakened the impact of sanctions,' Samaan told Breaking Defense. Ben Taleblu said that 'if anything, these penalties are what should have been levied following Iran's drone transfers [to Russia] two years ago to thwart the transfer of missiles more recently.' 'But now they can serve as the building block of a more coherent European policy toward Tehran if paired with the snap back of UN sanctions,' he added. Regardless of the sanctions, it appears Russia's ties to Iran are only growing stronger. Iran and Russia have both issued many statements that they are very close to signing a defense 'comprehensive agreement' to boost their military cooperation, as well as formalize it. '⁠Iran’s widening radius of arms proliferation is a symptom of a much larger problem,' Ben Taleblu said. 'Slowly and steadily, Iran and Russia are working to revise the regional balances of power in their favor, deepening their military cooperation and engaging in salami tactics against their adversaries while compartmentalizing their conflicts. Getting good on countering one of these threats will require improving your policy on the other.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/why-would-russia-need-iranian-ballistic-missiles-experts-point-to-tactics-defense-industrial-challenges/	2024-09-11T09:45:08-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/240911_iranian_missiles_parade_GettyImages-1251974143-scaled-e1726067511535.jpg
Navy awards BlueForge Alliance new $950M contract to boost sub industrial base	The Virginia-class attack submarine Pre-Commissioning Unit Minnesota (SSN 783) pulls pierside at Naval Station Norfolk from a scheduled underway. (US Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Alex R. Forster/Released) WASHINGTON — The Navy on Tuesday awarded BlueForge Alliance a $950 million contract to continue its efforts in bolstering the submarine industrial base (SIB) in the United States in preparation for the work necessary to carry out the AUKUS security pact. 'This contract will execute ongoing critical efforts to strengthen and expand the SIB and provides a direct contractual arrangement with a strong partner with demonstrated experience driving enhanced capability and capacity,' a Navy spokesperson told Breaking Defense. 'The contract supports urgent ongoing efforts to diversify and strengthen the supply chains, drive national/regional workforce attraction, targeted training capacity increases and enterprise wide retention improvements,' the spokesperson continued. 'Additionally, this work will scale manufacturing technology (additive manufacturing, robotics / automation) capacity and capability that is essential for defense industrial base wide production and maintenance.' Roughly $500 million of the contract award is categorized under foreign military sales. The spokesperson said those funds are under FMS because they directly support Australia's anticipated purchase of three or five Virginia-class submarines by adding capacity to the American industrial base. 'The U.S money being executed under this contract is part of the FY 2024 National Security Supplemental focused on accelerating and scaling critical efforts required for domestic submarine construction and sustainment. Efforts related to development of the larger submarine industrial base development, including Australia and/or the UK, may be considered at a future date,' the spokesperson said. BlueForge Alliance is a Texas-based nonprofit company that has rapidly made a name for itself in the defense industrial space by working with the Navy and submarine prime contractor General Dynamics to hit the service’s aspirational goal of hiring 100,000 new shipbuilders over the next 10 years. A spokesperson for BlueForge did not immediately return a request for comment about the contract. Prior to Tuesday's contract announcement, Navy officials had said they previously awarded the company roughly $500 million to turbo boost the service’s campaign to hire workers from across the country — most notably its advertising has been shown at Major League Baseball games and NASCAR races. The new contract brings the total amount of money the Navy has awarded to BlueForge in contracts up to $1.3 billion. Matt Sermon, a Navy civilian leading the service’s submarine industrial base efforts, previously told reporters BlueForge’s work has expanded to leading an additive manufacturing consortium across several universities as well as working with certain original equipment manufacturers and additive manufacturing companies to 'tie up that whole entire group from industry and academia into an organization that’s focused on the material maturity that we need to drive' capacity.

Boeing expects Polish air dominance fighter decision by early 2025	Boeing's F-15EX Eagle II features fly by wire flight controls and new electronic warfare equipment (Boeing) BELFAST — An aircraft selection decision relating to Poland’s air dominance fighter jet program could be made as soon as the end of the year, according to a Boeing official. Warsaw has long committed to acquiring 32 new multirole jets for the effort with rival bids from the manufacturer’s F-15EX Eagle II fourth generation type and the Eurofighter Typhoon on the table. A third option — another F-35A order — building off the $4.6 billion deal with Washington in 2020, has not been ruled out either. 'From our understanding, we are still trying to track when that [air dominance] decision is, we are of course meeting with the customer and also the political side, to make sure they understand the capabilities of the F-15EX,' said Marissa Myers, Boeing's senior manager for fighter programs, business development, during the International Defence Industry Exhibition (MSPO) in Poland. 'They have not given us a date per se, but we are targeting late 2024 or [early] 2025.' Maj. Gen. Cezary Wisniewski, deputy general commander for the Polish Armed Forces, told Breaking Defense last year that as part of an initial evaluation stage for the air dominance program, he had dispatched a team to Italy to discuss Eurofighter Typhoon capabilities. Myers at the time declined to comment on whether the F-15EX was similarly assessed. The jet is a modernized version of the legacy F-15, complete with digital fly-by-wire controls, glass cockpit and a new electronic warfare suite. Myers also weighed in on the question of powerplant, saying that 'if' Poland decided to place an order for Pratt and Whitney’s F100 turbo fan engine, an alterative to General Electric’s F-15EX qualified F110-129 powerplant, Pratt would face 'cost and schedule' issues tied to a F100 certification and test phase. Josh Goodman, F100 program director at Pratt and Whitney, told reporters on Sept. 3 that the company was campaigning for a Polish F100 order in support of the F-15EX offer, labelling the engine for Warsaw as 'low risk' and one that would require a 'couple of flight tests' to gain certification. In 2021, General Electric secured a $1.6 billion F110 contract for the Eagle II, beating the F100 in the process, while opening the door to the potential supply of 329 engines. USAF works off a program of record of 98 aircraft for the jet, subject to intervention by Congress. 'There was a response of timing [concerning Polish air dominance engine requirements],' Scott Keating, regional general manager of sales and business development in Europe for defense and systems at GE Aerospace, told Breaking Defense at MSPO. 'I’m not certain on how long that timing is, but it's a risk,' if additional time is required for engine qualification. 'We are the only qualified engine on the platform, that is a key element … the point that we want to illustrate is we are ready to serve, we are ready to deliver.' He also shared that F110 production will 'almost triple' in the next five years, adding, 'we are ramping up our supply chains to meet demand.' The GE offer also includes local sustainment benefits, with Poland able to maintain '90 percent' of engine shop replaceable units in country, according to Keating. According to a US Air Force spokesperson, 89 engines are on contract for F-15EX, covering Lots 1-5 and 29 spares. 21 engines have been delivered to date. GE company literature [PDF] notes that in addition to powering all USAF Eagle II aircraft, the F110 is also integrated on 70 percent of the service's 'frontline' F-16 fleet and at an export level, Bahrain, Bulgaria, Jordan, Qatar and Taiwan have all selected it for F-15 and F-16 integration. Planned export orders for the F-15EX include Israel acquiring up to 50 units, due to be named F-15IA. Tel Aviv's acquisition was cleared by the US State Department last month, as part of a wider F-15 package, valued at $19 billion. Additionally, in August 2023, Boeing and Indonesia signed a Memorandum of Understanding as a key milestone to finalize the sale of 24 Eagle II's.

Aussie GPS alternative firm Advanced Navigation wins big Hanwha contract	A Redback infantry fighting vehicle on display in Canberra. Army will take delivery of 129 of the vehicles, to be built in Geelong. (Andrew Green via Australian Ministry of Defence) LANDFORCES 2024 — A small Australian company, Advanced Navigation, scored a big win here today, signing agreements with Korean giant Hanwha to provide a unique inertial guidance systems for a range of the Asian company's weapons. 'We're really excited to announce that we have signed a contract with Hanwha Australia to supply the inertial navigation systems for their Redback vehicles for the Land 400 program,' CEO Chris Shaw told Breaking Defense. The contract, for $8.7 million AUD ($5.8 million USD), is a boost to Australia's pursuit of what it calls sovereign capability. The Redback is an infantry fighting vehicle meant to replace the country’s ancient M113 fleet. Hanwha won the $5-7 billion AUD ($3.38 billion US) contract in July 2023. That deal, combined with a broader agreement for Advanced Navigation to supply its precision guidance systems to Hanwha worldwide, could lead to as much as a 400 percent increase in business for the Australian firm, Shaw said. However, that broader agreement, as far as was disclosed, does not include an immediate contract. Advanced Navigation builds fiber-optic inertial guidance systems bolstered by artificial intelligence to provide systems that the company claims can operate in degraded combat environments, where GPS is subject to jamming or spoofing with a high degree of accuracy. That's important, because the conflict in Ukraine has shown that active electronic warfare capabilities can largely sideline the kind of precision-guided systems the West has invested in heavily for decades. (For instance, the precision artillery projectile Excalibur has reportedly been largely sidelined by Ukraine because its effectiveness declined below 10 percent. The munition costs around $160,000 per unit.) Shaw said his company already supplies systems used by Ukraine but he didn't identify any of them. 'Navigation warfare has emerged as one of the most effective mechanisms to level the battlefield,' Mike Smith, CEO of Hanwha Defense US, said at the ceremony marking the broader agreement. 'It has the potential to be the most expansive non-lethal effect in modern history.' The agreement will see the companies collaborate on the development of high-performance inertial navigation systems (INS) for autonomous, airborne and crewed systems on land and in the air. The deal calls for co-production of the systems by Advanced Navigation and Hanwha, appearing to open the door to deals in every country where Hanwha's defense units do business.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/aussie-gps-alternative-firm-advanced-navigation-wins-big-hanwha-contract/	2024-09-11T06:39:06-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/02/240226_australian_redback_ifv_MoD-e1708986548908.jpg
Army to test out 30 new drones and launched effects during EDGE 24	A UH-60 Black Hawk launches an ALTIUS mini-drone (aka a launched effect) during a previous event. (photo provided by Yuma Proving Ground) WASHINGTON — This month in the sky over Yuma Proving Ground, the US Army is testing out a slew of drones in an effort to help decide just what the future force needs and pave a path towards acquiring it, according to a pair of one-star generals. The aviation-focused Experimental Gateway Demonstration Event (EDGE) 2024 kicked off Monday and is expected to run for over two weeks. While details about exactly what tech is being tested this year remains under wraps, the event is focused on examining launched effects and unmanned aerial vehicles. Can they work together? Hold up against electronic warfare jammers? 'We really wanted to pinpoint it down to autonomy and behaviors … inside a contested environment,' Brig. Gen. Cain Baker, the director of the Army Future Command’s Future of Vertical Lift Cross Functional Team, told reporters last week. 'We've established, really, some battlefield geometry out there at the brigade, division, corps, against replicated threats, you know, with our live emitters, and now we're going to ask industry to actually fly a mission set against those threats,' he later added. In total, the service selected five companies to haul along 30 different launched effects and aerial drones into the Arizona desert for this year’s demo, according to Baker, who did not disclose just who and what made that list. Sister services will also be on hand with their own tech. The goal, he said, is threefold: explore which capabilities worked well alone, which paired well with other weapons, and how they responded to threats. 'What we're doing out of EDGE is really informing our next set of requirements for launched effects or UAS,' Baker said. 'The outcome of EDGE really drives our set of requirements and acquisition,' he later added. Evolving Strategy As the Army looks to pull demo observations into the acquisition plan, service leaders have been grappling with its aviation weapons portfolio. After moving ahead with several, possibly overlapping, categories like launched effects, loitering munitions and drones, they sought a reset or at least a chance to better nail down each category. During a recent interview with Breaking Defense, Program Executive Officer for Aviation Brig. Gen. David Phillips said the Army Requirements Oversight Council inked an internal Abbreviated Concept Development Document earlier this summer. While he didn’t detail all the changes in the document, he revealed that the service is officially moving forward with the hunt for a short-range launched effect, studying lethal payloads for the medium-range option, and in a holding pattern for a long-range precision munition. When it comes to those launched effects — essentially small drones that shoot out of something else mid-flight to collect info or strike targets — the service is eyeing three ranges: short, medium and long. It initially opted to focus work on that middle option, but is now officially moving forward with development of a shorter-range variant. 'That's executing in parallel,' Phillips said. As for the medium-range weapon, the service formed a partnership between a handful of companies. Anduril Industries is providing the air vehicle (the Altius 700); Collins Aerospace, the mission system; Aurora Flight Sciences is the integrator; and two other undisclosed companies working on payloads. The change, here, according to Phillips, is that his shop is now working with the Program Executive Office for Missiles and Space to move forward to find the right lethality capability for that medium-range option. 'From our perspective on the launch effect capability … [it] is maturing rapidly, so to bring a warhead lethality capability on to that, would be a feasible approach, and so they're working on that,' he explained. The pursuit for a longer-range launched effect is still down the road, according to Phillips, but Baker explained that the Marine Corps is bringing out a similar 'lethal' capability to EDGE for the Army to try out and explore connectivity questions, like how far out it can fly. What isn’t clear is the fate of a helicopter-launched, long-range precision munition (LRPM). The service wants a longer-range weapon to fire off its AH-64 Apache helicopters and is buying and fielding the Spike Non-Line-Of-Sight missile system (NLOS) — made by Lockheed Martin and Israel’s Rafael — as the interim solution. However, it was planning to acquire a long-term solution and hosted a 'shoot-off' with three vendors in 2022. An Army Requirements Oversight Council had been slated to meet earlier this year to discuss the way ahead but that was postponed and possibly folded into that larger Abbreviated Concept Development Document decision point, in part because the service reclassified LRPM as a launched effect. Phillps didn’t disclose just how LRPM work now fits into the launched effect roadmap but said more decisions will be forthcoming. 'There's more to be determined based on technological maturity assessments, all those capabilities and discussions from a requirements perspective,' Phillips said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/army-to-test-out-30-new-drones-and-launched-effects-during-edge-24/	2024-09-11T04:34:42-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/09/UH-60-launches-Area-I-ALTIUS-mini-drone-e1649271214347.jpg
