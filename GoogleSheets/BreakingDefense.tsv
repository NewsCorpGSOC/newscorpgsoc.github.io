Pentagon needs further industry collaboration on O-RAN development for 5G interoperability	US Marines with Tactical Training and Exercise Control Group (TTECG), familiarize themselves with 5G-enabled devices at Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center (MCAGCC), Twentynine Palms, Aug 16, 2022. (US Marine Corps photo by Lance Cpl. Isaiah Brummett) WASHINGTON — The Department of Defense needs industry partners to become more involved in the process of making open radio access network (O-RAN) capabilities a reality, Pentagon leaders and warfighters said Thursday. O-RAN architectures allow users to mix and match different hardware and software components from various vendors when creating 5G networks. The goal is to provide more flexibility, cost efficiency and seamless interoperability, all while ensuring the network is as secure as possible. O-RAN has been a hot topic within 5G circles in recent years, but official direction on the principle wasn’t released until last October in the DoD’s most recent 5G guidance. Now the Pentagon wants more help from industry to make O-RAN become a reality at a faster pace, Director of the DoD CIO’s 5G Cross Function Team Juan Ramírez said during a Potomac Officer’s Club event today. 'We've actually developed an open RAN strategy that, God willing, we get our money and we don't get cut, we will actually start to see more deployment of open RAN. Yes, the department has been at the forefront of it, but we can’t be the only ones,' Ramírez said. 'This is something that we are working with industry on, and we are getting support from industry, but we want to see it push faster. From that perspective, I would say the DoD is leading it [O-RAN], but it shouldn't be the only one. We're a small player when we look at the overall amount of money that is out there for network modernization.' When asked during a panel what needed to change to make 5G more applicable for military use, Johnson Wu, the commercial and technical lead of the Defense Innovation Unit’s cyber and telecom portfolio, replied 'cross vendor interoperability.' 'We are still doubtful whether all this cycling stuff and 5G relays are actually interoperable,' he added. Coming from experience in the tactical domain, Zachary Taylor, senior communications officer in the Army’s special operations 75th Ranger Regiment, admitted that he tends to be skeptical of 5G capabilities because of their lack of interoperability and the lack of education on how they can become interoperable. If industry learns how to work together to be able to plug one device from one vendor into another device from another and teaches the warfighters how the process works, he said, the possibilities of 5G are more promising. 'It is not a silver bullet, right? It doesn’t solve everything,' Taylor said of 5G. 'What I need industry to do is work with other industry partners and be willing to take that critical feedback from the warfighter. 'Most of the warfighters don't understand how to implement some of these different technologies. So what we need from industry is an education piece. We're not subject matter experts. There's a lot of technology. The rapid evolution of technology is just going to outpace our knowledge.' Capt. Lucas Vancina, 5G technical lead at the Marine Corps Tactical Systems Support Activity, said the most helpful component of 5G is when it can operate in an O-RAN fashion. 'Definitely the extensibility of the open architecture aspect is probably the biggest advantage from my perspective, like the backwards compatibility,' Vancina said, explaining the capability of a 5G network component being able to work with a legacy system. 'It can be both backwards compatible using the non-3GPP inner working functions [which are responsible for connecting networks like Wi-Fi, fixed-line and code division multiple access to 5G networks] and but also having that built in capability and plan roadmap for future use cases like 6G, is one of the biggest things.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/pentagon-needs-further-industry-collaboration-on-o-ran-development-for-5g-interoperability/	2025-02-27T13:42:19-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/230316_DVIDS_5G_phone_test_7423737-scaled-e1678992887468.jpg
SECNAV nominee says he’ll bring ‘urgency’ to Navy’s shipbuilding	President Donald Trump's nominee for Secretary of the Navy John Phelan listens during a Senate Armed Services confirmation hearing on Capitol Hill on February 27, 2025 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) WASHINGTON — The nominee for Navy secretary pledged to lawmakers he'd be focused on correcting the course of problematic shipbuilding programs as well as replenishing dwindling munitions stockpiles, while largely avoiding any significant controversy. John Phelan, a prominent financier and GOP campaign donor who was tapped to become Navy secretary a few weeks after President Donald Trump won the election, testified today before the Senate Armed Services Committee and appeared poised for an easy confirmation. 'I think what is missing from what I can see is a sense of urgency,' Phelan said of the Navy's shipbuilding record. 'We're just going along and everybody — it's Kumbaya. It's almost as if you're waiting for a crisis to happen to ignite things. And I think in the business of warfare, that's a dangerous place to be. So I think why the president selected me is I will bring a sense of urgency to this. I will bring a sense of accountability to this.' Asked about the Constellation-class frigate — one of the most delayed shipbuilding programs, according to a review by the previous administration — Phelan called the program a 'mess' and said the service is producing a frigate that 'looks more like a carrier, or a battleship or a destroyer.' RELATED: Trump slams Navy's frigate program over cost increases At one point, Phelan said Trump has texted him multiple times complaining about the state of the Navy's ships and shipbuilding, and asked what he was doing to fix it. The nominee said he responded by reminding Trump that he had not yet been confirmed. Phelan's hearing was largely uneventful in the sense that most questions focused on the standard cast of Navy-oriented topics, from investment in the service's Nuclear-Armed Sea-Launcher Cruise Missile (SLCM-N) to the dwindling stockpile of munitions the Defense Department has been facing since the start of the war in Ukraine. As for SLCM-N, a weapons program the Biden administration had advocated canceling, Phelan said it is a 'critical component' to the nation's defense. On the subject of dwindling munitions, the nominee said the stockpiles were 'dangerously low' and pledged to focus on the issue 'very quickly.' One of the few contentious moments of the hearing came when Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., repeatedly asked Phelan about what the senator characterized as a broad, topline cut to the Pentagon's budget ordered by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. (The Defense Department has denied Hegseth is cutting the budget and has said it intends to shift monies towards the new administration's priorities.) Phelan responded by saying he was not privy to discussions around that choice and therefore couldn't comment on its efficacy. Following the hearing, Blumenthal told reporters Phelan 'clearly dodged' the senator's questions. That 'should leave all of us wondering whether he has the guts and grit to lead the greatest Navy in the history of the world in a time of greater challenges than ever before,' the senator said. Unlike most service secretaries, Phelan, whose career has centered on private investment, does not have experience serving in uniform or as a civilian at the Pentagon, a fact he briefly addressed in his opening remarks. 'I understand that some may question why a businessman who did not wear the uniform should lead the Navy. I respect that concern,' he said. 'The Navy and the Marine Corps already possess extraordinary operational expertise within their ranks. My role is to utilize that expertise and strengthen it to step outside the status quo and take decisive action with a results-oriented approach.' Trump's first confirmed Navy secretary, Richard Spencer, also came from a business and financial background prior to being tapped to lead the Navy and Marine Corps. However, Spencer did serve as a Marine Corps aviator in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Kenneth Braithwaite, Trump's second confirmed Navy secretary, was a career naval officer in both the active service and reserves, but only served as its chief civilian for several months at the end of Trump's first term in office.

RoQS for a hard place: DARPA seeks radically more ‘robust’ quantum sensors for ‘inhospitable’ fieldwork	Researchers at Sandia National Laboratories are developing a small vacuum chamber that could aid in non-GPS navigation. (Credit: Sandia National Laboratories) WASHINGTON — The latest atomic clocks use quantum science to measure time to a trillionth of a second. In a lab setting, quantum sensors allow ultra-precise measurements. But the Pentagon wants to take this new technology to the field, to navigate warzones without needing GPS or hunt submarines without using sonar, to put it on helicopters and jets and satellites, with all the vibration and radiation that entails. In those harsh environments, the same exquisite sensitivity that makes quantum tech such a good sensor also makes it extraordinarily vulnerable to interference, drowning the desired signal in irrelevant noise. Past efforts to ruggedize quantum sensors have focused on taking today’s finicky lab tech and shielding it from interference: One might wrap a sensor in metal to shield it from electromagnetic radiation, for instance, or install it on a vibration-cancelling boom instead of in the body of an aircraft. But in a new interview with Breaking Defense, Jonathan Hoffman, a program manager at the fringe-science-loving Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), argued that those kinds of Rube Goldberg fixes don’t address the underlying problem. Hoffman's team is in the midst of a project, dubbed Robust Quantum Sensors or RoQs, that he hopes will discover a fundamentally new approach. 'We’re looking for ideas that don’t require what I call these ‘band-aid’ solutions,' Hoffman said. 'Our hope is this is a philosophical, foundational change in how we build we quantum sensors. &#8230; Rather than saying ‘I’m going to shield away the problem,’ how do I, at the very beginning of my sensor design, think about all those interferences and figure out a way around [them]?' That’s an extremely difficult problem, and the potential solutions can get esoteric. Some of the ones Hoffman described sound similar to the latest developments in quantum computers, which suffer a similar hyper-sensitivity to outside influences and are also looking for alternatives to brute-force shielding of a fundamentally fragile core. They might require using different types of subatomic particles or finding new ways to 'superimpose' quantum states of particles. But Hoffman made a point of not endorsing any specific method. 'We didn’t pick one or the other,' he emphasized in the interview. 'Any quantum sensor that can do the job … is on the table for us.' The RoQS program had its public briefing for interested parties — from tech startups to government-funded labs — at the end of January, with initial abstracts due last week and full proposals by the end of March. Evaluating these complex scientific ideas will take a while, so Hoffman said he doesn’t expect to announce a list of winners or any specific dollar values until the end of summer. The award announcements, expected in August, will kick off a 30-month initial phase. Each competitor will have to take their quantum sensor and get it to work on a helicopter. That’s not targeted at any particular Pentagon aircraft program, Hoffman emphasized. He picked that challenge because a helicopter in flight is one of the most inhospitable environments for any sensor, with vibration, noise, heat, and all sorts of other interference to test the technology. 'There’s nowhere to hide,' he said. Meanwhile, in parallel, Hoffman and his team will work with Pentagon programs that are interested in quantum sensing to see what technical requirements and constraints they have. Once the 30-month initial phase is over, he said, competitors who got their tech to work on the test helicopter will then have 12 months to work with one (or more) of those partner programs to tailor it to work on their specific weapons system. 'All this would be done in close partnership with various government entities to make sure we can bring this onto the right platform, integrate it there, and demonstrate the significant advantage these quantum sensors can bring,' Hoffman said. This is not just a science experiment but an experiment in defense procurement as well, he said. 'Can we bridge the valley of death' between R&amp;D and actual fielding, he asked. 'If we can prove that the worst-case platform interference experience you can experience doesn’t matter to our sensors, then we’ve collapsed the TRL [Technological Readiness Level] chain.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/roqs-for-a-hard-place-darpa-seeks-radically-more-robust-quantum-sensors-for-inhospitable-fieldwork/	2025-02-27T09:48:11-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/211101_sandia_avocado_handout-e1635776824520.jpg
Preparing the defense industrial base to surge, collaborate, and deliver	Across the defense industrial base, the Defense Department is urging prime contractors and suppliers alike to deliver systems faster – everything from missiles, artillery, and air defense, to electronic warfare, drones, and maneuver vehicles. In this Breaking Defense webinar, we examine how DoD supply chain leadership is helping industry meet delivery requirements and targets by addressing strategies to surge production, improve supply chain visibility, and develop alternate sources of vital materials that can constrain and bottle up the supply chain, in addition to prioritizing demand signals that focus industrial-base efforts — as well as potential partnerships with international companies to meet domestic demand. AGENDA Webinar Panel: We will discuss the following: Tech Perspective: Amber Lao, Digital Strategy Analyst, Adobe, will discuss digital transformation and modernization of processes within the defense industrial base.

Dennis Blair: Pentagon purge a sign of dangerous times ahead	Former commander in chief of the US Pacific Command, Dennis Blair, delivers a speech at a conference of the Japan Atomic Industrial Forum (JAIF) in Tokyo on April 13, 2015. (YOSHIKAZU TSUNO/AFP via Getty Images) The Trump administration’s recent Department of Defense leadership changes are unprecedented in their scale and riskiness. Far from bringing fresh and smart perspectives to national security, they are most likely to weaken the combat effectiveness of the armed forces at a dangerous time for the United States. A diverse officer corps at all ranks produces higher combat effectiveness because it is drawn from a wider and deeper talent pool. The armed forces have learned over the years that not all the best military leaders are white males, and that we need to draw from the best leadership talent in the 35 percent of Americans who are not white and the 50 percent who are not male. The armed forces bring in the best people they can attract at the start of the very competitive merit-based 'up or out' promotion system. The larger the talent pool from which the entrants are drawn at the bottom, the better will be the leaders at all levels through the very top four-star positions. Army, Air Force, and Marine Corps colonels and Navy captains have been tested and judged, and the best of them promoted through a dozen jobs over twenty-five-year careers. Only 3 percent of them are selected for general and admiral. Further promotion only gets more selective as the jobs become tougher: The roughly 300 one-star flag and general officers ultimately are winnowed down to just 38 four-star generals and admirals at the highest levels of command. Gen. CQ Brown, the most senior African-American military officer in the armed forces and Adm. Lisa Franchetti, the most senior female officer in the Navy, had worked their way through this grueling obstacle course of the military promotion system with top performance at every level of command. They were the only current members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who were not white and male, and they were doing a fine job in their very difficult assignments. Senior officers have been and should be dismissed for poor performance and for insubordination. However, the decision to dismiss Brown and Franchetti without performance-based justification will weaken the faith of all current and potential officers in the fairness of the officer promotion system and shrink the talent pool of future military leaders. Arbitrary personnel decisions in the senior officer corps do damage beyond reducing the officer talent pool, at a time when the armed forces are fighting for talent. They also move less competent leaders into the top jobs. The basis for promotion up the officer ranks has been superior performance, especially in operational assignments, and leadership growth potential. What has not been a factor has been connection with or sponsorship from civilian politicians or political parties. The traditions of the American military profession are operational competence, political neutrality and institutional loyalty, not political or personal loyalty or connections. Politicization of the officer corps will move the wrong people to the top military positions, where they will provide incompetent and sycophantic military advice to political leaders and poor leadership to the troops. The experience gained in a merit-based promotion system is crucial. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and the new nominee for Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Dan Caine, will be the least seasoned defense leadership team in modern history. Whatever their personal qualities and success early in their careers, they have not been tested in high-stakes national security leadership roles — positions where wisdom is forged under pressure, where failure carries real consequences. History provides sobering examples of the cost of inexperience at the top. General Ambrose Burnside, General George Custer, Admiral Ralph Ghormley, General Ricardo Sanchez all had admirable personal characteristics and early careers but were not ready for the higher commands to which they were assigned. The challenges of inexperienced leaders at the top will be compounded by removing the civilian experts. The combination of forced early retirement for senior officials and a hiring freeze of new civil servants is a shortsighted move that will save little money but likely hobble the Pentagon. Yes, reform is needed to modernize the department. However, the problem is not the size of the civil service, but its outdated personnel system that makes it difficult to remove poor performers and reward top talent. Instead of reforming this system, the administration is choosing indiscriminate cuts that hollow out expertise when it is needed most. Make no mistake, a weaker civilian workforce means a weaker Department of Defense — just as threats from China, Russia and rogue states demand sharper strategic thinking. The current administration claims to support a strong military. You could have fooled me. Choosing inexperience at the highest levels, cutting without improving civilian staff, dismissing respected leaders without cause, and politicizing military promotions all point to a weakened force, not a stronger one. These are mistakes with lasting consequences that will endanger national security and, if history is any guide, they will take blood and treasure to correct. Admiral (ret.) Dennis Blair is the former Commander in Chief of the US Pacific Command and Director of National Intelligence.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/dennis-blair-pentagon-purge-a-sign-of-dangerous-times-ahead/	2025-02-27T08:12:23-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/GettyImages-469552254-scaled-e1740665696871.jpg
US defense industry could struggle to sell to new German government: Analysts	Soldiers participate in Saber Junction in Hohenfels, Germany, Sept. 13, 2024. The exercise is designed to assess readiness to execute unified land operations in a joint, combined environment (US Army) BELFAST — Germany’s conservative CDU/CSU-led government in waiting, and Europe’s urgent plan to rebuild its military capabilities through self-reliance, puts US industry and future orders from Berlin on shaky ground long term, a trio of analysts tell Breaking Defense. Notably, those concerns include whether Germany will stay the course on an $8.8 billion order for Lockheed Martin F-35A fifth generation fighter jets. Though he has still to formally take up office, Friedrich Merz, the CDU’s choice for chancellor, has proposed securing 'independence' from the US, criticized President Donald Trump's 'America first' doctrine and said he is prepared for the 'worst case scenario,' implying a future where the US would no longer be considered a trusted ally. Additionally, he has publicly called for Ukraine to be part of peace negotiations with Russia, pushing back on the White House decision to exclude Kyiv and European nations from proceedings. On Sunday, Merz told German television, 'After Donald Trump’s remarks last week, it is clear that the Americans, at any case the Americans in this administration, do not care much about the fate of Europe,' adding, 'This is really five minutes to midnight for Europe.' The US has since opposed a UN resolution condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine and sided with Moscow a second time by drafting another resolution, passed by members, which called for an immediate end to the conflict but without any criticism of Russia. Merz on the other hand has kickstarted German armed forces modernization plans by opening up discussions with the Social Democrats around a €200 billion emergency defense fund, Bloomberg reported on Monday. Amid such moves, posturing and strategic thinking rests the F-35 order, comprising 35 aircraft, and a collection of other highly lucrative US contracts, including Boeing P-8A Poseidon Maritime Patrol Aircraft (MPA), CH-47F Chinook heavy-lift helicopters and RTX Patriot air defense systems. Assessing the level of cancellation risk tied to the four major orders, JJ Gertler, a senior analyst at the Teal Group, told Breaking Defense, 'The most significant existing contract in which there may be buyer’s remorse and an attempt to go a different direction is the German commitment to F-35.' He put the stealth jet at the top of the list as it demands 'an ongoing relationship with the United States, because of their presumed access to all of the data going to and from the airplane,' and added 'it is not a one-time purchase decision like some of these other systems, and the US’ reliability as a partner has to be considered more seriously.' Similarly, Richard Aboulafia, managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory, a consultancy firm, said that 'the most survivable US export programs are the ones that need the least care and feeding from the US, and can be sustained with in-country resources. The F-35 is incredibly dependent on a constant stream of upgrades and parts.' Offering an opposing view, Jim Townsend, adjunct senior fellow in the transatlantic security program at the Center for a New American Security thinktank, said that the F-35 order is 'safe,' largely because Germany has 'no other option' but to acquire the aircraft to replace retiring Panavia Tornados. 🇩🇪#F35 Milestone achieved! Lt. Gen. Ingo Gerhartz, Inspector of @Team_Luftwaffe has signed the bulkhead for the first German F-35 at Lockheed Martin&#39;s Marietta, GA plant🇺🇸 A major step forward as Germany strengthens its defense capabilities with this 5th-gen fighter! pic.twitter.com/R3rVCVueHW &mdash; Lockheed Martin Europe (@LMEuropeNews) December 6, 2024 Political objections previously troubled Lockheed’s attempt to sell the aircraft to Berlin, when it was ruled out of consideration in 2019, only to be selected three years later and ahead of European fourth generation fighters. The German F-35 fleet is also set to be equipped with US B61-12 bombs to undertake NATO nuclear deterrence missions, with first deliveries expected in 2026. A spokesperson for Lockheed Martin told Breaking Defense in a statement, 'Questions regarding German politics are best addressed by the German government. Questions relating to Germany’s procurement of F-35, through a government-to-government contract, are best addressed by the governments involved.' At the other end of the spectrum is the contract to procure 60 CH-47F helicopters, which the analysts said is likely to continue forward, in part because the only competition was between two US firms — Boeing and Lockheed, which was offering its CH-53K King Stallion design. (Boeing declined to comment.) The 'odds of [CH-47F] cancellation are probably lower than in a case where the runner-up was European (or where a viable European counterpart might exist, like Airbus’s intent to develop a P-8 equivalent based on their airliners)' explained Gertler. The Chinook case is also helped because the aircraft can be supported by 'in-country depots,' as opposed to over reliance on the transfer of supply chain goods from the US, according to Aboulafia. In 2024, Tim Flood, Boeing's vice president of international business development, told Breaking Defense that the company plans on making first CH-47F deliveries to Germany in 2027, while the first of eight P-8’s is due for handover this year. A CH-47F Chinook assigned to B Company, 101st Combat Aviation Brigade, 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) perches on a mountain in the Alps in Germany (US Army National Guard) Air defense is another major investment for Germany, as over the course of 2024 alone, Berlin inked two Patriot air and missile defense system orders worth $2.4 billion and received approval from the US State Department to acquire up to 600 Lockheed Martin Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) Missile Segment Enhancement munitions and related equipment, valued at approximately $5 billion. Additionally, Germany is one of four European countries involved in a $5.5 billion acquisition of up to 1,000 Patriot Guidance Enhanced Missiles (GEM-T). The deal is contracted to COMLOG, a joint venture between RTX and European missile house MBDA, through the NATO Support and Procurement Agency. RTX deferred questions on Patriot to the German government for this report. Like Europe as a whole, Germany is acutely focused on replenishing air defense stocks to replace systems gifted to Ukraine. Berlin has supplied Kyiv with an undisclosed number of Patriot missiles as well as three complete systems, including spare parts and four launchers, according to a military support factsheet. Patriot has been credited with shooting down Russian Kh-47M2 Kinzhal hypersonic missiles and Su-34 fighter jets during the war, though delivery delays have been a point of tension. Townsend voiced confidence that Patriot orders for Berlin will go through as planned, noting the weapon system 'is too important for German air defense to be left behind and the delivery schedule is too long to delay the purchase.' Aboulafia added that a lack of alternative options could keep missile defense deals with the US on track. 'Conceivably, Eurofighter could replace the F-35, with enough time/money to qualify it for the nuclear mission,' he said. 'By contrast, Patriot might just be in a class by itself.' Currently signed agreements may be one thing, but there seems to be agreement among the analysts that future US sales to Germany will face longer odds. Gertler, for example, forecast that Merz’s push for 'independence' will likely lead to a situation where 'the US will lose its position as the default answer to every hardware requirement.' He added, 'Going forward, there will be no preference for US equipment stemming from a regard for their role as a guarantor of European security – at least so long as that commitment remains vague.' As Germany becomes more 'protectionist' in a bid to deliver weapons programs and rearmament at pace, US market entry restrictions or complete loss of market access could take hold, suggested Townsend, especially if the European Union decides to take more of a leading role over major projects. Earlier this week, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen launched plans related to a new 'designated European instrument' that she said would let the bloc deliver 'targeted and efficient defense spending' and that would specifically support European integrated air defense, deep strike capabilities, UAVs, ammunition and missiles, per Politico. 'I think in the short to medium term, the US will have the upper hand' over Europe, said Townsend. 'But in the long term, if European industry is able to rise to the challenge, they'll have competition, particularly in terms of price. The US tends to have the pricey, exquisite systems and maybe that's not always the answer to things.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/us-defense-industry-could-struggle-to-sell-to-new-german-government-analysts/	2025-02-27T07:01:57-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/DOD.mil-image-Collins-240913-A-VS161-2582M-scaled-e1740600109136.jpg
A joint project? Turkey’s KAAN fighter program attracts Gulf interest, exec says	The second flight of the national combat aircraft KAAN, which was initiated by the Turkish Defence Industries Presidency (SSB) in order to meet the combat aircraft requirement of the Turkish Air Forces Command and developed by Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI), is carried out successfully in Ankara, Turkiye on May 06, 2024. (Photo by TUR Defence Industries Presidency/Anadolu via Getty Images) IDEX 2025 — Turkey has seen 'lots of interest' from foreign nations in potentially joining its next-generation fighter jet project, including from an unnamed Gulf country that is 'seriously considering' joining development, a senior Turkish industry official told Breaking Defense. As of now, Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI) General Manager Mehmet Demiroglu said that the jet, known as KAAN, is under development only by Turkish companies as 'there is no official [outside] participation yet. 'There are lots of interest [from a] number of countries, but these things are taking a lot of time and high-level decisions,' he said in an interview last week at the International Defense Exhibition and Conference (IDEX) in Abu Dhabi. 'It will be a joint program.' Turkish media claimed in 2024 that Saudi Arabia was in talks to procure 100 KAAN fighter jets, but those reports were never confirmed by Ankara or Riyadh. (The Gulf kingdom has also expressed interest in joining competing fighter programs.) RELATED: Why Saudi Arabia is interested in GCAP — and whether it should be After the first KAAN prototype flew in 2024, Demiroglu said he expected the second and third prototypes to 'be flying by the end of the year and early next year, and we'll be heavily testing these prototypes. ' Demiroglu said that the firm plans to 'shorten the testing period, because we need to do lots of testing and to be able to deliver our first production to [the] Turkish air force in 2028-2029 time frame.' In May 2024, TAI announced that the firm will deliver 20 aircraft by 2028. Demirogu clarified that the delivery of the KAAN jets will start that year. 'I can tell [you] we didn't change our target, but we will see. No one can guarantee that this is going to happen at [a] specified time, because the world is in a different place compared to 10 years ago,' he said. Demiroglu added that for the firm to be able to deliver KAAN with the needed qualifications, it 'need[s] to do lots of homework, and with the latest developments in computing area, testing and experience building with the Hurkus, Hurjet and other [Turkish air] platforms, we are confident that we'll do much shorter time than normally expected,' he said comparing the KAAN development timeline to the lengthy development of the American-made F-35. KAAN, which is described as a 5th-generation fighter jet will have 6th-generation features, Demiroglu said, adding that that the firm is working on manned-unmanned teaming concept between KAAN and Turkish UAV maker Baykar. During IDEX, TAI displayed a model of the KAAN fighter jet alongside the Hurkus 2 trainer and light attack turboprop aircraft. Without going into any specific initiatives, Demiroglu said that Turkish industry more broadly is having 'very, very, very advanced discussions' with Saudi Arabia related to a number of projects. 'We are in discussion to find out the best collaboration model,' he said. A model of the KAAN fighter jet on display at Turkish Aerospace Industries stand at IDEX 2025. (Agnes Helou / Breaking Defense) He said he was confident that during 2025 Turkish firms 'will announce at least a couple of big projects' with the Kingdom. About interest in Hurkus 2 that was on display at the show, Demiroglu said that 'there are interests, but that interest will grow, because if Turkish air force is accepting a platform, that means it's a good platform.' He added that TAI is discussing export deals of Hurkus trainer and light attack version, not only in Gulf countries but also with countries from Africa, Central Asia and the Far East. More broadly, Demigroglu said that in the next five years TAI will focus on 'how fast we can deliver [and] how cost competitive these platforms will be without sacrificing any bit from the quality.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/a-joint-project-turkeys-kaan-fighter-program-attracts-gulf-interest-exec-says/	2025-02-27T02:22:18-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/kaan-e1715707472727.jpg
Japan targets weapons sales through Indo-Pacific, as industrial ties lag strategic ones	Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries launches fourth of Mogami-class frigates, Mikuma. Credit Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force TOKYO — Japan is in talks with Australia, Indonesia, the Philippines and other countries as part of a push to export weapons and subsdystems throughout the Indo-Pacific, according to a senior defense official here, part of a campaign to increase defense industrial ties regionally. The US ally's main thrust is the high-profile effort to sell Australia the Mogami-class frigate, which has attracted unprecedented support from the highest reaches of the Japanese government and industry. The official, who spoke to Breaking Defense on the condition of anonymity, also pointed to a long-simmering attempt to provide technology to Indonesia for what had been described as a destroyer program. The official said Friday there were talks with other countries but declined to name them. As for the Philippines, the Japanese defense minister publicly pledged closer defense cooperation on Feb. 24 in the wake of the persistent and aggressive pressure from China on Manila to give up some of its internationally recognized waters in the South China Sea. Defense Minister Gen. Nakatani said during his first visit to the Philippines that the two countries believe they must 'further enhance defense cooperation and collaboration in order to maintain peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific' because of the difficult security situation. That cooperation will include increased sharing of technology and the provision of weapons like the radar systems Japan recently has gifted to the Philippines. The air defense radar were installed at Wallace Air Station on the island of Luzon. Nakatani said nothing specific about weapon systems marked for eventual sale or transfer. Taken together, Tokyo's moves appear to be indicative of a lag between defense policy — where relations with Australia, South Korea, the Philippines and other regional players have grown substantially closer in the last two years — and weapons exports, perhaps the most concrete proof of closer cooperation between two countries. 'The defense relationship is not catching up with other areas of defense cooperation between the two nations [Australia and Japan],' the senior defense official said. 'The defense cooperation has been pushed up so much, but equipment cooperation — we've done some joint research projects — but not this big deal yet.' To catch up, Japan has moved swiftly to make good on its policy to begin exports. In the last year it moved from making its first appearance at an international air show, the 2024 Singapore event, to providing radars to the Philippines and engaging in a full court press to sell the Mogami to Australia, in what could be a turning point for Japan-Australia defense industry relations specifically. The Japanese government also created a joint board of senior government officials and of industry leaders late last year to coordinate policy and actions and ensure Australia, in particular, is as well informed about Japanese intentions and capabilities as possible. Japan has proposed a $10 billion AUD ($6.6 billion USD) sale to Australia of the Mogami frigate to answer Australia's request for bids for surface vessels to supplement the Hunter class, which are most focused on anti-submarine warfare. The Mogami, built by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, is competing against a German offering from ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems (KTMS), builder of Australia’s current Anzac-class frigates. KTMS is offering the Meko A-200, an upgraded version of the 30-year-old Anzacs. Selling the Mogami to Australia could 'open up the doors to other industrial cooperation, which is attracting more and more Japanese industries interested in the Australian market,' the official said. Closer cooperation could include the Lucky Country's guided weapons enterprise known as GWEO (Guided Weapons and Explosive Ordnance). Japan has invested heavily in missile systems and has 'much industrial expertise,' the senior defense official told Breaking Defense. Outside Australia, the nascent discussions with Indonesia about supplying technology — some reports from Indonesia said the Mogami frigate was discussed — are clearly in the early stages after years of on and off talks with the previous government. With the election last year of Prabowo Subianto, the former defense minister, those discussions have restarted, the official said. But they are less focused on a destroyer than on what the official called 'maritime security.' As Prabowo's team reviews its acquisition plans, Indonesia's plans will come into clearer focus. 'We'll discuss maritime security with them and we'll find out what capabilities they want and what capabilities we could provide to them,' the senior defense official averred.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/japan-targets-weapons-sales-through-indo-pacific-as-industrial-ties-lag-strategic-ones/	2025-02-26T12:55:33-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/Image-3-e1733085030942.jpeg
‘Let’s be frank’: Hegseth’s budget shakeup will be ‘painful’ but there’s ‘hope,’ Air Force official says	U.S. Air Force and Massachusetts Air National Guard pilot Capt. Martin 'Heklr' Clark, climbs into the cockpit of an F-15C Eagle aircraft prior to flight, April 20, 2016, as part of the Frisian Flag 2016 exercise, Leeuwarden Air Base, Netherlands. (U.S. Air National Guard photo by 1st Lt. Bonnie Harper/Released) WASHINGTON — Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s direction for the military services to collectively free up roughly $50 billion for fiscal 2026 will be 'painful,' a top Air Force official said today, though he predicted the process will benefit the service in the long run. 'Let's be frank,' Maj. Gen. Joseph Kunkel, a chief architect of the service’s new force design concept, said in a conversation hosted by the Hudson Institute. 'The Air Force has gotten smaller. The Air Force has gotten older. And as you look at where the Air Force has gone, we've protected core [missions], which is homeland defense, strategic deterrence and power projection. So there's not many places where we can go for these things.' Those limited opportunities for paring back, Kunkel reasoned, means 'it's going to look really, really bad' once Hegseth’s budget drill gets underway. Nevertheless, the general found reason for 'hope.' The process is not anticipated to change the service’s overall topline and is instead shifting dollars toward the Trump administration’s new priorities — including in the out-years under the Pentagon’s five year budget planning cycle. 'When you look at it from that perspective, the Air Force is going to do really well in the future,' Kunkel said, adding that the service’s newly minted force design will provide options for leadership to invest in. 'When you look at the secretary's priorities and you look at our force design, you're like, ‘There's a match, there's a match, there's a match.'' A leading hot-button issue for the service is a futuristic stealth fighter known as Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD), whose fate has still not been formally decided by the Trump administration after being paused last year. Without providing too much detail, Kunkel stated that 'the fight looks much better when NGAD is in it' as opposed to having to operate without it. 'NGAD remains an important part of our force design, and it fundamentally changes the character of the fight in a really, really good way for the joint force,' he said, such as by ensuring 'less operational risk' as the service pursues air superiority. If the fighter is not fielded, 'that fight is just gonna look a little bit different, and we may not be able to pursue or achieve all of our policy objectives.' Kunkel additionally observed that for the NGAD concept to be viable, the platform will need support from survivable bases it can launch from and tankers that can gas it up. Concerning base defense, elsewhere in the conversation Kunkel echoed comments from other officials that the Air Force may need to have its own indigenous base defense capabilities instead of traditional reliance on the Army to provide them. And on tanking, the general said that a next-gen tanker also currently in limbo 'might be part of the solution,' but there are other operational approaches that can achieve a similar outcome without it. Asked about reforms to the requirements process, including the at-times-cumbersome Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System, Kunkel said a key lesson from the war in Ukraine has been the value of rapidly iterating systems that are then quickly delivered to the field. That necessity, in turn, will likely require a different way of doing business. OP ED: The Pentagon's joint requirements process must go 'We've got to make changes in our processes, which is going to require some changes to the law to get ourselves to be more adaptable,' Kunkel said. He declined to comment on specifics.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/lets-be-frank-hegseths-budget-shakeup-will-be-painful-but-theres-hope-air-force-official-says/	2025-02-26T10:44:51-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/02/240213_pilot_cockpit_2550991-scaled-e1707844904759.jpg
The Pentagon’s joint requirements process must go	Seal of the Pentagon on display at the Pentagon visitor center. (Photo by Trevor RaneyDigital Media Division) A wave of efficiency talk has arrived in Washington, epitomized by the Department of Government Efficiency now roaming the halls of the Pentagon. But as policymakers examine how government actually functions, it's becoming clear that the goal shouldn’t merely be cost savings, but higher competence. One glaring example stands ready for immediate action: the Pentagon's sclerotic joint requirements process. In a new Hudson Institute report, 'Required to Fail,' we outline the need to immediately put this process out of its misery. For over two decades, the Defense Department has labored under a bureaucratic ritual known as JCIDS — the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System. Created with noble intentions, this process has devolved into a crushing administrative burden that actively impedes America's military modernization. Far from ensuring strategic alignment or joint warfighting capabilities, JCIDS has become a bureaucratic priesthood fixated on formatting, enthralled by committees, and divorced from tangible warfighting needs. The numbers tell a damning story. It takes over two years just to get a military requirement approved through this system. During that time, technology evolves, threats advance, and opportunities evaporate. While China rapidly fields new capabilities, and commercial technology cycles span mere months, America's military remains trapped in endless document reviews and formatting refinements. Consider this absurdity: When engineers once discovered that the F-35’s combat radius fell short of its validated key performance requirement by just six nautical miles — about one percent — it triggered nearly a year of bureaucratic wrangling. Instead of acknowledging that 584 nautical miles might be perfectly adequate, or rethinking the entire approach, the system doubled down on its initial, arbitrary decree. Hours of senior leader time, including that of the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, evaporated in the pursuit of percentage points that had no inherent strategic significance. This isn't just inefficiency — it's institutional madness. The fundamental flaw lies in JCIDS's delusion of perfect planning. The system imagines an immaculate cascade from high-level needs to engineering specifications, all knowable years in advance. But reality intrudes: Technical constraints, shifting threats, and budget realities collide with these neat theoretical cascades. When they do, instead of adapting, the system demands costly acrobatics to preserve the illusion of perfection. But here's the cruel irony: After climbing this bureaucratic mountain, these documents accomplish nothing. They don't align money. They don't identify program managers for urgent joint needs. They simply accumulate in an ever-expanding pile of validated requirements that don't get published, don't get culled, just accumulate. An unprecedented wave of decorated senior military leaders has promised to fix this system. From General Cartwright's blunt calls for elimination through Admiral Winnefeld's streamlined forums, General Selva's accelerated timelines, General Hyten's software-era rhetoric, and Admiral Grady's top-down pronouncements — each inherited the same unwieldy machine and promised to fix it. Each has been absorbed into its inertia. Congress has finally lost patience. The latest defense bill mandates a clean-sheet redesign of military requirements. But tinkering won't solve this. The entire apparatus needs to go. Remarkably, this is relatively straightforward: One minor revision to Title 10, removing the legal requirement for document validation, coupled with an internal Defense Department memo scaling back the joint requirements oversight council, would suffice. What the Joint Staff calls progress just indicts the system for its futility — broad capstone documents you can drive a truck through and that don't track accountability, alongside a capability portfolio review model that dominates calendars but doesn't move money. Over more than 30 years and twenty major revisions to the joint requirements system — calling it top-down and bottoms-up, changing document names and approval authorities — the Pentagon has failed to ever question whether the idea of rubber-stamping documents could lead to desired its outcomes. The solution isn't more paperwork — it's understanding warfighting outcomes. Rather than prescribing solutions years in advance, the Pentagon should start with clear problem statements of warfighting need, then move to campaigns of experimentation where service systems and new prototypes can be linked together to see what solutions work best. Our recent report explores what this new approach might look like and how it could function. But to make things better, we don’t need to wait for a new system, we can start today. This isn't about making government smaller for its own sake. It's about recognizing that sometimes less really is more. By removing this bureaucratic albatross, we could free up America's brightest officers in joint roles to focus on actual warfighting innovation rather than debating section headers while our adversaries field new capabilities. Abolishing JCIDS can be the first needed step in streamlining Pentagon processes — picking off the low hanging fruit in the monstrosity that is defense acquisition. If Congressional and Pentagon reformers can’t do what it takes to kill such a non-value-added process, they will have no chance in tackling more difficult choices. Let's give JCIDS the funeral it deserves. Our military's future depends on it. William C. Greenwalt is a nonresident senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and a former deputy undersecretary of defense for industrial policy.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/the-pentagons-joint-requirements-process-must-go/	2025-02-26T10:02:05-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/8605018-scaled.jpg
Too soon? GAO questions tech readiness of satellite laser links	SDA's Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture (PWSA) will depend on laser links between satellites and to ground stations to provide high-speed data transport and missile warning, tracking and fire control. (Illustration: Government Accountability Office) WASHINGTON — While the Defense Department is counting on laser links to enable new satellite constellations for rapid communications and missile tracking, the Space Development Agency has yet to prove that the technology is viable, according to a new report by Congress's watchdog agency. SDA 'has taken steps to develop laser communications technology but has not yet fully demonstrated it in space,' finds the GAO report, 'Laser Communications: Space Development Agency Should Create Links Between Development Phases' released today. Thus, GAO recommends that DoD 'fully demonstrate the technology's capabilities before investing further, among other things' — which would require slowing SDA's two-year acquisition cycle to ensure workable laser links can be integrated. The SDA's Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture (PWSA) is a 'mesh network' — defined by the GAO as 'a decentralized type of network that automatically configures and adapts itself to route data most efficiently' — of large constellations of small satellites in low Earth orbit. The two main constellations will provide data transport and missile warning/tracking. Not only is the PWSA the planned backbone of DoD's Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) concept, but it also now has been tagged as a foundational element of President Donald Trump's Iron Dome for America concept of a homeland defense missile shield. Laser communications links between satellites, and then from satellites to ground stations, are the linchpin of the PWSA's mesh network concept. In addition, the Space Force is planning to use optical inter-satellite links for future satellites in medium Earth orbit designed to track hypersonic missiles and vehicles. 'Laser communications could improve capabilities beyond traditional radio frequency communications that DOD has traditionally used, in part, because data can be transmitted faster,' GAO explains. Advantages include 'the ability to transmit at much higher data rates through significantly narrower transmission beams, which enables more secure communication between users.' At the same time, senior SDA officials long have acknowledged that optical inter-satellite links are the long pole in the tent for the PWSA. The GAO report stresses that 'this technology is much more complex' that traditional radio-frequency satellite communications. Obstacles include: stabilizing the laser beam to eliminate 'jitter' that disrupts the signal; pointing, acquisition and tracking with enough precision so that terminals on each end of the communication link can reliable 'speak' to each other; and minimizing atmospheric disturbances in transmitting laser signals from satellites to user platforms on the ground or in the air, according to the report. Due to the technology's complexity, 'the Space Force is working with multiple vendors to develop it,' GAO notes. 'Nevertheless, the number of vendors involved adds further complexity to the overall effort. Among other things, the Space Force will need to ensure that different vendors’ satellite optical communications terminals (OCT), devices used to establish laser data transmission links, are able to communicate with each other,' the report states. And so far, GAO says, SDA's development program has not made discernable progress to demonstrate that these problems can be overcome. 'SDA's demonstration tranche—referred to as Tranche 0 or T0—has faced development challenges and delays and has not fully demonstrated the capabilities expected from it. For example, SDA planned to launch the first T0 satellites in 2022 but launched them in 2023 and 2024. Further, this initial group of satellites has not yet fully demonstrated laser communications technology in space,' the report elaborates. 'Specifically, as of December 2024, SDA reported that one of its four prime contractors in T0 had demonstrated three of the eight planned laser communications capabilities while another contractor had demonstrated one of the eight capabilities. The remaining two contractors have not yet achieved any planned capabilities.' GAO's Feb. 26, 2025 report finds little progress made by SDA vendors on development of optical communications terminals. (Government Accountability Office) Further, GAO asserts, 'SDA has lowered its expectations for T0 but has still faced challenges.' For example, the report said that as of December 2024, SDA contractors have demonstrated two of the planned optical communication terminal capabilities that were planned for Tranche 0 satellites. 'SDA officials said contractors have also achieved a laser link between two satellite vendors, York Space Systems and SpaceX, but both of those companies are using the same OCT developer. This means SDA has yet to demonstrate a link between two OCT vendors in space as originally planned,' the report adds. GAO goes on to criticize SDA for using a development approach 'thus far is inconsistent with the leading practices,' in particular the fact the agency 'is proceeding through tranches and increasing the complexity of its development based on designs that have not yet met initial capabilities. As a result, SDA is at risk of unnecessarily investing in new efforts without yet delivering on promised capabilities intended to support critical missions.' DoD this month provided formal responses to GAO's findings and recommendations, the report says, and 'concurred with our recommendations.' However, 'DOD notes that it believes it is already implementing our recommendations,' GAO says. 'We disagree. The evidence presented throughout our draft and final report supports our view that SDA is not already taking the actions we recommend. We continue to believe SDA would benefit from taking steps aimed at implementing our recommendations.' The GAO report is yet another blow to SDA, which has been embattled by a bid protest by Viasat that, as first reported by Breaking Defense, was the trigger for the Air Force’s Jan. 16 decision to place SDA Director Derek Tournear on administrative leave. That protest has resulted in a requirement for the agency to recompete one of the contracts awarded under that bidding process. Meanwhile, DoD has launched a review of the agency's semi-independent status as an acquisition unit under the Space Force — a move that has resulted in pushback from some members of Congress.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/too-soon-gao-questions-tech-readiness-of-satellite-laser-links/	2025-02-26T09:30:04-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-26-at-12.01.23 PM-e1740589957405.png
Army picks Carnegie, Forterra for autonomous logistics truck prototyping	Oshkosh PLS (Palletized Loader System) trucks equipped with Leader-Follower autonomy systems. (Oshkosh Defense) WASHINGTON — The US Army has quietly selected two companies to develop and test autonomous logistics trucks, with officials hoping to get them into the fleet as soon as 2027 — if budgets allow. Officials from the Army and the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) told Breaking Defense Tuesday that both Carnegie Robotics and Forterra have been selected to move forward with prototyping work on the Autonomous Transport Vehicle System (ATV-S) ahead of a mid-fiscal 2026 decision point that could narrow the field to a single winner. The Army and DIU did not disclose how much funding each team received under the new deals or when those contracts were awarded. In fact, no official announcement was ever made, with the revelation that a downselect was complete only coming to light Tuesday during comments from Army officials, including Maj. Gen Michelle Donahue, the commanding general for the Army’s Combined Arms Support Command/Sustainment Center of Excellence. 'We must optimize the combinations of humans and machines to increase lethality, survivability and agility, while streamlining and reducing and anticipating those logistics burdens,' Donahue said at the National Defense Industrial Association’s tactical wheeled vehicles conference. 'The integration of autonomous systems for resupply, maintenance and energy distribution will be a game changer.' 'We will capitalize on ATV-S autonomous replenishment of critical commodities to extend the division commander's operational reach and his endurance, or her endurance,' Donahue later added. 'We expect our divisional composite truck companies to increase sustained throughput by 50 percent while autonomously navigating varied and unpredictable routes while maintaining continuous movement.' RELATED: Frustrations mount over Army’s Robotic Combat Vehicle autonomy, acquisition approach Getting to this point hasn’t been a direct line for the service. After plowing ahead developing the Expedient Leader Follower (ExLF) for several years — an effort to outfit Oshkosh Defense’s Palletized Load System trucks with autonomy software — in 2023 the service began sunsetting work on that developmental initiative and returning the vehicles back to the fleet without the autonomy packages. The new aim was to find commercial solutions under an acquisition pathway dubbed ATV-S. DIU began supporting that work, in part by standing up the Ground Expeditionary Autonomous Retrofit System (GEARS) project. Then in 2023, DIU selected three teams — Carnegie Robotics, Forterra and Neya Systems — to spend a year developing and testing viable prototypes that could eventually be scaled for mass production. 'We made a lot of headway on this program, really, in the last approximately 18 months, we went from…experimentation, to let's get it onto a program timeline to field to multiple units over time,' Kyle Bruner, the project manager for force projection under Donahue’s command, said on Tuesday. Now with the downselect to two teams, the initiative is officially in phase two with the goal of eventually having PLA A2 heavy expanded mobility tactical trucks (HEMTTs) roll off the production line with a 'digital backbone' ready for the autonomy suites. As for picking a winner to provide that autonomy solution, the Army wants to begin phase two testing later this summer. However, Bruner and Donahue said the stalled FY25 defense bill on Capitol Hill could derail that plan. Since Congress has not yet passed a defense spending bill for this year, the department is operating under a continuing resolution that maintains FY24 spending levels, and that’s a problem for the ATV-S. 'I said 12 to 18 months [for fielding]. It could even be 24 months…if we can't go forth with the final source selection for that capability,' Donahue said. Such a decision would be delayed if the service and DIU do not have funds to test out ATV-S prototypes as planned. That testing roadmap, the duo separately explained, involves using some form of the autonomous trucks at the upcoming Project Convergence capstone event at Ft. Irwin, Calif. next month. Soldiers inside the 3rd Infantry Division at Ft. Stewart in Georgia, will also take their turn with the ATV-S prototypes as part of the upcoming transformation in contact 2.0 push.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/army-picks-carnegie-forterra-for-autonomous-logistics-truck-prototyping/	2025-02-26T08:25:35-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/08/PLS-Autonomy-scaled.jpg
Smaller polygons and cell alerts: How Israel’s Home Front Command honed its civilian alert system	People take cover as sirens sound to warn of incoming rockets, during a funeral ceremony in the northern town of Mitzpe Netofa on November 3, 2024. (Photo by JALAA MAREY/AFP via Getty Images) JERUSALEM — Israel’s warfighting in Gaza and Lebanon may have spawned some technological leaps when it comes to combat operations, but according to an Israeli security official, advances weren’t constrained only to the fighting itself. Israel’s Home Front Command, which is charged with protecting Israeli civilians, also evolved over the course of the year-plus conflicts, honing existing technology and developing new communication techniques to alert the populace to any threats — mostly coming in the form of rocket or drone attacks. 'Our motto is to get the early warning to every citizen in any place in Israel in any time,' the official, who requested their name not be used for security reasons, told Breaking Defense. 'Because of the threats Israel has, it’s the most advanced system in the world.' RELATED: As &#8216;dome' air defense discussions rage, Turkey's Aselsan sees an opening, CEO says The Hamas attack on Oct. 7 and subsequent attacks by that group, as well as by Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen and directly from Iran, tested the alert system to its limits. Six months into the war, the Israel Defense Forces estimated around 12,200 rockets had been fired at Israel from Gaza, Lebanon and other fronts. To better alert civilians to the threats, some of the Home Front Command’s adaptations were a refining of current systems. Israel has relied on a siren alert system in which sirens have been placed throughout the country. The country itself is digitally divided into different polygons. When a projectile appears to be heading towards any particular polygon — after likely being spotted by the same radar system that supports Israel’s multi-layered air defense shield — all the sirens in that polygon are commanded to sound the alarm. But in previous decades the polygons could be quite large, meaning a solitary rocket could send the people of a whole city running for shelters, when the threat was really much more localized. Over time, Home Front Command has managed to be more precise in its predictions, and in its geographical alerts — essentially shrinking the polygons, and therefore the number of civilians who really need to be alerted. Home Front Command also worked to alert individual citizens directly through their cell phones. The first method was with an app developed by the military in recent years that civilians could download that would receive alerts based on the cell phone’s geographical position. But during this war, the command also added a new tactic: issuing alerts directly to relevant phones using cell broadcasts. That system uses existing cell technology but doesn’t have to rely on the user having downloaded the app or having GPS to locate the phone (a good thing, since Israel reportedly jammed some GPS signals near combat zones.) The direct cell broadcast alert was first used during Iran’s second ballistic missile and drone attack on Israel in October 2024, the official said. (Drones also provide a novel problem for an alert system that relies on threats having a predictable trajectory, though the official said vaguely the command has learned lessons from Ukraine's experience fighting Russia to better deal with those.) RELATED: What it was like on the ground during Iran's attack on Israel Beyond cell phones, the official said the Home Front Command has worked to beam alerts directly into Internet of Things devices, like Smart TVs, so that someone watching the TV at home would get a digital alert if they need to run for shelter. Each singular alert systems has its weaknesses — what if a civilian can’t hear the sirens, or doesn’t have the app, or isn’t near their phone, etc. — but the official suggested that the idea is to have a layered alert system that raises the odds of citizens getting at least one warning that they could be in danger. In the future, the official said, Home Front Command could try to beam alerts directly into smart cars, so drivers would be immediately made aware of threats. Cloud computing, the official added, is being evaluated to see if it could offer aid as the program gets more data heavy. 'We always look ahead for new technology and how they can be implemented in our systems and do it even better,' the official said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/smaller-polygons-and-cell-alerts-how-israels-home-front-command-honed-its-civilian-alert-system/	2025-02-26T07:30:31-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/250225_israel_siren_GettyImages-2182009055-e1740508737549.jpg
Space Force: Vive la difference, advises a new AEI policy paper	Space Systems Command headquarters in Los Angeles, Calif., at sunset. (SSC) WASHINGTON — The Space Force should 'embrace its exceptionalism' and push Congress and the Trump administration to allow the service to forge new ways of doing business — from how it buys kit to how it trains Guardians to how it defines its missions, according to a new policy paper from the American Enterprise Institute (AEI). '[T]he Space Force is fundamentally different from the other services, and it should not settle for being bound by the same rules, processes, and constraints,' asserts author Todd Harrison, a senior AEI fellow and long-time military space policy guru. The paper, 'Embracing Space Force Exceptionalism,' is a chapter from AEI's 2025 book, Affording Defense: Investing in American Strength to Confront a More Dangerous World, edited by Mackenzie Eaglen. Urging the Space Force to 'be more aggressive' in breaking the mold set by its sister services, Harrison argues that the newest military service 'is better positioned to take on new missions in a multiple theater force-planning construct.' Such new missions include not only ones necessitated by adversary advances in space power, such as 'offensive and defensive counterspace,' but also 'existing missions that can be better performed from space than from other domains' in heavily contested environments, such as detecting, tracking and targeting enemy forces on the ground. Harrison also posits a fundamental reshaping of the Space Force's organizational structure that would group command units around mission-specific areas such as satellite communications or positioning, navigation and timing. AEI Senior Fellow Todd Harrison is recommending that the Space Force reorganize its command structure around mission areas. ('Embracing Space Force Exceptionalism,' American Enterprise Institute, Feb. 25, 2025) The paper makes seven major recommendations: 'Congress and the White House recognize that the Space Force is different, and the public assumes it is different, but the Space Force itself has not fully accepted its uniqueness. The Space Force is the exceptional service, and Space Force Exceptionalism should be the heart of its culture, values, and vision,' Harrison concludes.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/space-force-vive-la-difference-advises-a-new-aei-policy-paper/	2025-02-26T05:52:45-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/221020_SSC_hq_sunset.png
EXCLUSIVE: Hegseth draft memo lays out software acquisition reform push	US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth visits Joint Task Force North, US Northern Command, to see the efforts military men and women are undertaking in support of US Customs and Border Protection to secure the southern border at Fort Bliss, Texas, Feb. 12, 2025. (US Army/Sgt. 1st Class Andrew R. Sveen) WASHINGTON — Pentagon leaders are crafting a plan to shake up how they buy and field technology, with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth starting things off by potentially directing that the department adopt the Software Acquisition Pathway (SWP) as the preferred method for software development. In a draft memo obtained by Breaking Defense, Hegseth calls on the department to adopt the Software Acquisition Pathway, a practice created in 2020 to accelerate software development by implementing best practices from the private sector. At its core SWP is a streamlined method for procuring software programs bespoke to DoD requirements. Through the SWP organizations can deploy capabilities into platforms within six months or less, DoD has previously stated that the goal is to speed this process up into hours or days. The memo also directs the use of Commercial Solutions Openings and Other Transactions as the 'default solicitation' and award avenue for acquiring capabilities. 'Software is at the core of every weapon and supporting system we field to remain the strongest, most lethal fighting force in the world. While commercial industry has rapidly adjusted to a software- defined product reality, DoD has struggled to reframe our acquisition process from a hardware- centric to a software-centric approach,' the memo reads. (As the memo has not been signed out, it is possible wording could change in the final version of the document.) 'When it comes to software acquisition, we are overdue in pivoting to a performance-based outcome and, as such, it is the Warfighter who pays the price.' Speaking on background, a defense official told Breaking Defense that the department will not comment 'on alleged unsigned draft memos' but did not push back on the contents. 'As a general matter, the department is committed to ensuring our warfighters have cutting-edge digital capabilities,' the official said. 'Through that lens, we are looking at the best methods to accelerate the delivery of scalable, secure digital solutions by leveraging commercial innovation, removing bureaucratic barriers, and prioritizing performance-based outcomes.' Commercial Solutions Openings is a solicitation process developed by the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) that allows the DoD to work with nontraditional defense companies in a more flexible, faster, collaborative manner. Any contracts awarded as a result of this process are handed out as Other Transaction Agreements (OTA). 'This applies to any software pathway program in the planning phase prior to execution. Department Components are prohibited from implementing further guidance on this point that would set out restrictive measures, guidelines, frameworks, directives, or policies other than required by statute,' the memo states. Furthermore, the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, alongside the DIU director, have to develop and submit an implementation plan on how to best utilize these practices within 30 calendar days of the memo being signed. The memo is expected to kickstart a process aimed at getting new technologies and weapons into the field at a faster clip, which is emerging as a focus for the Trump Pentagon, as Breaking Defense previously reported. Related: DoD acquisition reform guidance expected soon, with focus on rapid prototyping There has also been speculation, including in a Defense One article earlier this month, on how the new Trump administration may restructure offices, to include possibly combining pieces of the Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office, DIU and Strategic Capabilities Office. (It may be notable that DIU is called out in the memo, potentially as a sign that the organization's approach and use of OTAs will have greater usage as the Pentagon seeks to increase ties to the commercial sector.) However, the defense official cautioned that it is still early days of 'pie in the sky brainstorming sessions' designed to explore a variety of options to make the Pentagon 'more effective and efficient.' 'I strongly caution against buying into one rumor of how this could go at this point,' the defense official previously told Breaking Defense. 'Each of the organizations, like DIU, have strengths that would only make sense to build on.' Earlier this month, one source that works closely with a broad swath of defense companies described this look at acquisition as par for the course anytime a new secretary enters the Pentagon. 'With all new administrations, there is a pretty much ‘stop, relook and clarify priorities period,’' the source said. 'And right now there is a sense of urgency with acquisition reform.' Many of the non-traditional tech companies, the source added, are ecstatic with the 'rumored frenzy' of acquisition change. That could potentially include revamping the DIU and funneling more work its way, with companies who focus on software, autonomous systems and capabilities that do not rely on GPS, given the ever-increasing threats from electronic warfare, hoping to cash in. 'They don’t need to recreate the wheel, [but they] need strong leadership with a determined focus,' the source added, referring to the DoD.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/exclusive-hegseth-draft-memo-lays-out-software-acquisition-reform-push/	2025-02-25T12:41:00-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/8855959-e1740511956929.jpg
Nominee for Pentagon No. 2: ‘Plug’ shortages, kill legacy programs to ‘defeat’ China	Nominee for Deputy Secretary of Defense Stephen A. Feinberg listens to the opening remarks of a Senate Armed Services Committee in Washington, D.C., Feb. 25, 2025. (DoD photo by U.S. Air Force Senior Airman Madelyn Keech) WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump’s nominee for the Pentagon’s No. 2 job indicated his willingness to chop legacy programs and called for the department to more closely align itself with the private sector during his confirmation hearing today. If confirmed as deputy defense secretary, billionaire investor Stephen Feinberg said he would bring his private equity chops to work at the Pentagon, driving greater efficiency and financial accountability, improving the defense acquisition process by increasing competition, and working to ensure the US military has the cutting edge technology it needs. He listed shipbuilding, aircraft development, nuclear modernization, cyber defense, hypersonics, counterspace capabilities and counter-drone platforms as key technology 'shortages' needed to beat China, which he called the biggest and most challenging threat the United States. 'China is the first nation we’ve ever competed with that has both a great economy and a great military. China’s entire private sector is fully committed in supporting that military development and as such, they effectively have unlimited funding,' he said during his opening comments in front of the Senate Armed Services Committee. 'Not meaning to be too negative, but we really need to plug these shortages, focus on our priorities, get rid of legacy programs, be very disciplined, and while at the same time focusing on the economics.' 'If we do that, given America’s great innovative capability and entrepreneurship, we will defeat China,' he said. Feinberg is the co-founder and CEO of Cerberus Capital Management, a private equity firm whose holdings have included defense companies such as hypersonic testing firm Stratolaunch and which has a 70 percent stake in tactical wheeled vehicle maker Navistar Defense, according to Cerberus's website and news reports. Feinberg has not previously held a position in government, but during Trump's last administration he headed the President’s Intelligence Advisory Board, which gives private citizens access to classified information so they can assess how the Intelligence Community goes about its normally cloistered business. Trump tapped Feinberg for the deputy defense secretary job in late December, calling him 'an extremely successful businessman.' Typically, the deputy is a largely managerial position, overseeing matters related to the Pentagon’s budget, workforce and its overall bureaucracy — thus leaving the defense secretary free to focus on overarching strategy, policy and political matters. 'There is great opportunity to improve our cost structure, our efficiency, our operations, to really save a lot of money that could be plowed into mission. We do not have great financial accountability, financial metrics or systems — [there's an] awful lot of low hanging fruit there,' Feinberg said. 'This is in my wheelhouse, hopefully. I spent a career helping organizations improve and after doing it so many years, I certainly made sincere mistakes, but … I think I can add some value there.' The Pentagon could improve its supply chain by 'working more closely with our private sector,' specifically by better understanding what drives their leadership boards or how they respond to shareholder pressure, Feinberg said. At a different point in the hearing, he said that the current acquisition system favors legacy defense contractors by incorporating 'gold-plated' technical requirements and rigid regulations that holds commercial companies and nontraditional vendors back. '[There’s] a lot we can do by getting into the program detail, line by line. My view is the deputy has to go program by program, line by line, not hand it off to somebody,' he said. Throughout the hearing, Democrats interrogated Feinberg about a recently announced 8 percent spending cut — which Feinberg said would be reinvested inside the Pentagon to fund top spending priorities — as well as plans to the reduce Pentagon’s workforce by at least 5 to 8 percent. 'Over the weekend, [Defense] Secretary [Pete Hegseth] announced that 5,400 probationary employees would be dismissed, and it apparently was not done with any analysis, it was just preemptive,' said Sen. Jack Reed, the committee’s top Democrat. 'You run companies. Have you ever walked in and fired thousands of people without any analysis for the costs or benefits?' To this question, and other similar ones from other lawmakers, Feinberg stated that layoffs were necessary when restructuring an organization to become more effective. 'Every person is significant, and these cuts are always hard. But I believe that most of the cuts that we will see will be from people that want to retire, people who would like to resign early,' he said. 'There’s obviously over 900,000 civilians in the in DoD so while you can never, you know, not take one person seriously in these kinds of reorganizations, there's always turnover. And without some turnover, you can't become an efficient organization.' Feinberg offered few specifics about any plans for individual weapons programs. After Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb., pressed the nominee on whether the nuclear deterrent was the Defense Department’s 'highest priority mission,' Feinberg offered that 'it might be,' but added that he wanted to receive classified briefings before answering that more directly. He later said that 'there's nothing that could be more important than our nuclear modernization,' but noted that 'we also need hypersonics.' And when about whether the US Air Force needs a sixth-generation fighter by Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., Feinberg said it was a 'controversial issue' and that he would offer his best advice to Hegseth — or even Trump, should the president get involved in the potential acquisition. Last week, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., laid out concerns about Feinberg’s business dealings and financial interests in a 23-page letter sent on Feb. 17, which stated that his Cerberus holdings could pose a conflict of interest if not properly divested. (Warren did not ask Feinberg about this issue during the nomination hearing, instead pressing him on Cerberus’s ownership of several hospitals in her home state.) 'I have serious concerns about your qualifications and ability to take on the responsibilities of the role. You have serious conflicts of interest, with holdings in seven companies that do nearly $16 billion in business with the Defense Department,' she wrote in the letter. 'As the Deputy Secretary of Defense, you will have to look out for what is best for the Department and the nation, not private backers, shareholders, or companies in your portfolio,' Warren said later in the letter. In ethics documents submitted on Feb. 18, Feinberg said he would 'divest all of my interests in Cerberus including, but not limited to, my equity interest, carried interest, incentive fees/allocations, and capital commitments' prior to assuming the role of the deputy secretary of defense.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/nominee-for-pentagon-no-2-plug-shortages-kill-legacy-programs-to-defeat-china/	2025-02-25T11:23:20-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/250225_feinberg_testimony_8885249-scaled-e1740510119294.jpg

Senate approves Daniel Driscoll as 26th Army secretary	Daniel Driscoll, U.S. President Donald Trump's nominee to be secretary of the U.S. Army, speaks during a Senate Armed Services confirmation hearing on Capitol Hill on January 30, 2025 in Washington, DC. Driscoll was questioned on a range of topics including Army retention rate. (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) WASHINGTON — The US Army is poised to get a new civilian leader after the Senate today approved Daniel Driscoll as the service’s 26th secretary. Confirmed on a 66-28 vote, Driscoll’s nomination was publicly viewed as less controversial than others put forward by President Donald Trump. It wasn’t immediately clear today when Driscoll would be sworn into office and officially take over the role as Army secretary. He will be greeted, though, with a service in the throes of modernizing its weapon portfolio, ramping up the defense industrial base and grappling with recruiting. The entire Pentagon is also working through a variety of changes and exercises ranging from each service identifying 8 percent of planned fiscal 2026 funding that can be redirected for other priorities to looming civilian cuts. Driscoll — relatively unknown before his nomination, with a limited social media presence — previously served as an advisor to now-Vice President JD Vance, is a graduate of Yale Law School, a former Army soldier, and has spent time working in the private equity arena. During his Senate Armed Services Committee hearing late last month, he seemingly garnered support from both sides of the aisle. In a bit of a rarity for Washington, he received a bipartisan show of support with Sens Markwayne Mullen, R-Okla., and Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., both introducing him to the panel during the start of the hearing. 'I spoke to Dan a number of times in the course of his preparing for his appearance here today, and those conversations convinced me that he is willing to work on the basis of collegiality, to be transparent and open with this panel with the Congress and our colleagues,' Blumenthal said during his introduction. Sen. Jack Reed, D-RI., the committee's top Democrat, also seemingly threw his support behind Driscoll, saying he brings 'integrity, intelligence and the experience of the young officer leading soldiers.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/senate-approves-daniel-driscoll-as-26th-army-secretary/	2025-02-25T10:02:09-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/daniel-driscoll-scaled-e1740506487433.jpg
President Trump must use every tool to speed up arms for Israel	Maj. Allyn Swavely, a participant in the Senior Officer Orientation course, helps guide the body of a MK-84 onto the Munitions Assembly Conveyor at Beale Air Force Base, California, Aug. 30, 2017. Bombs built by munitions Airmen can range in weight up to approximately 2,000 lbs and have multiple configurations depending on operational demands. (U.S. Air Force photo/Senior Airman Justin Parsons) A shipment of 1,800 MK-84 2,000-pound bombs arrived in Israel on Feb. 16, several weeks after President Donald Trump announced the end of a months-long freeze of critical US weapons deliveries to Israel. But there are still more weapons that Israel needs stuck in US bureaucratic processes. To fulfill his promise that these weapons 'are now on their way,' Trump should use his emergency authority to push past remaining roadblocks. Despite Trump removing the Biden administration’s ban on delivering MK-84 bombs, numerous other transfers remain stuck, including MK-83 1,000-pound bombs, MK-82 500-pound bombs, Hellfire missiles, and tank and mortar shells. JINSA’s Mike Makovsky and Blaise Misztal revealed in November that the Biden administration had been slow walking these weapons, as well as armored bulldozers that the Trump administration has now started to deliver. Such hindrances in arms deliveries, whatever their cause, only increase risk to Israel, the Middle East, and the United States. Now, with Iran accelerating its nuclear program and its proxies threatening to abandon the fragile ceasefires in Lebanon and Gaza, Tehran could see any further delays as opportunities to exploit. Conversely, rapidly arming Israel, by both providing vital capabilities and signaling US commitment, is critical to deterring and defeating Iran-backed aggression. Yet, beyond delays within the Biden administration, Congress has also put up roadblocks. In January, President Joe Biden alerted Congress that he planned to send $8 billion of weapons to Israel, including Small Diameter Bombs (SDB), Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) Guidance Kits, 500-pound bombs, AMRAAM and Hellfire missiles, and 155mm artillery rounds. However, Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-NY), the ranking member of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, put a hold on packages. His hold could have held up the weapons indefinitely because of the specific process the Biden administration used to notify Congress about the sale. The Arms Export Control Act (AECA) requires the State Department to publicly notify the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and House Foreign Affairs Committee before selling weapons to a foreign partner, at least 30 days for most countries or 15 days for close partners like Israel. But there is also another, informal process known as 'tiered review' that the State Department has been using since 2012. Under tiered review, State alerts the relevant committees that it plans to submit formal notification of a weapons sale within 40 days. It then waits to receive approval from all four of the committee leaders before actually making the notification. By withholding his approval, Meeks effectively put a hold on Biden’s January arm package, just as he had with other, similar shipments, some dating back to October of last year. While there is no legal requirement to honor such holds, the State Department usually does and did so in this case. To rectify this situation, the Trump administration notified Congress on February 7 that it will skip tiered review for new packages — avoiding any further holds — that advance $8.4 billion of weapons for Israel to formal review, starting the clock for Congress to take action. As part of the overall sale, the State Department approved a $6.75 billion foreign military sale (FMS) deal for thousands of SDBs, MK-82s, JDAMs, and fuzes. A separate FMS covers an estimated $660 million of Hellfire Missiles. In addition, the Pentagon announced a direct commercial sale of artillery shells. If legislators want to prevent these sales, they will have to pass a resolution blocking them. No such efforts have ever succeeded. A resolution from Rep. Meeks in January 2021 sought to block the transfer of SDBs to Saudi Arabia, and the Senate overwhelmingly rejected resolutions from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) in November 2024 that tried to block selling tank and mortar rounds and JDAM kits to Israel. There is an even faster way to move weapons to countries that urgently need them, as Israel currently does. The AECA also allows the president to waive the notification period if he verifies that 'an emergency exists,' allowing the immediate delivery of the weapons. Republican and Democratic presidents, including Trump, have used this authority. In May 2019, the Trump administration invoked the waiver to push through 22 pending arms transfers to Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. The Biden administration used waivers to send weapons quickly to Ukraine in April 2022, in April and May 2024, and to sell Israel artillery rounds and other equipment in December 2023. Israel is still waiting on multiple weapons, not just 2,000-pound bombs, delayed by the Biden administration. Trump should force his State and Defense departments to advance any remaining stuck items and submit an emergency waiver to immediately deliver backlogged weapons to Israel. After months of delays, the United States should provide Israel with the weapons it needs as soon as possible. Blaise Misztal and Ari Cicurel are the vice president for policy and associate director of foreign policy, respectively, at the Jewish Institute for National Security of America (JINSA).	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/president-trump-must-use-every-tool-to-speed-up-arms-for-israel/	2025-02-25T09:51:32-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/3797111-scaled-e1740426693313.jpg
Russian ‘menace’ prompts UK defense spending uplift to 2.5 percent GDP by 2027	F-35B fighter jets from the UK Carrier Strike Group launch from the HMS Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier to undertake sorties under NATO command in the Atlantic (UK MoD) BELFAST — In a bid to counter Russia’s 'menace,' UK Prime Minister Kier Starmer announced today that British defense spending will be increased to 2.5 percent GDP by 2027. Addressing lawmakers, Starmer also pledged to raise the bar further by committing to a 3 percent GDP target by 2034. Britain currently spends around 2.3 percent GDP on its military. The new spending plan, funded by foreign aid cuts, marks the 'biggest sustained increase in defense spending since the end of the Cold War,' according to Starmer. In simple terms, London will spend an additional £13.4 billon ($17 billion) annually on defense from 2027. At a strategic level, Starmer said that 'we must stand with Ukraine' because if a 'lasting peace' is not secured, then economic problems and security threats 'will only grow.' He was also clear eyed about Russia's continued threat. 'Russia is a menace in our waters, in our airspace and on our streets,' Starmer commented. 'They have launched cyberattacks on our NHS [National Health Service]. Only seven years ago, [carried out] a chemical weapons attack on the streets of Salisbury [England].' Though he did not share how the new funding will be spent, the announcement comes just days before Starmer visits US President Donald Trump in Washington, and appears to be carefully timed to demonstrate the UK is leaning forward to meet Trump’s demand that Europe does more to protect its own security. Starmer had long planned to put forward a 'path' to spending 2.5 percent GDP on defense in the spring. The UK is the third European country to announce new modernization or spending increases, behind France and Denmark, since Trump pivoted toward Russia by labelling Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky a 'dictator' and forecasting that 'he is not going to have a country left.' Amid transatlantic security relations plagued by disharmony, Starmer pleaded for differences to be set aside. 'We must reject any false choice between our allies, between one side of the Atlantic or the other,' he said. 'That is against our history, country and party, because it’s against our national interest. The US is our most important bilateral alliance. It straddles everything from nuclear technology to NATO to Five Eyes [intelligence sharing pact] AUKUS and beyond.' Such a resounding endorsement of the so-called UK-US 'special relationship' differs, however, with a political reality that has seen Washington exclude Europe and Ukraine from peace talks with Russia. At odds with the US position on peace negotiations, Starmer said 'we must ensure' Ukraine negotiates 'their future.' Other issues between the UK and the US remain outstanding. UK Defence Secretary John Healey said last week that a security 'backstop' linked to a peace settlement is required because 'only the US' is capable enough of stopping Russia from launching another attack on Europe. Starmer is expected to raise the backstop idea with Trump directly this week. The British leader has also said he is prepared to deploy UK troops to Ukraine as part of a peacekeeping force, should a peace agreement be struck. 'This week, when I meet President Trump, I will be clear I want this relationship to go from strength to strength, but … strength in this world also depends on a new alliance with Europe,' said Starmer. He added that European nations will 'find new ways to work together on our collective interests and threats, protecting our borders, bringing out companies together, seeking out new opportunities for growth.' Echoing Trump's messaging, Starmer said, 'European allies must step up and do more for our own defense.' Kevin Craven, CEO of ADS Group, a UK aerospace and defense trade body that represents over 1,400 prime manufacturers, subsystem suppliers and small- and medium-sized enterprises, told Breaking Defense in a statement that the 2.5 percent spending announcement 'does deliver on the long-term demand indication that allows us to do what we do best: deliver capabilities that are needed to uphold our security, in a way that delivers value for money to the citizens we are here to protect. This clear signal from Government today is very welcome.' The UK is expected to publish a strategic defense review in the coming months, which will focus on strategic priorities and equipment planning, but it faces financial difficulties arising from a £16.9 billion deficit between weapons requirements and its military budget, as revealed in a MoD 10 year equipment plan [PDF].	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/russian-menace-prompts-uk-defense-spending-uplift-to-2-5-percent-gdp-by-2027/	2025-02-25T09:19:14-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/FLEET-20231105-XN0184-136.jpg.iCexsZ_kMWATAA.lYYOVfIex0-e1719261083813.jpg
Space Force team mapping service’s contributions to Iron Dome missile shield	Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman delivers a keynote address on the state of the Space Force during the Air and Space Forces Association 2024 Warfare Symposium in Aurora, Colo., Feb. 13, 2024. (US Air Force photo by Eric Dietrich) WASHINGTON — The Space Force has set up a 'technical integrated planning team,' or IPT, to put together a picture of its current and potential future contributions to the Trump administration's Iron Dome for America missile shield, Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman said today. 'I think we have a central role to play,' he told a small group of reporters. 'We are leaning forward establishing this technical IPT to try to pull together all of the systems and start thinking about it from an overarching perspective.' The Space Force already is responsible for missile warning and tracking, currently operating the Space Based Infrared System satellites, and developing their replacements under the multibillion-dollar Next Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared (Next-Gen OPIR) program. The service also has two new programs aimed specifically at tracking hypersonic missiles underway: the Resilient Missile Warning/Missile Tracking — Medium Earth Orbit program being managed by Space Systems Command and the Space Development Agency's Tracking Layer constellation that is part of its overarching Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture (PWSA). Pursuit of the PWSA is specifically called for in President Donald Trump's Jan. 27 executive order laying out his priorities for the Iron Dome for America concept. Pentagon development and deployment of 'proliferated space-based interceptors capable of boost-phase intercept' also is mandated in Trump's executive order. That, however, has not been something on the Space Force's agenda until now. The order gave Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth 60 days to develop the plan to defend the homeland against 'ballistic, hypersonic, advanced cruise missiles, and other next-generation aerial attacks from peer, near-peer, and rogue adversaries.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/space-force-team-mapping-services-contributions-to-iron-dome-missile-shield/	2025-02-24T14:53:21-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/240717_DVIDS_saltzman_speech_8238081-scaled-e1721238990255.jpg
Leonardo DRS to expand new sub facility with $45M investment from HII	USS Greeneville (SSN 772) enters Diego Garcia’s harbor Aug. 21, 2020. (US Navy Photos by Mass Communication Specialist Seaman Michael T. Porterfield.) WASHINGTON — Leonardo DRS plans to expand its new South Carolina naval propulsion manufacturing facility through a $45 million infusion from HII’s Newport News Shipbuilding, Leonardo announced today. 'The investment is expected to expand the capabilities of DRS’s new, 140,000 square-foot naval propulsion manufacturing facility currently under-construction in Goose Creek, SC, and includes capital equipment and other infrastructure enhancements,' according to a company statement. 'The $45 million [submarine industrial base] investment will serve as a catalyst for a 40,000 square-foot expansion of the facility in support of capabilities critical to current and future U.S. Navy nuclear submarines and aircraft carriers.' The facility in Goose Creek, S.C., is also proximal to W International, a metal fabricator which was recently acquired by HII to bolster its own submarine manufacturing space. HII is one of two prime contractors for the US Navy’s submarine programs. 'This significant investment is the result of extensive collaboration between Leonardo DRS, the U.S. Navy, and our shipbuilding customers,' said Jon Miller, senior vice president and general manager of the Leonardo DRS Naval Power Systems. 'It signifies the depth of our combined resolve to address some of the most pressing challenges facing our nation’s submarine industrial base with respect to capacity needed to deliver critical capability on-time and on-budget for the warfighter.' Leonardo’s new facility is slated to open in 2026. The company is currently producing Columbia-class electric propulsion system components, including the main propulsion motor, the main propulsion drives and main propulsion controller. Separately, General Atomics Electromagnetic Systems announced today that General Dynamics Electric Boat, the Navy’s other submarine prime contractor, awarded it a contract to fabricate and deliver three shipsets of Virginia Payload Tubes for Block VI submarines. GA-EMS is scheduled to deliver the shipsets, each of which include two payload tubes, by the end of 2030. 'This contract follows a 2023 contract award for a single VPT shipset that qualified GA-EMS as a viable supplier with proven manufacturing capability to fabricate and deliver complex, safety-critical components for use on Navy submarines,' said Scott Forney, president of GA-EMS. 'We are excited to continue working with Electric Boat to apply our world-class fabrication and precision machining capabilities, experienced program management, and engineering and quality assurance expertise to help ensure the VPTs are available on time to support an aggressive Virginia-class build schedule.' A company statement did not disclose a dollar amount associated with the deal.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/leonardo-drs-to-expand-new-sub-facility-with-45m-investment-from-hii/	2025-02-24T13:00:14-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/09/6327059-Virginia-class-sub-scaled-e1631834346549.jpg
UAE’s defense giant EDGE Group inks $2.9B in deals at IDEX 2025	Emirate conglomerate EDGE Group had perhaps the largest exhibit of any company at IDEX 2025. (Agnes Helou / Breaking Defense) IDEX 2025 — Emirati defense conglomerate EDGE Group wrapped up an Abu Dhabi defense expo with just under $3 billion in new deals, most signed with the United Arab Emirates. The firm said in a statement on Friday that it signed 16 contracts, launched 46 'solutions,' and inked 32 strategic international agreements at this edition of International Defense Exhibition and Conference (IDEX) 2025. Among the largest contracts, at $1.2 billion, was with the UAE's Ministry of Defense for aerial munitions. Another deal, worth $524 million, was signed between the UAE's navy and EDGE subsidiary Maestral for in service support. 'This has been a very busy week for EDGE, and the support of our main customer and solid commitments and interest from international customers and partners, highlights the tremendous success we continue to enjoy,' said Hamad Al Marar, EDGE Group Managing Director and CEO, in the statement. He added that the firm looks forward to the next edition of IDEX in 2027, 'where I am confident EDGE will once again surprise the industry with the huge achievements few considered possible five years ago' when EDGE was founded. During the show, EDGE displayed dozens of platforms in an expansive, central exhibit, from large armored vehicles to UAVs to unmanned ground vehicles, to aerial munitions and small arms. 'While EDGE signed business partnerships to consolidate domestic industrial capabilities in the naval, land, and air sectors, the largest volume of deals revolved around the automation domain,' Leonardo Jacopo Maria Mazzucco, an analyst at Gulf State Analytics, told Breaking Defense. For instance, EDGE has launched new armored and robotic vehicle at the show dubbed HAVOC RCV and also has signed a contract to integrate MILSAR radars from Turkish Meteksan Defence on its unmanned aerial system Garmoosha. The firm has also teamed up with US-based GM Defense and integrated its drone launcher on GM Defense's light tactical vehicle. American contractor GM Defense and Emirati defense conglomerate EDGE Group have announced a new agreement to explore 'light tactical vehicle'-focused projects, in a move that came as the two firms put on display what one such team-up could look like: a G ride boasting an EDGE drone launcher. He added that 'the significant number of agreements signed by EDGE with international weapon manufacturers speaks volumes about the Emirati company’s 360-degree business expansion strategy, securing a strong foothold in the West and Asian defense markets alike.' EDGE Group signed a large number of agreements to codevelop defense platforms including among others, a memorandum of understanding with Turkish FNSS to update UAE’s armed forces infantry fighting vehicles, a strategic partnership with German HENSOLDT to cooperate in naval technologies and with Brazilian SIATT to supply Brazilian Navy with MANSUP anti-ship missiles. 'For EDGE, the rapid operationalization of business partnerships is vital to the company’s quest to build human capital, strengthen domestic know-how, and generate revenues from sales,' Mazzucco said. ​In his opinion Albert Vidal, a research analyst for the London-based thinktank IISS, said that what really deserves attention are 'the products that EDGE unveiled, the partnerships announced, and the display of the work done by Advanced Concepts, the Electro-Optics Center of Excellence, and the Radar &amp; EW center.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/uaes-defense-giant-edge-group-inks-2-9b-in-deals-at-idex-2025/	2025-02-24T11:11:26-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/img_5477-scaled-e1739816889511.jpg
France accelerates rearmament plan, eyes more Rafale fighters and frigates	A French Air Force Rafale F3R fighter jet on display at the Dubai Airshow 2023 (Breaking Defense) BELFAST — France's defense minister has called for Europe to 'accelerate our rearmament,' and Paris is speeding in that direction with new plans to acquire up to 30 additional Rafale fighter jets, three more frigates, and more drone and electronic warfare (EW) platforms. Through a series of posts on X, published Sunday alongside an interview with Le Parisien, Lecornu said the rearmament push was driven by a need to defend French and Ukrainian 'collective security.' The French action arrives amid a decisive shift in US foreign policy that demands Europe takes more ownership for its defense and has witnessed a firm pivot toward Russia, led by President Donald Trump. France is the second country on the continent, behind Denmark, to signal a renewed focus on modernization in the wake of Trump labelling Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky a 'dictator.' Lecornu did not mention the US or the Trump administration’s stance on European security relations or war in Ukraine specifically but vowed that French military manufacturers 'must join forces with Ukrainian companies to produce locally and massively what the Ukrainians will need.' Strengthening such industrial co-operation is in France’s economic interest, added Lecornu. The move also comes as French President Emmanuel Macron held a meeting with Trump in Washington today, which including participating in a G7 call from the Oval Office. Ahead of the trip Macron said that he would explain to Trump that a Russian victory over Ukraine would be 'a huge strategic mistake,' according to Politico. For three years, Ukraine has been fighting with admirable courage against an aggressor—Russia. For sovereignty and freedom. Our support for Ukraine will remain unwavering. I am in Washington to reaffirm this and to move forward with President @realDonaldTrump and our allies. pic.twitter.com/ZUehOczJhM &mdash; Emmanuel Macron (@EmmanuelMacron) February 24, 2025 In lieu of France facing 'threats over time and in potentially multiple theatres' Lecornu disclosed that Paris intends on acquiring between 20 to 30 additional Dassault Rafale fourth generation fighter jets, raising its frigate fleet from 15 to 18 ships and vowed to speed up the pace of drone and EW procurements. He did not share the exact type of aircraft or electronic systems in question or any costs involved. As Breaking Defense previously reported, France has placed an order for 42 Rafale aircraft, under a tranche five procurement plan, in a deal worth over €5 billion ($5.5 billion) that will see deliveries run between 2027 to 2032. In all, it has ordered 234 of the twin-engine platforms. In terms of maritime modernization, the French Navy already expects five Naval Group made FDI frigates to enter service by 2030. The first-in-class Amiral Ronarc'h is set for delivery this year, according to the shipbuilder. Financing of the new rearmament plan will depend on 'political and budgetary choices' with a war finance meeting, led by Lecornu and Eric Lombard, France’s economy minister, scheduled to take place on March 20. Industry and private investors will also participate in the event. Looking at new ways of raising funding for rearmament, Lecornu said that, 'we are also considering offering French people who wish to do so the opportunity to mobilize their savings to support the national effort.' He did not elaborate on how such a scheme would work but it could amount to a type of defense bonds initiative.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/france-accelerates-rearmament-plan-eyes-more-rafale-fighters-and-frigates/	2025-02-24T09:16:09-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/11/French-Air-Force-Rafale-F3R-fighter-jet-e1699908112769.jpg
New plug-and-play AI can protect pilots of non-stealth planes: Raytheon	Raytheon's AI-enhanced Radar Warning Receiver was flight-tested on an Air National Guard F-16 fighter, similar to this Arizona Air Guard jet. (Air Force file photo) WASHINGTON — One of the largest defense companies on the planet just unveiled a small upgrade that could make a big difference in the survival rates of US aircrews. And by deploying an AI device powerful enough to be militarily useful, yet small enough to be retrofitted on a fighter jet, Raytheon’s new Cognitive Algorithm Deployment System (CADS) is a major step towards a long-sought holy grail of 'cognitive electronic warfare.' The problem CADS helps to solve is a growing one: Adversaries like Russia increasingly employ — and export — reprogrammable digital radars that can rapidly reconfigure the signals they use to locate, track and shoot down airplanes. Those rapid changes, in turn, can confound Western radar-warning systems, which work by comparing each signal they pick up to a pre-loaded database of known threats. Raytheon is fighting back by upgrading its warning systems with AI, allowing them to analyze and identify the danger in real time — and, with a little luck, alert the pilot before it’s too late to evade. By exploiting ever-more miniaturized hardware and streamlined software, Raytheon’s CADS can run radar-analyzing algorithms on an electronics module compact enough to slot into the company’s existing ALR-69A Radar Warning Receiver (RWR). Over 600 of those RWRs are already widely used on older, legacy aircraft in both US and foreign service, ranging from the C-130 turboprop transport to the massive KC-46 tanker to the F-16 jet fighter. Such fourth-generation planes lack the stealth, sensors, and computing power of the fifth-generation F-35. (The full electronic-warfare capabilities of the F-35 are highly classified and subject to much speculation). So adding CADS could be an easy defensive upgrade to an increasingly vulnerable fourth-gen fleet. 'It’s a digital RWR that’s very flexible,' said Michael Baladjanian, Raytheon’s vice president of electronic warfare systems. 'It can go on any kind of F-16,' he said, for example, or any number of other aircraft. Specifically, the ALR-69A consists of four sensors installed around the aircraft being protected — the exact configuration depends on the type of plane — and a central processor housed in the fuselage. That processor is built with space for future upgrades, so Baladjanian’s team designed the CADS module to slot right in, without any modifications required to the ALR-69A itself. 'I didn’t have to redesign the actual 69A,' he said. 'I just had to put the card in.' It’s also easy to upgrade the CADS module itself, Baladjanian continued: 'The really cool part about it, is it's able to hold third-party apps.' That’s because CADS is built using an 'open architecture' meant to accommodate new software packages from different vendors, not just Raytheon, as long as they comply with certain technical standards. (The details of those standards, unlike on most 'open source' projects, are classified). Raytheon and the Air National Guard have already flight-tested an ALR-69A upgraded with CADS running three different radar-analyzing algorithms, he said. One was developed by Raytheon, albeit a different division from Baladjanian’s; one came from Georgia Tech, a frequent partner of the Pentagon; and a third came from a small firm called Vadum (a spinoff from the University of North Carolina). 'We were able to very easily take all three algorithms and … integrate them in our lab, in less than a day,' Baladjanian said. Then Raytheon flew the CADS ALR-69A on its own test aircraft, followed by a flight on an Air Guard F-16. 'Flight testing will continue through this year,' he added. The company and the Air Force are still negotiating any purchase of CADS, so it’s too early to know numbers, pricing, or schedule, especially with the Pentagon budget facing uncertainty. But Baladjanian already has his eye on further advances. Adding more and better algorithms to the CADS digital toolkit is the obvious first step, he told Breaking Defense. But in the not-too-distant future, he envisions expanding the AI’s capabilities from passively identifying radar signals to actively countering them. He’s 'looking at electronic attack,' he said. Such AI-controlled jamming is something technologists and tacticians have sought for years. Known in the trade as cognitive electronic warfare, it’s seen as a way to untether EW from slow-moving, ground-based analysis. In the traditional process, intelligence centers issue a Mission Data File of known threats, which aircraft must load before taking off. Then, if they encounter an unfamiliar signal, they can only collect the data, not act on it; and on landing, they must send it off to the intel hub to analyze and come up with countermeasures — a process that takes hours, days, or even months. By contrast, an aircraft with onboard AI could analyze the unfamiliar signal in near-real-time and generate custom countermeasures in mid-flight. What Raytheon’s rolling out is not that complete capability, not yet. But it’s a big step towards it.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/new-plug-and-play-ai-can-protect-pilots-of-non-stealth-planes-raytheon/	2025-02-24T06:00:57-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/AZ-ANG-F-16-080331-F-0000X-0005-scaled-e1740163594442.jpeg
With UAVs, air defenses and a full-sized, modified tank, Russian firms make splash inside IDEX 2025	A Russian tank on display at IDEX 2025. (Agnes Helou / Breaking Defense) IDEX 2025 — Two years after being relegated to a separate pavilion at the International Defense Exhibition and Conference (IDEX) in Abu Dhabi, Russian defense companies were back inside the conference center for this edition, where they took the opportunity to show off their wares — including several systems informed by their experience in the conflict in Ukraine. A full-sized main battle tank was on display, equipped with what appeared to be significant modifications like a metal cage, layers of chains, reinforced rubber shields and a green leather-like cover low on the tank intended to reduce the vehicle's heat and radar signature. 'This configuration of the T-90MS Main Battle Tank is the latest one. It features multiple protection against almost any threat, rocket propelled grenades, anti-tank guided missiles with high scores of anti-tank warheads, including those of tandem structure, unmanned aerial vehicles [and] first-person-view drones,' a RosoboronExport official told Breaking Defense at the show last week. The official declined to say whether that particular tank had participated in the battlefield in Ukraine, but said that it is fully operational. One of the reasons the government-owned organization decided to ship and display a tank of this size and other equipment at IDEX in Abu Dhabi, particularly, he said, was to 'demonstrate to the whole world the effectiveness and power of the Russian military hardware and the approaches of our experts.' At the last edition of IDEX, which took place in early 2023 and just a few months after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Russian companies were not listed as official exhibitors. Instead they were grouped together in an outdoor pavilion — one that happened to be just yards away from a US Army tent. This year several Ukrainian defense firms were also present at IDEX, all just steps away from Russian firms. (Ukrainian industry officials at the show were not immediately available for comment at IDEX; Breaking Defense has requested follow-up interviews.) RELATED: Russians playing with Javelins: US Army, Russia display weapons yard apart in the desert Such is the nature of international defense shows in general, but the welcoming back of the Russian firms inside IDEX this year coincided with Gulf nations playing a key neutral, diplomatic role on the world stage as well. While IDEX was going on, Saudi Arabia hosted talks between the US and Russia concerning the fate of the war in Ukraine, and the United Arab Emirates hosted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Elsewhere in the Russian floor space Kalashnikov displayed its Kub-10E loitering munition on its stand, just next to High Precision Complexes Holding's Pantsir-SMD-E air defense system, which itself sat next to other launchers. Unmanned Systems Group displayed its 'combat-tested' Supercam S350 UAV with Vertical Take-off and Landing capabilities. Another Russian firm, The Ural Works of Civil Aviation, debuted internationally the export version of what it also called its 'combat tested' Forpost UAV, according to the firm’s statement. That so many Russian firms attended IDEX is no surprise, as Middle East and African nations account for fully half of RosobornExport's orders, according to a TASS report. 'We implement and discuss with partners projects on cooperation in the area of arms and military equipment for all types of armed forces,' TASS reported CEO Alexander Mikheyev as saying.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/with-uavs-air-defenses-and-a-full-sized-modified-tank-russian-firms-make-splash-inside-idex-2025/	2025-02-24T04:44:43-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/250220_IDEX_russia_tank-scaled-e1740138645759.jpg
Hegseth fires Navy top officer, Air Force No. 2	Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Lisa Franchetti participates in a wreath laying ceremony at the Anitkabir &#8211; Atatürk Mausoleum, in Ankara, Türkiye, June 3, 2024. During Franchetti’s visit, she met with Turkish military and government leaders, where she emphasized the value of strong partnership and collaboration between the two navies. (U.S. Navy photo by Chief Mass Communication Specialist Amanda Gray) WASHINGTON — Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth today announced he was removing Adm. Lisa Franchetti as the chief of naval operations, unceremoniously ending early the tenure of the first woman to become a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In addition, Hegseth said he would be replacing Gen. James Slife, the Air Force's No. 2 officer, as well as replacing the top Judge Advocate General for the Army, Air Force and Navy. 'I am also requesting nominations for the positions of Chief of Naval Operations and Air Force Vice Chief of Staff. The incumbents in these important roles, Admiral Lisa Franchetti and General James Slife, respectively, have had distinguished careers,' Hegseth said in a Friday statement. 'We thank them for their service and dedication to our country.' 'We are also requesting nominations for the Judge Advocates General for the Army, Navy and Air Force,' Hegseth added. Trump and his supporters, including Hegseth, have repeatedly talked about ridding the military of general officers they deem as 'woke.' Franchetti’s firing follows that of Air Force Gen. CQ Brown, who Trump removed as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff minutes before Hegseth's announcement. RELATED: Trump fires CQ Brown, nominates retired Air Force 3-star as replacement In January, the administration removed former Coast Guard Commandant Adm. Linda Fagan within hours of taking power, citing her focus on DEI, among other things. Vice Chief Adm. Kevin Lunday is serving as the interim commandant. Tonight's announcement marks the early end of the first woman to serve as a service chief. Franchetti, a career surface warfare officer, first ascended to the ranks of the top Pentagon brass in April 2022 when she was tapped to be the Navy’s second-most senior officer, the vice chief of naval operations. She held that post until August 2023 when then Adm. Michael Gilday finished his own tenure as CNO and she subsequently became the service’s top officer. Franchetti was only the second woman to become VCNO, following behind now-retired Adm. Michelle Howard, and subsequently became the first woman to be a member of the joint chiefs. (Adm. Linda Fagan, commandant of the Coast Guard, became the first woman to lead a branch of the military in June 2022, but that service operates under the Department of Homeland Security rather than the Defense Department.) When a service chief is removed or unable to do their job, the current vice automatically takes over in the interim, meaning Franchetti’s removal puts VCNO Adm. Jim Kilby in command of the service until a new top Navy officer is nominated and confirmed. The lack of a service chief also puts a strain both on the vice chief and officers down the chain of command, as was on display in 2023 when Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville blockaded the promotions of hundreds of military officers, including top brass. Slife was tapped for his current role in September 2023, though the nomination was caught up in Tuberville's hold. He was eventually confirmed by the Senate and pinned on his fourth star in December of that year. The ousted general is a special operations pilot by craft. Amassing over 3,100 hours flying aircraft like the legacy MH-53 Pave Low as well as the MQ-1 Predator, he achieved the rating of command pilot, according to his service biography. He earned his commission as an Air Force officer through ROTC at Auburn University in 1989. Slife previously led Air Force Special Operations Command for over three years. He was elevated to his current role after Gen. David Allvin, who has been the service number two, was named Chief of Staff.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/trump-franchetti-slife-fired-brown-hegseth-woke/	2025-02-21T17:24:29-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/8446820-scaled-e1726655704624.jpg

McGee Leadership Award ceremony at the Samuel Riggs IV Alumni Center, University of Maryland, College Park, Md., Jan 27, 2023. (US Air Force/Andy Morataya) WASHINGTON — After four decades in uniform, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. CQ Brown was unceremoniously ushered from his post nearly two-and-a-half years early tonight via a social media message by President Donald Trump. His unprecedented replacement: John Caine, a retired three-star Air Force officer. 'I want to thank General Charles 'CQ' Brown for his over 40 years of service to our country, including as our current Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,' Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. 'He is a fine gentleman and an outstanding leader, and I wish a great future for him and his family.' It was not immediately clear if Brown was fired effective immediately, and if so, if Adm. Christopher Grady, the vice chairman, is now serving as the country’s top officer. In a separate statement, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth also announced that he was seeking nominations to replace Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Lisa Franchetti and Air Force Vice Chief of Staff Gen. James Slife. It was not immediately clear if those two had been removed from their positions. RELATED: Hegseth fires Navy top officer, Air Force No. 2 Trump and Hegseth have been on a quest to rid the military of 'woke' generals supporting diversity and those who carried out orders related to the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. And while Brown was not serving as President Joe Biden’s chief military adviser during the US withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, Trump supporters have repeatedly invoked his name when talking about 'woke generals.' 'First of all, you got to fire the chairman [of the] Joint Chiefs, and … obviously you’re going to bring in a new Secretary of Defense. But, any general that was involved — general, admiral, whatever — … in any of the DEI woke shit has got to go,' Hegseth said in an episode of the Shawn Ryan Show podcast just days before Trump named him to lead the Pentagon. 'Either you’re in for warfighting, and that’s it, that’s the only litmus test we care about.' However, Brown was not the first up on the chopping block. On inauguration night, Coast Guard Commandant Adm. Linda Fagan became the first service leader to be terminated. (The Coast Guard is under the Department of Homeland Security.) Brown instead continued on in his role, even greeting Hegseth outside the Pentagon on his first official day as the new secretary. When a reporter asked Hegseth if he would fire the four-star general, he patted Brown on the shoulder and said, 'I'm standing with him right now. I look forward to working with him.' More chaos and distinction from Trump on national security. Firing CQ Brown as joint chiefs chair is completely unjustified. Smart, competent leader to be replaced by a retired 3 star? More weakening of America. Putin just keeps smiling. &mdash; Rep. Adam Smith (@RepAdamSmith) February 22, 2025 While Brown has been long rumored to be in the crosshairs of the new administration, that wasn't the case during Trump's first tour at the White House. After graduating from the ROTC program at Texas Tech University in 1984, Brown was commissioned into the Air Force. He spent his tenure as a fighter pilot, commander of the 31st Fighter Wing, Central Command’s deputy commander and head of US Air Forces in the Pacific (PACAF). Trump later tapped the general to serve as the Air Force’s 22nd Chief of Staff, the first Black man to serve in the post. By October 2020, when Trump administered Brown's oath of office, the country was in a period of civil unrest after police officers killed George Floyd. The four-star general had spoken out about the incident, saying his own experience 'didn't always sing of liberty and equality.' Then after three years serving as the top-ranking uniformed Air Force official, Brown was sworn in as the 21st chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under the Biden administration — normally a four-year posting expected to run through October 2027. As to Brown’s replacement: Caine retired in 2024, according to his Air Force bio. However, he appears to have made quite an impression on Trump over the years, with the president having talked him up several times to crowds. 'Despite being highly qualified and respected to serve on the Joint Chiefs of Staff during the previous administration, General Caine was passed over for promotion by Sleepy Joe Biden. But not anymore!' Trump stated in his Truth Social post. According to a February 2024 report from the Washington Examiner, Trump talked about how Caine told him that he could defeat ISIS in four weeks if given the power to do so, and then claimed that the officer donned a MAGA hat, despite such outward displays of politics not being allowed by the military — a story that, if true, will set off alarm bells for those who are worried about the politicization of the military. It’s unclear exactly what mechanism would allow Caine to take the role. One potential route would be for Trump to recall the retired officer to active duty, and then nominate him for the Chairman’s job, which requires a full Senate confirmation. This story may be updated with more information.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/trump-fires-cq-brown-nominates-retired-air-force-3-star-as-replacement/	2025-02-21T16:53:03-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/09/CQ-brown-photo-e1696005207753.jpg
As DoD shifts $50B in spending, can an old playbook protect legacy programs?	Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth hosts a bilateral exchange with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the Pentagon, Washington, D.C., Feb. 5, 2025. (DoD photo by U.S. Air Force Senior Airman Madelyn Keech) WASHINGTON — Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has ordered the Pentagon to take a look at its fiscal 2026 budget plans and find 8 percent savings which can be realigned away from legacy efforts and towards new priorities. And that opens up two key questions: Can the services use an old playbook to pull an end around and save their programs, or will the Trump team be able to really break the mold? And with certain areas known to be protected, what pots of money might be on the cutting room floor? It’s hardly the first time a Pentagon leader has talked about a large-scale shift of funding towards more modern priorities. As Todd Harrison, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and a long-time DoD budget guru, put it: 'The Pentagon is used to budget drills like this.' Perhaps the best comparison to what Hegseth seems to be doing is former defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld’s push for 'transformation,' launched in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. As part of that effort, Rumsfeld wanted to see a shift from legacy programs towards newer capabilities, including drones, space systems, precision munitions and missile defense. Heavy armor, manned fighters and large surface vessels, Rumsfeld said, were outdated for the War on Terror age — criticisms and focus areas that match up with current comments from Hegseth and Elon Musk. The similarities to Hegseth's push are even more direct when looking at the industrial base. Per a Congressional Research Service report, 'Transformation could affect the defense industrial base by transferring funding from ‘legacy’ systems to transformational systems, and from traditional DOD contractors to firms that previously have not done much defense work.' But what happened, according to analysts, is that Pentagon planners were quick to shift how they described their programs, making sure their big, legacy items now fell under the 'transformation' rubric rather than seem outdated. As Roman Schwiezer, an analyst with TD Cowen, told Breaking Defense, 'I remember under Rumsfeld, everything from the F-22 to the USMC's new combat boot was called ‘transformational’ to try to protect it from cuts.' So with significant shifts seemingly planned between Hegseth’s memo and Musk’s desire to cut, should we expect to see Pentagon planners run the old playbook again? Brad Bowman, a senior director at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told Breaking Defense that 'of course' the Pentagon moves money around to protect certain programs. He also said that given the nature of the current geostrategic environment combined with inadequate defense spending, 'I don’t blame them.' 'I’d recommend they do that. I’m just being blunt,' he said. 'Some programs are parochial and unneeded or unnecessary, redundant and should be killed, but many are necessary. … Now is the moment for increased defense spending, for increased defense industrial base production capacity, for stockpiling weapons and focusing on building combined combat readiness and deterrence.' Bowman added that while the services should not act deceptively or immorally, they should do what is necessary to defend programs and capabilities that 'make sure that our service members have what they need to do their missions be successful and come home to their families.' But John Ferrari, a retired Army one-star who did budgeting inside the building for years, isn’t so sure the old playbook will work the way it used to. 'I do think this is very different in feel from when Rumsfeld last did this and everything became transformation,' said Ferrari, now at the American Enterprise Institute. 'This team is looking at old defense companies and new defense companies very differently.' One thing that is certain: Everyone in the defense sector is waiting for the next shoe to drop. Hegseth’s memo called out 17 priority areas whose investments should not be cut — implying that those are areas that may also get plus-ups with the redirected funding. Those priorities were: Southwest Border Activities; Combating Transnational Criminal Organizations in the Western Hemisphere; Audit; Nuclear Modernization (including NC3); Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCAs); Virginia-class Submarines; Executable Surface Ships; Homeland Missile Defense; One-Way Attack/Autonomous Systems; Counter-small UAS Initiatives; Priority Critical Cybersecurity; Munitions; Core Readiness, including full DRT funding; Munitions and Energetics Organic Industrial Bases; Executable INDOPACOM MILCON; Combatant Command support agency funding for INDOPACOM, NORTHCOM, SPACECOM, STRATCOM, CYBERCOM, and TRANSCOM; and Medical Private-Sector Care. One key problem with shifting funds in accordance with Hegseth’s directive is that some programs can blur the lines between an exempt and non-exempt category. Homeland missile defense, for example, requires a 'layered system' that requires a plethora of sensors from the ground up to the air and then into space, along with different intercept capabilities such as fighter jets that can shoot down cruise missiles, said Doug Birkey, the Mitchell Institute’s executive director. And even exempt categories can require non-exempt linkages to function. Although the Air Force’s Collaborative Combat Aircraft program is spared from losing funds, the concept relies on teaming with manned fighters. 'It’s ‘and,’ not an ‘or,’' Birkey said. 'I just caution about cherry picking certain things, because we need to look at the enterprise that gets the solution.' Given that list, what areas of the department might be in trouble? Ferrari says to first look at people. He noted that military pay (a number he puts at about $181 billion) was not listed as protected, which means a smaller force structure, with cuts likely coming from land forces seen as less helpful in a China conflict. Civilians will also likely take a big cut overall, with defense agencies in the 'fourth estate' — parts of DoD that don’t fall under one of the military departments — likely targets. That process got underway late Friday, with a statement from the Pentagon that it planned to cut 5-8 percent of its civilian workforce, with 'approximately 5,400 probationary workers' to be fired starting next week. A 2023 Government Accountability Office study put the DoD civilian force at around 700,000 people, so a 5-8 percent cut would involve anywhere from 35,000-56,000 firings.

The F-35A is an agile, versatile, high-performance, 9-G capable multirole fighter that combines stealth, sensor fusion and unprecedented situational awareness. (U.S. Air Force photo by Staff Sgt. Zachary Rufus) 'They have escaped serious reductions [in the past], this time feels different,' Ferrari said, predicting that groups like the Defense Finance Accounting Service (DFAS), Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), and Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) could be cut 'in half.' The fact that private sector medical care is protected, he noted, could also be a bad sign for Defense Health Program efforts. Services' contracts for IT and staff support, leased buildings, federally funded research and development centers and R&amp;D labs are also likely targets the planners could go after as they try to protect warfighting priorities, he said. And eventually, cuts will come for major programs. Ferrari predicts the F-35 (a favorite target of Musk), the Army’s Future Vertical Lift and Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle, and some naval programs will be offered up as sacrifices. Those kinds of items are part of another Pentagon playbook: putting up cuts that will hurt jobs in Congressional districts in order to entice Congress to come protect them. However, the combination of Musk’s DOGE team, a secretary who has boasted about not having any ties to legacy contractors, and a president who has shown interest in weapon procurement in the past means that may backfire this time, said Harrison. 'If the services respond this time by proposing cuts to things that are politically unpalatable to ward off the reductions they may end up having to live with those cuts,' Harrison said. 'This administration has flipped the script on what is politically acceptable and how much risk it is willing to take.' On the flip side, what might do well? Jeff Rowlison, vice president for space and intelligence at American Defense International, told Breaking Defense that 'despite any real guidance' yet from DoD, the Iron Dome for America program 'is going to be like the gold rush for companies — everyone is going to rush to show how they can contribute to the effort.' And until that guidance is released, he added, there also likely will be 'a disjointed' race among the military services 'to associate everything with Iron Dome.' Doug Loverro, former head of Pentagon space policy, agreed that military space programs 'will be a relative winner here along with missile defense in general, but so will other administration priorities.' And in some ways, the services might benefit from a willingness to cut among Republicans that hasn’t been there in previous years. One Army source said the service is planning to use this exercise as an avenue to push for cuts it has been eyeing for some time but had trouble getting through Congress, in hopes that lawmakers allow them to be cut this time. At the end of the day, there was widespread agreement from the analysts that the Pentagon needs to have the freedom to make smart choices and not just cut towards an arbitrary number. 'If we’re going to argue for more defense spending, you’ve got to make sure that the Pentagon [are] responsible fiscal stewards. Yes, yes and yes,' Bowman said. 'But in this moment, any DOGE initiative, any efficiency initiative that gets in the way of those topline priorities … is exactly the wrong approach at the worst possible moment.'

DISA: DoD to achieve federated ICAM connection across all military services by end of fiscal year	Airman 1st Class Gerald Mack, cyber operator with 175th Cyber Operations, Maryland Air National Guard, monitors cyber attacks during Exercise Southern Strike at Camp Shelby, Mississippi, April 21, 2023. (U.S. Army National Guard photo by Staff Sgt. Renee Seruntine) WASHINGTON — The Department of Defense plans to achieve federal identity, credential, and access management (ICAM) connection on unclassified networks across all military services by the end of this fiscal year, according to a Defense Information Systems Agency official. ICAM — the practice of performing constant checks to ensure that users are allowed to access the information they are trying to access — is essential to the DoD’s larger zero trust 'never trust, always verify' philosophy that operates under the assumption that the network is always compromised. Federated ICAM allows one organization to accept another’s identity processes and procedures to gain access to each other's data on an existing platform. It’s a vital part of information sharing, Brian Hermann, the program executive officer for PEO Cyber at DISA said during a media roundtable today. 'ICAM is how we work across the department, as well as how we work with our mission partners. Enabling our work with allied and coalition partners means we have to have some connectivity and understanding of who we're working with in that coalition, to make sure that we have an understanding of their access rights and grant them access to DoD resources,' he said. Hermann explained that at the beginning of this fiscal year DISA stood up a federation hub that allows the agency to be able to have a 'total picture' of all the information an individual has access to, basically guaranteeing that ICAM is working the way it's supposed to. With this hub, DISA started working with the Army to get its ICAM solutions federated. He said he expects the Army’s ICAM federation solutions to be completed by the end of March. 'Then roughly about three months later, be done with the Navy, followed by the Air Force by the end of the fiscal year,' Hermann said. 'We're going to use the lessons that we learned out of [the services] to go ahead and do the federation across all the other ICAM solutions that exist within the department,' he added. When asked the reasoning behind the order in which the services were attaining federated ICAM, Hermann explained that it was mostly due to 'deconfliction of timing' concerning other 'activities' that the services had going on. 'I can't really say for example, that the Army's technical solution was more advanced or more mature than any of the others. I think it was just a timing issue,' he said. Related: ‘A light bulb moment’: US, Canada achieve ‘vital’ federated ICAM connection through joint pilot Once the services have achieved federated ICAM connection, the next step is to work with the Defense Manpower Data Center to help it achieve federated ICAM followed by other components of the DoD, which Hermann did not expand on. Throughout this process, DISA will also start working toward federated ICAM with allies and partners — something the department piloted in December when it announced it had achieved federated ICAM connection with Canada. However, before the DoD begins widely establishing federated ICAM access with other nations, Hermann said it needs to speed up the process of federation, which he said will be possible through lessons learned from the services. 'When we start to federate with external partners, allies &#8230; ad hoc kinds of coalitions that we might fight with, we have to be able to move very quickly to make sure that we can continue to work and collaborate with those mission partners,' Hermann said. 'I think speed has to get down to days, not months, is my observation, if we're going to be a supportive part of providing that warfighter support.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/disa-dod-to-achieve-federated-icam-connection-across-all-military-services-by-end-of-fiscal-year/	2025-02-21T11:55:53-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/7758909-scaled-e1740165576715.jpg
Saltzman bars Space Force staff from Mitchell Institute events	CSO Gen. Chance Saltzman offer remarks during the Mitchell Institute Spacepower Security Forum in Washington, D.C., March 27, 2024. (DoD photo by Joseph Clark) WASHINGTON — Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman has barred all Space Force personnel from participating in any events sponsored by the Mitchell Institute, pending further instructions. The ban was conveyed to Space Force and US Space Command leaders in a Thursday evening email blast signed by Maj. Gen. Steven Whitney, Space Force staff director. 'CSO has directed that all Guardian participation with the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies is stopped until further notice. Instructions will follow when he clears future participation. This does not affect participation at the AFA's Warfare Symposium, only Mitchell Institute sponsored events,' the email states. 'I ask that you disseminate this guidance to your teams.' The email does not list a reason for the decision. However, it follows hard on the heels of the Feb. 19 release of a new Mitchell report calling on the Defense Department to more clearly define the Space Force's role in warfighting. The report, which was based on a workshop attended by Guardians, also found that Saltzman's overarching theory of space power, dubbed 'Competitive Endurance,' gives the impression of being weighed toward defensive operations rather than offensive actions — and that there continues to be some hesitancy within the Guardian corps about warfighting in space. A spokesperson for the Space Force was unable to respond by press time. While maintaining 501c3 status as an independent think tank, Mitchell traditionally has advocated for the importance of US military air power and the US Air Force, and increasingly in recent years for space power and the Space Force. Indeed, it was named for Army Brig. Gen. William Mitchell, who according to the organization's website, 'was a visionary of early airpower and the importance it would play in post-world-war global security and future wars.' In response to a request for comment from Breaking Defense, retired Air Force Lt. Gen. David Deptula, Mitchell Institute dean, said that Saltzman 'is dedicated to infusing a warfighting attitude in the Space Force.' Nonetheless, he said, 'for decades, military personnel were prohibited from saying ‘warfighting’ and ‘space’ in the same sentence. Circumstances are far different now given adversary actions. The Space Force leadership knows this and is pressing hard to evolve the service. 'Mitchell Institute will continue to advocate for the Space Force, and the absolute need to increase their resources, personnel, and authorities that are all essential to realize &#8216;peace through strength' for our nation,' he added.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/saltzman-bars-space-force-staff-from-mitchell-institute-events/	2025-02-21T09:54:01-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/Salzman-at-Mitchell-scaled-e1740143242552.jpeg
Saab CEO floats Euro defense ‘coalition,’ plans to fly unmanned combat demonstrator	Saab CEO Micael Johansson told Breaking Defense that the company hopes to generate interest from Germany in the GlobalEye spy aircraft. (Saab) BELFAST — Swedish manufacturer Saab is one of Europe's largest defense companies, famed for the development and manufacture of Gripen fighter jets among a wide variety of other major platforms across air, land and sea domains. The company also has a special interest in the US, largely due to it supplying aft fuselages for the Air Force's T-7A Red Hawk advanced trainer program, while a new Michigan-based shoulder-fired munitions final assembly line is scheduled to begin production next year. US and European security ties are beginning to fray, however, as new leadership in Washington insists the continent drive up defense spending, tells the Munich Security Conference that Europe's primary threat rests 'from within,' and looks set to be much less of a reliable ally going forward. Against such a backdrop the implications for Europe's defense industry could be profound. Breaking Defense sat down with Saab CEO Micael Johannson on Sunday on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference to discuss transatlantic tension, the potential for a European 'coalition of the willing' to fund major, collaborative defense projects, the state of Saab's weapons production and plans to flight test optionally manned and unmanned Swedish future fighter demonstrators over the next four years. This interview has been edited lightly for length and clarity. MICAEL JOHANSSON: First of all, I do think that a strong transatlantic link is still important, and I don't think we should sort of jump into too many conclusions [or] we should give up on that obviously. Since we have operations in the US I don't think that is so much affected by this. This is a local business. Locally perceived, important stuff for the US DoD and the defense forces in the US, and we are still pushing to grow that. We're building a new facility in Michigan to manufacture munitions and support weapons, of course, that's still absolutely in play. It's more on a political level, to decide, okay, 'how strong do we have to be in Europe?' We come from a peace dividend and if we didn't sort of hear the wake up call a number of years ago, when the [Ukraine] war started, or even back in 2014 [when Russia invaded Crimea] I mean, now we should sort of understand that we need to do more in Europe, nation by nation, of course, but also as part of the alliance, being a strong pillar in NATO. I think [this is] important and I wish that we could sort of get our act together to do a few more things together in Europe, to create scale and identify a number of flagship projects that we need as capabilities [from the] European perspective, and also being aligned with what NATO needs going forward for a regional defense, but also as a strong sort of deterrence capability [in] Europe. We can identify those projects. We all talk about integrating air and missile defense systems. We have great defense industries that would support that. We have unmanned, collaborative combat aircraft. We have all these things with critical underwater infrastructure [threats] that we have to manage somehow. We can do more on the sensor side, on [the] space side, we could do more on sovereign security of supply when it comes to munitions and powder factories and stuff like that. How do we get there is the problem. A British Army Pathfinder Regiment soldier test fires Saab next generation light anti-tank weapon or NLAW (UK MoD) The European Commission was talking a couple of days ago about having a deficit break by triggering an emergency clause [effectively allowing governments more flexibility over defense spending]. Is that the right path to take? If this sort of triggers nations within Europe to take the next step to spend more then I think that is probably a very good way to go, nation by nation. I'm not sure that will help the collaboration issue. I'm more looking at our Commission having defense and security really high on the agenda. We have a new defense commissioner [Andrius Kubilius] that is writing his white paper together with Kaja Kallas [European Commission vice president] and [come] 14 March, we will see what that includes. I think theoretically, these are good initiatives to try and create some sort of European defense industrial program, with those flagships, the projects that I mentioned as examples. But then of course we need all the countries agreeing, by consensus, 27 of us, that we want to put money into this, substantial money. We are not talking about €1.5 billion ($1.56 billion) in Europe [the proposed budget of the European Defence Industry Programme]. We're talking hundreds of billions of euros, I think, over a time period to do this. Will that happen? I don't know. But if that is not manageable from an EU Commission perspective, we need to see a coalition of the willing, because when I look upon this, it seems countries have different views of the threat environment. I mean, it's obvious in the Baltic states, in Poland, maybe Germany, Sweden, Finland, maybe a few others that really want to, sort of step up and do things. (Days after Breaking Defense spoke with Johansson the Financial Times reported that the European Union is considering reallocating €93 billion of unused COVID recovery funds to the defense sector.) Saab has shared plans to hit a production target, across all of its ground combat weapons, of 400,000 units per year from 2025. Is that on track? Yes, we are on par with what we expect in terms of output, and we have a huge backlog now to execute also and so that will come into play at the end of this year. Are you able to give a figure for 2026, will it level out or increase? It will go beyond [the 2025 production rate] but I won't specify a number It will happen when our [Carl-Gustaf M4 shoulder launched recoilless rifle] facility in India comes into play in 2026 and also in the US [Michigan munitions facility] at the end of 2026. Production increase is also planned with our missile capability, short range air defense capability, and also sensor capability. That's why we opened a new [Giraffe 1X air surveillance radar] facility in Fareham to be able to manufacture, or start to manufacture the 1x at large scale. So we are investing heavily, a bit more front loaded than we assumed a couple of years ago, but it's the right thing to do. Pal Jonson, Sweden's defense minister, has said the government expects to launch a future fighter 'inquiry.' Is that a good step politically to also tie in with future fighter activities from the Swedish Armed Forces and studies already underway? It's public news that there is a concept program ongoing where the alternatives are, continue the way we do it today which is in itself, of course, an ecosystem of companies joining to support us as the prime. The other option is to join, and I am not saying SCAF [Future Combat Air System] or GCAP [Global Combat Air Programme] but finding an international partnership, but it is very important to retain the OEM [Original Equipment Manufacturer] capabilities that we have. I can't foresee that we will throw that out the window after nine decades of cost efficient, highly performing platforms being developed and manufactured. The third alternative would be to buy something off the shelf, which I have a hard time seeing, that Sweden would actually turn that way because that would mean lots of cost and infrastructure effects and stuff like that. They will do some sort of assessment on the three alternatives. I don't know when exactly they will come to a conclusion. Sweden could decide on which procurement path to take for a future fighter designed to replace Saab's Gripen fighter jet earlier than expected, company CEO Micael Johansson told Breaking Defense (Saab) We are supporting the program. We're doing concepting and we will fly things over time and they stated between 2028 and 2030 they have to take this decision. I think it will happen a bit earlier, but that's my personal view, we need to settle which way we go because that's good for us, that's good for Sweden, good for the [NATO] alliance. Of course there will be assessments, but I cannot see that there will be a request for information or something like that, sent out [to industry]. Do you think we will see anything flying soon [from Saab on the future fighter concept phase]? Absolutely we will definitely fly things. Manned or unmanned? Unmanned [flight testing around] 2027-2028. Before that, we will probably fly something optionally manned, and maybe partly show off some mission sort of capability that would be more AI than pilot-oriented. The AI package would be developed in-house or from a start up? We have a collaboration with Helsing. We work with them, and we also have an equity stake. So of course, we will use AI from the company broadly. But of course, we're looking into what can support more efficient missions when using AI agents. I won't go into details around that. Are you happy with the level of funding provided for future fighter related activities? We are on contract for lots of these things. There will be more to come. Touching on the GlobalEye joint Nordic purchase idea, do you think there will be an agreement soon? I hope so. It's mainly sort of a discussion between the politicians, MoDs and defense forces, around [the question of] what sort of capability do we need? Do we need to add one or two platforms and/or if Finland or Denmark would join that to start with. Of course, that would be great and I think we need that capability, not only for the Nordics, but also the Arctic perspective, to be able to cover that. As the UAE deal is complete, what are your GlobalEye export priorities? I think there's an interest from France. Hopefully we can get the Germans interested. I'd love to see it as an interim solution at least for the NATO iAFSC [initial Allied Future Surveillance and Control] as they call it. I know the E-7 has been selected, but there's some sort of schedule problem there, I think, so we are offering [GlobalEye] if there's an interest, but then we go nation by nation. We have some interest or potential customers that are interested in Asia-Pacific region, but also Middle East. There are quite a few sort of leads or campaigns [happening]. Has Saab made first Gripen E deliveries to Satenas air base yet? We have delivered [aircraft] to the FMV [Swedish Defence Materiel Administration] test center. Given news around a possible F-35 sale to India, do you see that as a competitive issue for the Gripen campaign? We have a very competitive opportunity. We've said to them that we're prepared to more or less build a small Linköping [Gripen's Swedish manufacturing base] in India, to transfer technology, build production, and also knowledge transfer for a platform like Gripen [is important]. It has to be a highly performing platform, which it is and I think it's suitable for what they need. But then again, I can't judge politically how discussions are going. Is there a commensurate type loss on T-7 for Saab, in line with Boeing's losses? It's not proportional at all to what Boeing has written off, which is public information and I won't give you a number, but is that substantial? Absolutely not. I think the investors have sort of understood that if you look upon the combination of aerostructures which has not been giving us black numbers over the last few years, but will go into a positive sort of scenario now — [when you consider] T-7 and then Gripen — we've always said that it should be sort of high single digit numbers [for profitability]. They're now being pushed down a bit, and you are roughly at 6 percent I think, 5.9 percent last year for aeronautics. So that gives you a feeling.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/saab-ceo-floats-euro-defense-coalition-plans-to-fly-unmanned-combat-demonstrator/	2025-02-21T01:05:16-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/20210220-en-3896563-1-scaled-e1637694229726.jpg
As ‘dome’ air defense discussions rage, Turkey’s Aselsan sees an opening: CEO	Aselsan showcases its wares at IDEX 2025. (Agnes Helou / Breaking Defense) IDEX 2025 — As the US is sorting out what exactly an American Iron Dome will look like, Turkey is forging ahead with its own Steel Dome — and eyeing potential exports for such air defense systems to both NATO allies and eager Gulf customers, according to a senior Turkish executive. 'The Steel Dome is very promising system. All nations want to have this kind of system,' Ahmet Akyol, president and CEO of Turkish electronics giant Aselsan, told Breaking Defense here in Abu Dhabi. 'We are a member of NATO. These are our allies. Also we have got many brother countries in this [Gulf] region and all around the world. So the decision is [a] government decision, but we are ready to contribute [to] peace and prosperity of all brother and allied nation nations.' Announced in August 2024 and with a name that invokes Israel's multi-layered defense system that includes its Iron Dome platform, Steel Dome is meant to be a network-centric air defense system equipped with artificial intelligence and is expected to protect Turkey’s entire airspace from 'very low altitude to very high altitude' and 'very short range to long range' threats, according to a statement issued at the time by the government’s Presidency of Defense Industries (SSB). Aselsan is one of a handful of Turkish firms, including ballistics maker Roketsan, charged with making the concept a reality. Akyol said there is no projected end date for the Steel Dome to be complete, as it's a layered system that's continuously updated. 'We can provide this solution for Turkey and for allied countries right now,' Akyol said. 'So in Turkey, this is in progress. Every year we are delivering new systems of the Steel Dome concept, and it will be beneficial for our region.' As for the name, the American plan has come under no small amount of criticism since Iron Dome refers to a layer of Israel's overall system that would not be practical for many US air defense needs. Asked whether Steel Dome was a better fit for Turkey's needs, even if it echoed the Israeli original, Akyol said, 'The name is not important the concept is important,' adding the name was chosen by the government not the firm. Akyol's mention of the potential to deliver air defense systems to partners in the region will likely be welcome news to Gulf militaries. Other defense firm executives told Breaking Defense during IDEX 2025 that the region is eager for air defenses following the rash of missile and drone threats in recent years. 'Especially after drone and kamikaze attack attacks in the region, [in] Yemen and other conflicts, there is a huge demand for air defense systems and also guidance kits,' he said. More broadly Aselsan is making a push into the Gulf, to deepen ties here. 'We are opening new entities in this region. Just last week, I was in Oman and opened a new entity in Oman. And also we have got some production facilities like in Jordan,' he said. 'So in this region, the trend and the demand is to increase local contribution.' Akyol said that Aselsan is open for technology transfer. He added that the firm will convert its office in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to an excellence center. 'We will have design capabilities in house, in these offices. And also we have got some discussions [for] new joint ventures. Saudi Arabia is one of the key countries for our activities. And day by day, we are increasing activities in Saudi Arabia,' he told Breaking Defense. After mending ties between Riyadh and Ankara, Turkish firms started to have increased cooperation opportunities in the Saudi market, the largest importer of defense platforms in the Gulf region. That included another Turkish firm, Baykar, selling its AKINCI drones to the Kingdom in 2023. Akyol added that with Abu Dhabi there are 'some technology of transfer and production opportunities are also on the table.' He saw increased regional demand in the following areas: radars, air defense systems, electro-optics and naval platforms. But Aseslan is also eyeing expansion far from the Gulf, including further into Western Europe, the Far East and Latin America. 'We will have additional capacities and new partnerships, and we will have a more presence in these regions in 2025, and other upcoming years,' he said. 'We will be one of the 30 largest defense companies in defense 100 list in 2030,' Akyol predicted.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/as-dome-air-defense-discussions-rage-turkeys-aselsan-sees-an-opening-ceo/	2025-02-20T23:07:46-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/250221_aselsan_booth_AGNES-scaled-e1740120506769.jpg
DoD reviewing ‘non-essential’ consultancy contracts for termination	Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) WASHINGTON — The Defense Department has ordered all acquisition shops to review consulting service contracts to determine whether they are essential to Trump administration priorities, and terminate those deemed not to fit that bill. 'To ensure we are accountable for every dollar we spend and that we are aligned with the President of the United States’ America First priorities and Secretary of Defense [Pete] Hegseth’s direction, Component heads will conduct a comprehensive review and validation of existing contracts for consulting services,' states the Feb. 18 memo [PDF] memo signed by Steven Morani, who is performing the duties of DoD's undersecretary for acquisition and sustainment. The memo mandates an assessment of 'the essentiality of contracts &#8230; for the purpose of terminating or descoping contracts for activities that are not essential for the Department to fulfill its statutory purposes.' Components are organizations within the Pentagon that have acquisition authority. Morani's memo, first reported by DefenseScoop, is addressed to 'senior Pentagon leadership, defense agencies and DoD field activities directors.' The DoD review is taking place in two parts: first looking at contracts let under the General Services Administration vehicle, then other types of contracts. Component heads have until March 19 to submit to the results of the first review and until April 19 for the second. The memo doesn't define 'consulting services,' so it is unclear what exactly will fall under the review and how much money is currently being spent on these types of contracts. However, according to a 2023 report by the Government Accountability Office, DoD spent between $184 billion to $226 billion from 2017 to 2022 on all types of 'service contracts,' including administrative and technical support. That said, the report noted that data is hard to collect as the various offices within the DoD do not use the same criteria to keep track of such spending. Morani explains that if certain consultancy contracts are found to be 'essential,' then a 'short justification' including a validation of the requirement by 'a General Officer/Senior Executive Service member' should be provided. The memo comes against the backdrop of Hegseth ordering Pentagon leaders to redirect roughly $50 billion planned for the fiscal 2026 budget request towards a set of priorities that better align with Trump's goals for the department, as well as the arrival of Elon Musk's DOGE team at the Pentagon.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/dod-reviewing-non-essential-consultancy-contracts-for-termination/	2025-02-20T15:31:38-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/hegseth-confirmation-scaled-e1736870161374.jpg
GE, Pratt clear key design milestone, begin building next-gen engine prototypes	Lockheed Martin Skunk Works concept art of a sixth-generation fighter. (Lockheed Martin) WASHINGTON — Engine makers GE Aerospace and RTX subsidiary Pratt &amp; Whitney have both formally passed a key design milestone for the Air Force’s Next Generation Adaptive Propulsion (NGAP) program, paving the way for the two companies to begin building their respective prototypes. GE Aerospace said in a statement Wednesday that its prototype design, dubbed the XA102, cleared what’s known as Detailed Design Review (DDR), the final step before work to construct the engine can commence. In a statement today, Pratt similarly announced that its NGAP offering, called the XA103, has also cleared the DDR milestone. 'GE Aerospace is making great strides with model-based engineering, which has been instrumental in the success of the XA102 engine design,' Steve Russell, vice president and general manager of Edison Works at GE Aerospace, said in the company’s press release. 'As we transition into the procurement and build phase, we will continue to incorporate this innovative approach while working closely with our supply chain partners to advance the engine toward a full-scale demonstration.' In its announcement, Pratt asserted that the company completed the 'first fully digital' DDR for its NGAP candidate, emphasizing the growing importance of digital design tools that support weapon systems development for the Pentagon. 'For decades, propulsion has been a key differentiator for the United States, and we are working with the US Air Force to make sure it stays that way,' Chris Flynn, Pratt vice president of Military Development Programs, said in a statement. 'Collaborating with the US Air Force, we have supported every generation of jet engine development since World War II. XA103, our adaptive engine for the future, will continue to advance our digital and agile design and development capabilities while advancing the propulsion capability for the warfighter.' The announcements follow a new round of contracts issued by the Air Force in January for the NGAP program, which raised the total award ceiling for each vendor to $3.5 billion each. The Air Force is expected to assess the performance of each prototype once they begin testing later this decade, and make a down-select decision from there. The 'adaptive' engine technologies underpinning the NGAP program could herald a leap in military propulsion, Air Force officials have said, because they can change the characteristics of a jet engine in flight to enable features like more fuel efficient cruising or increased thrust. The designs for both companies draw heavily from work previously conducted under the Air Force’s Adaptive Engine Transition Program, which constructed a new, prototype engine for the F-35 but was ultimately passed over due to budgetary constraints and other logistical concerns. The NGAP engines have principally been intended to power the service’s Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) fighter, though the sixth-gen jet is currently in limbo after being paused by the Biden administration and awaits a review by the new Trump team. NGAD is now the only publicly known potential recipient of adaptive engine technologies for the US military, following a disclosure last year by the Navy to Aviation Week that its own next-gen fighter in the works, called F/A-XX, will instead rely on more traditional propulsion designs. The exquisite NGAP powerplant has also been identified by former Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall as a potential source of cost savings for the NGAD fighter, whose projected price of several hundred million dollars per copy could prove prohibitive. Among other changes that could be made to the fighter, reducing the complexity of its engine could be one option to make the aircraft more affordable, Kendall said. Internal Air Force analysis recently validated the requirement for a manned, sixth-gen fighter, Breaking Defense previously reported. It’s not clear what the Trump administration may decide, though the fighter was notably not exempt from an order by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to pare back about 8 percent of projected spending for the next five fiscal years, which will free up money to shift toward the administration’s priorities. A project to field a fleet of drone wingmen known as Collaborative Combat Aircraft, however, was expressly put off limits, according to a memo from Hegseth and obtained by Breaking Defense.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/ge-pratt-clear-key-design-milestone-begin-building-next-gen-engine-prototypes/	2025-02-20T12:38:55-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-17-at-10.28.29-AM.png
Denmark to pass 3 percent GDP on defense over fear of Russian rearmament	Danish officials address media regarding an increased defense spending plan (Danish MoD) BELFAST — Based on a strategic assessment that Russia could rearm faster than NATO should the war in Ukraine end or turn into a frozen conflict, Denmark says it plans on injecting an additional 50 billion DKK ($7 billion) to its defense budget over 2025-2026. The uplift will see the Nordic nation exceed 3 percent GDP on military spending. In a translated statement from Wednesday, the government said the extra money will speed up the 'building of the Armed Forces' combat power,' and be drawn from an 'Acceleration Fund.' Copenhagen did not specify which weapon systems the new fund will be used to acquire, but laid out its security fears in clear terms. The Danish Ministry of Defence 'assesses that when the war in Ukraine stops or freezes and NATO does not arm itself at the same pace, Russia will be able to free up significant military resources and, within about 2 years, pose a credible threat to one or more NATO countries in the Baltic Sea region, if the US does not get involved,' it said. The warning that Russia could rearm within two years is not out of step with comments from other regional officials. During a recent trip to Washington, Lt. General Carl-Johan Edström, Sweden's Chief of Defense Staff, told Breaking Defense that it will take only a few years for Russia to rearm itself if the Ukraine conflict freezes. RELATED: Ticking clock: Northern NATO defense chiefs see ever-closing ‘window’ to prepare for Russia 'If you're a country with the border to Russia, then you say two to three years. And if you're really far away, then you say maybe five to 10 years,' he said. 'You have to look at that perspective, maybe five years, maybe less. Not more.' European powers are still struggling to come to terms with the reality of urgently having to do more to protect the continent without relying on the US for renewed support. US President Donald Trump labelling Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a 'dictator' and speculating that 'he is not going to have a country left' have only heightened concerns in the region that Washington is prepared to negotiate a peace deal along pro-Russian lines and without any involvement from Kyiv or NATO allies. 'The current security situation demands political action from European allies,' Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen said during a Wednesday press conference, according to a post on X. Washington also continues to test bilateral relations with Copenhagen through its push to buy Greenland, which has included hints from Trump that he would be open to military action to take it over. The island is a self-governing territory that remains part of the Kingdom of Denmark. In January, Denmark’s Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen quashed the US military takeover idea, telling local broadcaster TV 2 'I don’t have the imagination to imagine us getting there.' Copenhagen's latest spending pledge comes after it also committed last month to spend $2.04 billion on new naval vessels, long-range drones and improved space capabilities in a bid to strengthen Arctic security.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/denmark-to-pass-3-percent-gdp-on-defense-over-fear-of-russian-rearmament/	2025-02-20T12:03:50-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/pressemode-stm-2025-artikel-e1740080003703.jpg
Trump administration weighing C-UAS role in Iron Dome for America, two-star general explains	The 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment and the Threat Systems Management Office operate a swarm of 40 drones to test the rotational units capabilities during the battle of Razish, National Training Center on May 8th, 2019. (US Army/ Pv2 James Newsome) WASHINGTON — Pentagon officials are crafting a plan to expand the United States’s missile defense system under the 'Iron Dome for America' initiative, and grappling with whether new tech to down aerial drones should also be included, according to a two-star Army general. 'There's talk about does that involve counter-UAS [unmanned aerial systems] or will counter-UAS be established [separately],' Maj. Gen. David Stewart told Breaking Defense earlier this month. Stewart — dual hatted as the director for the Joint Counter-Unmanned Aircraft Systems Office and Army fires — said he and his team are working with Pentagon leaders and other agencies to determine just what route to take. In late January, President Donald Trump issued the Iron Dome for America executive order calling for greater investments for a multilayered homeland air defense system, including a requirement for the development of space-based interceptors. That order started a 60-day clock for Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth to develop a plan to defend the homeland against 'ballistic, hypersonic, advanced cruise missiles, and other next-generation aerial attacks from peer, near-peer, and rogue adversaries.' 'What do we have right now that gets out [to] the cutting edge [and] is that the right capability, versus what do we need to invest in,' Stewart later added. The proliferation of aerial drones on the battlefield has been pushing the services to focus on new counter-drone weapons for years to varying degrees of success. More recently, though, there have been a plethora of reports of drone sightings and incursions on military installations throughout the US. 'I have no doubt that there’s significantly more incursions that we don’t see, either with a system or with our eyeballs,' Gen. Gregory Guillot, the commander of US Northern Command and North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), told reporters in October 2024. At the time, the four-star general speculated that those events are gaining more attention due to the spread of systems that are able to detect and track UAS with greater 'fidelity.' And while drone sightings at locations with highly classified programs have prompted questions of if adversary nations are behind the operations, Guillot said that he has not yet seen evidence of any 'organized or unorganized foreign nexus' and that the 'overwhelming majority of them are probably local hobbyists that are just flying too close to the base.' Regardless of if many of those incidents are from hobbyists or not, Stewart said the new administration is taking the potential threat 'very seriously' and pushing the DoD and other entities like the Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Aviation Administration and local law enforcement to work together. But red tape abound. US regulations and policy, for example, limit just which C-UAS systems can be used on the homeland. While there are expectations depending on the location, by and large, only 'low-collateral effectors' are used to down drones inside the continental US — think jamming or spoofing the radio frequency link between the controller and the drone, a net to capture the drone or using one drone to ram the other drone. This has meant that the military services have had to find innovative ways to test out new C-UAS against real threats. When the Army wanted soldier feedback on its new Stryker-mounted 50-kilowatt laser weapons against drones last year, it sent the four prototypes into the Middle East. In a similar vein, the service is also planning to test new high-powered microwave C-UASs over there. 'The full breadth of capability is not authorized to be used in the United States, in the homeland,' Stewart said. Ultimately, though, that may need to change under a more comprehensive C-UAS plan that is either part of the Iron Dome for America umbrella or a standalone. 'There is no single silver bullet,' Stewart added. 'We have to look at is a layered approach that we look at both really exquisite capability to get after a threat, but also trying to get after more affordable capability, and just trying to make sure that we use the right tool and provide the warfighter the right tools to get after this mission.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/trump-administration-weighing-c-uas-role-in-iron-dome-for-america-two-star-general-explains/	2025-02-20T11:15:52-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/5356116-scaled-e1738101657589.jpg
Navy relieves captain of carrier that hit merchant vessel	Exterior damage of USS Harry S. Truman (CVN-75) viewed from a ship’s rigid-hull inflatable boat following a collision with merchant vessel Besiktas-M, Feb. 12. (U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class Cody Beam) WASHINGTON — The captain in command of the US Navy aircraft carrier that collided with a merchant vessel near an Egyptian port last week has been relieved by the head of his carrier strike group, the service announced today. Rear Adm. Sean Bailey, commander of Carrier Strike Group 8, relieved Capt. Dave Snowden on Feb. 20 due to a 'loss of confidence in his ability to command,' according to the statement. The Navy rarely divulges specific reasons why commanders are relieved, opting instead to use the phrase 'loss of confidence' as a catchall explanation. But in this instance, the service directly attributed Snowden's firing to last week's collision. 'The relief occurred after Truman was involved in a collision with the merchant vessel Besiktas-M on Feb. 12, while operating in the Mediterranean Sea in the vicinity of Port Said, Egypt,' according to the statement. 'The U.S. Navy holds commanding officers to the highest standard and takes action to hold them accountable when those standards are not met. Naval leaders are entrusted with significant responsibilities to their Sailors and their ships.' Snowden will be temporarily re-assigned to Naval Air Forces Atlantic. Capt. Christopher Hill, commander of the aircraft carrier Dwight D. Eisenhower, will temporarily serve as Truman's commander, according to the statement. The Truman reportedly pulled into port for repairs associated with the collision, and the Navy said Snowden's relief will have no impact on the ship's schedule.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/navy-relieves-captain-of-carrier-that-hit-merchant-vessel/	2025-02-20T10:38:40-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/8871530-scaled-e1740076408529.jpg
Trump ‘clearly not happy’ with delivery schedule for new Air Force One jets, Boeing CEO says	US President Donald Trump gestures with a saber after cutting into a cake representation of the new Air Force One design during the Commander-In-Chief inaugural ball at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center in Washington, DC, on January 20, 2025. (Photo by PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — Lengthy delays with the delivery of two Boeing 747 jumbo jets outfitted to serve as flying White Houses has drawn the ire of President Donald Trump, who is 'clearly not happy' with the lagging schedule to deliver the planes, Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg said today. 'I think he’s made that well-known,' Ortberg said during the Barclays Industrial Select Conference, referring to the commander-in-chief’s widely publicized dissatisfaction with Boeing’s management of the Air Force One program. The two jets, dubbed VC-25B, are set to replace older 747 models currently in service that regularly shuttle the US president around the globe. Trump personally intervened in the contract negotiations for the deal in 2018, and the ensuing work to modify the planes with features like a secure communications suite and the ability to survive a nuclear detonation has proven difficult for the beleaguered aerospace giant. Amid other woes like workforce disruptions and a fixed-price development contract that has forced Boeing to lose billions of dollars on the Air Force One program, delays have piled up, and now the first of the two planes may not deliver until 2029 or even later, Breaking Defense previously reported. The first jet was originally expected to be handed over in 2024. An updated schedule assessment from Boeing is anticipated in the spring. To help speed things up, Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) chief Elon Musk has now been tapped to intervene, a move Ortberg said he welcomed. 'Elon Musk is actually helping us a lot in working through the requirements on VC-25 to try to help us get the things that are non-value added constraints out of the way, so that we can move faster and get the president those airplanes delivered,' Ortberg said. 'He's a brilliant guy, so he's able to pretty quickly ascertain the difference between technical requirements and things that we can move out of the way, and he's helping us in a big way,' he continued. 'So I'm embracing that, working with the DOGE team to help us improve the delivery.' Noting that an accelerated schedule can help reduce the risk of further cost overruns, Ortberg concluded that he is 'all in on trying to pull these airplanes up and get the president his airplanes delivered to him, which is what he wants.' Vexed by the schedule setbacks, Trump has openly mused about finding alternatives, telling reporters flying aboard Air Force One on Wednesday that he was considering buying other used Boeing aircraft from a foreign seller. It’s not clear how that plan might work to potentially save time, as any other jets will need to be acquired and retrofitted similar to the work Boeing is doing. But other companies could theoretically compete for such a deal: In April 2024, the Air Force awarded the mid-size firm SNC a contract worth $13 billion to convert used 747s into the service’s next fleet of 'Doomsday' planes.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/trump-clearly-not-happy-with-delivery-schedule-for-new-air-force-one-jets-boeing-ceo-says/	2025-02-20T09:34:57-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/GettyImages-2194465096-scaled-e1740070941499.jpg
Air Force awards Pratt $1.5 billion to keep F-22s flying	An F-22 Raptor takes off from Al Dhafra Air Base, United Arab Emirates, Feb. 21, 2022. The F-22s were rapidly deployed to the base earlier in the month on order from the U.S. Secretary of Defense in coordination with the Abu Dhabi Crown Prince and join a range of joint, coalition and allied and partner combat airpower capabilities already based in the region. (U.S. Air Force (photo by Master Sgt. Dan Heaton) WASHINGTON — The Air Force has awarded RTX subsidiary Pratt &amp; Whitney a contract worth up to $1.5 billion to continue sustaining the F119 engine that powers the service’s F-22 Raptor stealth fighters, the company announced today. The sustainment contract for Pratt’s F119 spans three years, according to the company, covering more than 400 powerplants. The single-seat F-22 flies with two engines and is often hailed for its ability to 'supercruise,' or soar at supersonic speeds without using afterburners. 'The F119’s readiness and reliability rates have never been more important, and we are improving both while lowering lifecycle costs,' Jill Albertelli, president of Pratt’s military engines business, said in a statement. 'We are committed to helping our U.S. Air Force customer maintain the F-22’s combat edge.' In a briefing with reporters ahead of the announcement, Caroline Cooper, Pratt’s executive director for the F119 program, reiterated past projections that the company’s Usage Based Lifing effort launched in 2022 — which essentially leverages flight data and engineering algorithms so that maintenance isn’t performed until it’s actually necessary — will save over $800 million across the engine’s lifespan. Asked about assumptions underpinning that forecast, such as fresh uncertainties concerning the longevity of the F-22 fleet given questions about its planned replacement, Pratt said in a statement that the 'constant flow of data' collected from ongoing flight operations 'is continuously re-analyzed and allows the customer to take advantage of the full life of the engine parts while reducing risk to the fleet.' (Company executives have previously explained that the $800 million prediction means that the Air Force can continue operating the fighter the same as it has in the past, but save money by running parts longer, or harness the greater durability of parts to squeeze more performance out of the engine.) Additionally, according to Cooper, Pratt is exploring how to incorporate additively manufactured, or 3D printed, parts into the F119, but deferred on specifics until an announcement is ready at a later date. 'I can say with certainty that we're looking at leveraging additive across Pratt,' she said. RELATED: Turbine ‘fatigue’ issue forced F-22 engine retrofit, Air Force says The Raptor’s development began near the end of the Cold War and continued through the 1990s, though the cessation of superpower competition drove a decision to limit production to 187 copies of the fighter. The airframe itself is built by Lockheed Martin. The Air Force’s Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) fighter was originally envisioned as a direct replacement of the F-22, though the sixth-gen jet is currently in limbo pending a decision by the Trump administration. While NGAD was planned as an air superiority fighter like the F-22 that precedes it, former Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall said in January that as officials weigh alternatives for the platform, one option could be developing it as a multirole fighter tasked with quarterbacking a forthcoming fleet of drone wingmen. '[T]o keep the industrial base going, to get the right concept, the right mix of capability into the Air Force, and do it as efficiently as possible, I think there are a couple of really reasonable options on the table that the next administration is going to want to have to take a look at,' Kendall said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/air-force-awards-pratt-1-5-billion-to-keep-f-22s-flying/	2025-02-20T06:00:57-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/7063324-scaled-e1660672633444.jpg
What’s new in naval tech? Highlights from WEST 2025	Every year, luminaries from the naval community gather in San Diego for the annual WEST conference. Yes, San Diego in February. Never let it be said the sea service isn’t clever. This year’s show was a little different, however. Because the Trump administration is only a few weeks old and no civilians have been confirmed to top navy roles, there was a bit of a leadership vacuum. But that worked out just fine for Breaking Defense reporters Justin Katz and Carley Welch, who were on the ground digging around for the latest naval technologies.

Papua New Guinea, Australia begin hammering out first defense treaty	Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles with Papua New Guinea Defense Minister, Billy Joseph, in Brisbane on Feb. 20, 2025 where they announced the two countries hope to draft and sign a defense treaty. (ADF) TOKYO — A half-century after gaining independence from Australia, the Pacific island state of Papua New Guinea (PNG) and its giant neighbor are negotiating what the two sides hope will become a defense treaty, elevating their security relationship at a tense time in the region. 'This will be a treaty with ambition. It will be the most significant defense agreement between our two countries since Papua New Guinean independence,' Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles told reporters in Brisbane today. It will be 'really fitting' if this country signs a defense treaty with Australia, 'because we got independence from Australia, and, at the same time, we are very close to each other,' PNG's defense minister, Billy Joseph, said at the press conference. Australia created the first Papuan defense force in 1943 to help drive the Japanese out of the Pacific islands during the Second World War and now regularly trains with their forces. Marles said the pending agreement would be 'a pathway of increasing integration and increasing interoperability' with its neighbor just three kilometers to the north. The two countries came close to signing a treaty in December last year but it foundered due to criticism from some PNG politicians. 'The Bilateral Security Agreement that came into effect last December was originally intended to be a treaty-level document, but the PNG side pushed back on that because of perceived legal hurdles with respect to the PNG Constitution,' noted Mihai Sora, a Pacific Islands expert at Sydney's Lowy Institute, international think tank. The treaty is likely to focus on the 'traditional and non-traditional security cooperation where Australia is already a key partner for PNG: military, police, cyber, climate, and so on,' Sora said. But there will probably be more, if not quite a NATO-style pledge that all will come to the aid of any state attacked (Article 5), he said. Sora expected it to likely be an exclusionary pact, one focused on PNG not entering a defense or security agreement with a country, like, say, China. Australia has already forged such agreements with the tiny island states of Nauru and Tuvalu. They allow Australia to veto agreements the islands might try to make with any other country. Australia isn't alone in its focus on PNG. The United States signed an agreement with PNG in May last year. Perhaps the biggest benefit of the deal in the long run for the United States is that it gives US forces access to the joint Australian-PNG facility on Manus Island, where the US built facilities during World War II. Australia is spending at least $175 million AUD ($112 million US) to improve the port. That signing was followed by the first visit to the island state by a US defense secretary, Lloyd Austin. But there are questions about whether these bilateral agreements are the best approach to take with the Pacific Islands. 'Australian governments have been quick to claim these bilateral arrangements as diplomatic wins. But they are the diplomatic equivalent of a Mars Bar: the government gets the sugar-rush of making an announcement, but there is no guarantee that these arrangements will deliver long-term outcomes,' argued Joanne Wallis, a professor in Pacific studies at the University of Adelaide, and her colleague, Salote Tagivakatini, a former Fijian diplomat, in a recent paper for the Australian Institute of International Affairs. They point to the decision by the minuscule Cook Islands, whose residents are citizens of New Zealand, to sign a 'comprehensive strategic partnership' with China as proof this bilateral approach might not be as effective as hoped. The Cook Islands leadership, which is supposed to consult with New Zealand on security and defense issues, failed to do so recently when deciding to sign a strategic pact with China, according to the New Zealand news outlet RNZ. Wallis and Tagivakatini argue the unique culture of the Pacific islands, where governments regard themselves as a 'family' and try to work together on the basis of consensus, runs counter to the spirit of what they call 'transactional' bilateral agreements. The authors say this approach 'risks undermining the Pacific Islands Forum and other regional agencies. Pacific leaders have made clear their desire for Pacific-led regionalism.' But John Blaxland, an Indo-Pacific expert at the Australian National University, said he believes that 'great power competition is more acute today than it has been for generations.' Papua New Guinea is now as important to Australia as it has ever been, and he stressed competition for access and influence has intensified in recent months and years. 'Consolidating and formalizing a defense treaty makes sense in view of the shifting security and defense dynamics,' Blaxland told Breaking Defense. This treaty, should it be signed, 'can't be taken for granted,' he wrote in an email. 'This is a time of what can be described as unrestricted competition in the legal, media, psychological and economic domains. Australia cannot afford to rest on its laurels about maintaining deep, trusted and effectively collaborative relations between Australia and PNG.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/papua-new-guinea-australia-begin-hammering-out-first-defense-treaty/	2025-02-20T04:03:42-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/20250220adf8671822_6893-scaled-e1740052603340.jpeg
Hanwha’s new global defense chief eyes aggressive expansion in every direction	A Hanwha K9 howitzer on display at IDEX 2025. (Breaking Defense) IDEX 2025 — On the job for less than two months, the new head of global defense business for Hanwha Aerospace has his sights set on helping to make the South Korean defense firm a major industrial player worldwide. Just don't ask him to prioritize one market over another. 'So to be a global leader we need position in the largest defense markets in the world &#8230; [the] United States, Europe, Middle East, Asia. So I would say you have to be focused on all of them,' Michael Coulter, who was appointed to the role in December, told Breaking Defense in an interview from Hanwha's expansive floor space at IDEX 2025 here in Abu Dhabi. Encouraged in recent years by a more defense export-friendly government in Seoul, Coulter said Hanwha made significant strides before his tenure to go global, including major contract wins in Australia, Poland, Romania and Egypt. But he said the company now aims to use each as a springboard to more business in each region. 'We've been doing export for 15, 20 years, but it's just been in recent years that we've really been reaching out to create [a] global defense industrial base, creating global partnerships, partnerships in local countries,' he said. Coulter, who was at Leonardo DRS before joining Hanwha, described the US as a key market, but acknowledged the firm has a 'modest' presence there so far. A 2023 rejection for the Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle, he said, has not stopped the company's 'commitment' to the American military market, and there are discussions with the US Army about 'various capabilities.' (Coulter did not identify any specifically, but Breaking Defense has reported that Hanwha's howitzer was among those recently observed when Army officials went on a global evaluation tour.) Michael Coulter, head of global defense at Hanwha Aerospace, speaks to Breaking Defense at IDEX 2025. (Courtesy Hanwha) Naval systems could also be a significant opportunity for Hanwha in the US, as Coulter said there have been discussions with the Navy about leveraging Hanwha's recent takeover of Philly Shipyard to eventually bolster the service's fleet. Coulter said Hanwha is keeping an especially close eye on Europe, where Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine and the expected shift of US military support away from the continent under the Trump administration have spurred European nations to race to shore up their own capabilities. 'As European defense budgets increase, its important for us bring the strength of Korea but also to be European,' Coulter said. 'So we are investing in partnerships and facilities and workforce in Europe.' The deal with Romania in which Hanwha will build a facility to be a 'production house for land force capability' is also meant to give the firm 'really a domestic industrial base in Europe,' Coulter said. 'We're having similar conversations in Poland and in other countries in Europe as well.' As for the Middle East, Hanwha took the opportunity at IDEX to bring in a full-sized K9 howitzer, showing publicly for the first time a version of the platform that used a Korean-built engine. The first Korean-made K9s are expected to go operational with the Egyptian military later this year, a Hanwha spokesperson told Breaking Defense, with locally produced versions expected in 2026. Beyond Egypt, Coulter said there are 'very active' conversations in the Gulf with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Regionally, he said, there's 'sincere' concern about the threat of ballistic missiles and therefore there's an appetite for defenses against them — another investment area for Hanwha. Finally in the Indo-Pacific region, Coulter highlighted Hanwha's expected outsized presence in South Korea, but also its victories in Australia in competitive infantry fighting vehicle and howitzer programs. The Lucky Country could be, Coulter said, another springboard to larger markets. 'We're producing those in Australia for use by the Australian military, but with an eye to being a global supplier out of a domestic presence in Australia,' he said. 'So, very strong support from the Commonwealth for not just further capabilities in Australia, but then to using that hub in Australia as a global supply chain platform.' But with all that said, Coulter said Hanwha is interested in expanding not just in a geographical sense, but a 'functional' one too. 'And that means building up partnerships around the world, be those partnerships with militaries and governments, to partnerships with technology companies, to partnerships with industrial partners to grow capacity around the world,' he said. That kind of 'functional growth,' Hanwha is 'very focused on.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/hanwhas-new-global-defense-chief-eyes-aggressive-expansion-in-every-direction/	2025-02-20T00:35:47-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/20250218_104955-scaled-e1739970691806.jpg
Saab unveils UAE-developed Coast Control Radar at IDEX 2025	Saab's UAE arm showcases a new radar at IDEX 2025. (Agnes Helou / Breaking Defense) IDEX 2025 — Sweden's Saab unveiled a new radar at the Abu Dhabi defense show IDEX, this one developed in the United Arab Emirates through the government-affiliated Tawazun Industrial Park. The next-generation Coast Control Radar, which was on display at IDEX 2025, is a static, non-rotating system that uses phased-array software. 'It's crucial to have this kind of new technique, [with] low maintenance [requirement], as it's a non-rotating radar. That is kind of the key features that takes this radar into the kind of next generation,' Saab’s UAE managing director Heléne Bittmann told Breaking Defense in an interview at the show. The new radar is designed to safeguard territorial waters and to detect smaller vessels at a time when maritime security poses a big concern in the Middle East region, especially in light of continuous attacks on shipping lanes in the Red Sea and Arabian Gulf. 'I think for the UAE, it's really important to be indigenous, having their own kind of securing and defense capabilities, making sure their people and society are kept safe,' Bittmann said. She added that Saab UAE is in continuous discussion with Tawazun, the governmental entity charged with procurement and development, to align with the country’s vision. 'Designed for easy integration into infrastructure such as buildings, towers, and waterway bridges, the Coast Control Radar ensures flexible installation and can offer comprehensive 360-degree coverage. Its modular design minimises installation challenges while also offering routine software upgrades for continued exceptional detection and performance,' the company said in a statement. The coast guard radar is the second system developed by Saab UAE and uses Emirati intellectual property. The other was DeployNet, a portable 5G network provider column that the company says can be easily deployed to provide network services in rural or remote environments. DeployNet was also on display at the firm’s exhibition display. 'We see that there is a global need for this [radar]. The [need] for this kind of radars for the Coast Guard, and even more so now securing waterways will become more and more important. So we do see a genuine interest,' Bittmann said. She expected that Saab UAE 'will have the opportunity to grow even more. That's my ambition. And they have invested a lot in the UAE, and we're here to stay and to continue to drive that.' Bittmann concluded that the firm’s next five-year plan is to continue to focus on the sensor software and radar capabilities.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/saab-unveils-uae-developed-coast-control-radar-at-idex-2025/	2025-02-19T22:51:52-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/250220_IDEX_saab_radar_AGNES-e1740032823193.jpg
Pentagon seeks to shift $50B in planned funding to new priorities in FY26	Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth is greeted by Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Air Force Gen. CQ Brown, Jr. at the Pentagon, Washington, D.C., Jan. 27, 2025. (DoD photo by U.S. Navy Petty Officer 1st Class Alexander Kubitza) WASHINGTON — Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has ordered a review of the department's fiscal 2026 budget plans in order to shift funds from legacy programs towards President Donald Trump's priorities, including border security and the Iron Dome for America. The goal: Find roughly $50 billion, or 8 percent of the FY26 plan, and reprioritize it. 'Secretary Hegseth has directed a review to identify offsets from the Biden Administration’s FY26 budget that could be realigned from low-impact and low-priority Biden-legacy programs to align with President Trump’s America First priorities for our national defense,' acting Deputy Secretary of Defense Robert Salesses said in a Wednesday night statement. 'The Department will develop a list of potential offsets that could be used to fund these priorities, as well as to refocus the Department on its core mission of deterring and winning wars. The offsets are targeted at 8% of the Biden Administration’s FY26 budget, totaling around $50 billion, which will then be spent on programs aligned with President Trump’s priorities.' While not noted in the Salesses statement, the Washington Post earlier today reported that the 8 percent shift would not just be for FY26, but for each year of the five-year long Future Years Defense Program (FYDP) that accompanies the annual budget request. After the statement was released, Breaking Defense obtained a portion of Hegseth's memo, which lists 17 'offsets' which 'may not be included by services and component in their eight percent decrease' recommendations. Those are: It's unclear what kind of programs will be targeted outside this list, although Salesses in his statement said the department will target 'unnecessary spending' like 'so-called &#8216;climate change' and other woke programs, as well as excessive bureaucracy.' It's also unclear if the decision not to exempt support for EUCOM, AFRICOM, CENTCOM or SOUTHCOM is a sign that those regions may be downplayed as priorities. It's not unusual for a new administration to take a look at the previous administration's planned budget, though the statement tonight would seem to indicate a greater shift than previous teams go for in their first budget request. This effort would seem to be a parallel but different one from the cuts expected to be pushed by the Elon Musk-led DOGE office, which arrived this week at the Pentagon. Those in defense circles are bracing for a wave of personnel cuts, perhaps as soon as this week, as probationary employees in the civilian workforce have been early targets of DOGE during their other stops. How the idea of cuts lines up with proposals in Congress to increase the department's budget by either $100 billion or $150 billion through the reconciliation process is unclear, nor is it clear how members of Congress will react to having programs — potentially major ones — in their districts impacted. It's also uncertain when the FY26 budget might actually be delivered to Congress.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/pentagon-seeks-to-shift-50b-in-planned-funding-to-new-priorities-in-fy26/	2025-02-19T15:38:01-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/hegseth-brown-scaled-e1740007139471.jpg
Pentagon 14% of the way to zero trust compliance, faces challenges with ICAM, data tagging	The Network Enterprise Technology Command (NETCOM) &#8211; Army Department of Defense Information Networks (DoDIN-A) Cybersecurity Strategy uses Zero-Trust principles to protect critical Data, Applications, Assets, and Services (DAAS). (Photo by U.S. Army Network Enterprise Technology Command) WASHINGTON — The Department of Defense is 14 percent of the way on its goal of having all enterprise networks zero trust compliant by the end of fiscal year 2027, a key official said Wednesday. 'Fourteen percent is a good start, but far from being done,' Col. Gary Kipe, chief of staff of the DoD’s zero trust portfolio management office, said during a panel at a CyberScoop event. He added that the 14 percent constitutes areas specifically where 'we could stop adversarial lateral movement within our network.' Kipe said there are two major deficiencies in the DoD’s zero trust capabilities keeping it from achieving that 100 percent readiness. The first is the lack of identity, credential, and access management (ICAM) tools — which perform constant checks to ensure that users are allowed to access the information they are trying to access. The second is the lack of automated data tagging that helps label and categorize data based on sensitivity, importance and other standards to facilitate better data management and protect the data from unauthorized users. 'We do have an optimistic but reasonable anticipation that we're going to have both of those by the end of this FY, which is critical,' Kipel said of the deficiencies. 'Then we'll be able to plan around it, resource it, proof of concept it and develop it further until we get to [20]27.' Kipe particularly harped on the important role data tagging plays in creating data centricity, which ultimately allows the DoD to share information on threats with the broader intelligence community, allies and partners, he explained. RELATED: Katie Arrington to head back into Pentagon as new CISO 'It's got to be interoperable between the DoD, [civilians in the federal government], the IC [intelligence community] and Five Eyes and other mission partner environments. We're not the only target that damn communists are trying to overcome,' Kipe said. 'They're trying to overcome freedom loving people around the world, and all of us are using the same data.' If such data tagging standards are not implemented, Kipe said 'it won’t matter because we will have lost the broader fight, and that is defending liberty around the world.' John Sahlin, the vice president of cyber solutions at General Dynamics Information Technology, echoed Kipe’s statements on the importance of data tagging leading to data centricity during the panel. 'Zero trust is about enabling a mission, and ultimately, we need to use that data collectively to pursue mission objectives, and those mission objectives include dangerous stuff,' Sahlin said, referencing Kipe’s anecdotes about the risk adversaries poses to democracy. He added that once the DoD can implement the 'basics' of data tagging and implementing zero trust at the enterprise level, it can start to more widely implement zero trust at the tactical edge — something the company demonstrated back in 2023. 'We need to be able to enable the mission commanders with the ability to make changes on the fly under what conditions and with whom we're sharing data, so that we can execute the mission,' Sahlin said. 'That's where it gets really interesting. If we get the basics right, then we could really do some cool stuff at the tactical edge.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/pentagon-14-of-the-way-to-zero-trust-compliance-faces-challenges-with-icam-data-tagging/	2025-02-19T13:54:09-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/7974050-scaled.jpg
DoD needs to clarify Space Force roles and missions: Mitchell workshop	Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman delivers a keynote address on the state of the Space Force during the Air and Space Forces Association 2024 Warfare Symposium in Aurora, Colo., Feb. 13, 2024. (US Air Force photo by Eric Dietrich) WASHINGTON — The Pentagon urgently needs to clarify the roles and missions of the Space Forceand how it relates to US Space Command, the Intelligence Community and the other military services,according to a new report from the Mitchell Institute. Only then will the newest military service be able to successfully articulate and advocate for its long-term needs to deter China with the US Congress, the executive branch and the American public, the report concludes. Those needs, the report stressed, include an explicit mandate and funding to develop and deploy 'offensive' weapons, as well as increased resources across the board. The report — 'Ensuring a Spacepower Advantage in Prolonged Competition: Findings and Recommendations from the Space Endurance Workshop' released today [PDF] — was the result of a two-day workshop involving 55 space experts from diverse backgrounds 'to examine how the United States, its allies, and partners can maintain an enduring spacepower advantage,' according to institute's website. The workshop also focused on a review of the 'theory of competitive endurance' put forward by Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman in 2023 to guide Space Force operations against six futuristic scenarios where US space power was challenged, and found it somewhat wanting. Charles Galbreath, one of the two Mitchell authors along with Jennifer Reeves, explained today that the problem with Saltzman's theory, identified during the workshop, is its focus on 'enduring' — resisting attacks via deterrence and resilience — rather than on 'winning.' 'The tenets of competitive endurance — responsible counterspace campaigning, domain awareness, resiliency in the architecture — those are solid lines of effort. It's kind of the wrapping, though, of competitive endurance, as opposed to a war winning concept, a war fighting strategy, that we think needs to change,' Galbreath said in response to a question from Breaking Defense during Mitchell's online rollout of the report. Key findings of the workshop included: The US Space Force Must Clearly Explain Its Roles and Missions. 'Failure to establish and convey these roles and missions could lead to confusion among the services, reduced funding from Congress, and a deterioration of national will to maintain leadership in space,' the report says. Thus, it adds, 'the Department of Defense needs to clearly define the roles and missions of the Space Force. Once defined, Space Force must pursue an aggressive and persistent campaign to communicate them.' Space Must Be Normalized as a Warfighting Domain. 'Normalizing space as a warfighting domain necessitates changes to policy, funding, understanding, and operational capabilities,' the report says. 'While some fear such developments could drive a destabilizing arms race in space, it is important to recognize that credible deterrence is the only viable path given adversary decisions. Peace through strength needs to become the new mantra for twenty-first century spacepower.' An Overreliance on Commercial Space May Be Detrimental. 'On one side, commercial space greatly expands access to rapid innovation and an increasing set of services available for integration. On the other, an overemphasis on the capabilities commercial entities can ostensibly provide detracts from the critical roles of the Space Force, which is dedicated to national space security in ways private entities are not,' the report explains. Guardians Must Adopt a Space Warfighting Mindset. 'The lack of defined and clearly articulated roles and missions, the lingering view of space as a benign domain, and the encroachment of commercial entities in space security roles have a compounding effect' on the way Guardians perceive themselves and their missions that undercut their ability to advocate the Space Force's criticality to future warfighting, the report finds. Improved Space Domain Awareness Is Critical. The report notes that each of the scenarios ran during the workshop 'underscored the importance' of space domain awareness, as well as the need to lower classification barriers to sharing space data with allies and partners. Allied and Partner Cooperation &amp; Integration Are Essential. 'Like the discussion on commercial space capabilities, workshop participants asserted that the Space Force needed to take a proactive leadership role in defining what effects and necessary contributions each ally and partner could provide,' the report says. Further, it recommends that the service expand force integration beyond the current 5 Eyes partners (Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom), up the number of Guardians working on partnerships, increase combined force exercises and 'enable' more space-related foreign military sales. Improved Space Warfighting Training Infrastructure is a Critical Enabler. Not only do the Space Force and SPACECOM need improved training capabilities and infrastructure, including 'advanced simulators,' for their own use, but also require the ability to allow allies and partners to train in tandem with Guardians. International Norms Are Key to Responsible Space Behaviors. 'By proactively defining which actions in space are acceptable and which will lead to the escalation of tensions, the United States will be positioned to rally international support to counter hostilities,' the report asserts. Reeves told Mitchell's online audience today that the institute will follow-up with another workshop in the October timeframe focusing specifically on what conflict in space might look like. Galbreath elaborated that the workshop will be held at the unclassified level, even though that will 'create some some tension for many people.' Doing so, he said, will allow 'thorough discussions' about, &#8216;What does space conflict mean? Where do we draw the line between competition and conflict? &#8230; Is there a tripwire for space'?' The goal, he added, is 'expanding the the field of thinking in that area, and looking at how if we ever do go to conflict, can we end it as quickly as possible on terms that are favor favorable to United States and our allies.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/dod-needs-to-clarify-space-force-roles-and-missions-mitchell-workshop/	2025-02-19T13:00:05-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/240717_DVIDS_saltzman_speech_8238081-scaled-e1721238990255.jpg
Securing data at rest on Edge devices with layered protection	Keeping sensitive and classified mission data safe isn’t optional—it’s essential. Cyber threats are more sophisticated, compliance requirements are stricter than ever, and organizations must secure data across a growing mix of traditional and unconventional devices. From endpoint systems, including PCs and servers, to industrial control systems and unmanned vehicles, every device that collects, processes, and stores sensitive information is a potential target. Without a multi-layered approach to security, organizations risk unauthorized data access, potentially exposing critical mission information. To meet compliance requirements effectively, organizations must adopt an integrated security framework that protects data at rest while the device is in operation and at end of life. The White House, NSA, NIAP, and DISA have implemented requirements for encryption and secure authentication and access controls to meet compliance requirements, including CSfC for DAR, FIPs and EO 14028. However, compliance is only part of the equation—security measures also need to be practical, ensuring personnel can work efficiently while keeping data protected. Unfortunately, many traditional security methods fall short against today’s evolving threats. Risks include: To address these challenges, agencies must ensure data security at every layer, leveraging software and hardware-based solutions. The first line of defense in securing data at rest is ensuring that encryption and authentication mechanisms are robust and tamper-proof. Other data security products’ protection ceases once a device is activated. But mission data needs to be protected when a device is operational with capabilities to mitigate risks, including unauthorized data extraction, data tampering and malicious insiders.

In response to Viasat suit, SDA will recompete 10-satellite award to Tyvak	Space Development Agency graphic WASHINGTON — As a result of a lawsuit by Viasat, the Department of the Air Force has agreed to revoke a Space Development Agency award to Tyvak Nano-Satellite Systems worth $254 million for 10 experimental fire-control satellites, and reopen bidding. Documents filed on Feb. 14 in the US Court of Federal Claims by the Air Force, first reported by Aviation Week, further state that SDA's companion contract to York Space Systems — worth $170 million for 10 Tranche 2 Transport Layer (T2TL) Gamma variant prototype space vehicles — will not be affected. The court filings do not provide a proposed schedule for the new bid process, but do reveal that it will be managed by officials who were not involved in overseeing the original contract awards. Neither the Space Development Agency nor the Air Force responded by press time to inquiries about the proposed resolution of the protest. As first reported by Breaking Defense, the Viasat bid protest filed in September was the trigger for the Air Force's Jan. 16 decision to place SDA Director Derek Tournear on administrative leave. The Feb. 14 court documents state that an internal Air Force evaluation determined that an unnamed 'SDA employee,' in advance of the Gamma contract award, revealed to Tyvak that its bid price 'was the second highest and would not be selected for award.' This action was determined by the senior Air Force official in charge of the review, Maj. Gen. Alice Trevino, to be a violation of the Procurement Integrity Act that regulates government contracting practices. The documents note that the rebidding process was deemed necessary by SDA because the requirement for the 10 Gamma vehicles awarded to Tyvak, now a subsidiary of Lockheed Martin, remains crucial to the success of its Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture of low Earth orbit satellites — but with the caveat that a substantial delay in the process and/or increased costs could cause a reevaluation of that requirement and the need for a new competition. While SDA has explained that the Gamma satellites will not be part of the operational Transport Layer of data relay satellites, the agency has said that they instead are part of its efforts to develop fire control capabilities for missile defense and the experimental FOO Fighter program. Further, such fire control capabilities could be a key part of SDA's contribution to the Trump administration's newly planned Iron Dome for America missile defense shield. Attorneys for Tyvak and York have accepted the Air Force's plan, the Air Force court filings state. However, the documents add that Viasat had not responded to the proposal as of the time of their filing. 'Viasat does not comment on ongoing filings and litigation as matter of policy,' a spokesperson for the company told Breaking Defense today. 'York is a strong supporter of transparency and the integrity of the USG’s selection process. We are glad the investigation made public some of its findings that clearly show York was not involved in any wrongdoing, and support the integrity of our award on merits,' a spokesperson for the company said today. Lockheed Martin did not respond by press time to a request for comment.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/in-response-to-viasat-suit-sda-will-recompete-10-satellite-award-to-tyvak/	2025-02-19T11:17:10-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-07-at-1.42.29-PM.png
Katie Arrington to head back into Pentagon as new CISO	Chief Information Security Officer for Acquisitions Katie Arrington delivers a keynote speech during the Military Satellite Communications Digital Week, the Pentagon, Washington, D.C., Dec. 8, 2020. (DoD photo by Lisa Ferdinando) WASHINGTON — Former chief information security officer (CISO) for acquisition and sustainment at the Department of Defense is headed back to the Pentagon — this time as DoD's CISO — following her previous suspension from the department for allegedly disclosing classified data. Katie Arrington served as a state lawmaker for South Carolina and had an unsuccessful bid for Congress before taking her post in 2019 as the chief information officer for A&amp;S during President Donald Trump’s first administration. She played an active role in standing up the department’s Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) program before she was put on administrative leave in May 2021 after the National Security Agency suspended her security clearance for allegedly sharing top secret information to a defense contractor. Arrington announced her new role on Tuesday night with a LinkedIn post. Following Arrington’s suspension, she resigned in February 2022 because of the DoD’s decision to move the CMMC program from the office of acquisition and sustainment to its Chief Information Office, according to a resignation letter obtained by SC Media. She contended in the letter that her suspension was 'politically influenced' and maintained that such claims of disclosing classified information were false. The day after Arrington resigned from the Pentagon, she announced a second bid for Congress which she subsequently lost to Republican South Carolina House lawmaker Nancy Mace. The DoD did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding the status of Arrington’s ability to obtain a security clearance or the status of the investigation into the accusations that she shared classified information. The department also did not respond to comment on Arrington’s claims that the investigation was 'politically influenced.' The NSA deferred to the DoD for comment. According to a 2022 report from Federal News Network, Arrington’s attorney, Mark Zaid, said Arrington was, as of then, still challenging the government’s decision to suspend her security clearance and the following effort to permanently revoke it.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/katie-arrington-to-head-back-into-pentagon-as-new-ciso/	2025-02-19T09:55:29-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/6447505-scaled-e1739982663234.jpg
DARPA plans ‘major expansion’ of quantum computing push next month	A graphic concept of quantum technology depicts two ships at sea in the background and a large, stylized molecule in the foreground. (U.S. Navy illustration by NIWC Pacific/Released.) WASHINGTON — The self-proclaimed 'quantum skeptic' heading DARPA’s Quantum Benchmarking Initiative (QBI) tells Breaking Defense he is 'pleasantly surprised' by how many companies’ quantum computing plans look feasible — and as a result, he’s weeks away from announcing a slew of new awards. The point of the QBI program is not to pay the private sector to develop the tech, which they’re already doing on their own, according to program manager Joe Altepeter. Instead, in essence, a company that wins a QBI award gets access to DARPA’s interagency team of expert testers and devil’s advocates, serving as an independent outside check to make sure that they’re on a practical path. Tech titan Microsoft and specialist startup PsiQuantum have already won contracts for the initial, pilot-project version of the program, known clunkily as Underexplored Systems for Utility-Scale Quantum Computing or US2QC. ('You can tell why we changed it to ‘QBI,’' Altepeter said). Two other companies, Atom Computing and QC82, also won preliminary, short-term grants in 2023, but their proposals didn’t survive subsequent rounds of more intensive scrutiny. So only two of four competing firms made it all the way through the three-phase process to win one of the long-term 'Stage C' contracts announced Feb. 6. That 50 percent success rate is actually much better than Altepeter expected. 'That was definitely surprising,' he told Breaking Defense. 'I didn't think anybody was going to make it to Stage C. But that's why we do this, to get surprised.' So a 'major expansion' to 'bring in many more companies' is now underway, Altepeter said. 'We've gotten finished with source selection [and] sent out letters inviting all the companies who've made it into stage A to negotiate a contract…. My best guess is late March, we're going to have the vast majority of those contracts signed.' RELATED: Pentagon info officer’s top priority: Upgrading cryptography ahead of quantum-enabled hackers In this new round of competition, once again, Altepeter said many competitors exceeded his expectations for how far along their tech is and how feasible their plans are to build reliable, practical, and usefully powerful quantum computers. As a result, 'we'll have the chance to kick the tires on a lot more companies,' he said. 'A year from now, we’ll know a lot more about if this industry is for real or not.' How does that timeline work? The process is meant to be flexible, with the schedule accommodating what companies think is required, and companies that fail at one stage of the evaluation — like Atom and QC82 — are welcome to come back for a second shot. But overall, Altepeter said, QBI goes like this: At each stage, the size and cost of the DARPA team roughly doubles, Altepeter said. Currently, it consists of roughly 200 quantum experts from across the government — including Energy Department labs like Los Alamos as well as Defense Department labs like the Air Force Research Laboratory — and government-funded research centers, such as Johns Hopkins. (These personnel will remain with their home organization but spend roughly 60 to 70 percent of their time on DARPA quantum work). The idea, he said, is to get independent, expert feedback from professionals with no financial stake in the outcome either way. With new technologies, it’s all too easy to get sucked in by hype cycles and impressive statistics, Altepeter said, so it’s critical, and difficult, to figure out the right way to measure progress. Track the wrong metrics, he warned, and you end up with the equivalent of assessing a space-launch program by highest altitude achieved to date, a superficially reasonable approach that ends up grading grifters who can climb a ladder over professionals conducting static rocket-motor tests. 'We are building by far the best, largest test and evaluation team for quantum computing on the planet,' Altepeter summed up. '[We’re] planning for this to be a $1 billion-plus program.' This kind of careful evaluation isn’t cheap, he acknowledged, and if too many companies prove qualified, he may not have enough funding to give all of them awards. 'It’s a double-edged sword,' Altepeter said. 'I'm pleasantly surprised that these companies were doing so well. I also worry that we couldn't eliminate as many companies, because we're definitely trying to eliminate companies.' Could the Trump Administration's controversial ongoing cuts to government agencies, spearheaded by Elon Musk's DOGE, cramp or cripple the Quantum Benchmarking Initiative just as it's trying to grow? Altepeter demurred on those 'bigger-scope&#8230;budget issues.' That said, when it comes to federal funding, 'it's always a danger that there are other priorities that take precedence,' he said. 'But my marching orders are the same as they have been since we started this&#8230;which is to sprint as fast as possible and get ready for a world-changing program.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/darpa-plans-major-expansion-of-quantum-computing-push-next-month/	2025-02-19T09:01:42-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/quantumn-navy-e1739907798420.jpg
Pentagon’s $96M wearable contract sparks protest, accusations of vendor preference	Tom Hale, chief executive officer of Oura Health Oy, wears an Oura Ring during an interview in San Francisco, California, US, on Friday, June 14, 2024. ( David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images) WASHINGTON – A contract to provide the Defense Health Agency (DHA) with millions of dollars of biometric trackers has been hit with a second protest, with accusations that the agency is seeking to tailor the contract to give it to a preferred vendor. The issue puts a spotlight on the Pentagon’s attempts to work with new technology firms, and has raised the ire of a member of Congress — all against the looming backdrop of expected cuts to acquisition programs at the Department of Defense, as Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, team get the knives out. Last August, the DHA put up a notice on the government contracting site Sam.gov, announcing it was going to sole-source a $96 million contract for wearable devices and a 'wellbeing platform' to Ouraring, the US subsidiary of Finnish firm Oura Health. The wellbeing platform refers to a system that takes data from a user’s wearable device, for example a ring, watch or band, and creates a custom plan based on what the user’s biometrics indicate needs improvement. The company’s rings had become a popular device among members of the military during the COVID-19 pandemic, and now, it seemed DHA planned to outfit its team of nurses and doctors with the items in order to better track biometric data. While $96 million isn’t major by Pentagon standards it was a big win for Oura; for comparison, its December series D round of fundraising was $200 million. But it didn’t take long for the deal to hit a snag. Wearable company WHOOP contacted the Government Accountability Office, protesting the award, saying the intent to sole source lacked sufficient information. Shortly after, the DHA wrote to GAO that they were going to cancel the sole source contract and requested that the WHOOP protest be dismissed. (Breaking Defense obtained a copy and verified the protest documents.) Then, when the initial contract was cancelled, another request for information and subsequent request for proposal was posted to Sam.gov by the DHA in November and December respectively, specifying that the wearable must be a ring — something WHOOP says was designed to still hand the award over to Oura by default. DHA has acknowledged to lawmakers that Oura is the only wearable ring company that is cleared by DoD for use in secure facilities, according to documents reviewed by Breaking Defense. So in January, WHOOP issued a second, previously unreported, protest. A response is due by mid-April. 'WHOOP is eager to compete on a level playing field for the opportunity to provide wearables and wellbeing solutions to our warfighters and all those who support them. We regret that DHA leadership has decided, for no discernibly valid reason, to effectively sole source this requirement to a foreign company,' a WHOOP spokesperson wrote in a statement to Breaking Defense. 'In this case, the agency's ‘ring-based form factor’ requirement is unnecessarily restrictive, excluding companies constituting more than 97% of the current commercial market. We hope that DHA leadership reconsiders its approach and allows innovative American companies like WHOOP to compete.' Neither Oura nor DHA responded to requests for comment by press time. Rep. Morgan Luttrell, R-Texas, a member of the House Armed Services Committee’s Cyber, Information Technologies and Innovation subcommittee, told Breaking Defense that he was alarmed by what seems to be a push to sole-source the deal. 'It is the responsibility of the Department of Defense to ensure that our warfighters have access to the newest biometric technology by spreading funding across multiple wearable biometric companies, rather than relying on a single provider,' Luttrell wrote in a statement to Breaking Defense. 'Competition drives innovation, strengthens national security, and ensures our warfighters get the best gear possible. Relying on a single provider limits options and slows progress,' he added. When Breaking Defense asked Luttrell’s office if he plans on advising the DHA to reconsider their choice in exclusively soliciting for a ring option, a spokesperson told Breaking Defense, 'Rep. Luttrell thinks that different biometric monitoring devices serve distinct purposes and exclusively investing in the Oura Ring raises concerns. Our office is reviewing the matter and will provide updates soon!' The Pentagon’s interest in wearable technology puts Oura and other wearable creators in good company. According to one report, the wearable technology market size is worth roughly $70.3 billion. Another report puts that number at $74.6 billion. Regardless of the actual figure, it’s clear it’s a growing business — and one that the DoD can find many uses for, given the focus on health and fitness in the military. But wearables come in many sizes and shapes, so to get the best results, the user should be given choices to find what fits best for them, Sam Howell, an associate fellow with the Technology and National Security Program at the Center for a New American Security (CNAS), told Breaking Defense. 'Having continuous data is the most important thing. People aren't going to wear the device unless it's comfortable [for] them. So, I do think there is a lot of benefit in giving folks some flexibility to choose what's most comfortable for them and their lifestyle,' said Howell. 'Another big component is they have to trust that the device is accurate, or they're not necessarily going to put any stock in the insights that are gleaned from them, and then the whole point is kind of defeated. So if there's a service member that, for example, trusts the Ouraring more than, let's just say, a Garmin, I do think there's value in allowing them to use the device they personally trust the most.' Asked to speculate why DHA may be emphasizing the ring option, Howell said in her experience rings 'probably give the most accurate heart rate reading, because it's directly on your finger.' However, she noted that doctors usually take off rings to perform surgeries — the kind of situation where you most want biometric data, if you’re trying to understand how someone is operating at their peak. Jerry McGinn, executive director of the Greg and Camille Baroni Center for Government Contracting at George Mason University, told Breaking Defense that though there is 'likely' a reason the DHA is choosing a ring, 'it would be helpful if they explain their rationale in their RFI and RFP,' something both solicitations did not include. 'Whether that's grounds for GAO to uphold the protest, I don’t know,' he added. 'It is a little surprising that after the protest of the sole source award, that the government wouldn't explain a bit more their rationale for seeking a ring solution as opposed to other solutions.' No one involved could have realized it when the protest began, but the contract dispute may be coming at a bad time. Members of DOGE, the Elon Musk-organized group that has been actively seeking government cuts on behalf of the White House, arrived at the Pentagon this week. And while $96 million may not seem like a lot of money, it feels like everything in the so-called 'fourth estate' —the parts of the Pentagon that, like DHA, don’t fall under the services — is at risk. 'I think pretty much every contract or solicitation that’s out there has got a lot of uncertainty now, so that is for darn sure,' McGinn said. And while he said he could see reasons for the wearable contract to go through, 'there’s bound to be some kind of changes' with DoD acquisition spending. Which potentially means that whomever ends up prevailing in this fitness tracker dispute may still have to sweat out if they’ll be getting their money.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/pentagons-96m-wearable-contract-sparks-protest-accusations-of-vendor-preference/	2025-02-19T06:25:28-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/oura-ring-scaled-e1739913886921.jpg
In EMSO, the small stuff matters	Imagine being tasked with solving the following problem: Find a way to double the traffic capacity on the DC Beltway without decreasing speeds – and please find a way to accomplish this using less highway real estate than currently exists. The ask is seemingly impossible as the infrastructure in place does not allow the current traffic flow to approach posted speed limits! The electromagnetic warfare (EW) community is facing a similar challenge as bandwidth requirements skyrocket and weight and size specifications continue to shrink. Today’s electromagnetic operating environment (EMOE) requires systems that can collect, process, and transmit vast amounts of data and dissipate the heat generated along the way. Basically, future systems need to be the smaller highway that can throughput more cars. Without the material science advances required to achieve the bandwidth and light-weight requirements needed for future manned and unmanned systems, the U.S. and its allies will be at a disadvantage in attaining spectrum superiority. Gone are the days when electronic warfare consisted of a joint restricted frequency list and the noise jamming of steady, single-frequency early warning radars. Successful electromagnetic spectrum operations (EMSO) must now contend with a congested, contested spectrum that includes adversary systems with pulse-to-pulse frequency and pulse width modulations that are much harder to identify and defeat. As we are seeing in the Ukraine conflict, the ability to gain and maintain electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) superiority will play a major role in a nation’s ability to succeed in operations across all warfare domains, and EW systems and operations can no longer afford to be an afterthought. From the Vietnam War through operations in support of the global war on terror, EW planning did not receive the same level of priority as the air-to-air and air-to-ground mission planning. When commanders devised operational plans and execution orders to conduct in-depth operations through complex integrated air defense systems, they relegated the integration of U.S. and allied EW capabilities to a limited number of experts who had studied the spectrum and knew how to use it to our advantage. However, as warfare has evolved in the 21st century, adversary capabilities across the EMS have forced the U.S. and our allies to revisit what EW capabilities we need and how we integrate them into the platforms and systems that we acquire. Realizing the importance of EW, in the October 2020, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) released the Electromagnetic Spectrum Superiority Strategy, which includes the need to develop superior EMS capabilities. Specifically, the strategy tasks the department to leverage and adapt commercial technologies and to collaborate with commercial companies to leverage the innovation and experience those companies offer in their fields of expertise. This is a potential game changer and extremely advantageous way to solve difficult problems, such as those encountered in the development of new, agile EW systems. Many of these companies, including W. L. Gore and Associates (Gore), are non-traditional defense companies and bring a wealth of talent and capabilities to the development cycle. For example, Gore is a materials science company that uses its current and advanced materials expertise to develop and design lightweight, high performance cables that provide system performance enhancements and weight savings. Including the non-traditional companies early in the design cycle allows the large defense ecosystem to leverage those capabilities in system trades. Whether it’s a cable, thermal material, or other capabilities, bringing this expertise into the fight can be a huge advantage. In this process, the integration of cables and connectors, and the ability to dissipate heat from high performance systems, should be included in the base designs. Just as the USG has realized the importance of integrating EW into the early planning process, Gore believes that the program offices and prime contractors would benefit from incorporating commercial companies with a history of material science expertise into their early planning and designs. For more than 60 years, Gore has partnered with the U.S. government, allies and partners, and the defense industrial base to anticipate the next revolution of aerospace and defense technology. Gore invented the flexible microwave assembly in the 1970s and, in cooperation with government and industry partners, solved seemingly intractable challenges by advancing the boundaries of material science and reliable performance. Welcoming the challenge to innovate, the team continues to create reliable material science solutions that will help ensure future EMSO systems keep pace with the rapid proliferation of threats. Similar to how operational planners historically added EW at the end of planning, acquisition teams often do the same for the wire and cable associated with EW systems. Often thought of as a commodity, the cabling is often purchased on a lowest cost, technically acceptable basis, focusing on program expenditures instead of lifetime costs. In the emerging EMOE, technically feasible must rise to a new level. When survivability is measured by detection ranges and response times, every decibel is critical. The question remains as to how to translate this imperative into successful, high-performing, cost-effective programs. Gore innovators and engineers have combined for over 3,500 patented inventions, including advanced cables and assemblies. These products have an esteemed track record of succeeding in harsh environments, from supersonic flight to low-earth orbit to Mars and beyond. Less well-known, but equally impressive is Gore’s applications expertise, which provides the appropriate technology for specific requirements like EMSO. Gore is currently supporting multiple programs to upgrade the EMSO capabilities of fourth-generation aircraft, with these enhancements further improving their survivability. Contributing its materials science and cabling expertise, Gore plays a key role in many current and future aircraft and systems. Our fiber optics capabilities and high-speed, lightweight copper-based data solutions are found across many U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force platforms. For each program, Gore provides engineering and scientific expertise to meet the requirements needed for the future fight. The combination of performance, durability, and lighter weight ensures that our aircrew have the performance they need. The need for a smaller, faster highway is not going away, and designs should focus on building digital backbones that won’t need to be replaced in 5 or 10 years due to the demand for more speed. The next generation of EW systems will require even more system integration. Collaborative Combat Aircraft will require more capabilities in a smaller airframe, and the Next Generation Air Dominance and F/A-XX programs will test the limits for power generation. Both issues will require material science advancements and innovations. We believe in our ability to design innovative solutions for EW systems that will have the bandwidth and durability to meet the needs of the next-generation warfighter. W. L. Gore and Associates stands ready to partner on future programs to find success in this critical endeavor to protect assets and save lives.

Saab CEO still upbeat on prospect of Sweden sending Gripen fighter jets to Ukraine	Sweden has already donated Gripen fighter jet spare parts to Ukraine, intended for use with a future fleet of 14 aircraft, but authorities have still to clear the aircraft for delivery (Saab) BELFAST — The head of Swedish manufacturer Saab remains optimistic that the Scandinavian nation will decide to send JAS 39 Gripen multirole fighter jets to Ukraine and strengthen strike capabilities on top of US-made F-16 and French Mirage 2000 aircraft. 'Without jumping into conclusions [at a political level] I hope it will happen' Saab CEO Micael Johansson told Breaking Defense at the Munich Security Conference. Ideally, a long-term agreement would be struck that opens the way for Ukrainian pilots to start training in Sweden, learn Swedish and begin flying the single engine combat jets, he said, leading to a first squadron of C/D standard aircraft being delivered to Kyiv 'sooner rather than later.' Johansson added that 'over time' the more advanced Gripen E aircraft should be sent to Kyiv, before stressing that 'it’s purely a political decision' to set the entire process in motion, beginning with the older C/D platforms. 'I can only hope it will happen. I don't have any more detailed insight into how they are contemplating' the approval decision, he said of political discussions associated with the military aid effort. There is 'nothing new [to say] regarding Gripen,' a spokesperson from the Swedish Defence Minister's office told Breaking Defense today. 'The Airforce Capability coalition advised Sweden to wait until' F-16 is implemented. Ahead of plans to send 14 Gripen C/D jets to Ukraine at a future date, Sweden has already donated 2.3 billion SEK ($214 million) worth of spare parts. 'By acquiring new materiel parts, a number of JAS 39C/D will be saved from being dismantled and can — if the Swedish government decides so — be considered for a possible future donation to Ukraine,' the Swedish government said in a statement last year. NATO allies previously asked Sweden to hold back on sending Gripen aircraft so Ukraine could first focus on flying F-16 jets and not overload its pilots with a variety of different aircraft types. A small number of French Mirage jets have since been sent to Kyiv. 'In the long term, yes, [but] I think we have to avoid [giving] too many systems to Ukraine, because they have a shortage of pilots,' Chief of Defence of the Netherlands Gen. Onno Eichelsheim told Breaking Defense last year. Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands and Norway have all agreed to supply around 80 F-16s under an air force capability coalition for Ukraine, which includes 16 nations in all. Additionally, Denmark, Romania, the UK and the US have contributed to Ukrainian pilot training on the aircraft. Prior to the F-16 and Mirage deliveries, the Ukraine air force had been mainly relying on Soviet-era MiG-29 and Su-27 combat jets to counter Russia’s invasion. Defense analysts have consistently pushed for Gripen to be sent to Ukraine. A 2022 report from the UK’s Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) defense and security think tank labelled the aircraft 'by far the most suitable candidate' of Western-manufactured combat jets, capable of meeting operational requirements. It also highlighted that the aircraft would minimize the risk of Ukraine being subjected to long-range missile strikes by Russia, while stressing that the Swedish air force’s employment of 'low level air superiority tactics from dispersed bases' are similar to Ukrainian air force operations. The Swedish air force currently operates close to 100 Gripen jets, according to Flight Global. Courtesy of a C/D upgrade program and acquisition of 60 E models, both under contract with Saab, the Swedish air force plans on expanding the Gripen fleet to 120 aircraft long term. Johansson told Breaking Defense that a number of Gripen E types have been handed over to the Swedish Defence Materiel Administration (FMV) test center in preparation for first deliveries to the Swedish Air Force's Satenas base. Brazil is Sweden's sole export customer for the E version, while the C/D type is also operated by the Czech Republic, Hungary, South Africa and Thailand.

Buoyed by Trump ‘boom,’ General Atomics expects MQ-9 LoA with UAE this year: Exec	MQ-9B SeaGuardian with Emirati flag, at General Atomics booth at UMEX 2022. (Agnes Helou / Breaking Defense) IDEX 2025 — With an aggressive Trump administration back in office, the head of General Atomics Aeronautical Systems said he expects the long-suffering, high-dollar deal for the United Arab Emirates to acquire MQ-9B SeaGuardians will move forward swiftly, with a Letter of Offer and Acceptance expected as early as this year. 'We expect that to move. It's been a long time in the making, and then it got on hold, and I think that's going to be all behind us now,' GA-ASI President David Alexander told Breaking Defense on the International Defense Expo show floor here in Abu Dhabi. Back in January 2021 the UAE struck a $23.3 billion deal to procure 50 F-35 fighter jets along with 18 SeaGuardians. But the combination deal was halted over US concerns about the Emirates’ use of Chinese network technology and a perceived threat to the F-35. A breakthrough appeared to come last year, when Alexander told Breaking Defense at a different Middle East defense show that the MQ-9B part of the deal had been disentangled from the F-35 controversy, clearing the way for it to go forward alone. Now, especially with businessman-turned-president Donald Trump back in office, Alexander said he sees a general defense sales 'boom coming this way.' 'They mean business now, and they want to see the business deals happen and where we've been, maybe stuck in policy and bureaucrats,' Alexander said in an interview Tuesday. 'I think it's going to move out quick, so I predict a lot of action in this area, and a lot of business growth for General Atomics.' C. Mark Brinkley, a spokesperson for the company, put it succinctly referring to the MQ-9 deal, which was negotiated under the first Trump administration: 'Trump started this. Trump's going to end this.' 'I think the Trump administration is committed to closing this deal. The Trump administration has made it very clear that they're committed to the UAE, and they're committed to putting this deal back on track,' he said. Alexander told Breaking Defense that because there's been such a long pause in the deal, it's currently being updated to reflect current realities. 'A lot has happened in four years and we're on the other side of COVID. We have to address the time issue, when we can make deliveries, what they cost, how fast can we get it delivered,' he said. Alexander said that there's been some configuration changes since the original signed LOA, 'it’s essentially the same system, [but] there are some [things] added and some things taken away.' In November 2023, Breaking Defense reported that General Atomics was planning to integrate Emirati EDGE Group missiles on the MQ-9B SkyGuardian platform. Representatives for the State Department, which has already approved the Foreign Military Sale of MQ-9s to the UAE, did not respond to Breaking Defense's request for comment on the new MQ-9 timeline. As GA-ASI puts what it hopes to be the finishing touches on the UAE deal, Alexander said his eyes are already on the 'biggest potential international deal' in GA-ASI history with neighboring Saudi Arabia. 'I can't discuss the numbers right now because we're still going back and forth, but it'll be the biggest deal in the region by far,' he added. He didn't specify any details but said that 'there's a long list of things to provide — MQ-9 [is] part of that list. So it's a significant program.' While the actual announcement date of this deal is not known yet, Alexander expected 'some details [to] come out later this year.' Regarding the localization mandate these Gulf countries request for any deal, Alexander didn't see any issues. 'Almost every international deal has some kind of reach back [localization] like that. We're doing it. India's got a maintenance repair that we have to stand up. Here in the UAE, they've got to offset requirements. Canada has 100 percent offset requirement. So we have to get creative on other ways to bring business,' he said. He added that 'it's not just the unmanned aircraft system that we bring in, but there's the sensor packages, and then there's the MRO, and maybe split the production and do half of the assembly, in-country.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/buoyed-by-trump-boom-general-atomics-expects-mq-9-loa-with-uae-this-year-exec/	2025-02-18T22:58:51-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/11/273926266_252473973758080_2833298978951006949_n-e1698856746894.jpg
With new MoU, GM Defense and EDGE Group’s team-up gets more ‘meat on the bone’	A GM Defense Next Generation Tactical Vehicle coupled with a drone launcher made by EDGE Group makes its public debut at IDEX 2025. (Breaking Defense) IDEX 2025 — American contractor GM Defense and Emirati defense conglomerate EDGE Group have announced a new agreement to explore 'light tactical vehicle'-focused projects, in a move that came as the two firms put on display what one such team-up could look like: a GM Defense ride boasting an EDGE drone launcher. 'Under terms of the memorandum of understanding GM Defense, a General Motors subsidiary, would work with NIMR Automotive, an arm of EDGE, on potential opportunities,' GM Defense said in statement Tuesday, adding that it was eyeing customers in the Middle East, Africa, Malaysia and Indonesia, specifically. 'By uniting EDGE’s regional insight, operational excellence, and established infrastructure with GM Defense’s technical expertise and industry leadership, we aim to create a powerful synergy that will drive innovative projects and elevate operational capabilities across key markets,' said Khaled Al Zaabi, the president of Platforms &amp; Systems at EDGE. GM Defense's exhibit at IDEX included what it calls its Next Generation Tactical Vehicle (NGTV) but with EDGE's Hunter SP loitering munition launchers nestled in the back — the first such set-up viewed in a public setting. In an interview with Breaking Defense, GM Defense President Steve duMont said that the MoU is 'not just to bring [the NGTV] to the UAE as a product, but to bring it there as a vehicle to be produced in the region for the region's needs, using an Emirati and regional supply chain to help us reduce the amount of transportation, bring jobs into the region, bring technology into the region.' He highlighted that the MoU is the initial step. 'We've had some really good discussions with UAE senior leadership for the past couple years,' he said. 'This signing of the MoU kind of puts a little bit more a little bit more meat on the bone.' (Last IDEX, in 2023, GM Defense signed an MoU with the Emirati government's Tawazun Council in an effort to expand the firm's footprint in the region.) Today other GM Defense representatives told Breaking Defense they expect the NGTV, which made its solo debut at the Association of the US Army conference in Washington, DC, last year, to be tested in the UAE. 'GM has plans for summer trials for this vehicle, probably won't be in 2025, but we're targeting probably a 2026 time frame,' Bradley Watters, vice president of international business development, told Breaking Defense. The NGTV already participated in an exercise earlier this month in Germany, which was 'the first time that it had really been in a tactical environment.' Additional trials in the Gulf will be by the 'invite from the UAE [Ministry of Defense] and their general maintenance corps. But there's a lot of interest coming from the Emirates, as well as others in that region.' DuMont said the company has 'been looking at this vehicle for application in the Middle East region, which is very important region for us, and I think there's a lot of applications in this vehicle.' NGTV uses diesel fuel to power a generator which then charges a battery, and 'then that battery gives it that silent drive capability,' duMont said. He said this makes the vehicle quiet enough that it has the 'ability to sneak up behind soldiers, and the soldiers didn't even know there was a big truck behind them.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/with-new-mou-gm-defense-and-edge-groups-team-up-gets-more-meat-on-the-bone/	2025-02-18T21:46:02-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/IMG_5465-scaled-e1739894348747.jpg
Startup Saronic to build ‘Port Alpha,’ next-gen shipyard focused on autonomous vessels	Saronic’s Corsair autonomously navigating open waters in the Gulf of Mexico. (Photo provided by Saronic.) WASHINGTON — Off the back of a $600 million Series C funding round, Saronic, the Texas-based defense startup company, announced today it plans to build a 'next-generation shipyard' focused on producing unmanned and autonomous vessels, dubbed 'Port Alpha.' The latest funding round was led by Elad Gil, a San Francisco-based entrepreneur and investor with previous stints at Google and Twitter. The round evaluated the company’s worth at $4 billion, which Saronic says effectively 'quadrupled' its valuation. 'Port Alpha will reflect the apex of America’s shipbuilding past — generating new opportunities for the country’s shipbuilding workforce, forging public-private partnerships to accelerate growth, and bringing innovation and ingenuity to an essential industry,' said Dino Mavrookas, Saronic’s CEO. 'We will bring these elements together with a single goal: to rapidly build a fleet of autonomous vessels in America that redefine maritime superiority and guarantees freedom of the seas for generations to come.' RELATED: With Navy Exercise, Unmanned Surface Vessel Firm Saronic Sees &#8216;Next Step' Speaking to reporters today, Mavrookas and Saronic co-founder Rob Lehman said they have not yet selected a location for the new shipyard and declined to provide a timeline for the new project, except to say they will move 'as fast as possible.' The company executives said they will work with federal and state governments to determine the best location, a decision which may be the biggest determiner of the new project's success, because any new location is only going to be successful if they can sort out a key issue facing all naval programs today: Workforce development. Finding people to build ships has a been a top issue for both the US Navy and the defense industrial base in recent years. The service just last year spent roughly $1 billion trying to attract new workers to build submarines. A recent effort to bolster the workforce, dubbed 'SAWS,' stirred a snafu on Capitol Hill in December and January as outgoing service leadership from the Biden administration and lawmakers traded accusations about a lack of transparency. When pressed for how Saronic would overcome the existing workforce challenges, Mavrookas said Saronic is 'changing the culture' around shipbuilding. 'You look at the workforce we built today, we have over 350 employees&#8230; We've attracted people from Silicon Valley that focus on software. We've been attracting people from SpaceX and Tesla that run our manufacturing and production line. Now we're going to combine those folks with the lead naval architects and people that are focused on shipbuilding,' he said. 'We're raising the private capital to hire the people. We're creating a training pipeline to attract the people. We're going have programs in place to recruit to people. We're focused on building the entire ecosystem around this shipyard,' he continued. Saronic in October unveiled plans to mass produce 'hundreds' of its newest autonomous surface vessel, 'Corsair,' citing the Pentagon's need for expendable drones manufactured en masse. The company's announcements largely align with the framework the Defense Department has projected for its Replicator initiative, but the company, like others that have made similar announcements, has been coy when asked about specific deals or discussions with the Pentagon. The company last year also acquired a roughly 420,000-square-foot production and manufacturing facility in Austin, Texas. That space is scheduled to be fully operational by the end of this year, Mavrookas said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/startup-saronic-to-build-port-alpha-next-gen-shipyard-focused-on-autonomous-vessels/	2025-02-18T13:00:26-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/CORSAIR_STILL-07_v002-scaled.jpg
Space Force taps Firefly to launch mysterious Victus Sol ‘responsive space’ mission	Firefly Aerospace's Alpha rocket, shown here lofting a payload for Lockheed Martin in December 2023 from Vandenberg SFB, Calif., was chosen to provide launch of the Space Force's upcoming Victus Sol mission. (Photo: Firefly Aerospace) WASHINGTON — Although most details of the newest mission under the Space Force's Tactically Responsive Space (TacRS) program remain shrouded in secrecy, the service has announced a $21.81 million award to Firefly Aerospace to launch the effort, dubbed Victus Sol. Victus Sol, the third in the TacRS series, will build upon the past two demonstrations of rapidly satellite launch, and be the first to put an operational system on orbit, according to the Space Force. The mission 'is moving beyond TacRS demonstrations and will be available for operations,' a spokesperson for Space Safari, the Space Systems Command shop managing the program, told Breaking Defense in a Feb. 14 email. However, the spokesperson said the Victus Sol launch date, payload type, capability requirements and mission objective 'will not be disclosed at this time in accordance with mission requirements.' Nor would the spokesperson reveal when a provider for the space vehicle and/or payload would be chosen. The Space Force in its fiscal 2025 budget request [PDF] asked for $30 million in research and development funds for the TacRS program, explaining that 'each VICTUS mission furthers the capability to launch within 24 hours of notice, match the orbital plane of a previously unknown object, and conduct rendezvous and proximity operations for inspection and characterization on an operationally relevant timeline.' The budget documents further note that the goal of the Victus Sol plan for FY25 is to 'enable launch in the first half of FY 2026.' The Space Safari spokesperson said that Firefly's contract is sole source and is being paid for using FY24 and FY25 funds. The service's press release explained that the award was made under the Orbital Services Program (OSP)-4 indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract mechanism that 'provides dedicated and primary launch services to the DoD and other Government agencies.' Jason Kim, CEO of Firefly Aerospace, noted in a Feb. 14 press release that this will be the third TacRS mission to be launched by the company. 'As our country’s deterrence and responsive space needs grow exponentially, Firefly has ramped up our Alpha production line to meet that demand and provide flexibility to support the Space Force’s urgent needs that keep us ahead of the game,' he said. The stated goal of the TacRS series has been for the Space Force to be able to turn around a satellite launch within a 24-hour window. At the same time, all of the TacRS missions have been designed to carry maneuverable satellites that can get up close and personal with another satellite — a capability that could allow inspection, repair or even attack of the target satellite. The first TacRS mission, Victus Nox launched in September 2023 and was praised by senior Space Force officials as a game-changer for the service in future great power competition. Under that demonstration, Firefly launched a maneuverable space vehicle developed by Boeing’s Millennium Space Systems. In April 2024, the Space force announced awards to two vendors for the follow-on Victus Haze mission. Rocket Lab National Security was awarded a $32 million contract through the Pentagon’s Defense Innovation Unit (DIU), while True Anomaly was awarded $30 million through the Space Force's SpaceWERX innovation hub. 'VICTUS HAZE is progressing toward successfully achieving all cost, schedule, and performance goals,' the Space Safari spokesperson said. According to the FY25 budget documents, the two Victus Haze satellites should be 'ready for call-up in the second quarter of FY 2025.' Last October [PDF], Space Systems Command announced that it was developing two more missions for FY26, called Victus Surgo and Victus Salo, in partnership with DIU to 'demonstrate on-orbit prepositioned capabilities as response options to meet urgent needs of combatant commands.' Impulse Space was awarded a $34.5 million Small Business Innovation Research Phase III contract for two space vehicles 'that will demonstrate how highly maneuverable on-orbit assets can complement responsive launch approaches to further reduce response times and meet urgent needs,' the announcement added. Senior officials at US Space Command (SPACECOM) have expressed the need for on-orbit capabilities for what is broadly known as space mobility and logistics — such as highly mobile satellites that could be refueled and/or repaired by other space vehicles or even on-orbit 'gas stations' to allow 'dynamic space operations.' SPACECOM, US Indo-Pacific Command and US Transportation Command officials also have touted the potential for cargo to be placed on-orbit that then could be dropped into theaters as needed. And while as recently as 2023 Space Force acquisition leaders were equally enthusiastic about such capabilities, the service over the past year or so has seemed less interested. For example, as Breaking Defense was the first to report, the Space Force zeroed out funds for those activities in its FY26 budget request after having asked for $20 million in FY25.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/space-force-taps-firefly-to-launch-mysterious-victus-sol-responsive-space-mission/	2025-02-18T12:10:50-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/Firefly-Alpha-flight-004-e1739903328357.jpg

UK Defence Secretary urges US to commit to ‘backstop’ to avoid future Putin attack	John Healey, UK Defence Secretary (left) with Pete Hegseth, US Secretary of Defense, during a meeting of the North Atlantic Council at NATO HQ in Brussels (UK MoD) BELFAST — UK Defence Secretary John Healey has called on the Trump administration to commit to a security 'backstop' for Ukraine, warning that 'only the US' is capable enough of stopping Russia from launching another attack on Europe. Healey said that UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and US President Donald Trump will discuss the backstop plan when they meet in Washington next week. His comments at the Institute for Government think tank today arrived before US and Russian officials held bilateral peace talks in Saudi Arabia, where Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said deployment of NATO troops to Ukraine is 'unacceptable,' according to various reports. Washington and Moscow also agreed to 'appoint respective high-level teams to begin working on a path to ending the conflict' in Ukraine, according to the US State Department. The new pact once again excludes Europe and Ukraine from a direct role in peace negotiations. 'We need a security guarantee for Ukraine in Ukraine that is capable of delivering what President Trump has pledged and says he wants, which is a durable peace that requires an end to the Russian attack and no repeat of that in the future,' said Healey. 'The European countries have to play a leading part in that guarantee, but require a backstop from the US, because, in the end, it is only the US that can provide the deterrence to Putin that will prevent him attacking again.' Starmer said on Sunday that he is 'ready and willing' to deploy UK forces to Ukraine as a security guarantee for Kyiv connected to a peace deal, but Healey declined to comment on troop numbers linked to a minimal, credible force that London could deliver. 'The one thing I'm not going to do, is discuss details of the work that we're doing, the discussions we're having with allies and with the US, because the one thing I don't want to do is make Putin any wiser,' he said. US-European security relations were thrown into disarray when US Vice President JD Vance told the Munich Security Conference that Europe’s primary threat sits 'from within' — not with Russia — accusing the continent of media censorship and suppressing free speech but Healey appeared to downplay the impact of those messages. Somewhat surprisingly, Healey responded 'no' when asked if US discourse in Munich had changed his assessment of the state of European security. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, for example, mocked Vance's speech for failing to say anything of substance on Ukraine and US security relations with Europe. Healey, who attended the Munich event with UK Foreign Minister David Lammy, instead praised comments from US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth at the last Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting around the need for Europe to increase defense spending and do more for its own security. 'The content of his [Hegseth’s] messages was not new, what was so striking was the recognition and agreement by the European nations at that meeting and in the discussions I chaired, recognizing, we've been stepping up, but recognizing and making the commitment that we must do more and we will,' he said. The UK currently spends around 2.3 percent GDP on defense but will 'set out a path' to reaching 2.5 percent GDP in the spring, added Healey, despite Hegseth calling a figure of 5 percent 'a model for the continent' of Europe. Forced to reckon with the reality of a more turbulent transatlantic relationship and exclusion by the US on peace talks, European leaders convened at an emergency meeting in Paris on Monday to discuss security guarantees and putting troops on the ground in Ukraine as part of a peace deal. The French President's Office did not share details of the discussion between Macron and Trump, according to the UK's Guardian newspaper. However, according to a White House official, on background, the call lasted 'approximately 30 minutes' and covered Ukraine, the European nations meeting, and the US-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia. Commenting on the talks with Macron, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said on social media that they both hold a 'common vision' based on the idea that security guarantees 'must be robust and reliable.' He added, 'Any other decision without such guarantees—such as a fragile ceasefire—would only serve as another deception by Russia and a prelude to a new Russian war against Ukraine or other European nations.' On the separate matter of UK defense reform plans, which he framed as the 'biggest shake up of UK defense for over 50 years,' Healey said that a new 'quad' of senior UK MoD leaders will take office from March 31. The quad is made up by a new armaments director (not yet in post), permanent secretary (chief accounts officer) David Williams, Chief of the Defence Staff Adm. Tony Radakin and Chief of Defence Nuclear Madelaine McTernan. 'This new quad will lead a defense [department] which is more concentrated on warfighting, readiness and on deterrence,' said Healey.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/uk-defence-secretary-urges-us-backstop-to-avoid-future-putin-attack/	2025-02-18T10:10:42-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/250213c-010.jpg.iCfX1JjuMe-THd1jYBMA.cUmKw_IyH3-e1739893025832.jpg

High-power microwave ‘force field’ knocks drone swarms from sky	Soldiers from the U.S. Army’s Air Defense Artillery community stand in front of the IFPC-HPM system alongside Epirus support staff following New Equipment Training in March 2024. (Epirus photo) In the mix of counter-UAS systems under development today like kinetics, lasers, and jamming, only one technology, high-power microwave (HPM), is specifically designed to take out swarms of drones all at once. Attacking swarms have become a common feature in Russia’s war on Ukraine. Defensive systems, however, can only shoot down one threat at a time. To address that gap, the Defense Department is experimenting with high-power microwave (HPM) to disable drone swarms and other devices dependent on electronics. A defensive concept known as 'one-to-many', the U.S. Army is developing these systems with Epirus, a 'neo prime' focused on asymmetric warfare. Epirus has delivered four prototype HPM counter-swarm systems under a $66 million OTA issued by the Army’s Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office in early 2023 under the Integrated Fires Protection Capability High Power Microwave (IFPC-HPM) program. Epirus delivered the first IFPC-HPM system nine months after contract award and finalized delivery of all four systems in March 2024. The Army followed in October with an approximately $17 million contract modification for the development and integration of an upgraded sensor suite in support of IFPC-HPM. Breaking Defense discussed HPM with Epirus CEO Andy Lowery. Breaking Defense: What’s the idea behind using HPM to counter drone swarms and the concept of one-to-many short-range air defense? Andy Lowery is Epirus CEO. Andy Lowery: This is an idea that changes the paradigm of how we think about defense of critical assets from a one-to-one thought process to a one-to-many thought process. It could be from a detection point of view, a command-and-control perspective, or in the case of Epirus, an effector perspective. There aren't many other types of systems that have one-to-many effects. Kinetics you rule out. They're all one-to-one. The counter-UAS strategy that the DoD published recently describes a need for this one-to-many philosophy of going after threats like what’s seen in network attacks, which are one-to-many attacks. When I talk to cyber experts, they are bored with me talking one-to-many. They say we've been talking about this for 20 years. So, we’re not actually alone in this idea or concept. In electronic warfare, there’s an interesting comparison with the Next Generation Jammer (NGJ). One of my chief engineering accomplishments at Raytheon was to design the NGJ system, which is a cousin or even a brother to Leonidas, the high-power microwave systems that Epirus specializes in. Waymo is another example. They have a different mission to navigate a car automatically, but they are processing one-to-many threats: a bicycle, a car, a commuter, a red light. How do they take in all of those 10,000 things at the same time and produce a meaningful objective? That's what we have to think about — HPM for high-value asset protection, short-range air-defense protection. The ways of protecting our guarded assets now need to evolve because swarms have manifested into the physical realm and are being developed by the Russians, Chinese, and Iranians. Do we still need kinetics? Absolutely. We need the kinetics because there'll be high-value targets that they are assigned to. Then there'll be swarms – cheap, attributable, and autonomous in the not-too-distant future. Ask any counter-drone warfighter what's the first thing that pops into their head when they hear the word ‘autonomy’, and they’ll tell you ‘swarms’. Like a Waymo vehicle, each one of them can be sent out with no signals or attachment to anything. The future of autonomy is no outside connectivity. This is where we come in because it isn't just counter swarms, it's counter electronics in a sector-defense way. HPM will affect anything with electronics in it: boat and car motors, night-vision goggles, computers, and switches. That's all vulnerable. Those all are hypersensitive to this type of electromagnetic radiation. Epirus delivered the first IFPC-HPM system nine months after contract award and finalized delivery of all four systems in March 2024. (Epirus photo) Tell us about your HPM solution called Leonidas. Leonidas spins on a gimbal and generates a persistent field of electromagnetic energy in the sky. As you push it into the airspace, incoming drones come into that energy field and begin to get confused. Different parts of the electronics are starting to pull energy onto the boards and they begin to overload. Epirus HPM basically cyber-attacks a target through an analog vector of absorption, meaning we don't move in through an antenna through an RF chain and then into the digital part of the system that pushes out some kind of effect. We come straight into the analog pieces like a servo motor or wires that run down the wing of an aircraft. These things become vectors of attack for this type of entry with high-power microwave. The CONOPs would be to find the exposed area of whatever asset you're protecting. If it is a base totally out in the open you can't beam these HPM systems over the base, so you would need to have maybe five or six of our systems positioned in a way that gives you 360-degree coverage. Remember that they're additive; as you scan off angle, you're adding the two together in order to give you a homogeneous bubble – really like a force field of energy with five or six of these. Once Leonidas is installed, it becomes a permanent way to generate an HPM shield that can go defend against any number of drones indefinitely at just the cost of electricity. The Army has tested our HPM technology upways and downways with all their threats that are relevant to these fights overseas – not to mention the fights domestically starting to happen – and we have 100-percent effectiveness. Final thoughts? Epirus is a formidable neo prime or next-generation prime. We work directly with the government, DoD, international agencies, and foreign governments in order to employ one-to-many defensive systems that are geared toward high-value asset protection. That could be bases, military airfields, civilian airports, stadiums, and refineries. As we zoom in, there could be local protection for JLTVs, Strykers, Abrams tanks, and C-17 transports. What we've, in fact, done is create a forcefield of sorts, which by nature is a one-to-many system that can effectively counter swarms, as well as attacks coming from the consumer electronics and the irregular/asymmetric warfare vectors. In order to defend that adequately, we need to do a lot of ‘me too’ and ‘better than’ the other guys – like companies such as Anduril and Saronic are doing. We've got to keep up, but we also have to flip it on its head and create capabilities in areas where the United States still bears a strong advantage. The folks at Epirus were largely trained by the primes. Many of us also have dual backgrounds in consumer electronics and big data. Our CTO has Waymo, Raytheon, and AFRL in his background. By fusing advanced technologies with bold thinking informed by decades of leadership at A&amp;D primes, Epirus is positioned at the forefront of this new neo-prime ecosystem. We're thrilled to be part of the equation.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/high-power-microwave-force-field-knocks-drone-swarms-from-sky/	2025-02-18T05:24:52-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/IFPC-HPM_NET_PressRelease_May_2024-scaled.jpg
UAE inks $1 billion deal with local firm Calidus for missile system	A HEDA missile on display at Emirati firm Calidus's exhibit at IDEX 2025. (Agnes Helou / Breaking Defense) IDEX 2025 — The United Arab Emirates today announced an AED 3.76 billion ($1 billion USD) deal with local defense firm Calidus for a new missile system, the largest deal announced on the second day of the International Defense Exposition (IDEX) in Abu Dhabi. The 'Phase 1' announcement, made by the governmental Tawazun Council, was sparse on details, including the number of systems to be procured, but representatives at Calidus's expansive exhibit here said the system was a ground-to-ground missile system that can be mounted on armored vehicles, including light infantry fighting vehicles. (In its announcement, Tawazun briefly showed a photo of the system with several missiles that appeared to be mounted on a heavy duty truck.) Calidus occupies a large event space in an outdoor pavilion, where it's showing off several armored vehicles, one of which featured an 'ALHEDA' mounted missile pod. Also at the stand, the company displayed a new, rugged 8&#215;8 vehicle, which local media said was the 'first to be designed and produced in the region.' Though IDEX focuses more on ground systems (and sister show NAVDEX focuses on maritime), Calidus is also an aircraft producer. Breaking Defense reported in November 2023 that the UAE Air Force had become the firm's first customer for its B250 trainer aircraft. Today's missile system deal represents a sizeable chunk of the total value of agreements signed so far at the show by the Emirati government, according to Tawazun, which reported in all 18 deals have been inked with local and international firms, worth a total of AED 9.8 billion. Day one involved nine local deals and four international deals, totaling AED 4 billion. Agnes Helou contributed to this report.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/uae-inks-1-billion-deal-with-local-firm-calidus-for-missile-system/	2025-02-18T03:07:27-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/250218_calidus_heda_missile_AGNES-scaled-e1739876302257.jpg
EDGE Group CEO says space, Africa two critical areas for growth in coming years	The EDGE Group stand at IDEX 2025. (Agnes Helou/Staff) IDEX 2025 — As the national champion of the UAE defense market, it's no surprise that EDGE Group has the largest space on the show floor here at IDEX 2025, nor that it seems to have the lion's share of unveilings and announcements through the start of the conference. Among the announcements today: EDGE's joint venture with Fincantieri, known as MAESTRAL, was awarded its first-ever deal , a five-year, €500 million service support deal with the UAE navy. The conglomerate also unveiled a number of unmanned ground vehicles, its new first-person view UAVs, and debuted its national offshore patrol vessel Falaj 3, dubbed the Altaf. But as big as its presence seems on the outskirts of Abu Dhabi, EDGE has greater ambitions, according to CEO and managing director Hamad Al Marar. He laid out his plans for growth in an exclusive Monday interview with Breaking Defense. The interview was edited for length and clarity. BREAKING DEFENSE: You have been EDGE Group CEO for one year now. What has been achieved by the group during this one year? HAMAD AL MARAR: Definitely, we have positioned EDGE globally. We have seen a rise in exports and foreign deals. We've surely been working towards a stable order book to keep going, and we have been focused on the areas of focus that we always had, which is autonomous systems, EW and smart weapons. We've been seeing increased offerings, as we have today in our display in IDEX. Recently EDGE Group launched POWERTECH, a new aero engine and propulsion company. What are your plans for the new firm? How far can it take EDGE Groups in the aerospace industry? Engine and propulsion are a very demanding technical endeavor [for] any organization, any country We have been seeing successes on many of our developments, whether it was in the micro jets or the, literally, small piston engines. And we don't see [not to expect] successes in the larger ones. I believe, with putting the right partnerships in place, we will be able to cover, if not all our engine requirements for our systems, [at least] for UAVs. RELATED: Emirate’s EDGE Group marks 5th birthday, from small disruptor to Middle East heavyweight You used the show this week to launch your national offshore-patrol vessel Falaj-3. What is EDGE Group's future plans for the naval sector? And are you planning to develop and manufacture Unmanned Surface Vessels and underwater systems? We have a very strong drive now towards naval applications, whether it was ships, CMS systems [Combat Management Systems], underwater systems and underwater armament, mine disposal. So yes, there is a very strong drive on the navy sector. We had certain successes on autonomous surface vehicles, and we're continuing to do so. One of our entities called Marakeb has been designing autonomous system for vessels. EDGE Group have integrated its payloads on Turkish Baykar UAVs. Have you seen any countries who are procuring the UAVs with your payloads integrated on them? Yes. We have signed a deal with an undisclosed country [not UAE], currently operating the [Bayraktar] TB2, and yes, we are on target [for delivery]. EDGE has been investing worldwide for some time now. After Latin America, which was mainly Brazil, what is the second market that your are trying to increase your presence in? Africa. North Africa, from Egypt to Morocco, the whole of Africa is our focus, besides Brazil, and we have certain focus areas in Asia. But if we look at growth, we see the growth happening fast in Africa. What about Europe? We saw your interest in investing in European firms, what will that look like going forward? Definitely, it's going to pay off. I think when you look at this defense industry, it's quite regulated. Speaking of Europe, you might speak of NATO; speaking of NATO, that might limit you somehow in collaborating outside NATO. So you take two advantages here. One is for us to establish a leg in Europe, where our entities owned in Europe can play the role of doing the products domestically in Europe and selling to Europe. Vice versa is also correct, because they also want to establish [presence] in the UAE for what it is meant to be 70 percent of the world, [including] Latin America, Africa, and Asian. So such a relationship needs to be looked at [as] Europe-centric and outside Europe. And I think we've been doing very well in that. In general, our entities in Europe are already selling to Europe. This is how they were born before, and we see the growth happening, and it continues. With FADA, your new space entity, what is your space ambition? And what are your expectations for FADA, in terms of defense related space, from early warning to missile defense? Space is the future, and there is so much technology that we have to develop or be on par [with competitors] to keep rendering services. It's not limited. It [space applications] could be communication, reconnaissance. We are focused on putting the best engineering experts, because we're not launching it [FADA] for today. We're really going to continue launching way in the future. Therefore it is very important for us to have control over our satellites. For all of this operation [space], you need the regulator. You have players on the market today in Abu Dhabi, Dubai and the UAE that we are fully aligned on, who is going to do what. You can see us really clearly [focusing] on upstream, others are doing the downstream. We're looking at military, some of them are looking at civilian. That area is also so big that we have to continuously improve. Technology is very demanding. We will always try to have the best offering, the best technology, the best AI towards what you want to do. Big picture for EDGE, what's your next five-year plan? Our plan is to continuously grow. Our plan is to grow internationally. Our plan is to see how we can establish alliances with countries outside the UAE.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/edge-group-ceo-says-space-africa-two-critical-areas-for-growth-in-coming-years/	2025-02-17T10:47:06-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/img_5477-scaled-e1739816889511.jpg
AeroVironment unveils Jump-20X drone at IDEX 2025, eyeing expanded cooperation	An AeroVironment Jump-20X unmanned aerial system on display at IDEX 2025 on Feb. 17, 2025. (Agnes Helou / Breaking Defense) IDEX 2025 — American defense firm AeroVironment unveiled a new version of a current unmanned aerial vehicle on the first day of the International Defense Exposition (IDEX) in Abu Dhabi, part of a larger push to reel in some customers — as well as potential partners — in the Middle East. 'We're very interested in collaborations in the area [Middle East and Gulf] and we're looking at partnerships. We're looking at production possibilities, and research development possibilities,' the company’s vice president of international business, Charles Dean told Breaking Defense. Dean spoke on the show floor as his company showcased the Jump 20-X, the new maritime version of its current Group 3-sized Jump 20. 'What's unique about our launch here is that this is our new maritime version. We can now fly off of naval ships that have a heavy fuel requirement,' Dean said. (The X, the company's website says, signifies 'cross-domain dominance.') He specified that the new UAV, which is in the final development stages, is equipped with a heavy fuel engine, capable of burning multiple fuel types, including aviation-type fuels. The company said the UAV can fly for 13 hours with 30 pound (13.6 kg) payload and is equipped with Vertical Take-off and Landing (VTOL) capabilities. It is 'going through its final testing, up for sale in the next few months, so customers can place advanced orders right now,' Dean said. AeroVironment is the maker of the Switchblade family of loitering munitions, which the Pentagon has sent by the hundreds to Ukraine and which were among those chosen for the first tranche of Replicator platforms. RELATED: Following Replicator win, AeroVironment sees strong demand for Switchblade, loitering munitions The company also took the IDEX day one opportunity to showcase its new smaller, autonomous drone, the P550, an all-electric UAV designed for 'intelligence gathering, precision targeting, and force protection in dynamic and contested environments,' according to a company release. Dean said the P550 is highly modular, meaning a 'soldier or sailor can put on [multiple payloads] without any tools.' 'So in a matter of a minute, you can take the whole front end off of P550 that might be a reconnaissance payload and put on a whole other, perhaps electronic warfare payload that then take off and fly that mission set,' he said. As for partnerships in the Middle East, there are a few obstacles to contend with. For one, major potential partners like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are pushing aggressively to develop local production of their defense systems, which can include requiring the transfer of production and development. That can run up against US defense trade restrictions. If that's the case, Dean said, 'it's a little bit more difficult, but it's all doable.' He said the company already has such permission for one 'major' Middle East nation, but declined to provide further details.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/aerovironment-unveils-jump-20x-drone-at-idex-2025-eyeing-expanded-cooperation/	2025-02-17T08:39:46-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/IMG_5445-scaled-e1739809640821.jpg
General Atomics to unveil new ‘super wide area’ sensor for ‘Iron Dome for America’	MQ-9 Reaper aircraft and assigned personnel in Hawaii, Aug. 7, 2024. (U.S. Air National Guard photo by Tech. Sgt. Joseph Pagan) WASHINGTON — General Atomics is ready to step in the ring to compete for contracts to build President Donald Trump’s 'Iron Dome for America' with a new technology the company believes can radically contain the costs of the project, the head of General Atomics’ aeronautics unit said. The special sauce, Dave Alexander told Breaking Defense in an exclusive interview, is a long-range, high resolution sensor that has been under development for about a decade, has a 'super wide area' of coverage, and is ready for production. 'We're ready to rock and roll on this. We’d go straight into production, full-rate production,' he said. 'This Iron Dome is perfect timing for us, and I'd be willing to go into Trump’s office and tell them we're ready to go today.' General Atomics envisions fielding a collection of sensors that would detect threats to the homeland as a ground-based capability and on an air layer integrated onto MQ-9 Reaper drones. Because the sensors have such a wide area of coverage, fewer would be needed to encompass the entirety of the United States, Alexander said. The data gleaned from those sensors can then be digested and combined into a single operating picture by General Atomics’ CCRi division. 'What we're trying to do, is just to grab available technology combined with this new sensor that we're talking about, so that we can get out there and scale and do it for a very affordable price,' he said. 'The cost of what we're talking about on this ground layer sensing is two orders of magnitude less cost than your traditional systems out there today. So that means it's 1/100th of the cost. That's what's game changing about it.' Beyond that, Alexander was willing to give few specifics about the technology, citing classification. He said the sensor has a 'high technology readiness level,' noting that 'the technology has already worked in other areas' outside of the Iron Dome program, with about 80 percent of its funding coming from General Atomics’ internal investment. However he declined to detail what kind of a sensor the company is proposing, whether the sensor has been demonstrated or if it was developed for an existing program. General Atomics intends to respond to Defense Department requests for information and will participate in an industry day on the program this week, said Alexander. The company is also interested in proposing technologies associated with the missile interception piece of Iron Dome, but Alexander declined to provide details about its potential offering. Just a week after taking office Trump released a Jan. 27 executive order that gives the Pentagon 60 days to develop a plan to defeat 'ballistic, hypersonic, advanced cruise missiles, and other next-generation aerial attacks from peer, near-peer, and rogue adversaries' through a system he calls 'Iron Dome for America.' Since then, both the Missile Defense Agency and Space Development Agency have put out solicitations for industry on technologies that could be incorporated into the architecture. Alexander’s comments come just days after Gen. Gregory Guillot, commander of US Northern Command and North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), told lawmakers that the 'top priority' for Iron Dome should be fielding a sensing grid with nodes located undersea, on the ground, in the air and in space. General Atomics is not the only company that sees Iron Dome for America as a potential moneymaking opportunity. During an earnings call last month, RTX chief executive Chris Calio said the company views the program 'as a significant opportunity for us, something right in our wheelhouse,' while Northrop Grumman CEO Kathy Warden said it was 'very well positioned to support that architecture' during its own earnings call in January.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/general-atomics-to-unveil-new-super-wide-area-sensor-for-iron-dome-for-america/	2025-02-17T06:00:50-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/8813732-e1739551941716.jpg
As the world reexamines defense priorities, the world looks to UAS like MQ-9B	GA-ASI’s MQ-9B multi-mission UAS delivers the longest range and endurance in its class The world has taken so many turns in the 21st century that it would be foolish to try to predict what might come next. Responsible nations have no choice but to be ready. In the realm of security and defense, the foundation of readiness is information, especially that gathered via intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. Taking action requires greater insight for informed decision-making. And generals, admirals, ministers, border guards, rescue services, and many others can’t get enough. That’s one reason why the MQ-9B SkyGuardian® and its sibling SeaGuardian® are in such high demand around the world. MQ-9B is the leading multi-mission aircraft of its kind anywhere. With more than 30 hours of endurance, in some configurations, an advanced suite of onboard sensors, and a wide library of payloads—from communications equipment to anti-submarine sensors—MQ-9B is rewriting operational practices around the world. What’s more, because the platform builds on a well-proven series of earlier-model aircraft and didn’t require a risky novel design from a clean sheet, it can deliver these capabilities at much lower cost than an all-new system. Series of new programs The visits world aerospace leaders are making to IDEX in Abu Dhabi this month follow a long series of announcements about new MQ-9B programs around the world. The most recent was in Poland, which is acquiring three aircraft that will play a central role in bolstering European security near NATO’s eastern front. Warsaw’s decision to acquire aircraft of its own followed a highly successful company-owned, company-operated agreement in which builder General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, Inc., flew MQ-9Bs on Polish missions, proving their enduring value. Before that, the government of Japan announced that it, too, would move from a company-owned, company-operated arrangement to a full program of its own aircraft. The Japan Coast Guard has ordered its own production-model MQ-9B SeaGuardian aircraft, and the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force has followed suit, which will allow Japan to continue to expand and sharpen its maritime domain awareness in the strategically vital Western Pacific. Japan’s experience with the SeaGuardian has delivered vital intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance data across a variety of fronts, including some that have been a surprise to everyone—as when an MQ-9B detected the eruption of an undersea volcano, enabling Japanese coast guard authorities to warn mariners to steer clear of the area in order to avoid the lava. Japan is using the MQ-9B SeaGuardian for a wide range of maritime missions, including search and rescue Before Japan there was India, which likewise initially began to operate MQ-9B in a work-hire arrangement before placing its own order for a full complement of aircraft. Over tens of thousands of operational hours, MQ-9B has transformed the Indian Navy’s operational capabilities in the Indian Ocean and beyond and was further used to support several missions of global importance. When East African pirates threatened the orderly flow of trade through the region, the Indian Navy responded by tracking and, in some cases, rescuing hijacked ships. MQ-9B was central to those operations, using its long loiter time and precise intelligence-gathering sensors to stay with captured vessels hour after hour. And when Indian Navy special operations forces had to assault vessels to free their crews, MQ-9Bs provided real-time intelligence before, during, and after the operations, enabling commanders on land to watch the action unfold live. Meanwhile, on the other side of the world another government likewise selected MQ-9B for its protection—that being the government of Canada. MQ-9B SkyGuardian will serve as Canada’s mainstay platform for search and rescue, wildfire support, security, and other missions over a vast territory that’s also one of the most difficult in the world for most aircraft to operate in. MQ-9B will meet the challenge head-on, though, as it was purpose-designed to fly in the coldest temperatures, has electro-expulsive de-icing capabilities, and includes highly resilient and versatile satellite communications capabilities that support operations from pole to pole, something true of no other platform in its class. Enduring international demand These users followed orders by Belgium, the United Kingdom, and the U.S. Department of Defense. And the international demand for MQ-9B isn’t letting up. Still more nations, including Denmark, Norway, Morocco, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates are among those that have expressed serious interest. In the case of the UAE, discussions have progressed far enough to yield a commitment that GA-ASI would integrate Emirati-made smart weapons onto a future Emirati MQ-9B. Company President David Alexander has confirmed that the firm has agreed with the Abu Dhabi-based technology group EDGE to support the integration of its precision-guided munitions and guided-glide weapons on the aircraft, following authorization to do so by the UAE and U.S. governments. MQ-9B SkyGuardian is the first U.S. unmanned aircraft approved to carry indigenous UAE smart weapons 'We’re excited to work with EDGE on this initiative,' Alexander said. 'Integrating home-grown capabilities onto our customer platforms is something we’ve done a lot, but we’ve never before integrated a non-NATO weapon system onto one of our RPA platforms.' The partnership marks the first time that UAE-made smart weapons will be integrated onto a U.S. unmanned platform, signaling a new chapter in U.S.-UAE defense cooperation and opening the door to further collaboration. Hamad Al Marar, President of EDGE Group’s Missiles &amp; Weapons cluster, said, 'We are proud to be working with General Atomics Aeronautical. The opportunity to integrate our smart weapons on the MQ-9B SkyGuardian will offer the end user multiple dynamic, highly accurate, and cost-effective ground strike solutions. We look forward to working closely with General Atomics Aeronautical on this program and to enhancing our collaboration in the future.' So as governments around the world reexamine their defense and intelligence outlook at the beginning of a new era in global affairs, many already have chosen MQ-9B. As others approach the point of decision, MQ-9B’s compelling benefits will help to make their choice clear.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/as-the-world-reexamines-defense-priorities-the-world-looks-to-uas-like-mq-9b/	2025-02-17T05:20:47-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/2303_GA-ASI_JMSDF_Poster-03_Preview_EDITED-scaled.jpg
Estonia wants answers from US on HIMARS production, could turn to other options in ‘months’	US Army soldiers from Able Battery, 3rd Battalion, 321st Field Artillery Regiment, 18th Field Artillery Brigade, launch rockets from HIMARS during a semiannual validation exercise (US Army) MUNICH — Estonia could scrap a plan for a second buy of Lockheed Martin-made M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) if the US government cannot assuage its concerns about lead times and production slots, with a decision likely in the coming months, the Baltic state's defense minister tells Breaking Defense. 'I would like to speak' with the US government to ask, 'are they ready to speed up the production, or are they ready to give us earlier [production] slots because the information we've gathered today clearly shows that delivery time is very long and we don't have so much time,' Hanno Pevkur said in a Friday interview on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference. Primarily designed to strike fixed targets, HIMARS have proven to be formidable assets for Ukraine and are credited with success against Russian supply lines, ammunition depots and command and control centers. The US has suppled 'more than 40' HIMARS to Ukraine, according to a State Department factsheet. Breaking Defense initially reported on the prospect of a second HIMARS order in October, when another Estonian official disclosed issues linked with delivery lead times and pricing. Dependent on how Washington responds to Estonia's questions, Tallinn will either go ahead with a second tranche of HIMARS or change course and potentially opt for an alternative. A decision will be made on the preferred platform in a 'couple of months,' said Pevkur. RELATED: ‘Main focus’: With new defense budget, Estonia pledges big investments in long-range ammo Rocketsan's Khan, from Turkey, and the Elbit Precise and Universal Launching System (PULS), out of Israel, are known to be in the running, but in his discussion with Breaking Defense, Pevkur only mentioned South Korea's Hanwha Aerospace-made K239 Chunmoo. Poland is already a customer for the Chunmoo, and it is also under consideration with Norway, while Hanwha is also providing Estonia with 36 K9 Thunder self-propelled howitzers. Hanwha 'is one of the competitors' involved in the impending artillery equipment decision, Pevkur said, adding that he met with South Korea's acting defense minister Kim Seon-ho and Hanwha Aerospace officials last month. Lockheed Martin did not immediately respond to questions on HIMARS production. 'As a matter of policy, we are unable to comment on or confirm potential or pending arms transfers before they are formally notified to Congress,' said a US State Department official on background. Estonia has needed to invest in long-range fires in part because the country has made major donations of its own equipment to support Ukraine — something Dmytro Kuleba, the former Ukrainian foreign affairs minister, made clear by interrupting Breaking Defense's interview with Pevkur. After making sure Pevkur was talking to a reporter, Kuleba said he wanted to underline publicly how much Estonia's support means to Kyiv. 'Ukrainians appreciate Estonia probably more than anyone else because they gave all the artillery that they had to us&#8230; and never complained, [or said] &#8216;how are we going to survive without howitzers' like some other much more powerful nations did,' Kuleba said. To help fill the gap left by those donations, Tallinn has made key progress on a first order of six HIMARS units, a package worth over $200 million that includes several rocket types that can reach a range between 70km and 300km, communications systems, training and logistics. 'Officially, we've got the keys,' said Pevkur, in recognition of a HIMARS handover ceremony that took place at Lockheed Martin's headquarters in Camden, Arkansas last month. The first six systems 'are somewhere, probably in the Atlantic Ocean at the moment, but they will be delivered very soon,' he added. On other future procurements, Pevkur noted that there is 'still some time' to decide on a XA-180 armored personnel carrier replacement acquisition.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/estonia-wants-answers-from-us-on-himars-production-could-turn-to-other-options-in-months/	2025-02-15T12:37:17-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/max1200-e1739634928119.jpg
German Chancellor’s pushback at Vance brings US-Euro tensions into the public at Munich	German Chancellor Olaf Scholz addresses delegates at the Munich Security ConferencePhoto: MSC/Tobias Koehler MUNICH — German Chancellor Olaf Scholz received rapturous applause from European officials in a fiery speech at the Munich Security Conference that took issue with controversial claims from US Vice President JD Vance surrounding alleged democratic infringements across Europe, hate speech and supposed mistreatment of the far-right, Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. 'We will not accept that people who look at Germany from the outside intervene in our democracy, in our elections and in the democratic opinion forming process in the interest of this party,' said Scholz. 'That is just not done, certainly among friends and allies. We resolutely reject this.' He went on, 'as a strong democracy, we are absolutely clear that the extreme right should be out of political control and out of political decision making processes and that there will be no cooperation with them….I think there is strong consensus between all relevant parties in Germany' on the matter. 'Where our democracy goes from here is for us to decide' Scholz added. German elections are set to take place next week after the collapse of Scholz's three party coalition, with polling indicating that the AfD, whose critics have compared them to neo-Nazis, is on course to return the second largest vote, behind the Christian Democratic Union (CDU). Scholz's Social Democratic Party of Germany is sitting in third place. Scholz's comments came the day after Vance appeared at Munich and gave a speech blasting European politicians for what he called suppressing far-right parties in their countries — in essence, using the security forum, which is traditionally a home for cross-Atlantic coalition building on defense issues, to attack America's allies. Vance’s remarks suggesting Europe’s main threat sits 'from within' seemed to shock attendees here. US President Donald Trump, who did not make the trip to Munich, endorsed the Vance message saying, it was a 'very good speech, actually very brilliant.' Following the speech, European officials, who have been cautious in their comments about the newly-inaugurated Trump administration, seemed ready to drop the veil of politeness, with Scholz — seeking to bolster his party's diminishing chances at home — providing the most open pushback. Asked on stage after his address if there was anything in Vance’s speech worth reflecting on, Scholz sarcastically replied, 'You mean all this very relevant discussions about Ukraine and security in Europe?' Those gathered hummed with laughter, amid a sense that Vance’s blindside attack on European democracy has thrown transatlantic relations into a tailspin. Vance's words have demonstrated that the US looks to be more of 'a divisive force, perhaps not [a] uniting force in Europe,' Alina Polyakova, president and CEO of the Center for European Policy Analysis, told Breaking Defense on the sidelines of the conference. Polyakova said another delegate at the conference had spoken of how a 'two-front' war has effectively emerged for Europe, comprising of the conventional conflict with Russia and a fight with the US over 'values and principles.' In the lead up to the conference, Trump administration officials have moved away from Ukraine’s long held conditions for securing peace with Russia: the return of illegally seized territory by Russia and future US security guarantees. In addition, comments from Trump have raised fears that he plans to negotiate directly with Russian President Vladimir Putin about Ukraine, sidelining Kyiv and its European allies entirely. European leaders here have been pushing the message that Ukraine must be involved in such talks, including Swedish defense minister Pål Jonson, who told Breaking Defense on Friday that 'There can be no talking about Ukraine without Ukraine.' 'We don't know what the US position is' on Ukraine, said Polyakova. 'The last few days, we've heard a lot of different ideas and a lot of different positions from various parts of the administration here in Munich. 'There is no policy, there is no strategy. There's a threat and it's unclear to me how real that is.' Ukraine giving up half of its mineral reserves in exchange for billions of dollars of US military aid has also been floated by the Trump administration. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reportedly this week presented Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy with a draft contract that would sign half of Ukraine's mineral wealth to the US, something the Ukrainian leader reportedly did not agree to. 'There's a deal to be had there,' said Polyakova. 'The Ukrainians could basically say, &#8216;look, 60 percent of these deposits are in Russian occupied territory, you give us the weapons to take back the land, you can have it. And that is the kind of transactional mentality that I think is appealing to Trump.' Despite Scholz being quick to dismiss Vance's failure to make Ukraine more of a priority, he made it clear that at a fundamental level, he is on board with US thinking. 'We stand at the side of Ukraine, which has come under attack, and I'm therefore pleased that the American administration has reaffirmed our common objective of preserving the sovereign independence of Ukraine,' he said. 'This sovereign independence has also been reflected in the negotiations.' He added that it is 'right Ukraine is involved as we begin to talk directly with Russia.' Scholz also revealed that he has spoken to Putin 'several times' and put to him what a 'just peace' looks like. 'I trust that we all agree that Russia's war against Ukraine must end as quickly as possible,' he remarked.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/german-chancellors-pushback-at-vance-brings-us-euro-tensions-into-the-public-at-munich/	2025-02-15T06:39:32-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/20250215MSC2025tk1289-e1739628545577.jpg
Army deploys first Athena-R spy plane to South Korea	A photo of the US Army's new Athena-R aircraft that deployed to South Korea this week. (L3Harris) WASHINGTON — A new US Army spy plane deployed to South Korea this week and is slated to begin key testing to ensure it is ready for operations, according to a senior service leader. Dubbed Athena-R — short for the Army Theater level High Altitude Expeditionary Next Airborne ISR-Radar — the service tasked MAG Air and L3Harris with integrating a suite of sensors and equipment onto two Bombardier Global 6500 business jets. As of this week, that first one is now 'supporting the long-standing commitment we have to the Republic of Korea,' Andrew Evans, the director of the Army’s ISR Task Force, told Breaking Defense today. The service will begin an operational assessment with the aircraft next week that is expected to last about four months and assess any fixes the modified spy plane might need. 'We may spend the first few months doing some adjustments and tweaks. This is our newest system, and so as with any new system, we'll have to work out some bugs, but … we have the right experts on the ground,' Evans said. 'This will be an ongoing and iterative operational assessment with the goal of having those fixes complete in the coming months and then being in a sustainable place here by May or June, with it collecting on behalf of the US Army on a daily basis,' he added. In the meantime, the MAG Air and L3Harris team will continue integration work on the second Athena-R, with Evans eyeing its deployment to the Indo-Pacific region later this fiscal year. The Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC) is also under contract to produce two similar aircraft dubbed Athena-Sensor. Those two aircraft are also expected to be ready for deployment later this year, though it is not yet clear where the Army will send them. 'They will be offered for global allocation according to the priorities of the administration, the joint force and OSD [Office of the Secretary of Defense],' Evans said. Both Athena lines are billed as 'bridging' aerial ISR assets as service leaders move out on plans to field the High Accuracy Detection and Exploitation System (HADES). Also centered around the Global 6500, last year the Army selected SNC to proceed with integration work on that program. If the HADES program stays on track, the first aircraft should be ready by the end of 2026 or early 2027, and the service could ultimately acquire more than a dozen under a one-per-year buy depending on budgets and the threat analysis.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/army-deploys-first-athena-r-spy-plane-to-south-korea/	2025-02-14T11:25:03-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/L3Harris-ATHENA-R-flight-1-scaled-e1739554062471.jpg
What America’s Iron Dome effort should learn from Israel’s air defense systems	Rockets launched towards Israel from the northern Gaza Strip and response from the Israeli missile defense system known as the Iron Dome leave streaks through the sky on May 14, 2021 in Gaza City, Gaza. (Photo by Fatima Shbair/Getty Images) On Jan. 27 President Donald Trump signed an executive order aimed at creating 'a next-generation missile defense shield for the United States against ballistic, hypersonic, advanced cruise missiles, and other next-generation aerial attacks,' something he dubbed an 'Iron Dome for America.' That term references the well-known short range Israeli air defense system that has been effective in countering thousands of rocket, and other types of aerial attacks on Israel. The main difference between the Israeli experience, and what the White House is embarking upon, is the fact that the US faces much larger global threats on an exponentially larger scale. Israel is less than one percent the size of the US. Still, there are absolutely lessons the Pentagon can, and should, learn from Israel’s experience with a multi-layered missile defense network — clearly the inspiration behind Trump’s push. Israel’s history of developing new air defenses to defend against emerging threats is closely entwined with the US experience in air defenses. Israel’s Arrow missile program has its origins in Israel’s partnership in the US Strategic Defense Initiative in the 1980s. In 1991, after Saddam Hussein’s invasion of Kuwait and the US deployment for Operation Desert Storm, the US deployed Patriot batteries to Israel to defend against Iraqi Scud missiles. As the Scud missile threat materialized, Israel realized how vulnerable it was and then moved to create the Israel Missile Defense Organization, which became the main body for accelerating work with the US on air defenses. For more coverage of Trump's Iron Dome executive order, click here. Israel’s experience in deploying air defenses illustrates how long it took to keep up with the emerging threats. Despite starting in the 1980s, it wasn’t until 1998 that the Israeli Air Force received the first Arrow 2 missiles. Iron Dome was started in the wake of the 2006 Hezbollah war, when Israel’s home front was battered by rocket fire; It only became operational in 2011. Israel also developed David’s Sling, designed to be the medium range interceptor between Iron Dome and Arrow, in cooperation with the US. Development began in 2006 and it was operational by 2017. Still, the systems have shown themselves to work. Iron Dome became incredibly successful over the years, protecting Israel first against existing rocket threats from Hamas and Hezbollah, and eventually from new emerging threats such as drones and cruise missiles. David’s Sling notched its first success in 2023, stopping a missile aimed at Tel Aviv. Arrow 3, the latest operational Arrow system, achieved its first war-time successful interception in November 2023 during Israel’s recent war. The growing threat of drones is one area that the Israeli experience also informs the US challenge. In the recent war Israel faced threats from up to seven fronts, including Gaza, the West Bank, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen, Iraq and Iran. Long range drones were used by Iran and Iranian-backed groups in Iraq, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen. These kinds of drone threats, which can occur over thousands of miles, are one that the US needs to confront. Cartels could use drones, as well as terrorist groups such as the Houthis in Yemen. In addition, drone threats could become part of a conflict in the Pacific. Israel has used every means to shoot down drones, from scrambling F-16s and attack helicopters to using air defense interceptors. Now Israel is moving toward laser air defenses, another type of technology that could inform US decision making on this front. The good news is, while Trump may want everything built in the US, there are ways to tie into the Israeli systems already in use — much of which, it must be noted, American dollars helped fund R&amp;D on. For instance, Rafael Advanced Defense Systems works closely with Raytheon, its US partner, on David’s Sling and Iron Dome. The interceptors for these systems are called Skyceptor and Skyhunter, respectively, in the US; the David’s Sling interceptors are similar to the Patriot PAC-3 and can be used in Patriot batteries. Recent sales of Arrow and David’s Sling to Germany and Finland also illustrate how there is a growing market for these systems. Any new US investment in aerial defense will thus benefit from the Israeli experience because new systems could be deployed to allies abroad. What this means is that the four-decade legacy of joint development of these systems can easily plug-in to the US drive for new air defenses to confront next-generation threats. And that is another key thing the White House has to keep in mind: The threats are going to keep mutating. Adversaries are already rolling out so many types of threats that keeping up with them is a hurdle. Intercepting ballistic missiles or maneuvering missiles, drones and cruise missiles is not the only problem. As Iran showed during its two attacks on Israel in 2024, the main goal is to launch so many missiles that they can overwhelm air defenses. Therefore, building a new system is not the only challenge. Israel’s experience has shown that the second problem to overcome is to have large numbers of interceptors and different types of them to confront all the threats — building up production is going to be key. The US will need to move quickly if it wants to build on existing systems, including existing cooperation with Israel, to roll out Trump’s vision of an American Iron Dome.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/what-americas-iron-dome-effort-should-learn-from-israels-air-defense-systems/	2025-02-14T10:45:04-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/220113_israel_iron_dome_GettyImages-1232873450-scaled-e1739291349746.jpg
Indonesia procures 60 Bayraktar TB3 drones	Baykar Bayraktar TB3 PT2, a Turkish medium-altitude long-endurance (MALE) unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV), successfully takes off from TCG Anadolu's short runway with a 12-degree inclined ramp on November 19, 2024. (Photo by Baykar / Handout /Anadolu via Getty Images) BEIRUT — Turkish drone maker Baykar will supply Indonesia with 60 Bayraktar TB3 armed drones and nine Akinci surveillance drones, according to Indonesian firm Republikorp. The deal was signed Wednesday by Baykar CEO Haluk Bayraktar and Republikorp founder Norman Joesoef, after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's visit to Indonesia, Turkish news agency Anadolu reported. The value of the deal was not disclosed. Per the agreement, 'a Joint Venture Company (JVC) will be established in Indonesia, focusing on the manufacturing, assembly, and maintenance of UAVs,' Republikorp's statement says. The Bayraktar TB3 can perform Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions and can be equipped with munitions under the wings for combat operations. It is also equipped with communication capabilities that allow control over distances beyond line of sight. The unmanned combat aerial vehicle completed open-sea shipboard trials and performed its first successful flight test to take off and land on the Turkish ship TCG Anadolu, a short runway vessel, in November 2024, Breaking Defense previously reported. The Akinci High-Altitude Long-Endurance UAV entered service with the Turkish armed forces in August 2021, and has received six export contracts so far, according to the company. It is also the drone that was used to locate the helicopter crash of Iranian President Raisi in May 2024. Baykar had previously secured the largest contract in the firm's history to supply Saudi armed forces with Akinci drones. Baykar was in the top 10 Turkish defense exporters in 2024, with export revenue amounting to $1.8 billion.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/indonesia-procures-60-bayraktar-tb3-drones/	2025-02-14T10:01:21-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/GettyImages-2184995575-scaled-e1732120267604.jpg
DOGE or be DOGE’d: The Army needs to preemptively start cutting	American flag displayed on a laptop screen and Elon Musk post about DOGE on X displayed on a phone screen are seen in this illustration photo taken in Krakow, Poland on November 13, 2024. (Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images) The Army currently appears to be holding the weakest hand in the Pentagon budget deliberation process. Just look at the Senate, which is recommending an add of $150B to defense, with priorities listed as growing the Navy and strengthening the shipbuilding industrial base; building an integrated air and missile defense for the Homeland, and investments in the nuclear enterprise. There is only one plus up for the Army: maintaining military readiness. Additionally, the incoming administration has questioned the need for forward deployed troops in Europe, which historically has been a major rationale for the size and structure of the Army. With two strikes against it, the Army is now going to be entering the woodchipper called DOGE and its slash first, fix later philosophy. It may be best for the Army to move first and make the difficult choices on its own. Specifically, with little new money coming into the Army, the best deal the Army can hope for is to keep its own savings. The only way to do this is to ask the Secretary of Defense to let the Army DOGE-itself before Elon Musk and his crew can get the knives out. Here’s where to start. First, the Army needs to organize for 'combat' specifically, by mirroring DOGE’s ability to see through the data. The Army has been hampered in this effort for decades, as many of the Army’s internal data owners claim that the data is theirs, however, as we see across the government, the data belongs to the president. (This should not be confused with the data-right issues associated with weapon systems, which may at some point come to the attention of DOGE; The group currently is only going after the government’s own internal personal and finance data.) The Army, however, in this case may have a running start with its Vantage program that is consolidating multiple sets of data. This may be the time to see if Vantage is worth the price the Army has been paying for it and to see if the Army can make decisions using that data before DOGE accesses it and makes the decisions for the Army. Second, since the DOGE crew prefers to work at midnight, the Army needs to pull some all-nighters and bring back its Night Court process that found $25 billion to cut back in 2018. That version of the Night Court focused on procurement programs and was driven by a desire to hit a specific dollar target. This new version would need to be expanded — and keep cutting until the Army leadership can assure itself that DOGE would find no fat to target. This new process would be deeper and more tedious, and need to cut across three main areas: Operation and Maintenance (O&amp;M) funding; Weapon Systems; and Organizational Overhead. The Army’s O&amp;M funding accounts for $71.4 billion (38 percent) of its $185.9 billion FY25 budget request. By its nature, this funding is 'squishy' in that it funds everything from staff support consulting contractors, to fuel, to leases, and yes, subscriptions to media. While previous Night Courts focused on the 500+ or so major defense programs, the O&amp;M transactions number in the hundreds of thousands, so a serious review of every dollar spent has not been done at the most senior levels. However, given modern data analytics, this now appears possible. The Army could start with Elaine McCusker’s report on Defense Budget Transparency and eliminate many of the items she identifies. The O&amp;M accounts also fund the majority of the salaries for the civilian workforce, many of whom are now eligible for buyouts. Next up will be the weapon system accounts, both in research and development, as well as procurement. We already know that Musk has put a target on the F-35 aircraft because he states that 'design was broken at the requirements level, because it was required to be too many things to too many people.' The Army’s new lift helicopter program, FLRAA, has many similarities with the F-35 in complexity, cost, developmental time, and the fact that drones can replace many of its missions. It may be time to kill this program off and invest in transitioning Army aviation to a drone fleet. The Army will also have to wrestle with the statement that Musk has made that tanks are death traps, and will likely need to convince Musk that it is making Abrams smart again. Finally, the Army has too many headquarters and staff, a fact that DOGE will realize in a New York minute. While the current Chief of Staff, Gen. Randy George, has proposed cutting five percent of the General Officers, it is likely that DOGE will be looking for something like a 50 percent reduction. This level of reduction can only be done by dramatically altering the institutional structure of the Army, eliminating entire levels of staff and simplifying the organization. The DOGE shock and awe campaign that has started across the government is being unleashed by the Commander in Chief onto the Pentagon, and everyone in the building is battening down the hatches. The Army is the one service that lacks both congressional and Pentagon support. It needs to give up hope of growth and focus on holding onto the money it already has — and to do that, it needs to change at the speed of DOGE. Retired US Army Maj. Gen. John G. Ferrari is a senior nonresident fellow at AEI. Ferrari previously served as a director of program analysis and evaluation for the service.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/doge-or-be-doged-the-army-needs-to-preemptively-start-cutting/	2025-02-14T09:15:50-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/doge-logo-scaled-e1734035776699.jpg
Swedish DefMin: ‘No talking about Ukraine without Ukraine’ as tension over peace negotiations stir	A Swedish CV90 Infantry Fighting Vehicle maneuvers through the tree line during a training exercise between Swedish and American forces of the Minnesota National Guard’s 1st Combined Arms Battalion – 194th Armor (DVIDS) MUNICH — Ukraine must be included in any negotiations aimed at ending war with Russia, Pål Jonson, Sweden's Defense Minister, told Breaking Defense at the Munich Security Conference today, despite US President Donald Trump opening peace talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin. 'That is a given. There can be no talking about Ukraine without Ukraine,' said Jonson, as world leaders, defense industry chiefs and analysts gathered for discussions on the opening day of the event. 'They have to be involved in these negotiations.' Europe must also have a say in peace negotiations noted Jonson, because the continent has supplied around 60 percent of all military aid to Ukraine over the last year alone and any settlement will have 'important ramifications for security' across the region. As a priority, Sweden will continue to deliver weapons to Kyiv 'as quickly as possible,' so Ukraine can negotiate from a position of strength, he added. Stockholm has spent SEK 61.9 billion ($5.8 billion) on military aid to Ukraine over the course of the war including supplies of Archer self-propelled howitzers, Combat Vehicle 90 (CV90) infantry fighting vehicles, Pbv 302 armored personnel carriers, RBS Man-Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS) and TOW anti-tank missiles. RELATED: Sweden’s new $1.2B donation to Ukraine includes drones, missiles and boats Jonson also backed Ukraine's campaign to join NATO, following Pete Hegseth, US Defense Secretary, telling a Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting on Wednesday that the 'United States does not believe that NATO membership for Ukraine is a realistic outcome of a negotiated settlement.' Sweden entered the alliance last year, following decades of non-military alignment. 'We were very grateful that NATO opened the door for us when we applied in May 2022, and we don't think that it would be wise to leave Ukraine outside of the Euro-Atlantic structures,' said Jonson. 'Therefore we think it's very important that they have to maintain a membership perspective, even if it is not going to happen tomorrow.' On US links, Jonson said he had a 'good discussion' with Hegseth at a NATO defense ministers meeting on Thursday, without disclosing details. Hegseth has, however, been 'crystal clear' on the need for Europe to 'shoulder a lot' more responsibility concerning support for Ukraine, said Jonson. 'It's a valid point,' he explained. Long-term, Sweden has committed to spending 2.6 percent GDP on defense, significantly boosting expenditure last year with a jump of 28 percent, equivalent to $10.8 billion. Any additional increase above the 2.6 percent pledge depends on finalizing NATO capability targets, according to Jonson. Work on the capability targets is 'underway,' said Mark Rutte, NATO Secretary General on Tuesday. The targets are set to be released in the summer, according to Reuters, and are designed to deliver better standards of readiness, interoperability and coordination across members on items like air and missile defense systems. Separately, Swedish lawmakers are considering launching a future fighter 'enquiry' later this year, following studies on the subject already underway by the Swedish armed forces and the Swedish Defence Material Administration (FMV). The parliamentary project could begin 'later this year,' said Jonson and run for a 'couple of years.' Sweden's Gripen fighter jet will be in service until around 2060, but Stockholm has decided to settle on a procurement pathway for a next generation aircraft by 2031 and is focused on three options: rely on development of an indigenous platform, join a program with other nations or acquire an off the shelf aircraft. 'I don't want to jump into any conclusions before the enquiry has even started,' Jonson said, giving nothing away about which option might be favored.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/swedish-defmin-no-talking-about-ukraine-without-ukraine-as-tension-over-peace-negotiations-stir/	2025-02-14T08:05:24-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/10/3801975-scaled-e1696863427965.jpg
Army, Navy experimentation efforts foreshadow second wind for Hypervelocity Projectile	A rendering of BAE Systems's Hypervelocity Projectile. (Image courtesy of BAE Systems.) WASHINGTON — The munition once slated for use on the US Navy’s failed electromagnetic railgun may be getting a second wind for both the service’s ubiquitous MK-45 5-inch gun, as well as a new Army initiative to defend bases from aerial drones. The Hypervelocity Projectile, produced by BAE Systems, is a maneuvering, precision guided munition capable of intercepting anti-ship cruise missiles. Its development and experimentation through multiple branches of the Pentagon spans back to 2012 when it was, at that time, destined for use on a key railgun capability to be installed on the Zumwalt-class destroyers. The Navy ultimately canned the railgun program in 2021, instead opting to outfit the Zumwalt class with the hypersonic weapon now called 'Conventional Prompt Strike.' But in the intervening years, HVP transitioned to programs at the Strategic Capabilities Office, Army and the Air Force Research Laboratory. Now, both the Navy and Army have taken up efforts that could lead to its wider fielding. For the Navy, this has come in the form of the Major Caliber Anti-Drone Air Program (MADCAP), Inside Defense reported. The crux of that testing, which began quietly last year, is to determine the viability of launching the HVP from BAE's Mk-45 naval gun as a means of defense against the kinds of drone threats that have been pervasive in the Red Sea. RELATED: Navy Is Down $1B In Munitions From Ops In Red Sea, Says SECNAV Tate Westbrook, BAE Systems director of business development for naval guns and missile launchers, told Breaking Defense in January during the Surface Navy Association symposium that if brought to full-rate production, HVP would be a 'fractional cost' compared to using Standard Missile, the Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile or the Rolling Airframe Missile. (Standard Missile in particular has been a favored, but relatively expensive, interceptor for Navy destroyers tasked with eliminating low-cost Houthi-based threats in the Red Sea.) The Navy’s ships operate using a principle of 'layered defense,' meaning that ships are equipped to employ different capabilities depending on how far away a threat is spotted. Westbrook, a retired surface warfare officer, characterized the 5-inch-gun and associated HVP round as a 'middle-range engagement.' Separately from the Navy’s MADCAP program, the Army in December announced it is planning to award BAE a contract to provide what has been dubbed the Multi-Domain Artillery Cannon and Hypervelocity Projectile (MDACS) prototype. The Army’s Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office is aiming to develop and deliver a full MDACS battery no later than fourth quarter of fiscal 2027, which consists of 'eight Multi-Domain Artillery Cannons, four Multi-Function Precision Radars, two Multi-Domain Battle Managers, and separately, no less than 144 Hypervelocity Projectiles,' according to a public notice. The Army’s notice was an 'intent to sole source,' meaning that no contracts have been signed yet and plans could still change pending detailed negotiations with BAE. It’s 'same basic projectile that we would offer to the Navy,' Christopher Laski, director of business development for precision guided munitions programs at BAE, told Breaking Defense this week. 'The difference is, you’re going to be firing it out of an Army 155-millimeter gun.' Similar to the Navy, the Army’s public notice explicitly calls out MDACS and HVP as a defense against unmanned aerial systems, cruise missiles and other advanced air threats. The notice also said the Army is planning an assessment in 2028 to determine if the technology can be fielded. 'The Army has its procurement path, and the Navy has their procurement path to be responsive to their particular acquisition fielding needs,' said Laski. 'As you start tailoring it to specific service needs, you get those efficiencies and the right skill sets&#8230; the base to go design, develop, test and deliver the particular round to a particular service’s need. And so you get some of those natural efficiencies of having a common technology base.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/army-navy-experimentation-efforts-foreshadow-second-wind-for-hypervelocity-projectile/	2025-02-14T07:05:08-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/NEW-BAE_HVP_MidAir-scaled-e1739459255839.jpg
Ukraine orders 6,000 loitering munitions from Germany’s Helsing	An international donor has agreed to fund Ukraine's order of 6,000 Helsing manufactured and AI-enabled HX-2 loitering munitions (Helsing) MUNICH — Funded by an undisclosed international donor, Ukraine has placed an order with a leading European defense startup for production of 6,000 AI-enabled platforms, in a bid to significantly increase the war ravaged nation's loitering munitions inventory. The acquisition of Germany’s Helsing HX-2 one way attack drones coincides with a newly opened, first-of-its-kind production facility in southern Germany, dubbed RF-1, said the company in a translated company statement released on Thursday. The abbreviation stands for Resilience Factory. A Helsing spokesperson told Breaking Defense today that the HX-2 international donor 'will make' a future announcement about underwriting funding for the order. 'This new batch [of HX-2 loitering munitions] positions Helsing among the largest strike drone manufacturers in the world,' said the company in its statement. The new production site, it added, will 'initially' support production of 1,000 HX-2 aircraft per month, suggesting capacity can be increased if further demand merits a ramp up. 'Helsing has the ambition to deploy Resilience Factories across the European continent, with the ability to scale up production to tens of thousands of units in the event of conflict,' it noted. Ukraine previously ordered 4,000 HX-2 aircraft, said the Helsing spokesperson. The AI capabilities of the platform make it resistant to electronic warfare detection and it has been designed to strike artillery and armored targets out to a range of 100km, according to a product profile. Additionally, the integration of Helsing’s Altra reconnaissance and strike software enable deployment of HX-2 drone swarm formations. 'The HX-2 has been designed to be produced in large quantities and at a unit cost significantly lower than traditional systems, filling a growing gap in modern land warfare capabilities,' the company added. Loitering munitions have been a common feature of the war in Ukraine, offering combat mass at relatively low cost and short production cycles. Others that have arrived on the frontline include US Switchblades and French OSKAR (Opportunity Strike Kinetics Aircraft Ruggedised) systems. The startup has quickly made a distinctive mark on the European defense market by securing key contracts for the AI 'backbone' of the French-German-Spanish Future Combat Air System (SCAF), cooperating with Airbus on the Wingman future unmanned aircraft concept and is under contract to deliver a new AI-enabled electronic warfare platform as part of Saab's wider effort to integrate Arexis sensor equipment package on German Eurofighter EK (Electronic Combat) fighter jets.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/ukraine-orders-6000-loitering-munitions-from-germanys-helsing/	2025-02-14T06:01:38-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/HX-2-1.jpg
EDGE Group launches aero engine and propulsion firm, expands UAV testing facility	Swarming drones at EDGE Group's stand at Dubai Air Show 2023 (Agnes Helou / Breaking Defense) BEIRUT — Just days before the largest defense show in the Middle East, UAE defense giant EDGE Group announced its new aero engine and propulsions systems manufacturer POWERTECH. POWERTECH is EDGE's first company dedicated to developing and producing 'high-performance aero engines and complete propulsion systems. With a clear ambition to compete in the global propulsion market, POWERTECH will deliver reliable, purpose-built engines for civil aerospace and defence applications,' the firm said in a statement Wednesday. The company noted that POWERTECH will address 'international market needs' and will support the firm's unmanned and autonomous systems for national and international markets. 'The launch of POWERTECH represents a strategic move to enter the global propulsion market while enhancing EDGE’s capabilities across aerospace and autonomous systems,' Khaled Al Zaabi, president of EDGE's platforms and systems, said in the statement. 'By developing tailored, application-specific solutions, we are strengthening our market position and creating new opportunities for innovation and collaboration.' In a statement Thursday, EDGE also announced the expansion of XRANGE, its unmanned aerial vehicles testing facility launched by the firm's subsidiary REMAYA in November 2023. The expansion will include 'a secondary runway, two emergency runways, an environmental test centre, an unmanned aerial systems (UAS) Drone Training Village, and expansion of airspace for customer operations.' EDGE has also introduced a 'data acquisition systems facility' and will further add 'vehicle blast and ballistics test service' to the center, according to the statement. 'XRANGE was designed to push the boundaries of what is possible in terms of conducting critical TT&amp;E activities in the UAE,' CEO of REMAYA Haitham Awinat said in the statement. 'While significantly boosting our operational flexibility, these enhancements allow our clients to expedite their product development processes and accelerate the delivery of their solutions to market.' The secondary runway is 1.2 km long, increasing UAS operations on the test island. 'The new runway doubles the test island’s capacity to hold simultaneous flight operations for the conventional take-off and landing of UAVs while enhancing overall operational flexibility,' the firm said in a statement. EDGE Group is expected to display 200 defense platforms and services at the International Defense Exhibition and Conference, and the accompanying Naval Defense Exhibition taking place next week in Abu Dhabi.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/edge-group-launches-aero-engine-and-propulsion-firm-expands-uav-testing-facility/	2025-02-14T05:10:27-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/11/370244807_804947507984036_3855702757333965982_n-e1701364254203.jpg
