How the US Army is building its networks and cyber capabilities	Normally, one tries to avoid going to Augusta, Georgia in the hottest part of summer — that is, unless you’re attending the annual AFCEA TechNet conference, a requirement for those interested in military cyber and network capabilities. This year, Breaking Defense reporter Carley Welch braved the heat and hit the show floor, bringing back a series of stories from both the US Army — which gave updates on two pilot programs and discussed personnel issues — and DISA, whose boss, Lt. Gen. Robert Skinner, promised to use the next year to 'hit the accelerator' on a key priority. In this collection, you’ll see just some of the highlights from the conference.

US announces coalition mission in Iraq to end by 2025, but US ‘not withdrawing’	U.S. Army Soldiers, assigned to 37th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, 125th Infantry Regiment, 1st Battalion, Combined Joint Task Force – Operation Inherent Resolve, board a CH-47 Chinook helicopter after a live-fire exercise at Al Asad Air Base, Iraq, July 7, 2023. (U.S. Army photo by Spc. Timothy VanDusen) BEIRUT — The US formally announced today that the coalition mission in Iraq will come to a close in September 2025, but emphasized that troops will stay in country as part of an 'evolution of the military mission in Iraq' and the counter-ISIS mission will continue. 'To be clear, the United States is not withdrawing from Iraq,' a senior administration official told reporters today. 'We are moving towards the type of productive long-term security relationship that the United States has with partners around the world.' The US and Iraq have agreed 'on a two phase transition plan for operations in Iraq,' the official said. 'In the first phase, we'll be concluding the global coalition's military mission in Iraq, the Combined Joint Task Force Inherent Resolve, and ending the presence of coalition forces in certain locations in Iraq as mutually determined.' That phase will begin this month and finish by the end of September 2025. The second phase involves an 'understanding to allow the coalition to continue to support counter-ISIS operations in Syria from Iraq &#8230; until at least September 2026,' the official said. 'While ISIS is down, they are not out,' the official said. 'ISIS continues to pose a real threat although diminished in Iraq and the wider region. Together the US, Iraq and the coalition remain committed to the defeat to defeat the core ISIS threat. We plan to continue focusing on that important task as we head into the future.' The official did not say how many troops — US or coalition allies — would be leaving Iraq. Reuters previously reported that 'hundreds of troops' would be leaving. Though the announcement from Iraq marks a significant milestone in the long, contentious history of US-Iraqi relations, analyst Norman Ricklefs said it's better described as a 'drawdown' than a total 'withdrawal.' 'It will be conditions-based, so that hopefully we will not see a disaster as we saw when troops completely withdrew in 2011 and left behind a security vacuum that was filled by ISIS,' Ricklefs, CEO of geopolitical consultancy firm NAMEA Group, told Breaking Defense ahead of today's news. Ricklefs said this time around Iraqi forces are 'already very proficient, as we can see from the dramatic improvement in security in the major cities in the past few years. But the threat from a resurgent ISIS in Syria and rural areas of Iraq is still high, and Iraq will no doubt continue to benefit from US assistance in combating ISIS.' Iraqi defense analyst Ahmad Al Sherifi agreed with Ricklefs that Iraq was better positioned to counter terrorism, at least on land, but he said aerial assets and more advanced tech like electronic warfare suites could be an issue. The US invaded Iraq on March 20, 2003 on a mission to oust strongman Saddam Hussein. After a string of successes in overwhelming Iraqi forces and dismantling the government — resulting in an infamous speech by then-President George W. Bush in front of a 'Mission Accomplished' banner — the war devolved into a deadly, cumbersome fight against an violent insurgency while the US and its international partners struggled to reconstitute local governance. After President Barack Obama came into the White House in 2009, he announced a pledge to withdraw combat brigades from Iraq, and by December 2011, the final US troops pulled out, as recalled in a Council on Foreign Relations timeline. But that US withdrawal provided an opportunity for a terrorist group with its origins in an Iraqi al Qaeda offshoot, called the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, to gain power and extend its reach across both countries. Stunning and brutal military campaigns, grotesque public videos of executions that included Western victims and high-profile terrorist attacks in the US and Europe prompted the US to lead another multi-national force back into Iraq in 2014, this time under the banner Operation Inherent Resolve. Backed by thousands of airstrikes and leaning on local partners in Iraq, including Kurdish defense forces, the US-led coalition under Obama and then President Donald Trump managed to retake a vast majority of ISIS territory, kill its senior leadership and greatly reduce the terror threat posed from the group to the West. But US and international partner troops have remained in country in part ever since to ensure the terror threat does not rise again through continued operations. (Western troops have also become targets in Iraq and Syria not for ISIS but for Iran-backed Shi'a militias and, in one stunning case, Russian mercenaries.) In its latest review of Operation Inherent Resolve [PDF], the Pentagon Inspector General highlighted remarks from the leader of the US-led coalition, who said that the conditions that led to ISIS's rise in 2014 remained. As the analysts who spoke to Breaking Defense highlighted, US and Iraqi forces are likely betting that has changed Iraq's capability to take on ISIS with less international help to lean on.

Pentagon asks lawmakers to kill third-party look at an independent cyber force	A group of Army Reserve Soldiers from the 371st Chemical Company, 457th Chemical Battalion, 415th Chemical Brigade, 76th Operational Response Command, based out of Greenwood, South Carolina, watch their computer monitors as they undergo virtual battlespace training at Camp McCrady, South Carolina June 16. (Official U.S. Army Reserve photo by Sgt. 1st Class Brent C. Powell) WASHINGTON — The Pentagon has formally requested that lawmakers shut down a legislative proposal that would mandate an independent assessment of the establishment of a separate cyber service, three sources familiar with the matter told Breaking Defense. The appeal by the DoD contended that Congress had already called for an assessment of the current cyber landscape within the Pentagon, which included the potential for creating a cyber service in the 2023 NDAA, according to The Record. The Pentagon did not immediately respond to Breaking Defense's request for comment. 'DoD did express opposition to the provisions. However, it’s not unusual for DoD to express their opinion on provisions in the NDAA. They do so frequently on hundreds of provisions throughout the bill,' one senior committee aid told Breaking Defense. The idea of standing up a separate cyber service has long been a controversial topic in the department. Last year, officials warned that even though the service would confer some benefits, it’s likely that it would create confusion and overlap between the existing services’ cyber initiatives. 'A cyber service might have some benefits in ease of administrative management, but we have a variety of &#8230; military services in the Department of Defense who perform a variety of missions,' Mieke Eoynag, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for cyber policy told reporters at a Defense Writers Group last year. She added that 'having a cyber service that is divorced from those particular mission sets may pose some challenges in understanding the warfighting needs of the services to provide cyber to enable that fight.' 'I think the question is that for people who think the cyber service is the answer to our &#8230; current challenges in cyber personnel management: be careful what you wish for,' she concluded. Related: ‘Be careful what you wish for:’ DoD official warns separate cyber force could pose new challenges In April Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-Wisc., highlighted a study published by The Foundation for Defense of Democracies that called for a new independent service to sort out the 'inconsistent' nature of the current cyber set-up, as an FDD analyst put it. 'I will admit, I was skeptical at first; but over the last 18 months, I have been presented with an astounding array of data and rational arguments in favor of a Cyber Force, as well as a number of convincing arguments opposing such a force,' Gallagher, chairman of the Cyber, Information Technologies and Innovation Subcommittee, said in an April 10 hearing. 'In my mind, the most logical way to address this question is a fully independent evaluation of a notional Cyber Force, to be led by an entity other than the Department of Defense.' Lawmakers will have their first opportunity to craft a final version of the NDAA after the presidential election in November, when both the House and Senate return to Capitol Hill.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/pentagon-asks-lawmakers-to-kill-third-party-look-at-an-independent-cyber-force/	2024-09-27T11:56:11-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/10/211013_army_soldiers_monitors_5587272-scaled-e1634153082767.jpg
Pentagon confirms a ‘new class’ of Chinese nuclear sub sank pierside	Chinese president Xi Jinping and a PLA Navy honor guard await the King of Bahrain (Photo by Feng Li/Getty Images) WASHINGTON — The Pentagon has confirmed the submarine that sank pierside at a Wuhan shipyard is a 'new class' of nuclear vessels being developed by the Chinese navy. 'It is unclear if this shipyard is certified to handle nuclear materials. As such, we do not know if the submarine reactor was fueled at the time of incident, or if it is going to be relocated to a known nuclear-certified facility for its initial fueling, such as Huludao Shipyard, which has built all previous PLA Navy nuclear submarine classes,' according to a military official. The submarine's sinking was first reported by the Wall Street Journal on Thursday, which credited Tom Shugart, a former US Navy submariner and currently an associate at the Center for a New American Security, a DC think tank, with spotting unusual activity at the shipyard in satellite imagery. 'Everyone involved in reporting this clearly understands that nuclear submarines had not — yet — been built in Wuhan, and that this was a new development: a significant expansion of nuclear submarine production outside of Huludao,' Shugart said of the WSJ's reporting in a tweet. The majority of China's current submarine fleet is non-nuclear powered, but is known to operate at least six nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines and six nuclear-powered attack submarines, according to the Congressional Research Service [PDF]. A defense official on Thursday told reporters the incident raises 'obvious questions about training standards and equipment quality [as well as] deeper questions about the PLA's internal accountability and oversight of China's defense industry-which has long been plagued by corruption.' 'It's not surprising that the PLA Navy would try to conceal the fact that their new first-in-class nuclear-powered attack submarine sank pierside,' the defense official added.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/pentagon-confirms-a-new-class-of-chinese-nuclear-sub-sank-pierside/	2024-09-27T11:37:44-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/221219_xi_navy_GettyImages-180776873-scaled-e1671469373982.jpg
‘Main focus’: With new defense budget, Estonia pledges big investments in long-range ammo	An Estonian soldier carries an artillery round in this undated photo. (Estonian Ministry of Defence) WASHINGTON — NATO member Estonia has pledged to spend €1.6 billion ($1.8 billion) for long-range ammunition, saying it will devote a full quarter of its military budget to ammo in 'coming years.' 'Ammunition will be the main focus of the defence budget in the coming years,' Defence Minister Hanno Pevkur said in a release today. 'Of course, the Estonian Defence Forces are always ready to defend the Estonian people and the state without delay, but we still need more stocks of ammunition, among other things, to affect the adversary in its own territory.' Estonia, which shares an eastern border with Russia, said the €1.6 billion will be spent 'until 2031,' the defense ministry said, citing the State Budget Strategy approved by lawmakers earlier this week. RELATED: View from the north: What NATO leaders from Nordic, Baltic states think about defense Pevkur said that given the 'security situation' — likely a reference to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and its sabre-rattling about NATO's support for Kyiv — 'it is our responsibility to actively develop national defence and boost the capability of the Estonian Defence Forces.' He noted that Estonia already has €1.9 billion-worth of contracts on the books for 'previously planned stocks of ammunition and we will organize more tenders to fill our ammunition stores as soon as possible.' RELATED: Baltic defensive bunker line not meant to stop Russian attack, but &#8216;shape' it, general says Overall, Estonia plans to spend 3.3 percent of its GDP on defense through the next four years — well above the NATO-required 2 percent and, Tallin said, behind only Poland in defense-to-total budget ratio. In the release, the Estonian MoD cited a few key pending acquisitions, including the nation's first High-Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), a new loitering munitions 'battery,' and German Iris-T medium-range air defenses, all expected in 2025. RELATED: Estonian volunteers in Ukraine are helping prepare Tallin's rapid response force Senior Estonian officials have long warned that Russia could turn its attention to eastern European NATO members when the war in Ukraine is over. Earlier this year Estonia's then-chief of defense, Gen. Martin Herem, even produced a mathematical formula for when he expected Moscow to attempt to invade Estonia. 'There’s only one factor that we can change: our readiness,' he said in early May. 'We can support Ukraine, but one day [Russia] is coming out.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/main-focus-with-new-defense-budget-estonia-pledges-big-investments-in-long-range-ammo/	2024-09-27T09:06:27-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/240927_estonia_soldier_artillery_MOD-e1727452599901.jpg
The melting fortress: The United States, Canada, and the race against time in the Arctic	ARCTIC OCEAN, AK &#8211; JULY 29: Ice floes surround the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Healy in the Arctic Ocean on July 29, 2017. The cutter is the largest icebreaker in the Coast Guard and serves as a platform for scientific reseach. (Photo by Bonnie Jo Mount/The Washington Post via Getty Images) For years, Moscow has prioritized the Arctic as a critical pillar of its national security, opening or refurbishing over 50 military bases and scaling up military operations across the region. The United States, meanwhile, with a focus alternating between the Middle East and the Pacific, has largely entrusted Arctic security to its allies and partners in the region. The problem: One of those key partners, Canada, is by its own admission unprepared to face the Arctic challenge. Unless the US works quickly to help fill that gap, it means American interests in the Arctic are going to be at risk moving forward. Historically, the United States has been protected by the operational challenges of waging an Arctic offensive in frigid conditions. But the growing prospect of a 'Blue Arctic,' ice-free for months out of the year, could allow a great power adversary to deploy military assets right in America’s backyard for the first time in history. Already, Russian and Chinese warships have been seen patrolling together off the coast of Alaska in unprecedented numbers. As the US military’s former top commander for the Arctic, Gen. Terrence J. O’Shaughnessy said, the region is 'no longer a fortress wall' and we must be prepared to defend it. In the Arctic, Russia is not a 'pacing threat' as China is in the Indo-Pacific; it is well ahead of the United States. Russia controls nearly 53 percent of the Arctic Ocean’s coastline and has built countless bases across the region. Washington, meanwhile, only maintains six bases and five of them are outside of the Arctic Circle in southern Alaska. As of 2023, the United States Coast Guard possessed only five icebreakers or ice-capable patrol ships which are critical to maintaining a presence in the Arctic. Moscow, meanwhile, has 57 such vessels. It will be years before the American icebreaking fleet is large enough to effectively support large-scale US operations. In addition to rapidly scaling up its force posture, Russia has also conducted unprecedented naval exercises and harassed American fishing vessels in Arctic waters. Moscow has begun to assert its control over newly expanded shipping lanes through the Arctic like the Northern Sea Route (NSR), declaring certain parts of this route to be internal Russian waters with an aim towards regulating shipping that passes through it. In the future, Russia may try to expand its control over other Arctic waters closer to the United States and present a direct threat to the homeland and to US operations in Europe and the Indo-Pacific. The United States Navy’s top Arctic commander, Adm. Daryl Caudle fears that Moscow may try to create its own '‘nine-dashed line’ around the North Pole.' Indisputably, the United States is ill-equipped to face the Arctic challenge alone. To maintain security and stability, the United States Department of Defense (DoD) has increasingly emphasized the role of regional allies and partners as 'the core of DoD’s strategy for the Arctic.' Canada remains at the top of the list, but Ottawa’s ability to rise to the occasion has been called into question by experts and officials alike. Canada’s own Minister of National Defense Bill Blair infamously remarked that the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF)’s recruiting problems have sent the organization into a 'death spiral.' Meanwhile, Former Vice Admiral Mark Norman described Canada’s military readiness as 'borderline atrocious.' From an American perspective, Canada’s military woes highlight a fundamental weakness of US national security strategy in the Arctic, which depends heavily on collaboration with able partners. RELATED: ICE Pact: Why the US had to recruit help in race with Russia, China for Arctic icebreakers Controlling nearly 25 percent of the global Arctic, Canada has a vested interest in Arctic security. Canada currently possesses four operational Arctic and offshore patrol ships (AOPS) with two more set to be delivered by the end of 2024. The CAF maintains 300 full-time military personnel based out of the Yukon and Northwest Territories. These forces conduct joint long-range patrols, provide logistical support, and practice under-ice diving activities. Annually, Operation NANOOK provides an opportunity for Canada to showcase its Arctic capabilities, emphasizing the ability of the CAF to monitor and protect the Arctic. NANOOK provides a crucial opportunity for Canada to work with its close allies and partners — notably the United States — to enhance both Canadian and US capabilities in a region where Canada has far more tactical experience and familiarity with the operational landscape. But could Canada respond if needed? As of December 2023, the DND reported that only 58 percent of the CAF could respond if called to aid NATO allies. By some estimates, the Canadian air force, navy, and army operate at suboptimal capacities of 45 percent, 46 percent, and 54 percent respectively. Recruitment shortfalls, the mishandling of sex offenses, and resulting personnel shortages have exacerbated these suboptimal operational capacities. The CAF missed its recruitment goal by nearly 16,000 members in 2023 and can anticipate a similar outcome in 2024. Recently, more have left the ranks of the CAF than have joined. Canada knows the situation is dire and has long sought to revitalize its armed forces, going back to 2017 when it announced plans to grow annual defense spending from $18.9 billion CAD ($14 billion USD) to $32.7 billion by 2026-2027. The DND has redoubled these efforts in recent years with much support from citizens. A March 2024 poll conducted by the Angus Reid Institute revealed that an astounding 53 percent of Canadians say the government should increase its military spending level to 2 percent of GDP or beyond. The Canadian Government’s 2024 defense policy, Our North, Strong and Free: A Renewed Vision for Canada’s Defence, highlights asserting Canadian sovereignty in the Arctic as the most urgent task facing the CAF. Bold, ambitious, and engaged, this strategy sets lofty goals of achieving defense spending of 1.76 percent by 2029, additional funding of $8.1 billion over the next five years, and spending $73 billion on defense over the next 20 years. These measures are a critical step in the right direction, but Canada is still fighting an uphill battle. The sprawling timetables of these reforms are at odds with the CAF’s recruitment and retention crises. Newly-procured equipment will be useless without sufficient personnel to operate and maintain it. Furthermore, 62 percent of the aforementioned defense expenditures are estimated to take place between 2027 and 2037. By the time the CAF — and the United States — develop modern Arctic capabilities to counter Russian dominance in the region, the operational landscape could look entirely different. With Russia’s focus firmly on Ukraine for the foreseeable future, the United States and Canada have a unique opportunity to make up for lost time. In addition to modernizing NORAD, more must be done to combat potential Russian gray zone activity on the ground. First, the allies should build new joint bases in the Arctic Circle. In a region where difficult environmental conditions ensure that 'presence means influence,' these bases would allow Washington and Ottawa to collaboratively monitor and quickly respond to Russian gray zone activities. Units stationed at these bases could gain important experience training alongside each other in Arctic conditions. Once new icebreakers and other ice-capable vessels are delivered, these units could be widely deployed to neutralize Russian provocations across the region. Second, Washington and Ottawa should increase funding for their respective coast guards. These organizations play a critical role in defending against gray zone activity and currently lack the resources to effectively respond to Russian provocations. For example, when a group of Russian and Chinese ships approached Alaskan shores last fall, they were shadowed by a single United States Coast Guard cutter. Better-equipped coast guards could give the allies more flexibility — and indeed, credibility — to respond to different types of Russian gray zone warfare in both the short and long term. RELATED: Upcoming DoD Arctic Strategy will engage NATO allies The United States is in desperate need of a reality check regarding its closest ally’s present capabilities: Right now, Canada cannot be the bulwark of Arctic security and certainly cannot be the linchpin of the US Arctic strategy. Until the capabilities of the CAF have been fortified by the delivery of the DND’s promises, the United States must seriously consider the possibility of going it alone in the Arctic.

‘The king doesn’t lie down to save the pawn’: Why Iran may let Hezbollah face Israel alone	People in Iran listen to the speech by Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah on November 3, 2023 in Tehran, Iran. (Photo by Majid Saeedi/Getty Images) BEIRUT and WASHINGTON — As Israel has pummeled Hezbollah, killing several senior leaders, blowing up purported hidden weapons caches and striking out at hundreds of members through booby-trapped pagers, the group's most powerful backer, Iran, has stayed almost completely on the sidelines, offering token public support. That's because, more than a half-dozen analysts told Breaking Defense, Tehran is prioritizing its own strategic interests — in this case staying out of a conflict for as long as possible, even if it means allowing its longtime regional beneficiary to be decimated by the enemy Iran has long prepared them to face. Hezbollah's patronage from Iran is no secret. Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah previously highlighted the proximity with Iran, to an extent that in a June 2016 speech he said that the group’s 'funds, weapons, salaries and all other expenses come from Iran.' But for any Hezbollah members looking for robust reassurances from their backer, especially with signs indicating Israel may attempt a ground invasion, they'd be hard pressed to find them in public statements by Iranian leadership in recent days. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei declined to offer tangible support in an address Monday, only saying that Israeli strikes targeting Hezbollah leaders would not work and that 'the organizational strength and human resources of Hezbollah is very strong.' The same day Iran's new president, Masoud Pezeshkian, said Iran would 'defend any group that is defending its rights and itself' but claimed Israel was trying to draw Iran into a 'trap.' Instead he emphasized an appeal to the international community to 'now allow Lebanon to become another Gaza.' 'We seek peace for all and have no intention of conflict with any country,' he said. On Thursday the Financial Times reported that Iran had dispatched envoys to Lebanon to quell Hezbollah fears that it was being left out in the cold, but that will be tall order. Prior to that news, analysts told Breaking Defense that the war has revealed Iran's perception of Hezbollah as a tool of statecraft more than a true partner it's obliged to rescue. Hezbollah has been propped up by Iran all these years to be a threat on Israel's border that Tehran can activate in case of open conflict between Israel and Iran, according to the experts. But that relationship is not a two-way street, according to Jonathan Lord, a regional expert with the Center for a New American Security. 'Hezbollah exists to protect Iran, not the other way around,' Lord told Breaking Defense. 'The king doesn’t lie down to save the pawn.' Wehbe Katicha, a retired Lebanese armed forces general, concurred, saying 'When Hezbollah was in a hard position, Iran has abandoned it and is using the excuse that Hezbollah is capable of confrontation.' 'Iran’s first priority is to avoid violence escalating into all-out regional war,' added Thomas Juneau, a regional expert from the University of Ottawa. And even for one of its crown jewels in the so-called Axis of Resistance, 'Iran’s actions this week aim at avoiding pouring oil on the fire — which overt and vocal support for Hezbollah would inevitably do.' Still, Khalil Helou, another retired general in the Lebanese military, said he was surprised by just how muted Iran's reaction to the Israeli offensive has been. 'They are not giving signs of supporting Hezbollah in this war. Hezbollah is under attack, and Iran is doing nothing,' he said. '[Instead] Iranian speeches show appeasement towards US and talks about nuclear deal, and there is a trend for appeasement with Israel.' A cloud of smoke erupts during an Israeli air strike on the village of Sujud in southern Lebanon on September 25, 2024. Israel announced dozens of new air strikes on Hezbollah strongholds in Lebanon on September 24, a day after 492 people, including 35 children, were killed in the deadliest bombardment since a devastating war in 2006. (Photo by Rabih DAHER / AFP) (Photo by RABIH DAHER/AFP via Getty Images) However, the experts said Israel still must be cognizant of Iran's breaking point. 'If Israel pushes too far and Hezbollah is under threat of total collapse, which would mean the Hezbollah tool isn’t there when Iran needs it as a second-strike capability against Israel, that could compel [Tehran] to try and take some escalatory action,' Lord said. 'So I think the Israelis have to walk a fine line, understanding that it would be the tail waging the dog for Tehran to come save Hezbollah.' Juneau said that in the case of an Israeli ground invasion of south Lebanon, 'it becomes more likely that Iran would step in and increase its support for Hezbollah. Iran would still prioritize avoiding more escalation, but at the same time it would also try to limit what are already significant losses for Hezbollah.' Another factor that might trigger Iranian support for Hezbollah could be 'a direct attack inside Iran,' Sina Azodi, an adjunct professor at George Washington University who specializes in Iranian policy, told Breaking Defense. Israel is believed to have previously killed a senior member of the Palestinian militant group Hamas in Tehran. 'This would most likely trigger a response, but I think that overall Iranians are cognizant of the dangers of this and that's why they've showed a great deal of restraint,' Azodi said. MORE COVERAGE ON ISRAEL AND LEBANON: The last time Tehran launched a high-profile attack on Israel, it was in April with a mostly ineffective missile and drone barrage. That came in response to a reported Israeli strike on senior Iranian military leaders in Damascus. Outside of repeating that offensive, experts said Iran appears to be fairly limited in what it could realistically do. 'So if we’re talking about an Israeli operation that fundamentally changes that equation, near-irreparably destroys Hezbollah, Iranians are then looking at the menu of options they have to try and get Israel to stay its hand,' Lord said. He said that 'on one hand, [a response] maybe something similar to what we saw in April, which Iran seems loathe to do again based on their messaging and the posture of US forces in the region.' He said Tehran could consider something 'perhaps more limited and targeted, but it doesn’t have great options, because we’re outside the bounds of what is the typical Iranian doctrine for projection power and coercing its enemies in the region.' Behnam Ben Taleblu of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a group critical of the Iranian regime, said a repeat of the April barrage was possible, but this time 'with less warning and with more advanced systems. But that change would have to be brought about by near-existential conditions' for Hezbollah. Mara Karlin, a longtime regional expert who has served a number of roles in the Pentagon, specified that an Iranian support to its proxies will include training and equipment, 'but it’s hard to imagine the Iranian military deploying to support of Hezbollah.' 'This is born of a desire to break the tit-for-tat and create the political space and security for a return of [Israel's] displaced citizens,' Ben Taleblu said. 'This will apparently only come with deeper blows landed against Hezbollah that put it in a bind when it comes to responding.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/the-king-doesnt-lie-down-to-save-the-pawn-why-iran-may-let-hezbollah-face-israel-alone/	2024-09-27T02:05:13-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/hezbollah-iran-flag-scaled-e1727384521495.jpg
As Hurricane Helene looms, Pentagon prepares by moving ships and planes	A sign displays a hurricane warning along a roadside as preparations are made for the arrival of Hurricane Helene, in Cedar Key, Florida on September 25, 2024. (Photo by Miguel J. Rodriguez Carrillo / AFP) (Photo by MIGUEL J. RODRIGUEZ CARRILLO/AFP via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — As a life-threatening Category 4 hurricane makes its way towards Florida's panhandle, the US Navy and Air Force again have been forced to relocate numerous people, aircraft and ships — the kind of extreme weather the Pentagon has been preparing to deal with more and more often. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is predicting the 'extremely dangerous' Hurricane Helene will make landfall Thursday evening along Florida's northwest coast, characterizing it as 'unusually large' with wind fields extending as far as 275 miles from its center. Flooding is expected in Tallahassee, Atlanta and parts of North Carolina. Florida's northern region is home to numerous military installations including naval bases in Jacksonville, Pensacola, Whiting Field as well as Eglin and Tyndall Air Force Bases and Hurlburt Field, among others. A Navy spokesperson on Thursday told Breaking Defense the destroyers Delbert D. Black (DDG-119) and Thomas Hudner (DDG-116) left Naval Station Mayport on Tuesday, and that Mason (DDG-87) and Lassen (DDG-82) did the same on Wednesday to get out of the hurricane's way. 'Other ships are in maintenance periods and will not sortie but will remain pierside in Mayport. Storm preparations involve positioning these ships at heavy weather moors based on the forecast of Helene and adding storm lines once the ships are in position,' the spokesperson said, adding that various aircraft had also been either evacuated or secured in hangars. The Air Force is no stranger to the impact a cataclysmic hurricane can have on its installations. In 2018, Hurricane Michael ravaged Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida, ripping off the ceiling of aircraft hangars, destroying buildings and leveling groves of trees. While most of its F-22 stealth fighters moved ahead of that storm, about a dozen were left behind and were damaged. As the service rebuilt the base, it decided to relocate the F-22 mission and bring in F-35s. Tyndall AFB is currently closed to non-mission essential personnel, and a small number of personnel have been directed to evacuate counties with a hurricane warning, the Air Force said. Its F-35s have been relocated to Nellis AFB, Nev., and Tinker AFB, Okla., for the duration of the storm. Its QF-16 aerial target aircraft and E-9 prop planes have also been relocated to Gulfport, Miss. Nearby Eglin AFB, about two hours from Tyndall, has also moved to a mission-essential posture in advance of the hurricane, according to a news release. Earlier today, the base posted photos of aircraft stored away in aircraft hangars 'to protect them from the coming weather conditions brought on by Hurricane Helene.' Down the road from Eglin, all aircraft belonging to Hurlburt AFB and Duke Field have been evacuated or hangered, the Air Force said. MacDill AFB near Tampa is under a limited evacuation notice, issued Wednesday by the base’s commander, Col. Ed Szczepanik, according to the base Facebook page. Thirteen of the base’s KC-135s were already off-station, 11 KC-135s were evacuated to Bangor, Maine and Pease, NH, and two tankers were put in hangars on base, the Air Force said. Patrick Space Force Base — near Melbourne, Fla. — closed some facilities today but has not issued any evacuation notices, the Air Force said. Outside Florida, Moody AFB in Georgia has evacuated its C-130s, A-10s and HH-60s to Columbus AFB, Miss., but there are 'no indications' it will evacuate personnel, the Air Force stated. Of the C-17s at Joint Base Charleston in South Carolina, the Air Force evacuated 15 planes, put three in hangars on base, and sent three on missions this morning, in addition to the 24 aircraft already off station. The final destinations for aircraft during a natural disaster is 'determined based on the severity of weather events and space availability,' an Air Force spokesperson said. 'Air Force Weather Airmen at local installations in coordination with the 557th Weather Wing determine the timing, intensity, storm track, and other factors affecting both military operations and resource protection' and work with commanders to figure out where to disburse aircraft. Operations group commanders coordinate evacuation locations before, during and after a storm, the spokesperson said. Then, the final decision to evacuate aircraft, personnel or equipment is made by the wing commander and reviewed by that unit’s major command. Thinking through how the service might deal with a given a natural disaster has been the subject of both war games and strategic documents signed out by Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro and Meredith Berger, the service' assistant secretary for energy, installations and environment. RELATED: An Island, An Amphib, A Typhoon: Navy Hosts Climate-Focused War Game That eagerness to address climate-related issues though has also resulted in Del Toro being publicly confronted by lawmakers with accusations that he is prioritizing climate change over shipbuilding and warfighting. In one hearing earlier this year, during which multiple GOP lawmakers became visibly irate with the Navy secretary, Del Toro defended his record, stating he spends '75 [percent] of [his] time on shipbuilding,' but insisted being prepared for climate incidents remains a major concern. More broadly, however, Pentagon officials have for years now made the argument that climate change, and the extreme weather that goes with it, is a national security concern all its own. 'You can't train for combined operations with allies and partners if the training facilities are flooded,' Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks said last August, after another hurricane tore through the southern US. 'You can't run an installation without water because you're in a drought, and you can't adequately prepare for future threats if you're occupied with urgent crises.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/as-hurricane-helene-looms-pentagon-prepares-by-moving-ships-and-planes/	2024-09-26T15:53:03-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/hurricane-scaled-e1727382514871.jpg
Congress denies Air Force request for second C-40 VIP transport plane	A 932nd Airlift Wing Boeing C-40C sits on the flightline, during a foggy morning at Scott Air Force Base, Illinois, April 6, 2019. (U.S. Air Force photo by Christopher Parr) WASHINGTON — Lawmakers have rejected a request by the Air Force to acquire a second C-40 aircraft, Breaking Defense recently learned, adding another setback in the service’s bid to expand the airlift fleet that transports top US officials. Alongside a call for one C-40 aircraft in the fiscal 2025 budget submission, the Air Force additionally asked Congress to rearrange FY24 funds to procure a second aircraft, the service confirmed to Breaking Defense. Known as a reprogramming, the request was denied by Congress in July. Lawmakers in several draft defense bills similarly zeroed out or drastically reduced about $329 million in funds for the C-40 included in the FY25 request. The reprogramming request to fund the other C-40 sought a roughly identical amount as the FY25 budget submission, according to a source with knowledge of the process. The Air Force is pursuing the new C-40s to supplement a fleet of four C-32s, which are primarily tasked with serving 'Top Five' users: the vice president, first spouse, secretary of defense, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and secretary of state. The Air Force spokesperson told Breaking Defense that the C-32 fleet’s mission capable rates meet the service’s 'standards,' but that the fleet 'is unable to fully support all Top Five customers' — mainly because there simply aren’t enough planes. 'The current C-32A fleet can only support 59 percent of the Top Five user requests, which is the primary contributing factor for the Air Force to request additional aircraft,' the spokesperson said. The requirement for new jets was generated by a review between the Air Force, Office of the Secretary of Defense and the White House, they added. Air Force VIP airlift is chiefly carried out by the C-32 and C-40. The C-32 is a militarized version of Boeing’s 757 jetliner, whereas the smaller C-40 is based on the company’s 737 Next Generation. The secretary of defense also frequently travels on the Air Force's E-4B 'Doomsday Plane,' while the US president typically flies aboard the VC-25A, known as Air Force One when the commander-in-chief is onboard. Those two aircraft are based on Boeing’s 747 jumbo jet. RELATED: First flight of new Air Force One jet slips to 2026, Air Force says Although the C-32 fleet is largely reserved for Top Five travel, the C-40 — which transports a broader set of key officials — can also fulfill C-32 taskings. But demand on both aircraft fleets remains high, and this year the C-40 was the source of embarrassing headlines for the administration when mechanical issues reportedly stranded Secretary of State Antony Blinken twice after meetings in Davos and Paris. Asked about contingency plans for backup aircraft, the Air Force spokesperson said that the 'importance' of supporting Top Five travel informs 'standing DoD/AF policy to backup home station departures to help ensure mission success in case of a last-minute aircraft maintenance issue.' Two variants of the C-40, known as the C-40B and C-40C, comprise the current fleet of 11 aircraft. The new jet dubbed the C-40D would be similar to the B variant that includes secure communications for senior leaders, which is also featured on the C-32. The Air Force spokesperson said the C-40Ds would also be configured to hold up to 40 passengers in addition to VIPs, increasing passenger capacity over the C-40B. The C-32’s baseline airframe, the 757, is no longer in production, leaving the 737 as the only US-made, commercially available narrowbody jetliner that can expand executive airlift capacity. The Air Force first revealed plans to purchase the newer C-40 in the service’s FY25 budget request. Some key congressional committees have indicated they would reject most or all funding for the endeavor, though Senate appropriators left the request intact in their markup of the FY25 spending bill. Lawmakers this week approved stopgap funding that will run into December, meaning the FY25 budget likely won’t be finalized until the end of the calendar year — if not longer. Asked about an acquisition strategy for the aircraft, the Air Force spokesperson said the service expects to share more details in FY25. The new fiscal year begins Oct. 1.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/congress-denies-air-force-request-for-second-c-40-vip-transport-plane/	2024-09-26T11:59:16-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/C-40-scaled-e1727372638241.jpg
The next president must lead on missile defense	The White House in Washington, DC, US, on Thursday, Aug. 29, 2024. (Photographer: Kent Nishimura/Bloomberg via Getty Images) If you were to ask average Americans how much of the defense budget is allocated to defeating adversary missile attacks on the homeland, they would likely guess a significant amount. 10 percent? 5 percent? The reality: not even 1 percent. Out of a proposed $850 billion dollar defense budget this year, about $6 billion, defined generously, is tagged for defending the homeland from Chinese, Russian or North Korean missiles. And the Biden Administration this year proposed a $500 million cut for the Missile Defense Agency’s total budget. Why seek cuts to missile defense, even after US-made and co-developed systems have scored stunning successes defending the skies of Ukraine and Israel? President Joe Biden has historically been critical of US homeland ballistic missile defense on feasibility grounds, apparently unpersuaded by the last three tests, all successes, against threat representative targets. Some of his supporters are even wary of the regional and point defense systems that would be useful in defending the US homeland against low-flying cruise missiles — arguing falsely that such capabilities are 'untested.' Perhaps sensing an electoral advantage — who doesn’t want to be more defended? — President Donald Trump has made building an American version of Israel’s 'Iron Dome' system a regular promise on the campaign trail. While the Iron Dome system is tailor-made for the kinds of threats Israel faces (rockets, drones, and cruise missiles), not the threats the US homeland faces (advanced cruise missiles, ballistic missiles, and hypersonic glide vehicles), an American version might be structured using the same principles. For instance, a 'layered' defense employs different interceptors that are optimized for countering particular threats. To meet American requirements, one layer could counter long-range ballistic missiles, another layer could counter maneuvering hypersonic glide vehicles, and another layer could counter low-flying cruise missiles. The timing for a revolution in support of homeland missile defense on a scale not seen since President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s could not be better. The combination of vastly improved technology, mounting adversary threats, and resurgent US political will indicates a growing role for homeland missile defense in US defense strategy. Many Americans may not know it, but the United States has refused to develop ballistic homeland missile defenses against China and Russia, and built only very limited cruise missile defenses, for fear of causing an 'arms race' or inducing preemptive strikes during a crisis. Beijing and Moscow have predictably exploited Washington’s restraint, built their own homeland missile defense systems, and tailored their military strategies around threatening coercive missile strikes on what they see as a vulnerable US homeland. If adversaries believe that coercive strikes on the US homeland, at or below the nuclear threshold, can deter the American public or its leaders from defending their national interests, then that makes attacks more likely. Weakness invites aggression. America must no longer deter its enemies with one arm tied behind its back. Relying almost exclusively on threats of punishment without the parallel threat of denying the adversary’s attack increases the risk of attack, escalation, and damage to the homeland if deterrence fails. Critics occasionally acknowledge the deterrence benefits of improved and expanded homeland integrated air and missile defense but object on the basis that the systems must work perfectly, a 'leak proof' defense, for it to be worth the investment. This is a strawman standard. Air and missile defenses are meant to raise the 'price of entry' for an adversary’s attack such that he fears two things: failing to achieve the desired military and political effects, and prompting an unacceptable response. Should deterrence fail, air and missile defenses limit the damage and help preserve the capability to respond effectively. Whichever candidate is elected president in November should recognize these strategic benefits and phase in budget increases towards homeland missile defense over their term with a goal of reaching around two percent of the annual US defense budget. These increases over the short term should prioritize terrestrial, airborne, sea-based, and space-based sensors that can characterize the nature of the missile threat and inform decisions on picking the right interceptor. Then-Commander of US Northern Command, Gen. VanHerck stated that 'uncrewed, semi-autonomous' air and maritime sensors can help provide advanced warning. Additionally, a renewed focus on 'left of launch' options, i.e., before an adversary launches an attack, can improve deterrence by injecting doubt in the minds of the adversary military’s leaders that an attack will go as planned — or, should deterrence fail, that the damage will be worth the cost of the US response. Over the long term, the United States should lean into its advantages over its adversaries: its competitive market economy and its allies. The US economy is tech-heavy and allies are already helping to co-develop advanced missile defenses — but there is more to be done, especially exploiting the space domain and advancing directed energy capabilities to greatly lower the cost per intercept, initially for counter-unmanned aerial systems and soon for cruise missile defense. Building the capabilities to defend the US homeland from a series of coercive missile strikes will help deter conflict both at home and abroad as adversaries must consider not only their initial attacks failing, but also the US response — the worst of both worlds from their perspective. Only the sustained attention of the President of the United States will break the current logjam on US missile defense policy and determine whether adversaries can easily envision successful strikes in the heart of America.

‘I don’t see it’: Before their CCA drones even take to the air, Anduril and General Atomics trade shots	A full-sized model of General Atomics's Collaborative Combat Aircraft (top) and Anduril's (bottom) on display at AFA 2024 on Sept. 20, 2024. (Breaking Defense photos) WASHINGTON — On the exhibit floor of the Air Force’s biggest conference last week, two full-sized models of next-generation combat drones squared off amid a maze of defense contractor booths, drawing crowds that included the head of the Air Force. On one side, the Fury, built by defense tech startup Anduril. On the other, a variant of the Gambit family of drones built by General Atomics, a pioneer of the unmanned systems industry. It’s a scene that, 20 years ago, would be almost inconceivable for the fighter-jet obsessed Air Force, then still in the nascent stages of adopting unmanned aircraft for mostly surveillance missions. The drones on display are the first iteration of what the Air Force has said is a generational leap in air dominance: Collaborative Combat Aircraft designed to fly autonomously alongside, or ahead of, manned fighters as an aerial force multiplier. But while the Air Force envisions the CCAs engaging enemy targets in high-risk scenarios, at the AFA 2024 conference, with a production decision looming and hundreds of millions of dollars on the line, General Atomics and Anduril fired off a few rounds directly at each other in a rare public spat. Speaking to Breaking Defense on the show floor, General Atomics spokesman C. Mark Brinkley called Anduril 'the Theranos of defense,' referring to the much-hyped but ultimately hollow promises from the infamous pharma tech firm. He questioned how the Fury could carry weapons and host a landing gear with a large bottom inlet along the belly of the aircraft. 'Sometimes you find these companies, and they say they're going to use one drop of blood and they're going to revolutionize the whole world, and then they grow up to be Theranos,' he said. 'Quite frankly, when you look at the Fury — to me, it looks like trying to use a drop of blood to change the world. And I don’t see it.' Asked about Brinkley’s comments, Anduril Chief Strategy Officer Chris Brose declined to comment specifically about where the weapons would be stored on Fury, or to offer his own critique of General Atomics. 'We don't make it a habit of talking trash about our competitors,' Brose said. 'We don't think that it advances Anduril's cause to talk down other amazing companies that have been doing this for a really long time. Our focus is on ourselves and doing great work and continuing to beat expectations that people have of us. And, you know, seven years of evidence would suggest we're doing pretty well.' However, Anduril founder Palmer Luckey wasn’t so measured. He called out the legacy dronemaker publicly on Sept. 16 in a response to a sponsored post where General Atomics claimed, 'No other aerospace and defense manufacturer is poised to deliver a CCA as capable.' 'The sponsored article written by General Atomics PR people doth protest too much, methinks,' Luckey posted on the X social media platform. The sponsored article written by General Atomics PR people doth protest too much, methinkshttps://t.co/TLtf9xxhTH &mdash; Palmer Luckey (@PalmerLuckey) September 16, 2024 The Air Force in April awarded contracts for CCA prototypes to General Atomics and Anduril, which prevailed over defense aerospace juggernauts Lockheed Martin, Boeing and Northrop Grumman. The service has maintained the competitive field for CCAs is still wide open, with Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall saying last week that the service is 'moving towards greater reliance on uncrewed aircraft.' And while the service plans to make a production decision for its first increment of CCAs in 2026, Air Force leaders have routinely reiterated that it could buy drones from one or both of the two companies making CCA prototypes, or could even award a deal to one of the vendors it had cut in previous phases of the program. Among the biggest differences between the General Atomics and Anduril drones was the smaller size of the Fury, though analyst Byron Callan noted that the final version of the Anduril CCA will be 'slightly larger' than the model. (Brose described the Anduril model as 'full-scale.') Another 'very apparent difference' between the two is that the Fury vehicle will carry weapons externally, while the General Atomics CCA has an internal weapons bay, Callan said in a Sept. 17 note to investors. 'That could create more drag and make the Fury less stealthy, though it may not matter if the initial increment of CCA is a relatively small buy of air vehicles to refine tactics and training,' he said. Despite the sniping between General Atomics and Anduril, the irony is that both seem to share the same challenges, said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst with AeroDynamic Advisories. General Atomics has not disclosed what engine will power its CCA variant, while Aviation Week reports that the Williams International FJ 44-4 will be used in the Fury. However, engines sized for those drones in the 2,000-3,000 pound thrust range may not be powerful enough to operate across the long distances in the Asia-Pacific region, Aboulafia said. Production is another major question, with Anduril having no experience in large-scale aircraft production, and General Atomics is relatively inexperienced when it comes to manufacturing very high volumes of aircraft in a short period of time, he added. 'They can criticize each other, but ultimately, the two biggest problems seem to be things they have in common,' Aboulafia said. Both the Anduril and General Atomics CCAs are expected to fly next year — a milestone that will kick off testing of both the air vehicle itself and its integration with the various AI and software cores that will allow the drones to operate semi-autonomously. All of that will inform the Air Force’s eventual production decision in 2026. Anduril has not given a specific timeline for when its first Fury prototype will roll out and fly, but Brose said it remains on schedule to meet the testing and production timelines laid out by the Air Force. The company is currently testing 'core components' of the air vehicle, such as the landing gear, which Anduril is producing in-house to cut costs. 'I think the whole thesis for us is that the core requirement is cost, right? You're not going to have an attritable aircraft if the cost is not as low as possible,' Brose said. 'So a lot of the choices that we're making are around how you design the aircraft to be as simple as possible, as easy to produce, to take advantage as much as possible of commercial supply chains.' On the production side, Anduril intends to choose a location for its first major production site by the end of the year, Brose said. The facility, dubbed Arsenal, will be tooled to be able to quickly accommodate the production of different weapon systems, with CCA driving the urgency of standing up the new site. RELATED: Anduril unveils new Arsenal factory in bid to scale up weapons production 'We will have a decision very, very soon, and we have to in order to hit the timelines that we're required to hit with CCA,' he said. 'Someone might also look at this and say, ‘This is why you guys are going to fail. This isn't possible. You're moving into production on a far larger class of capability than you ever produced before, and you haven't even stood up the manufacturing location to do it.’ I think our view is, we feel, like I said, incredibly confident on the timelines that we're on.' While General Atomics still plans on flying its first purpose-built CCA prototype in mid-2025, it considers the XQ-67A demonstrator it flew in February as part of the Air Force’s Off Board Sensing System program as its 'first flight platform,' said Dave Alexander, president of General Atomics’s aeronautics business. GA-ASI's XQ-67A OBSS on display at AFA 2024 (Valerie Insinna/Breaking Defense) 'The design we're doing now is taking it to the next level so it can be mass produced,' he told Breaking Defense. 'We're going to be, mid-next year, ready to go into full rate production. And when I say that, that means manufacturing with automation, and designs that can be… produced in large batches.' General Atomics has said there is 80 percent commonality in the bill of material between the XQ-67A and its CCA offering. Before the rollout of its first CCA prototype, it has been conducting surrogate testing of key mission systems and autonomy software onboard an MQ-20 Avenger the company is using as a testbed, Alexander said. RELATED: General Atomics could fly first CCA prototype in mid-2025: Aeronautics president But while Anduril and General Atomics may be crouched at the starting block, that doesn’t mean other racers are standing on the sidelines. Other defense contractors such as Lockheed and Boeing have indicated they will compete for the second increment of CCAs. John Clark, who heads Lockheed’s Skunk Works advanced development unit, told reporters last week that the company’s next CCA offering for the Air Force will likely be much more low-cost and expendable than the stealthy drone it had offered for the first round of the competition. 'You could certainly armchair quarterback and say, well, the Air Force isn't valuing survivability right now, so we gold plated something that they didn't need gold plated,' he said, adding that he believes there may be a 'reckoning' in the future where the service questions the cost effectiveness of cheaper attritable drones and veers toward more stealthy, expensive models. As for the trash talking, it will be up to the Air Force to sort the haters and fakers from the companies able to manufacture CCAs capable of meeting its needs. And future fighter pilots won’t care what company’s name is on the drone, as long as it helps keep them alive.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/i-dont-see-it-before-their-cca-drones-even-take-to-the-air-anduril-and-general-atomics-trade-shots/	2024-09-26T10:07:25-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/240926_cca_anduril_ga_BDPHOTOS.png
New torpedoes for P-8s and Pillar II awards: AUKUS leaders in London	(Left to right) Australia Defense Minister Richard Marles, UK Secretary of State for Defence John Healey and US Defense Secretary Llyod Austin kickoff the third in-person AUKUS defense ministerial meeting at the Old Royal Naval College in London on Sept. 26. (Breaking Defense/ Ashley Roque) LONDON — The three defense leaders of the AUKUS nations today announced plans for a new bilateral security alliance between the United Kingdom and Australia, as well as the fact that UK-made torpedoes will arm the three AUKUS P-8 sub hunter fleets. But when it comes to one area of particular interest for the defense industry — a series of technology development efforts known as Pillar II that could, in time, include countries outside the US, UK and Australia — US officials are saying that patience may be a virtue. Today's meeting of US Defense Secretary Llyod Austin, UK Secretary of State for Defence John Healey and Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles came with three top-level announcements related to Pilar I, which involves the nuclear submarine fleets. First, UK-made Sting Ray torpedoes, produced by BAE Systems, will be approved for use on the combined fleets of P-8 sub hunting aircraft. All three AUKUS nations operate the Boeing-made maritime surveillance aircraft; the US operates 120, Australia 12, and the United Kingdom nine. Second, the UK has agreed to increase the number of Australians it will train on maintaining and regulating nuclear-powered submarines, a key issue as the Aussies seek to stand up their infrastructure for a capability they have never had before. And thirdly, the UK and Australia pledged to launch into a new 'bilateral treaty' to strengthen the bonds between the two nations militarily, even outside the AUKUS framework. But today's meetings and on the sidelines, Pillar II also got attention. 'I and our UK Government will work to maximize the benefits of AUKUS [for our three nations] advancing technology, developing new military capabilities, securing economic gains and growing good jobs,' Healey said during his opening remarks. 'We will work to maximize the potential for this ever-closer alliance to reinforce global security and stability.' The AUKUS nations announced that a first winners of a trilaterally sponsored innovation prize challenge, focused on electronic warfare. The New York-based Distributed Spectrum claimed $150,000 for a radio frequency sensing platform, while Advanced Design Technology, Inovor Technologies, and Penten from Australia were also awarded funds, along with the UK's Amiosec, University of Liverpool, RokeManor Research, and Autonomous Devices. 'Challenges are one way for the Department of Defense to easily work with our partners and allies to identify and potentially scale capabilities,' Doug Beck, the director of the Defense Innovation Unit, said in the announcement of the award. 'The EW Challenge is an exciting first step in deepening partnerships with some of our closest allies, creating networks across our commercial and tech sectors, and building resilience across our industrial bases and supply chains.' Based on the challenge's success, the trio of defense officials today endorsed plans for a two-year agenda that will increase collaboration between and among our innovation centers of excellence, according to a joint readout from the day's meetings. Two US officials briefed reporters stateside this week ahead of the trip, and emphasized that Pillar II is still very much a work in progress. For now, Pillar II work centers on six technology areas: undersea, quantum, artificial intelligence and autonomy, cyber, hypersonic work, and electronic warfare. And while — the first US defense official said there is an 'openness to looking at more' and potentially adding to that list, for now, the focus is on prioritizing the already-identified focus areas. EXCLUSIVE: Australian defense minister Richard Marles on AUKUS, China and industry concerns 'Every four months, the senior body gets together, and what it's doing is approving projects,' the second senior US defense official said. 'So, project proposals come in…they're vetted and then moved up for approval…. We started already.' That continuous process, the second US defense official added, is using something similar to DARPA's Heilmeier questions to lay out the case for a capability. Those include: 'That's actually laying out the case for why this project is AUKUS'ed,' the second senior US defense official said on Tuesday. 'What [will] the benefits be operationally? What [are] the measurements be in terms of performance and milestones? If we approve it to make it move ahead, how will it be funded?' That development and acquisition funding question for Pillar II, according to the first US defense official, will take time to work through and means industry may not see just what big-ticket AUKUS-related opportunities are available. '[We] probably would need some time to figure out what the timetable is because part of it requires three nations to commit funds, and so I wouldn't want to get ahead of anybody else's budget,' the first defense official added. Which doesn't mean there has been nothing to come out of Pillar II. Over the summer, Breaking Defense reported that a trilateral algorithm for information sharing among the P-8 fleets of the three nations would be operational before the end of the year. The countries have also demonstrated technologies to launch and recover undersea vehicles from torpedo tubes.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/new-torpedoes-for-p-8s-and-pillar-ii-awards-aukus-leaders-in-london/	2024-09-26T08:28:04-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/Aukus-photo-1-scaled-e1727354673948.jpg
After the failure of Oct. 7, with Hezbollah Israel gets the war it trained for	A cloud of smoke erupts during an Israeli air strike on a village outside Tyre in southern Lebanon on September 26, 2024. (Photo by KAWNAT HAJU / AFP) (Photo by KAWNAT HAJU/AFP via Getty Images) JERUSALEM — Israel has called up two reserve brigades to reinforce its forces in the north, amid indications the military could launch a significant ground operation targeting Hezbollah in Lebanon. 'We are not stopping,' Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, said Wednesday according to Israeli media. 'The Air Force is striking all day, and we are preparing for an operation.' The US and France are pushing for an immediate 21-day ceasefire, but today Israel denied reports it was on board. Any ground operation would follow now-days-long aerial bombardment of what the Israel Defense Forces said are targeting Hezbollah weapons caches hidden in southern Lebanon. That assault followed a series of strikes last week that the IDF said eliminated more than a dozen top Hezbollah commanders and an unprecedented purported Israeli intelligence operation to detonate hundreds of booby-trapped pagers and walkie-talkies carried by Hezbollah members. Taken together, Israel’s string of stunning successes in operations against Hezbollah in recent days, analysts said, is further evidence of a widely held belief that Jerusalem for years concentrated more on taking on the Lebanese Shi’a group than other threats like Hamas — thinking that help led to Israel’s failures ahead of Hamas’s surprise Oct. 7 attack. In a sense, the fight with Hezbollah is the fight for which Israel was actually prepared. 'Israel has shown amazing intelligence penetration of Hezbollah in comparison to Hamas,' Yaakov Katz, author of 'Israel vs. Iran: The Shadow War' and a fellow at The Jewish People Policy Institute, told Breaking Defense. 'It is the result of the focus that IDF put on the northern front over the last 18 years, ever since the Second Lebanon War, and focusing its intelligence collection on the north at the expense of other fronts like Gaza.' Carmit Valensi, a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) and the head of the Northern Arena Program, added that in years of preparation the IDF 'developed a range of operational plans designed to target [Hezbollah] from different angles. 'While much of our focus was on preparing for a confrontation with Hezbollah, we somewhat neglected the southern arena and the evolving situation with Hamas in Gaza,' she said. Short of its patron Iran, Hezbollah has long been seen by Israeli forces as the direst threat in the region. The group is believed to consist of tens of thousands of members and was estimated to have an arsenal of 150,000 to 200,000 rockets, making it capable of launching some 1,500 a day, according to a 2021 Israeli assessment. In recent years it has also with Iran’s purported help acquired precision guided munitions and one-way attack drones, munitions that can threaten Israeli cities if sent in large enough numbers to overwhelm or exhaust Israeli’s vaunted three-layer air defense system. Jonathan Lord, a former Pentagon analyst currently with the Center for New America Security, said that Israel sees Hezbollah as a 'strategic-level' threat. 'As damaging as Oct. 7 was, Hamas does not and did not present a strategic-level threat in the way Hezbollah does,' Lord told Breaking Defense. Still, he argued, it’s not as simple as a binary choice to explain where Israel was looking on Oct. 7. Rather, he said, that security failure was an outcome of the false assumption that Hamas had been successfully deterred from action. 'If that hadn’t been the accepted concept in the establishment, Israel’s posture in the south would be different, [the] intel focus would be different,' he said. 'It would have been inclusive of that as a threat.' In 2020 the IDF rolled out a new doctrine called Momentum, which envisioned using the IDF’s increasing shift to new technology and digitization to maximize its capabilities on the battlefield. Against enemies such as Hezbollah and Hamas, which use more traditional weapons such as improvised explosive devices, anti-tank missiles and rockets, the IDF’s high-tech army appeared to be well-placed to overcome the challenge. 'This includes the ability to not only defeat a terror army like Hezbollah but also to do it relatively quickly, at an acceptable cost to our forces and our home front, and in a way that is irrefutable,' the IDF noted at the time. In its urgent response to the Oct. 7 attack, Israel did deploy its high-tech weapons and platforms, including a reportedly a controversial AI system, but the long campaign — about to reach its first year — was characterized more by mass bombardment of Gaza, which has drawn stark international condemnation. But a fight in the north could be different, especially with Hezbollah very much on its back foot. 'The core strategy behind these preparations was to degrade Hezbollah’s capabilities in advance, improving our position before engaging in any extensive military operations or full-scale war,' Valensi said. 'The objective was to weaken Hezbollah’s strength and create a more favorable, manageable battlefield, making it easier to confront Hezbollah’s operatives when the time came for a larger confrontation.'

Space RCO taps 20 firms for software to control maneuvering sats	RCO Director Kelly Hammett speaks on a panel at AFA 2024 on Sept. 20, 2024. (Air &amp; Space Forces Association photo) WASHINGTON — The Space Rapid Capabilities Office (Space RCO) has announced the first $12 million in delivery orders to 20 small businesses for its Rapid Resilient Command and Control (R2C2) program, designed to develop software that will allow Space Force operators to manage hundreds of highly mobile satellites and spacecraft being envisioned for future dynamic space operations. 'R2C2, a combined program with Space Systems Command, is developing a cloud-based satellite operations infrastructure that gives military operators more flexibility to command and reposition satellites in response to threats,' the Space RCO press release explained on Wednesday. 'The program will deliver critical, tactical ground segment software to operate dynamic USSF satellites with protect-and-defend missions and to provide many tactical SatOps functions such as Rendezvous and Proximity Operations (RPO) planning, antenna brokering and telemetry, and tracking and command,' it added. Space RCO, headquartered at Kirtland AFB in New Mexico, is a semi-independent acquisition organization created by Congress in 2018 to take requirements directly from operators at US Space Command and find ways to quickly get capabilities, including cutting-edge commercial tech, into the field. Space Systems Command, headquartered in Los Angeles, is the Space Force’s major acquisition command. Space Force Rapid Capabilities Office emblem. (RCO image, launch image via DVIDS) Space RCO Director Kelley Hammett told Breaking Defense in a Sept. 17 interview that the office revamped its contracting approach this summer, deciding to award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contracts worth up to $1 billion total over five- to seven years to 20 small businesses. 'The approach was target people who actually know how to do software, versus large defense primes who say they can do software — but then you have OCX, you have ATLAS, you have all these examples of [Air Force space acquisition czar Frank] Calvelli's bottom [performing] programs that have not delivered,' he said. 'And so it's a little bit of an experiment, but I think it's a calculated experiment.' OCX, for Next Generation Operational Control System, is being developed by RTX and is designed to provide C2 for the latest model GPS satellites, as well as allow operators 'full control' of the jam-resistant, military-only GPS signal. It was originally planned to begin operations more than a decade ago. ATLAS, for Advanced Tracking and Launch Analysis System, is being designed by prime contractor L3Harris as the latest Pentagon effort to replace 1970s-era Space Defense Operations Center (SPADOC) computer system/software for managing data from the military’s network of radar and telescopes that detect and track objects on orbit to provide space domain awareness (SDA) to operators. It, too, has faced a series of delays. Both programs have been called out by Calvelli as acquisition 'albatrosses' weighing down key Space Force capabilities. The Space RCO press release explained that under the new task orders, each company would receive up to $600,000 'to help the awardees gain a baseline understanding of the current architecture, capabilities, and processes used within R2C2 and onboard essential personnel, while also providing the government team insight into the awardees’ classified processing capabilities and management processes.' The idea, the release added, is to acquire 'software systems in bite-sized pieces from companies with a broad mix of specialties, and Space RCO remains open to including more vendors.' The R2C2 program already has 'developed working software that is going to be flying satellites by the end of the month,' Hammett said. 'We're already sending &#8216;yes' commands to satellites, as of a week ago — what they call &#8216;no ops,' essentially, which is you're communicating with the satellite, but you're just telling it, don't change anything. It's just acknowledge, receive &#8230; establish a link.' While stressing that he is not criticizing progress being made, Hammett said that he is 'not going to wait' on ATLAS and related systems, including the Unified Data Library (UDL), to provide the necessary space domain awareness (SDA) data to R2C2 to ensure satellite safety — that is, to avoid on-orbit collisions or evade adversary threats. The UDL was initiated as a pilot program in 2018 to build a cloud-based repository for SDA data, provided by government and commercial systems at multiple classification levels. It is open not just to Space Force operators, but also commercial vendors, allies and academia. In June Calvelli announced that the UDL was transitioning to a program of record, with a focus on ensuring that it would be better integrated into operational systems. 'I'm not criticizing ATLAS, but on the record, if it doesn't get there on time, I'm gonna find an alternative, because that's why I exist,' Hammett said. 'I'm gonna go get access to commercial data with direct pipelines. If the UDL doesn't work right, I'm gonna go figure out how to feed the necessary SDA data into R2C2 to get the mission done.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/space-rco-taps-20-firms-for-software-to-control-maneuvering-sats/	2024-09-26T07:36:49-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/240926_kelly_hammett_rco_space_AFAMEDIA-e1727359927780.jpg
CCA: How industry views the Air Force’s plans for loyal drone wingmen [VIDEO]	WASHINGTON — The US Air Force views the Collaborative Combat Aircraft program as the potential future of air power. But as military leaders always love to point out, the service doesn't build its own weapons, industry does. For the CCA program, that means two competing designs, one from Anduril and one from General Atomics. In the above fireside chat, Breaking Defense Editor-in-Chief Aaron Mehta talks with David Alexander, president of General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, about the feedback he's gotten from USAF and recent comments made by Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall about how the systems might operate.

Norway’s Vard hosts senior officials, argues for Constellation-class designed by ‘our closest ally’	The Future USS Constellation (FFG 62), lead ship of the class, began construction by Fincantieri Marinette Marine in 2022 (Fincantieri) BELFAST — Norwegian shipbuilder Vard, a subsidiary of Italy’s Fincantieri, has stepped up efforts to offer a version of the US Navy Constellation-class design to Norway for the Nordic nation’s much-anticipated frigate acquisition, which is expected to cover a minimum of five new frigates to replace its aging Fridtjof Nansen-class fleet. On Monday, Bjørn Arild Gram, Norway’s minister of defense, and Trygve Slagsvold Vedum, the country’s finance minister, toured the Vard Langsten shipyard in Tomrefjord in western Norway where they and Vard officials discussed frigate procurement and 'long term' national defense plans, according to a Vard statement. 'Our sister company Fincantieri Marine Group (FMG) is currently building Constellation-class frigates for Norway's strongest and closest ally, the USA,' said Ronny O. Langset, yard director at Vard Langsten. 'This makes VARD the natural choice for any possible construction of frigates in Norway.' Gram spoke warmly of the local shipbuilder's pedigree and capabilities but stopped short of making any commitment regarding the frigate program. 'We are now embarking on a significant maritime initiative, and through its deliveries to the Norwegian Navy over several years, VARD has proven that they can deliver quality,' he is quoted as saying in the Vard release. 'They are now positioning themselves well to continue doing so in the future.' Norway is also part of well-established US naval based programs, through investment in Lockheed Martin’s Aegis Integrated Weapon Systems and MH-60R Seahawk helicopters. 'The operational advantages are many for both the USA and Norway,' added Vard, on the potential of a Norwegian Constellation-class purchase. 'Building the frigates and the standard fleet in Norway will provide short lead times and ripple effects to several local communities, subcontractors, and suppliers — and Norway's economy,' it added. Such a position sits somewhat uncomfortably with the reality of the US Navy's Constellation-class program, with Fincantieri as much as 36 months behind schedule, against original construction estimates. Intended to replace the Navy's Littoral Combat Ships, Washington has so far approved procurement of six Constellation-class vessels, evolved from the Italian FREMM design, through fiscal 2024, according to the Congressional Research Service [PDF]. The program is currently under heavy scrutiny by Congress and outside observers like the Government Accountability Office (GAO) because the Navy opted to make a significant number of changes in the design from the original FREMM vessel. It also appeared any Norwegian firm would face an uphill battle to win the competition in Oslo after Norway's chief of defense, Eirik Kristoffersen, said publicly in April that he does not want new frigates to be based on a 'Norwegian solution,' as allied interoperability was key. But in addition to Vard's statement emphasizing its sister company's ongoing work with the US Navy, in a statement to Breaking Defense a spokesperson said Kristoffersen's comments were 'not a concern,' because 'Vard and Fincantieri are not presenting a ‘Norwegian solution'.' Oslo is expected to make a downselect decision, 'to a handful' of competitors, 'very soon,' added the spokesperson. 'After this the process will continue towards a final selection. It is indicated that Norway wants a fast decision,' the spokesperson said, adding that a production contract award could be made in 'late 2025 or early 2026.' The Norwegian Ministry of Defence did not respond to a request for comment. Vard faces competition from other internationally renowned shipbuilders. The UK's BAE Systems is offering the Type 26 antisubmarine warfare frigate, while France's Naval Group has pitched a FDI design, and Damen Group from the Netherlands leans on its ASWF type. Oslo signaled in April that, 'in terms of money, the strengthening of the Navy is the largest investment' from a new long-term defense plans, which together with the frigate acquisition also includes a plan to procure five submarines.

US grants $920M loan to Romania to buy US-made weapons	U.S. Army Soldiers of 1st Battalion, 66th Armored Regiment, 3rd Armored Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division, setup their M1 Abram Tanks in Romania in a 2017 file photo. (DVIDS) WASHINGTON — The US State Department has announced a new $920 million Foreign Military Financing (FMF) loan to Romania, in order to help the NATO ally procure US-made Abrams tanks and ammunition. With Wednesday's announcement, Romania becomes the second nation to receive such a specialized loan version of FMF, which is a new tool the State Department first rolled out in September 2023, when Poland received a $2 billion loan. In July of this year, Poland received a second $2 billion loan under the program. FMF dollars have to be spent on US-made weapons. But unlike traditional FMF dollars, which are appropriated by Congress and work as grants handed to nations to fund the purchases, these State-authorized loans come with interest that will have to be paid back to the US government. For the Romanian deal, Washington put up $60 million to cover fees and guarantee the loan. 'Romania is undertaking a major military modernization program, including purchases of U.S. defense equipment such as Abrams main battle tanks and coproduction of ammunition,' a statement from the State Department reads. 'Romania is a leader in NATO, working closely with Allies to advance Black Sea security and providing critical assistance to Ukraine, including the transfer of a Patriot strategic air defense system and training Ukrainian F-16 pilots.' Last November, Romania announced plans to purchase up to 54 M1A2 SEPv3 Abrams Main Battle Tanks, with an estimated price tag at the time of $2.5 billion, which is the purchase this FMF money will go towards. But that’s just one of the modernization efforts the European nation has been pushing for. Since the start of 2023, the State Department cleared seven Foreign Military Sales (FMS) requests for Bucharest. Aside from the tanks, 2023 saw requests cleared for $104 million for 95 Heavy Gun Carriers Joint Light Tactical Vehicles; an F-16 modernization effort with a $105 million estimated price tag; and 16 Assault Amphibious Vehicles at an estimated cost of $120.5 million. In 2024, Romania was cleared to buy $592 million in AIM-120 missiles, $80 million in Javelins — plus the crown jewel, $7.2 billion in 32 F-35A Joint Strike Fighters.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/us-grants-920m-loan-to-romania-to-buy-us-made-weapons/	2024-09-25T13:55:38-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/romania-tank-scaled-e1727296720378.jpg
House approves three-month continuing resolution as Senate looks to vote by end of day	The US Capitol. (Photo by Anna Rose Layden/Getty Images) WASHINGTON — The House today pushed forward a stopgap funding bill that will keep the US government operating through December, passing the bill in a 341-82 vote. The bill now moves to the Senate, where it is expected to sail through in a vote later today. Government funding expires at the end of Sept. 30, when fiscal 2025 starts. The continuing resolution adopted by the House extends federal funding through Dec. 20, but pared down most 'anomalies' that would have pledged additional dollars to tackle specific challenges at the Defense Department or other agencies. For instance, the bill does not include an additional $2 billion sought by the White House for Virginia-class submarine construction or the extension or Presidential Drawdown Authority to provide military aid to Ukraine. 'Like most, my preference would be to pass full-year appropriations bills through regular order, but we are out of time,' House Appropriations Committee Chairman Rep. Tom Cole said in a speech on the floor ahead of the vote. We cannot afford a shutdown, which would be greatly damaging to our national security, to critical government programs, and to the American people.' Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the committee's top Democrat, said that while funding the government through a CR was not an ideal solution, the bare-bones CR is a 'responsible and sober measure' that avoids the problems that would have been prompted by a longer, six-month bill. House Speaker Mike Johnson originally sought to push through a six-month version of the CR, which included additional money for submarines — as well as the SAVE Act, a conservative voter ID bill that Democrats said was a nonstarter. The move was criticized by defense hawks who contended that the CR should be kept to calendar year 2025 to minimize impact on national security priorities, with House Armed Services Committee chairman Mike Rogers, R-Ala., joining roughly a dozen other Republicans to defeat the bill in the House last week. On Sunday, Johnson put forward a much more minimalist, three-month CR without the SAVE Act attached, garnering praise from House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who signaled that Democrats would approve the bill. Ultimately, Republicans made up the 82 votes against the measure. On Monday, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise said that the CR would bypass the House Rules Committee and go directly to the floor under a 'suspension of the rules' that mandates a two-thirds majority for passage. A day later, Schumer said the Senate would bring the bill to the floor without amendments for a vote directly after House approval on Wednesday. Defense Department and military leaders have warned that a long term continuing resolution — particularly a six-month bill — could delay key modernization efforts, including planned increases to munitions production, the B-21 bomber program and the Columbia-class submarine.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/house-approves-three-month-continuing-resolution-as-senate-looks-to-vote-by-end-of-day/	2024-09-25T13:42:13-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/congress_building-scaled-e1711030694393.jpg
In first, Hezbollah launches Qadr 1 ballistic missile towards Tel Aviv	HAIFA, ISRAEL &#8211; SEPTEMBER 23: Israel's aerial defense system Iron Dome destroys rockets fired from Southern Lebanon in Haifa, Israel on September 23, 2024. (Photo by Saeed Qaq/Anadolu via Getty Images) BEIRUT — After 11 months of clashes between Hezbollah and Israel, the Lebanese armed group fired for the first time today a ballistic missile dubbed Qadr 1 towards Tel Aviv, according to a statement by the group earlier. The strike comes after an intense week of severe Israeli air raids and attacks. The ballistic missile was 'targeting the Mossad headquarters in the suburbs of Tel Aviv, which is the headquarters responsible for assassinating [Hezbollah] leaders and bombing pagers and radios,' the statement said. Israel reported it intercepted a missile from Lebanon today headed toward Tel Aviv, and that no damage was done. Experts told Breaking Defense that the firing of the ballistic missile shows an expansion to the range of targets Hezbollah can attack. It’s a first for Hezbollah to strike 'this deep into Israel and do so using a guided system. This is a new level of escalation by Hezbollah we haven't seen before,' Fabian Hinz, a research fellow for Defence and Military Analysis at the International Institute for Strategic Studies told Breaking Defense. 'It is the first time Hezbollah has ever claimed to have used ballistic missile [and they] are guided,' Hinz noted. 'We've seen Hezbollah use shorter range rockets before, [and] we've seen them use some of the slightly longer range rockets that they also used in 2006.' Jean Loup Samaan, a senior research fellow at the Middle East Institute said that it’s a way for Hezbollah to intensify its strikes. 'We are no longer talking about short range rockets on the north in unpopulated areas but ballistic missiles deep into Israel,' Samaan told Breaking Defense. 'The Qadr-1 is a lot more powerful than the small rockets that Hezbollah has fired frequently against Israel,' said Shaan Shaikh, deputy director and fellow of the missile defense project at CSIS. 'But Hezbollah’s use of only one ballistic missile instead of a salvo launch or combined use with drones was militarily ineffective.' He pointed that this strike 'suggests it was done for signaling purposes — to remind Israel of the full range of Hezbollah’s retaliatory capabilities, and affirm their willingness to use them.' Iran reportedly revealed a Qadr ballistic missile, which is an upgraded version of the Shahab-3 ballistic missile, in 2007. The Iranian Qadr missiles have three versions with different ranges from 1300 km to 2000 km, and are powered by liquid and solid fuel. However, Hinz doubts that the Qadr missile used today is the same as Iran’s Qadr missile. 'This missile almost is certainly, 99.9 percent not identical with the Iranian one that is called so. The Iranian one is basically one of Iran's long-range missiles that has been developed to strike Israel. That's not the missile Hezbollah used to strike Central Israel,' he told Breaking Defense. He gave two possibilities: either the naming conventions of Hezbollah are just completely different to the Houthis or that 'there are more uranium missiles called Qadr that we don't know [of].'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/in-first-hezbollah-launches-qadr-1-ballistic-missile-towards-tel-aviv/	2024-09-25T12:50:53-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/iron-dome-intercept-scaled-e1727286748664.jpg
Northrop selected to develop anti-hypersonic Glide Phase Interceptor	WASHINGTON — Northrop Grumman has been selected to continue development on the Glide Phase Interceptor, a new missile defense asset designed to take down hypersonic weapons during the glide phase of the flight. The program, a coproduction initiative between the US and Japan, is led by the US Missile Defense Agency. The work will continue under an existing Other Transaction Agreement (OTA), according to an MDA statement. 'Today's decision represents a turning point for hypersonic glide phase defense,' Lt. Gen. Heath Collins, MDA director, said in the announcement. 'I'm very proud of the entire team including our industry partners, for all the hard work to get to this point. It is also an honor to have Japan as our partner as we move forward on this critical counter-hypersonic capability.' Northrop’s win comes over competitor RTX. Both firms were on contract to develop GPI in June 2022 after the elimination of another competitor, Lockheed Martin. The weapon, which began its 'technology development' phase in April 2023, is designed to launch from US Navy Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense destroyers as well as the Aegis Ashore system. In a statement, Northrop said that the next phase of development on the program will consist of four key benchmarks: refining the preliminary design of GPI, demonstrating system performance ahead of a Preliminary Design Review, running flight experiments and use digital engineering to 'connect the entire GPI program to accelerate design processes and develop interceptor capabilities faster and more efficiently.' A spokesperson for RTX said the company 'remains committed to supporting the U.S. Missile Defense Agency.' The fiscal 2024 National Defense Authorization Act pushed MDA to ensure initial operational capability for GPI by the end of 2029 and full operational capability by 2032, as well as to deliver at least 24 GPIs by 2040. But MDA has consistently said GPI is aimed at countering threats beyond 2035, and Collins told the Senate Armed Services strategic forces subcommittee on May 8 that achieving the 2029 goal would be 'very hard' and entail serious risks. Exactly how the workshare with Japan will break down is still a point of negotiation, officials in Tokyo told Breaking Defense earlier this year. There, the defense ministry plans to spend 75.7 billion yen, or $480 million, for the GPI program this fiscal year. Northrop previously said that if it won the competition, it would split work with Japan on a 50-50 basis. Writing on social media platform X, Tom Karako, a missile defense expert with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, called the award a 'big day.' But, he cautioned, 'this is just the beginning. The United States does not need *a* means to contend with the spectrum of high-speed maneuvering missile threats. The US does not needs *a* hypersonic defense interceptor. It needs more than one.'

For Lebanon, a war in all but name has finally arrived: Experts	Smoke billows at the site of an Israeli airstrike on the outskirts of the southern Lebanese village of Zawtar on September 21, 2024. Israel's military said it was striking more Hezbollah targets in Lebanon on September 21 evening, after announcing it had hit thousands of rocket launchers and other targets earlier in the day. (Photo by Rabih DAHER / AFP) (Photo by RABIH DAHER/AFP via Getty Images) BEIRUT — With Israel following up its targeted attacks on Hezbollah members by unleashing unprecedented air strikes over the last 48 hours, the situation in Lebanon has reached the point where it is a war in all but name, experts tell Breaking Defense — and there are signs a ground incursion may be coming soon. Southern Lebanese villages and towns are witnessing heavy bombardment, with hundreds of strikes daily on what Israel says are Hezbollah targets, resulting in the effective dismembering of South and Eastern Beqaa from the rest of Lebanon thanks to the destruction and blockage of most roads. Thousands have been forced to flee north, away from the territories controlled by Hezbollah. In national security circles, there has been some debate about whether to call the situation as 'war' or not. But there seems to be little debate inside Lebanon on that distinction, according to Wehbe Katicha, a retired Lebanese general officer who flatly told Breaking Defense, 'This is a full-scale war.' Katicha said he views the conflict as having had three phases since Hamas launched its Oct. 7 attack on Israel. The first phase consisted of Israel and Hezbollah lobbing rockets and missiles back and forth in the border area, which were relatively small-scale but occasionally deadly, leading to Israeli and Lebanese civilians alike abandoning their homes for safer areas. The second phase was a series of targeted attacks on Hezbollah members and leadership, culminating with last week's shocking attack via booby-trapped pagers and walkie-talkies that left several dead and thousands injured. This phase also includes a strike in the southern suburb of Beirut that killed top commanders of the Radwan Force, as well as Ibrahim Aqil, who was nominated to be the successor of Fuad Shukr, the Hezbollah military head who was killed by Israel in late July. And now, Katicha said, 'We have entered a new phase of the war, the third phase, which is a full-scale war with the largest number of above 500 casualties in Israeli air strikes in one day.' He said the air raids are now no longer constrained to just the south but throughout the country. The question of whether to call Israel's actions in recent days a 'war' is something where 'frankly, I don’t see the value of this debate,' said Mara Karlin, a longtime regional expert who has served a number of roles in the Pentagon. 'Israel and Hezbollah have been trading potshots for nearly a year and it has now escalated substantially.' 'I suppose there’s a case to be made that neither Israel nor Hezbollah wants this to be called a &#8216;war,'' Karlin noted. 'After 2006, Hezbollah could find itself in a terrible position domestically in Lebanon if there’s another war. And Israel has a lot else going on in Gaza, of course.' For the US, defining a 'war' is a tricky thing, said Mark Cancian, a retired Marine Corps officer now with the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank. The US has largely avoided using the term 'war' when talking about limited air strikes, he noted. But, 'we call what happened in Kosovo in 1999 a war. It looks a lot like what is happening in southern Lebanon in that there is a massive use of air and deployment of ground forces but no ground incursion.' Overall, 'I think it is fair to call this a war, and the longer it goes, the more fitting the term,' Cancian said. Khalil Helou, another retired Lebanese general, concurred, describing the ongoing conflict as a 'full-scale attrition war' and questioned how long Hezbollah can keep the conflict going now that Israel has moved from targeted strikes to wholescale bombardment of the group's territory. Hezbollah is 'not in a position where they can win, or if they can sustain a war of attrition with Israel, because Israel has proven during the past year that it can sustain a long attrition war on several fronts,' Helou said. Daniel Byman, a senior fellow for warfare, irregular threats, and terrorism at the IISS think tank, agreed the group is on its back foot. 'Hezbollah certainly can strike Israel with various missiles, but the group may be weak and off balance due to the Israeli strikes on its leaders, personnel, and systems. In addition, it may have difficulty communicating due to fears of Israeli penetration,' he said. 'However, there is a lot we do not know.' Perhaps the biggest unknown is what happens if Israel decides a ground invasion is needed to secure the border enough to allow Israeli villagers to return to their homes. There are indications that is at least on the table: Today, the Israeli Northern Command chief announced the army needs to be 'strongly prepared' for a ground offensive in Lebanon, and announced two reserve battalions would be recruited to help in the north. Rescuers sift through the rubble at the scene of an Israeli strike that targeted Beirut's southern suburbs a day earlier, as search and rescue operations continue on September 21, 2024. (Photo by -/AFP via Getty Images) 'We have entered another phase of the campaign. &#8230; The operation began with a very significant blow to Hezbollah’s capabilities, with an emphasis on [rocket] capabilities, and a very significant blow to the commanders and members of the organization,' Israeli media quoted IDF Northern Command, Maj. Gen. Ori Gordin as saying. Katicha hopes that a ground invasion may not be necessary since Israel 'doesn’t want to annex parts of South Lebanon.' But, he said, it's all going to be about if Jerusalem feels it has achieved its goals or not. 'It [aims] to bring back its citizens in the North, and whether a ground incursion is a need in this endeavor or not, accordingly it will resort to ground operation or not,' he told Breaking Defense. Defining a 'war' in the 21st century is a difficult proposition, but for Lebanese on the ground, it's a distinction without a difference. All many are focused on is instability and fear. On Monday, there was a large migration wave from South Lebanon, after Israel threatened to attack houses that hide Hezbollah's arsenal — many of which, Israel says, are among civilians. The Sidon Beirut highway was virtually blocked, according to witnesses and posts online, with drivers stuck for more than six hours while the security forces diverted all the lanes to in one direction towards Beirut to ease the traffic jam. Today, that road is physically blocked at more than one point with rubble from buildings following Israeli air strikes. As of publication, there is only one available path for southerners to flee: through the Beqaa Valley, a journey which is much longer and hardly safe, as rockets and bombs are seen along the path. After warning civilians to flee, Israel struck a large number of houses and sites in the south — at least some of which do, in fact, appear to have contained Hezbollah munitions. Open source videos show secondary explosions after air strikes as hidden ordnance flew off in different directions, providing yet another threat to civilians in the area. Eyewitnesses in the south told Breaking Defense that the missiles flying in all directions seemed like fireworks that have lost their path. One eyewitness said that explosions were intense and were seen very clearly by naked eye. On top of the strikes themselves, Lebanese civilians describe shock at Israel's ability to obstruct and overtake radio frequencies in Lebanon in order to broadcast an announcement warning people to stay away from Hezbollah sites and forecasting the air strikes to come. Flyers were also dropped on the Beqaa valley on Monday, giving the civilians two hours to evacuate to more than 1,000 meters away from Hezbollah-owned houses. Hezbollah would later say these flyers had a code that, if scanned, allowed Israeli forces to hack into phones, a claim that's so far unverified.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/for-lebanon-a-war-in-all-but-name-has-finally-arrived-experts/	2024-09-25T10:52:19-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/lebanon-israel-1-scaled-e1727279410678.jpg
Bipartisan duo of lawmakers to introduce ‘Ships for America Act’ following election	Ships assigned to the George Washington Carrier Strike group sail in formation during a strike group photo exercise. (U.S. Navy photo by Photographer's Mate 3rd Class Christopher Stephens) WASHINGTON — A bipartisan and bicameral duo of lawmakers say they plan to introduce legislation aimed at boosting the United States’ civilian and defense maritime industries following the upcoming election. Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz. and Rep. Mike Waltz, R-Fla. plan to introduce their 'Ships For America Act' following the November election, which they said today at an event hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies has garnered support among shipbuilding executives. 'We need to make it more cost effective to operate US-flagged vessels with some cargo preference,' said Kelly. 'We need regulatory reform and some financial support to the industry, like tax credits, and then building up our shipbuilding capacity to make sure that we’re going to be able to have more US-flagged ships here at home, and then the workforce [shortage] issue. 'This legislation addresses all [of] those areas extensively,' he continued. Kelly and Waltz have spent the past year publicly floating a handful of ideas that, in their view, would bolster the country’s maritime industrial base, both the commercial shipping side as well as military shipbuilding. During the event at CSIS, the duo said they supported a maritime czar of sorts — a single individual inside the executive branch whose authorities span across maritime issues related to both the Defense and Transportation Departments. Waltz’s Florida district encompasses the city of Jacksonville, also home to a Naval Air Station Jacksonville. While Kelly’s state of Arizona is less invested in shipbuilding directly, the senator is a graduate of the Merchant Marine Academy and has been vocal about urging lawmakers to take action to address a national shortage in merchant mariners. Earlier this year, Waltz and Kelly, along with signatures from more than a dozen other lawmakers, sent a letter to the White House calling on the administration to 'prioritize U.S. maritime defense.' 'The group [of lawmakers] called on the president to establish an interagency maritime policy director, designate maritime infrastructure as ‘critical infrastructure,’ invoke the Defense Production Act (DPA) for shipbuilding, and develop a whole-of-government maritime ‘de-risking’ strategy to reduce dependency on Chinese maritime infrastructure and industry,' according to a statement from the lawmakers’ offices released alongside the letter.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/bipartisan-duo-of-lawmakers-to-introduce-ships-for-america-act-following-election/	2024-09-25T08:55:07-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2012/05/csg-home-page-photo-2-low-res.jpg
Pentagon mum following FBI search of government cyber, IT distributor Carahsoft	U.S. Air Force Airman 1st Class Leann Munoz, 18th Force Support Squadron customer service technician, types on a computer Mar. 29, 2018, at Kadena Air Base, Japan. (U.S. Air Force photo by Staff Sgt. Micaiah Anthony) Tuesday afternoon the FBI said it conducted a 'court-authorized law enforcement activity' on the same street as Carahsoft's headquarters, but declined to provide further details. The same day Mary Lange, Carahsoft's vice president of digital media and public relations, told Breaking Defense in an emailed statement that 'representatives from the Department of Justice came to the Carahsoft office today as they are conducting an investigation into a company with which Carahsoft has done business in the past.' At the time she added that the company is 'fully cooperating' and is 'operating business as usual.' Nextgov first reported the federal action. When asked today about the development and whether the Pentagon had any concerns, DoD spokesperson Jeff Jurgensen told Breaking Defense the department 'has no statement or information to provide regarding this matter.' Carahsoft has won contracts with the Navy, Air Force, Army and the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency over the past few months. It also is a current vendor for GigEagle — a joint initiative between the Air Force Research Lab and Defense Innovation Unit to quickly find talent across the entirety of the DoD for short-term Pentagon projects, Breaking Defense previously reported. In court documents, the Department of Justice said Carahsoft 'has sold technology solutions that are manufactured or owned by [redacted] and [redacted] affiliates to the federal government, including the DoD' — some $2 billion worth of business overall over the past 10 years.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/pentagon-mum-following-fbi-search-of-government-cyber-it-distributor-carahsoft/	2024-09-25T08:19:27-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/240925_DVIDS_soldier_hands_keyboard_4299583-scaled-e1727275120995.jpg
Hanwha drops Austal takeover bid	USS Pierre (LCS-38) at Austal USA's shipyard in Mobile, Ala., as it prepares for launching into the water. (Photo courtesy of Austal USA) SYDNEY — South Korean defense giant Hanwha has dropped its bid to buy Australian shipbuilder Austal, a merger that would have had major implications for global military shipbuilding. The proposal, announced by both companies in dueling press releases in September last year, would have seen the world’s 19th largest defense contractor add the 80th largest defense contractor to its portfolio. It would also have bolstered the increasingly close defense and national security ties between Seoul and Canberra. following Australia’s potentially $7 billion deal to buy Hanwha’s Redback land vehicle, and represent yet another wave of growth for South Korea’s defense industry. And yet, there have been signs throughout the year that Austal was less-than-enthused about the unsolicited bid, leading to a sometimes public back and forth between the companies about regulatory concerns. Hanwha informed Austal CEO Richard Spencer of the decision in a Sept 25 letter, obtained by Breaking Defense, headlined simply 'Termination of discussions with Austal.' News of the dropped bid was first reported by the Australian Financial Review 'Since submitting its first NBIO on 15 September 2023, Hanwha has sought to constructively engage with the Austal Board. We have submitted three revised NBIOs, agreed to a 12-month standstill, and conducted preliminary US and Australian regulatory approval reviews, which we have clearly conveyed to you has only increased our confidence,' the letter from Hanwha Ocean CEO Hyek Woong Kwon said RELATED: How SECNAV’s claims about S. Korean, Japanese shipbuilders do and do not line up In the letter, Kwon specifically called out Austal's 'insistence' that Hanwha 'pay a US $5 million fee at any time in the transaction process if Austal forms the opinion that regulatory approval will not be obtained. This is unprecedented in the context of a public markets transaction, and is a wholly unreasonable condition on due diligence access.' Hanwha made three separate bids and was met with Austal's demand that Hanwha pay the $5 million fee should it appear Australian or American regulatory approval was at risk. In addition, Kwon stated that 'Austal, after first agreeing to provide site visit access, subsequently cancelled without prior notice or explanation two days before the visits were scheduled.' Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles said in early May the government had no problems with the bid but knew that security guarantees would have to be put in place to protect sensitive technology should the deal go ahead. A spokesperson for Austal did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Breaking Defense. However, in a comment to the Australian Financial Review, a spokesperson said, 'When Austal informed it shareholders in April that it had received an indicative, conditional, non-binding offer from Hanwha, the company was very clear that the Austal board and advisers were not satisfied that mandatory approvals for the transaction to proceed could be secured by Hanwha.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/hanwha-drops-austal-takeover-bid/	2024-09-25T07:35:41-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/53904232009_ded94874a5_k-e1722961913248.jpg
AUKUS defense chiefs to descend on London to discuss Pillar I and II roadmap	Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin answers questions during a press conference at the conclusion of the NATO Defense Ministerial meetings at NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, Oct. 12, 2023. (DoD/Chad J. McNeeley) 'This meeting, the third of its kind, reinforces our commitment on the third anniversary,' Pentagon spokesman Army Maj. Pete Nguyen told reporters ahead of the trip. 'With changing governments, it provides an opportunity to review progress and sets a path for continued work.' Nguyen was likely referring to the UK's change in government recently, which put John Healey newly into the shoes of defense minister. But the meeting is also likely to be the last in-person ministerial for US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin as President Joe Biden prepares to hand over the executive branch to either Vice President Kamala Harris or Donald Trump in January, both of whom are likely to shake up their cabinet. (The Australian government has expressed confidence AUKUS will continue whoever wins.) The White House changeover could have second- and third-order effects on Washington’s partnership with London and Canberra, but for now the trio of defense ministers is expected to dive into assessing and defining plans for both AUKUS Pillar I and II. Pillar I centers on Australia’s purchase of at least three Virginia-class, conventionally armed, nuclear-powered submarines to be followed by the joint development of a new boat, dubbed SSN AUKUS. Nguyen said this week’s meeting will touch on the progress implementing the 'Optimal Pathway,' or the conditions-based approach to support Australia’s acquisition. The approach includes Royal Australian Navy personnel in various stages of the US nuclear submarine training pipeline. In July the first cohort of Australian Submarine Corporation personnel began training at the Pearl Harbor Navy Shipyard. 'These efforts are all critically important steps in building Australia’s capacity to support a rotational presence of UK and US SSNs at SRF-West [Submarine Rotational Force-West] beginning as early as 2027, as well as Australia’s future sovereign SSN capability,' Nguyen added. And in mid-August, the three defense ministers announced a series of defense export changes aimed at making it easier to transfer technology and sell weapons amongst each other. Sweeping US reforms went into effect Sept. 1 and are designed, in part, to help Australia buy and build nuclear attack submarines as part of the AUKUS agreement. Although International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) do not cover nuclear technology, it did apply to a variety of components and systems abroad the Virginia-class subs Australia is expected to buy. Those US reform changes are also expected to speed up future exports for the non-submarine, tech-focused AUKUS Pillar II initiative. That part of AUKUS revolves around jointly developing and employing advanced technologies such AI, autonomy, hypersonic weapons, advanced cyber operations and electronic warfare. The trio is also billing this an avenue to collaborate with other countries including Japan on maritime autonomy work, as well as Canada, New Zealand and South Korea. At this week’s meeting in London, Nguyen said the defense ministers are expected to discuss ways to further 'integrate' tech innovations over the coming two years, as well as 'harmonize acquisition processes and [reduce] barriers to facilitate the accelerated delivery of Pillar II advanced capabilities.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/aukus-defense-chiefs-to-descend-on-london-to-discuss-pillar-i-and-ii-roadmap/	2024-09-25T01:04:10-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/04/240416_austin_nato_flags_8069533-scaled-e1713254552575.jpg
Navy inks long awaited $9.4B deal with HII for 4 amphibious warships	The amphibious ship Bougainville (LHA-8) under construction at Ingalls Shipbuilding. (Photo courtesy of HII.) WASHINGTON — The Navy today announced it has awarded contracts to HII for construction of four amphibious warships, executing a block buy deal years in the making which is expected to save the service up to $1 billion compared to buying the ships one-by-one. The ships being purchased under the $9.4 billion-worth of contracts are three San Antonio-class amphibious transport docks (LPD-33 in fiscal 2025, LPD-34 in FY27, and LPD-35 in FY29) and one amphibious assault ship, (LHA-10 in FY27), also referred to as a 'large-deck amphib.' The San Antonio-class ships were included in a multi-ship procurement contract, while the America-class amphibious assault ship is part of a contract modification. Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro in August sent lawmakers a letter, first reported by POLITICO, notifying them that the service and HII, which builds the amphibious ships at Ingalls Shipbuilding in Mississippi, had reached a deal. RELATED: Navy Secures Multi-Ship Amphib Buy, Saving Estimated $1B: Lawmaker Under a multi-ship buy, also called a 'block buy,' the Navy and industry agree on the prices of multiple ships years in advance and within the same contractual agreement. For the Navy, this results in price savings by purchasing material orders in bulk. For industry, these deals provide the scheduling stability shipbuilder executives frequently and publicly ask lawmakers and the Defense Department to provide. This deal in particular has been years in the making. Lawmakers have repeatedly urged the Navy to secure a block buy for amphibious ships given the Marine Corps' urgent need for more of those vessels as well as the service's success in carrying out a similar acquisition in 2019 for two aircraft carriers. 'We greatly appreciate the stability that this award provides to all Ingalls shipbuilders and our surrounding communities. It is an honor to continue our support of the joint Navy and Marine Corps mission to meet the minimum 31 amphibious ship requirement,' said Kari Wilkinson, president of Ingalls Shipbuilding, in a statement released following the Navy's announcement. 'We stand ready to reinforce an already strong team of capable shipbuilders with the ideas and skills of new shipbuilders that want to make a difference in the world. There is no greater sense of accomplishment than doing something difficult in support of our nation’s military,' she continued. The four ships 'will support amphibious assault, special operations, and expeditionary warfare of US Marines, moving Marines into theater and supporting humanitarian and contingency missions on short notice,' according to a description included in Del Toro's letter to lawmakers. To date, Ingalls has delivered 13 San Antonio-class ships and 15 large-deck amphibious ships.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/navy-inks-long-awaited-9-6b-deal-with-hii-for-4-amphibious-warships/	2024-09-24T14:05:01-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/LHA-8-underconstruction-at-Ingalls-e1724335565226.jpg
Rheinmetall, HDT win Army S-MET Increment II downselect	US Army soldiers with the 101st Airborne Division used S-MET Inc I's during a recent training exercise. The Army is moving forward with S-MET Inc II, which is now in the design phase. (Ashely Roque/Breaking Defense) WASHINGTON — The US Army today selected two companies — HDT Expeditionary Systems and Rheinmetall — to produce robotic mule prototypes for it to test out before crowning an ultimate victor. The Army awarded a total of $22 million, divided between the two teams, each of which must eight prototypes of their offerings for the Small Multipurpose Equipment Transport (S-MET) Increment II program, one of the Army's top robotic vehicle efforts. After it evaluates those robots, the service plans to ink a production contract with one vendor in late fiscal 2027 and buy up to 2,195 ground vehicles. 'S-MET supports the Army’s mission to implement robotic and autonomous system capabilities with urgency to lessen risk to soldiers in multi-domain operations,' said Kyle Bruner, the service’s project manager for Force Projection within the Program Executive Office Combat Support &amp; Combat Service Support. Several years ago, the service picked General Dynamics Land Systems (GDLS) to produce the initial S–MET — a single radio-controlled, eight-wheeled platform designed to ferry up to 1,000 pounds of troop equipment around the battlefield. It later kickstarted the Inc II competition for a new robot that can carry twice the weight — 2,000 pounds — while also producing more exportable power to power drones, increased reliability on the battlefield and a reduced audio signature. 'S-MET Increment II addresses capability gaps associated with excessive physical burdens, recharging batteries during continuous operations, and reducing sustainment burden for semi-independent operations,' Bruner added. In addition to Rheinmetall and HDT Expeditionary Systems vying for the deal, US-based tech firm Anduril teamed up with South Korean defense giant Hanwha for the competition, while incumbent GDLS also threw their hat in the ring. In a brief statement to Breaking Defense, Matthew Warnick, American Rheinmetall Vehicles managing director, praised today’s decision to move the program forward. 'The S-MET Inc II program will enhance our soldiers’ operational capabilities with advanced technologies needed now in support of their mission,' Warnick added. 'I'm incredibly proud of our entire organization for their hard work and dedication to achieve this success.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/rheinmetall-hdt-win-army-s-met-increment-ii-downselect/	2024-09-24T13:37:51-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/IMG_6862-scaled-e1725888049132.jpg
Space Force taps 4 firms for first phase of ‘Resilient GPS’ program	The GPS constellation that provides positioning, navigation and timing signals to the US military and civilians around the world, is made up of 31 active satellites. (BlackJack3D/Getty Images) WASHINGTON — The Space Force has chosen four companies to kick off its Resilient Global Positioning System (R-GPS) to back up GPS satellite signals, most of which are easily jammed, during times of crisis and conflict, Space Systems Command (SSC) announced today. The four companies are Astranis, Axient, L3 Harris, and Sierra Space, which each were awarded a contract 'to produce design concepts' for the first of three planned Lite Evolving Augmented Proliferation (LEAP) efforts that will make up the R-GPS program. 'R-GPS provides resilience to military and civil GPS user communities by augmenting the GPS constellation with proliferated small satellites transmitting a core set of widely-utilized GPS signals,' the SSC release said. Each LEAP segment will include eight small, low-cost satellites with incrementally improved capabilities, and the first LEAP satellite set is expected to begin launching in 2028, SSC explained. The Other Transaction Authority awards were made via the Space Enterprise Consortium (SpEC), though the press release provided no value for them. Nor did it provide any specifics about what exact signals they would be broadcasting. The 31 GPS satellites broadcast a variety of signals in the L1 frequency band (1575.42 MHz) and the L2 band (1227.60 MHz), including the encrypted, jam-resistant M-Code restricted to military users. Newer versions also broadcast in the L5 band (1176.45 MHz) primarily for aviation safety purposes. 'Following this initial phase, a subset of the awardees will continue to a Final Design Review and build payload prototypes. One or more vendors will then be selected to build the first satellite vehicles,' the SSC release said. The R-GPS program is part of Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall's 'quick start' initiative push to speed up acquisitions by getting around constraints of the cumbersome budget process. Congress provided $100 million (versus Kendall's initial proposal of $300 million) for the quick start effort in the 2024 National Defense Authorization Act. 'Thanks to the Quick-Start authority that was approved by Congress, we were able to field and award contracts for these low-cost satellites in less than six months,' Kendall said in the SSC press release.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/space-force-taps-4-firms-for-first-phase-of-resilient-gps-program/	2024-09-24T13:25:07-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/10/gps-graphic-scaled-e1706296594858.jpg

(US Space Force photo by Dennis Rogers) MAUI — US Space Command is adding new mission sets to the remit of the multinational Joint Commercial Operations (JCO) cell, originally created to improve space domain awareness via unclassified commercial data, according to JCO head Barbara Golf. 'The JCO [is] the space domain awareness cell that we have had in operations for several years now, augmenting military space surveillance,' she told the annual Advanced Maui Optical and Space Surveillance Technologies (AMOS) conference. 'We originally focused on protect and defend, feeding into the National Space Defense Center, but we have moved well beyond that.' The National Space Defense Center is SPACECOM's organization at Schriever Space Force Base in Colorado that brings together military and Intelligence Community (IC) operators, particularly those working with US spy satellites owned by the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) to determine how best to prevent adversary attacks on Defense Department space systems. The JCO is a new name as of last December for the Joint Task Force-Space Defense Commercial Operations created by SPACECOM in 2020. It now involves 14 countries plus NATO, and gets commercial data and analytical products via the Unified Data Library, Golf explained using a slide presentation. 'There's a variety of different sensor types from our commercial providers — electro-optical sensors, radars, passive RF [radio frequency] publicly available information, and we are moving into satellite-to-satellite information as well,' she said. Golf elaborated that the JCO's mission up to now has been providing warnings about worrisome space activities by adversaries from low Earth orbit (LEO) to geosynchronous orbit (GEO) and beyond to far flung orbits often called xGEO. 'We are very good in GEO, not so good in LEO [but] we're fixing that, and moving out into xGEO, providing support and indications of warning. We do things like maneuver detection, launch tracking and our report, out primary deliverable, is called the NOTSO, Notice To Space Operators, very similar to a NOTAM notice to Airmen and mariners,' she said. 'We do say: &#8216;if you drive it and drive it like you stole it, you have our full and undivided attention,' Golf added. Golf, who also serves as the strategic advisor for space domain awareness at Space Force's Space Systems Command, explained that the JCO now has 'a mandate to integrate commercial into operations' and is adding missions to its portfolio. These include electromagnetic spectrum operations, which the JCO took up in July, and tactical surveillance, reconnaissance and tracking (Tac-SRT), which it will begin as of Oct. 1, she said. Tac-SRT is the moniker created by Space Force leadership for what traditionally has been called tactical intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance in order to differentiate what the Pentagon sees as the service's role versus those of the NRO and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) as well as allied and partner nations. NRO not only owns and operates spy satellites, but also is charged with buying remote sensing imagery from commercial satellite companies. NGA is responsible for collecting the remote sensing imagery provided by NRO, as well as imagery analysis from commercial providers, fusing all that into usable information, and disseminating it to the US national security community including military forces. The roles and missions delineation between the IC and the Space Force, including over acquisition of commercial imagery, is the subject of a ongoing, and sometimes heated, interagency debate. The Space Force since February has been operating a Tac-SRT pilot program that uses unclassified commercial analytical products (rather than raw imagery) to help US Africa Command with support missions like disaster relief and most recently the US military withdrawal from Niger — something Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman touted in his Sept. 18 speech to the annual Air Force Association conference. Golf stressed that the JCO's Tac-SRT work will be coordinated with the IC, particularly NGA, which has its own commercial remote sensing data lake. 'We are actually collaborating with the IC. We don't double buy. We check NGA imagery libraries first to make sure we don't already have information. We take everything we purchase and put it back in those libraries,' she said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/spacecom-expanding-missions-for-multinational-commercial-space-domain-awareness-cell/	2024-09-24T12:44:18-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/UK-space-command-visits-JCO-Barbara-Golf-e1727201738216.avif
UAE designation as US Major Defense Partner to tighten security ties, could aid F-35 deal: Experts	An F-35A Lightning II assigned to the F-35A Lightning II Demonstration Team performs at the Capitol Air Show over Sacramento, Calif., July 15, 2024. (U.S. Air Force photo by Staff Sgt. Zachary Rufus) BEIRUT — America's declaration that the United Arab Emirates is now officially its second-ever Major Defense Partner is expected draw the two friendly nations even closer on military matters and may offer a boost to the UAE's beleaguered effort to join the international F-35 program, analysts told Breaking Defense. 'Acknowledging the U.S. and UAE’s deepening security partnership and cooperation in advanced technology and acquisition, shared interest in preventing conflict and de-escalation, President [Joe] Biden today recognized the United Arab Emirates as a Major Defense Partner of the United States, joined by only India, to further enhance defense cooperation and security in the Middle East, East Africa, and the Indian Ocean regions,' the White House said Monday. Broadly speaking, Bilal Saab, head of US-Middle East practice at the TRENDS consulting firm, told Breaking Defense that the new arrangement 'authorizes the US bureaucracy — primarily the Pentagon — to open new doors for military cooperation between the two nations in the areas of joint military exercises, training, weapons transfers, intelligence and information-sharing, interoperability, defense innovation, and defense industry,' Saab said. The White House announcement lacked specifics, but Saab said the designation could have a distinct impact on one defense program in particular: the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. 'The conversation about the acquisition of the F-35 platform just got a boost,' Saab said. Like many other Gulf countries, the UAE is interested in procuring the American 5th-generation fighter and years ago pursued a deal for dozens of the jets, along with MQ-9 Reaper drones, for more than $20 billion. But the procurement fell apart, in part over US concerns about the UAE's use of Chinese wireless technology. In October 2023, a State Department official told Breaking Defense that a 'robust dialogue' was ongoing and that the US 'remain[ed] committed' to the sales 'even as we continue consultations to ensure that we have a clear, mutual understanding with respect to Emirati obligations and actions before, during, and after delivery.' Echoing Saab, Kristian Alexander, a senior fellow at the United Arab Emirate-based Rabdan Security &amp; Defence Institute, said that the UAE is now in a better position to acquire F-35 fighter jets, among other systems. 'As a Major Defense Partner, the UAE could potentially gain access to advanced US defense platforms,' he said. 'The UAE could also potentially more easily be able to acquire missile defense systems, like the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) or bolster the Patriot missile defense system to better defend against threats, in the region.' He added that the military cooperation could be in cybersecurity and AI domains, as the US capabilities could bolster UAE’s endeavor in this regard. In a separate statement, the White House on Monday said that the two countries planned promote cooperation in AI and related technologies. The deepening relationship between the US and the UAE, which already hosts US forces at the Al Dafra Air Base outside Abu Dhabi, comes at a tense time for security in the Middle East, as aggressive Israeli operations in Gaza and now in Lebanon continue to threaten to spiral into a broader regional conflict. The UAE has already seen in years past a smattering of drone attacks the government blamed on Houthi rebels in Yemen. 'The ongoing conflicts in the Middle East, particularly in Gaza and Sudan, necessitate stronger collaboration for humanitarian aid delivery and conflict resolution. The Biden administration is seemingly attempting to leverage its partnership with the UAE to promote stability in these volatile regions,' Alexander said. Still, Alexander said it remains unclear if the new designation will pull the UAE further from Beijing's grasp. Cooperation in non-defense sectors, he said, will likely continue. 'The UAE has pursued a strategy of maintaining diverse alliances to safeguard its national security and economic interests. Even with enhanced defense cooperation with the US, the UAE is likely to continue engaging with China and Russia to balance its international relations,' he concluded.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/uae-designation-as-us-major-defense-partner-to-tighten-security-ties-could-aid-f-35-deal-experts/	2024-09-24T11:39:38-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/240924_F35_moon_USAF-scaled-e1727200160419.jpg
Boeing subsidiary, Indian firm ink new agreement to produce unmanned vehicles: White House	US President Joe Biden (R) greets Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi as he arrives for the Quadrilateral Summit at the Archmere Academy in Wilmington, Delaware on September 21, 2024. (Photo by Brendan SMIALOWSKI / AFP) (Photo by BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — American giant Boeing and Indian company Sagar Defence Engineering are teaming to codevelop and coproduce new unmanned surface vehicles, as Washington and New Delhi continue to seek strengthened defense industrial ties. The announcement, made through both White House and company statements, comes as Prime Minister Narendra Modi is visiting the United States as part of the Quad meeting and the UN General Assembly. The effort is built around Wave Glider, a USV produced by Boeing subsidiary Liquid Robotics and propelled by waves and solar power. They are used for ocean research, weather and climate modeling, tsunami and seismic monitoring as well as to support offshore energy, according to Boeing. 'The Wave Glider is an ideal system for fostering collaboration between the U.S. and Indian governments and strengthening tactical readiness in the Indo-Pacific,' said Shane Goodenough, CEO of Liquid Robotics. 'Teaming up with Sagar Defence marks a new era for our bilateral defense cooperation and enables us to grow our existing Wave Glider operations in India. We are very pleased to join forces with the skilled team at Sagar, who have a proven record of successfully integrating uncrewed systems into active defense missions.' In a Sept. 21 statement, the White House also applauded several other defense and technology cooperation initiatives between the United States and India, including a teaming agreement between Lockheed Martin and Tata Advanced Systems to establish a new maintenance facility in India for the C-130J Super Hercules fleet. 'This marks a significant step in U.S.-India defense and aerospace cooperation and reflects the two sides’ deepening strategic and technology partnership ties,' according to the White House statement. For over a decade, India and the US have made pledges of increased defense industrial cooperation with each other. The relationship was reset with the 2012 launch of the Defense Technology and Trade Initiative (DTTI), a specialized program crafted by Ash Carter, who was then the US deputy defense secretary. When Carter took on the full SecDef job, he prioritized relations with India, including cooperation on engine and carrier technology. Under the Trump administration, in 2019, Ellen Lord, then the Pentagon acquisition head, told reporters that the US and India would codevelop small, aerial unmanned systems. However, in part because of India's often convoluted acquisition system, little was actually developed from these agreements, leading the Biden administration to take its own swing in 2023 under the aegis of the India-US Defense Acceleration Ecosystem and a series of defense-oriented initiatives. There was also a subsequent memorandum of understanding signed by the Pentagon’s Defense Innovation Unit and a similar agency in the Indian Ministry of Defence. 'The efforts via the INDUSWERX consortium to facilitate pathways for defense and dual-use companies in the INDUS-X network to access premier testing ranges in both countries, were appreciated,' according to the statement.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/boeing-subsidiary-indian-firm-ink-new-agreement-to-produce-unmanned-vehicles-white-house/	2024-09-24T10:16:37-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/240924_modi_biden_quad_GettyImages-2172745566-scaled.jpg
How Israel degraded Hezbollah for years to come, in 8 days	Smoke billows from the site of an Israeli airstrike in Marjayoun, near the Lebanon-Israel border, on September 23, 2024. (Photo by RABIH DAHER/AFP via Getty Images) Over the last eight days, Israel has launched an extraordinary two-part campaign against Hezbollah, its longtime nemesis located in Lebanon. In the first part, Israel took out thousands of its opponents in two highly targeted attacks with minimal collateral damage, perhaps the greatest counterinsurgency stroke in history. The second part, currently unfolding, is a series of highly successful air attacks against Hezbollah leadership and facilities — precise, but with considerable collateral damage. The astounding ability to reach out and target Hezbollah’s heart is a victory for Israel’s intelligence services and a severe blow to Hezbollah — not just to their operations, but to their long-term sense of security and stability. Not only will there be the immediate effects of greatly weakening the adversary’s forces, but the secondary effects on leadership, recruitment, communications, logistics, and internal cohesion will hurt Hezbollah for years. The militant group will not disappear — it is an ideology as much as an organization — but these attacks will reduce Hezbollah’s strength, proficiency and standing amongst membership and the regional population. To briefly review the first phase: On September 17, at the same moment, thousands of pagers exploded, followed one day later by exploding walkie-talkies. In all, over 30 people were killed and 3,300 injured, according to official sources, though the actual number could be much higher. Most of the wounded will eventually recover, but many injuries, like the loss of a hand or eye, will cause lifelong impairments. Despite loose rhetoric about 'indiscriminate attacks,' and the tragic loss of life from family members of Hezbollah operatives, this was precisely targeted. The only people carrying Hezbollah pagers and walkie-talkies were Hezbollah operatives who needed them for their malign activities. The devices had limited other uses; they were not phones that could be used for personal business or entertainment. Thus, when such a device injures the Iranian ambassador to Lebanon, it means that Hezbollah gave him one that he kept on his person. That’s not a surprise considering how close Hezbollah and Iran are; the ambassador made himself a military target. To put this action into perspective, outside estimates are that in 11 months of war, Israel has killed 6,000 to 8,000 Hamas fighters. To do that, the Israelis have used thousands of munitions, including 2,000-pound bombs, to lever the Hamas insurgents from their fortified positions. Insurgents, by their nature, hide among the population. Counterinsurgency must ferret them out, often using blunt methods and inflicting great suffering on the civilian population. Thus, this campaign has caused about 40,000 dead and 92,400 wounded, as estimated by the Hamas health ministry. In two days in Lebanon, Israel inflicted about half the number of casualties on Hezbollah with very little collateral damage. That's extraordinary. It's like having a magic wand that attacks only the enemy and spares others. It's hard to think of any comparable action in the history of counterinsurgency that displayed this broad scope and precision The second phase of the Israeli campaign is playing out daily as Israel uses its air power to attack Hezbollah’s leaders and infrastructure. An attack on September 20 killed several high-ranking leaders. On Monday, Israel attacked 1,600 targets, including leadership, storage facilities, manufacturing plants, and personnel. On Tuesday, Israel struck Beirut itself in an action early reports say was going after a top Hezbollah leader. The ability of the attacks — and there likely will be more by the time you read this — to strike leaders and, based on social media videos, weapons storage facilities, speaks to the precision of Israel's intelligence on the ground. These attacks have been 'precise' in the sense that they are accurately striking valid targets. However, they are not free of collateral damage as the pager/walkie-talkie attacks largely were. These air attacks look more like the actions in Gaza, which have taken out both fighters and civilians. Lebanon is claiming over 500 civilian deaths from Monday’s attacks, a number that tragically will likely grow. So, what will the effects of this campaign be? Predicting how the current fighting will play out is highly speculative and will depend on what Israel and Hezbollah do next. But one thing that seems assured is that the attacks' secondary and tertiary effects will haunt Hezbollah for years. At a organizational level, there has been a major blow to the leadership. Hezbollah has lost many of its experienced and senior personnel, and will lose more. There will always be replacements, ambitious and dedicated subordinates who will step up to replace a killed principal, but they will lack the experience and authority of the originals, at least for a while. Further, there will be an organizational stutter step as it adjusts to new leaders. This is particularly a problem for non-state groups where legitimacy is tied as much to personality as it is to organizational position. At a tactical level, Hezbollah’s communications have been disrupted. Few people will now be willing to use a Hezbollah-supplied device, given the demonstrated risk — already, some airlines are outright banning pagers and walkie-talkies from flights over fear of further sabotage. Hezbollah will need to use other mechanisms: couriers, cell phones, landlines, e-mail, or chat functions. Because there are many possibilities, Hezbollah will not lose control of its military forces or political organization. However, all alternative communications have disadvantages. Some mechanisms are vulnerable to compromise — that’s why Hezbollah was using pagers and walkie-talkies in the first place. For example, cell phones are notoriously prone to interception because of their continuous broadcasting. The United States tracked many ISIS operatives through their cell phones, but doing so doesn’t even require the resources of a national government. The internet is awash with information about how individuals can intercept calls. Phone calls by Russian soldiers in Ukraine are routinely intercepted and reported on. Other methods are more secure but inefficient. Whereas pagers could inform 10, 100, or 1,000 personnel with a single message, landlines require making that many individual calls. Typically, that entails building 'phone trees' to divide the work. Not only is the process slow, but each call carries the possibility of compromise. Couriers — the means of communication for millennia — are secure but slow and visible. Many people will see the messages being delivered. Remember, Osama Bin Laden's hideout was found by tracking a courier. Yet, the indirect effects go even further. Hezbollah cannot be sure whether other devices weren't compromised. If the Israelis did compromise the pager batteries, then every battery-powered weapon in Hezbollah's arsenal is suspect. That includes thousands of rockets. True, it's unlikely that the Israelis were unable to tamper with all these different systems, but how likely were the original attacks in the first place? Hezbollah cannot take chances and will need to disassemble and inspect virtually everything in its arsenal on the verge of what might be a conflict with Israel. Finally, a search for scapegoats and possible traitors is inevitable; indeed, it has likely started. Someone in Hezbollah's logistics operation screwed up. For most Hezbollah logisticians, this might have been the unwitting result of operating in the shadows using front companies and cutouts. But someone in the long supply chain knew that these pagers and walkie-talkies were weapons, not communications devices. Who was that person, and where were they in the supply chain? The leadership attacks of the second phase will also engender suspicions of betrayal. How did Israel find all those locations? Overhead and electronic surveillance may explain some intelligence, but there was undoubtedly some on-the-ground reconnaissance. Were there traitors inside the organization? Insurgent organizations are naturally suspicious of internal betrayals. Interrogations will be widespread, likely harsh, and possibly followed by executions. The organization may tear itself apart. As many have pointed out, tactical success does not always lead to strategic success. Japan's attack on the United States in 1941 is a classic example of adapted technologies and innovative concepts producing a brilliant tactical success but ending ultimately in strategic failure. For Israel, the blow to peace negotiations and the possibility of escalation into a major war could overshadow the tactical value of taking out even thousands of enemy combatants. Time will tell. Nevertheless, the tactical success so far is spectacular and undeniable — and will hurt Hezbollah’s ability to operate and define itself as a top-tier competitor to Israel.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/how-israel-degraded-hezbollah-for-years-to-come-in-8-days/	2024-09-24T08:03:21-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/GettyImages-2173117664-scaled-e1727185954831.jpg
Replenishment oiler ‘sustained damage’ operating in Middle East: Navy official	The Military Sealift Command fleet replenishment oiler USNS Big Horn (T-AO 198) conducts a fueling-at-sea with the Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN 71), July 10, 2024.(U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Rashan Jefferson) WASHINGTON — A US Navy replenishment oiler, one of an aging but critical US fleet, 'sustained damage' while operating in the Middle East on Sept. 23, a Navy official told Breaking Defense. All crewmembers of the USNS Big Horn (T-AO-198) are safe, and US 5th Fleet is assessing the situation, the official said. Unverified videos and photographs circulating on social media today claim to show at least one room on the Big Horn flooded. GCaptain first reported the ship had run aground and was being towed to Dubai. The Navy official told Breaking Defense that 'it is too early to speculate on the specifics or cause of the damage' and that more information would be provided as it became available. The official declined to verify the authenticity of the imagery on social media. News of the Big Horn’s damage comes at a tenuous moment for the Navy’s support ship fleet. Those vessels, each with their own auxiliary functions and crewed by civilian mariners, are of varying ages, with many in need of recapitalization. USNI News first reported Military Sealift Command, the agency charged with managing auxiliary ships, had drafted a plan to remove the crews from 17 Navy support ships over a lack of qualified mariners. A Navy spokesman previously declined to comment on that report. Sal Mercogliano, a maritime historian and professor at Campbell University in North Carolina, said on Twitter the Big Horn’s situation 'demonstrates is the fragility of our maritime logistics system to support the fleet.' 'With just 14 fleet oilers, 2 supply class fast combat stores ships and 12 dry cargo/ammo ships, we don’t have much depth in the fleet to support multiple strike group deployments, routine operations and training,' he said. 'If Big Horn is out of service the two [dry cargo/ammunition ships] in the region can provide some fuel, along with shore side facilities. Other assets will have to be pulled from the western Pacific or Atlantic as there is only one oiler in the' Mediterranean, he continued.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/replenishment-oiler-sustained-damage-operating-in-middle-east-navy-official/	2024-09-24T07:27:40-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/8524368-scaled-e1727186104760.jpg
From more drones to smaller command posts, Army’s 3rd ID tests out new tactics	Soldiers with the 1st Armored Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division, scan a simulated village at the National Training Center, Fort Irwin, Calif. on July 21, 2024. (US Army/ Spc. Rebeca Soria) WASHINGTON — As the US Army rolls out new weapons and gleans lessons from Ukraine’s battlefield, 3rd Infantry Division soldiers with the newest combat vehicles are taking their turn discovering works and what doesn’t. 'What we're doing right now is just using what we have better and then experimenting within our units here to kind of evolve with what we have today at the pace with which we're observing change in the world,' Maj. Gen. Christopher Norrie, the commander of 3rd Infantry Division, told reporters Sept. 20. As part of the Army’s plans to field new equipment, the division recently swapped out a glut of legacy equipment for new M1A2 System Enhancement Program version 3 (SEPv3) Abrams main battle tanks, M2A4 Bradley Fighting Vehicles, M109A7 Paladins, Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV) and more. The 3rd ID trained with the new vehicles before an eight-month deployment to Europe (Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia), and then continued training at the National Training Center at Fort Irwin in California to continue testing out ways to make the formations more survivable. 'We've been transforming at scale both on our recent European deployment and back here in the United States,' the two-star general added. Soldiers in the 1st ABCT are the first to use the Army's new tracked combat APMV, designed to replace the M113 family. Norrie and 1st ABCT commander Col. Jim Armstong didn't go into detail about how the new vehicle might change infantry tactics, but said it has enhanced command and control integration, in part, because the field artillery digital fire system is inside that vehicle. The unit has also completely changed up how it distributes and hides its command posts across the battlefield. For that training exercise in California, for example, the unit kept the 'main' larger servers back at Ft. Stewart, Ga., and soldiers back there conducted defensive cyber operations, Armstrong explained. Smaller servers were then moved forward, allowing the unit to organize command posts differently. Soldiers out of the range of fire set up a command post focused on intelligence, targeting and logistics. Then smaller, more nimble command posts were then disturbed across the battlefield alongside fake ones, making it more difficult for the opponent — this time played by the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment, also known as the Blackhorse Cavalry — to find the right 'needle' in the haystack to strike, the two-star general said. 'Those efforts were extremely effective at masking our own formations while drawing the enemy out so that they could then be targeted here as well,' Norrie added. 'All of that was informed by experiences in Europe.' RELATED: The cloud, fiber optics and hiding in basements: Army races to adapt to new command post threats 'Just a few years ago, our brigade level command posts took on average 14-plus hours just to tear down. We were issuing lengthy orders just to get our units on the move, we weren't thinking about drones or kind of the threats in the airspace, and we weren't considering the electromagnetic spectrum,' Norrie said separately. As part of the Army’s effort to test the effectiveness of new equipment and operating constructs under the 'transformation in contact' initiative, those smaller command posts were designed to be set up and broken down in 15 minutes. As for minimizing their electromagnet signature, the Army has been setting up antenna farms several kilometers away from the smaller command posts and then using a fiber cable to link them to soldiers. Drones are also playing a more prominent role, with soldiers from the 1st ABCT, 3rd ID showing up in California with 90 platforms, and carrying along systems to shoot the opponents drones down too. The goal? Find new and innovative ways to organize around those weapons and use them, Armstrong said. 'We had battalions and squads with UAS that had not had them in that volume or at those echelons before,' Armstrong said. 'We endeavored to make contact with unmanned systems first, right? That was our goal, to make contact with unmanned systems first, to only aggregate and unmask our indirect fires and put our soldiers in direct-fire contact at times and places of our choosing.' While Armstong and Norrie didn’t disclose if the ABCT used 3D printing this summer out at the training center, the service is continuing to test out the best way to push the capability forward on the battlefield and into armor formations. Part of the work to get there was tested out at a separate training event, this one with soldiers from the 2nd Brigade, 101st Airborne Division on their recent stint at the Joint Readiness Training where they had a 3D printer on the mock battlefield printing out a small plastic replacement part. During a Sept. 20 interview with Breaking Defense, the acting commander general for Army Materiel Command, Lt. Gen. Christopher Mohan, explained that his team is taking lessons from that event and attempting to iron out the kinks to make it easier for soldiers to print replacements on the future battlefield. 'Our digital repository is too hard to get to [for that] user in the field because it is something that has been established to operate at the strategic, OIB [organic industrial base] level,' Mohan said. 'We have to make it easier for units to access it from the field, and then we have to train the right people to know how to access it.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/from-more-drones-to-smaller-command-posts-armys-3rd-id-tests-out-new-tactics/	2024-09-24T05:25:09-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/3rd-ID-scaled-e1727116490456.jpg
Lithuania and Northrop Grumman sign IFV ammunition pact	Lithuania operates 89 Boxer Infantry Fighting Vehicles, equipped with Northrop Grumman made Bushmaster MK44S 30mm chain guns (Lithuania Ministry of Defence) BELFAST — Lithuania and Northrop Grumman inked a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) today committing the US manufacturer to support local suppliers in the production of medium-caliber ammunition for Infantry Fighting Vehicles (IFVs). In a company statement, Northrop said that the new pact allows it to 'share technologies and advanced manufacturing expertise with Lithuanian industry, consistent with United States policy.' The firm added that helping 'allies’ indigenous defense industrial capabilities is key to replenishing stockpiles and enhancing the munitions supply chains' amid demand for artillery shells spiking dramatically in response to the Ukraine war. Lithuania shares a border with the Russian enclave Kaliningrad and has consistently supplied Ukraine with military aid over the course of the war, including 155mm ammunition, M577 armored personnel carriers, drone-jamming systems and ammunition for Carl Gustaf anti-tank recoilless rifles. Vilnius also plans on increasing defense spending in 2025 to 3 percent GDP, above the NATO target of 2 percent. 'This project [with Northrop Grumman], while also strengthening the long-standing close relationship between Lithuania and the US, will create clear value for Lithuania and for our region as a whole, which in the face of security challenges has an interest in minimising dependence on long supply chains,' said Laurynas Kasčiūnas, Lithuania's defence minister, per Northrop's company release. 'By integrating advanced American technologies, we are not only strengthening our national security, but also paving the way for future innovations in [the] defence industry.' Lithuania's state-owned Giraitė Armaments Plant is also set to join the ammunition production project alongside Northrop, according to Gintarė Skaistė, Lithuania's finance minister. As part of a €670 million ($745 million) acquisition, the Baltic state operates 89 Boxer IFVs, designated Vilkas (Wolf) in national service, the last of which were delivered at the end of 2023. Vilnius has long expressed interest in ordering an additional 120 platforms, opening negotiations with Boxer manufacturer ARTEC in 2022, but a contract has still to be signed. The vehicles are equipped with Israel's Rafael Samson Mk II remote controlled weapons stations and Spike LR anti-tank missiles, and Northrop-made Bushmaster MK44S 30mm chain guns. The agreement with Northrop comes five months after Lithuania similarly signed a memorandum of intent with Germany's Rheinmetall to open a 155mm artillery shell factory. The future facility is set to become the first of its kind to be established under new regulations relating to the development of large-scale Lithuanian defense projects.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/lithuania-and-northrop-grumman-sign-ifv-ammunition-pact/	2024-09-23T13:10:16-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/1-1-e1727121075288.jpg
General Dynamics inks $450M contract for Austal to build out sub facility	USS Pierre (LCS-38) at Austal USA's shipyard in Mobile, Ala., as it prepares for launching into the water. (Photo courtesy of Austal USA) WASHINGTON — General Dynamics Electric Boat awarded Austal USA a $450 million contract to expand infrastructure at its Mobile, Ala., shipyard for Virginia- and Columbia-class submarine construction, Austal announced today. The contract will include designing and building a new module fabrication and outfitting facility, which will begin construction this fall and is expected to be completed in 2026. Once fully operational, the new facility is expected to support approximately 1,000 new jobs at the shipyard, according to an Austal statement. 'This contract award further solidifies Austal USA’s strong industrial partnership with General Dynamics Electric Boat to increase capacity in the submarine industrial base,' said Austal USA President Michelle Kruger. RELATED: In Expansion, Austal USA Undergoes ‘Unique Evolution’ Beyond A Two-Trick Shipbuilder A GD Electric Boat spokesperson had no comment about the announcement when contacted by Breaking Defense. The new building will provide 369,000 square feet of production space across eight and a half acres of land, the Austal statement added. 'This award represents another significant milestone in the transformation of our Mobile facility to meet the diverse needs of our Navy and Coast Guard customers,' said Larry Ryder, Austal USA vice president of business development and external affairs. 'Since we broke ground for our steel panel line in 2021, we have continuously worked to grow the capacity and capability of our Mobile shipyard leveraging our highly skilled workforce.' The contract comes just days after the Navy announced it had established a separate deal with a private investment fund, United Submarine Alliance Qualified Opportunity Fund LP, or USA Fund, aimed at boosting the submarine industrial base. That deal, which included a $152 million investment by the Navy through Austal, purchased the 355-acre Alabama Shipyard situated adjacent to Austal’s own facilities.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/general-dynamics-inks-450m-contract-for-austal-to-build-out-sub-facility/	2024-09-23T12:25:22-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/53904232009_ded94874a5_k-e1722961913248.jpg
UAE’s defense conglomeration EDGE looks to space with new FADA entity	Communications satellite on the background of the starry sky. (Getty) BEIRUT — In its first large stride in the space domain, the United Arab Emirate’s defense giant EDGE Group launched today a new company dubbed FADA to spur the country’s defense-related space sector, the company announced today in a statement. 'EDGE is fully committed to advancing the UAE's strategic interests in defence and advanced technology, and FADA’s mission is to develop sovereign space capabilities and homegrown technologies in the UAE,' according to the statement. Named FADA, the Arabic word for space, the new entity is expected to help build a national space sector to support the country’s requirements and will expand international partnerships to benefit from Transfer of Technology (ToT) and transfer of Knowledge (ToK). 'FADA will establish state-of-the-art facilities for the development, manufacturing, assembly, integration, and testing of various satellite systems and subsystems, serving as a one-stop shop for all space-related activities and providing end-to-end solutions and services to local and international customers, including: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), Optical (EO) and Infrared (IR) payloads, as well as satellite platforms, and satellite cybersecurity and protection services in addition to other space activities,' according to the statement. EDGE Group CEO Hamad Al Marar said the new company 'will enable EDGE to grow and fortify its position in the global space industry in line with the UAE’s vision of becoming a leader in space technologies, creating the blueprint for a self-sufficient and innovative ecosystem.' EDGE Group’s head of space and cyber technologies, Waleid Al Mesmari, said among FADA's goals will be to facilitate the development of satellite systems 'while building a sustainable and skilled space-focused workforce.' In 2019, the UAE released its National Space Strategy 2030 and in 2021 it allocated more than $800 million in national space fund to build 'national capabilities and competencies, raise the economic contribution to diversifying the national economy, and consolidate the UAE’s position in the space sector.' While EDGE’s new entity aligns with this vision, it is the closest the Gulf country has reached in the defense-related space sector, as EDGE has a large number of cooperation with Western defense firms to build local platforms in the UAE. UAE is also not the only Gulf country exploring space. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is eyeing to boost its space sector and is expected to merge its air force and space force as part of this endeavor.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/uaes-defense-conglomeration-edge-looks-to-space-with-new-fada-entity/	2024-09-23T11:12:16-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/240923_satellite_generica_GettyImages-1452830132-scaled-e1727107359722.jpg
France claims world’s first space-to-earth laser comms	Communications satellite orbiting above Earth (Getty Images/ Adastra) PARIS — France’s Defense Innovation Agency (AID) together with a small French company, Cailabs, have succeeded in establishing a high-speed optical satellite communication between a nano-satellite in low orbit and a commercial optical ground station — a feat that they claim is a world first. The French Defense Ministry said in a Sept. 10 statement that this project contributes to the objectives of the 2024-2030 military programming law, which provides for the country’s effort to up its military space game. Satellite laser communications is an increasing area of interest for many governments as they seek to make the internet more resilient to attacks by bad actors, including those on subsea cables that currently carry most transatlantic internet traffic. Further, laser communications both between satellites and between satellites and ground stations enable the transmission of larger amounts of data in shorter time frames. Jean-Francois Morizur, co-founder and CEO of Cailabs, which developed the optical ground station, told Breaking Defense in a telephone interview that 'others have already demonstrated the proof of concept that a laser link can be established between a satellite and a ground-station but we are proposing an actual product that exists and can be bought off-the-shelf.' Morizur revealed that the company has 'already sold seven, at least seven we’re allowed to talk about, to South Korea, Australia, Greece, France and the United States.' He specified these ground stations had been bought both directly by the nations or else by companies which worked for governments. The Cailabs ground station 'is a white dome that measures around four metres in diameter with a large telescope that sticks out of it.' He explained that the technology lies in the way the light is treated once it’s entered the telescope. The laser communication terminal aboard the nano-satellite, made by Unseenlabs, another small French company, also is an off-the-shelf product. These terminals 'are sold by lots of companies and thanks to the US Space Development Agency, they are all required to be interoperable,' Morizur explained. The Space Development Agency has developed standards for orbital laser communications it intends to use, but has published the standards in hopes of facilitating widespread use. The French experiment was launched at the end of 2023 by AID with the launch of the Keraunos satellite and the aim of testing high-speed optical communications based on the innovative technology developed by Cailabs. AID provided €5.5 million ($6.1 million) to fund the Keraunos project which also involved Unseenlabs, another startup based in Rennes, western France. The team was able to establish a stable laser link over several minutes and thereby not only track the nano-satellite flying in low Earth orbit from the optical ground station, but also receive data sent from the satellite. In a statement, the Defense Ministry explained that 'the advantages of the optical link over the usual radio link are its speed, discretion and independence from regulations that coordinate the use of radio waves. Even if this optical link can sometimes be perturbed by atmospheric turbulence, the Keraunos satellite is able to circumvent them in order to achieve optimum transmission quality.' It adds that 'the modern and agile architecture of Unseenlabs’ nano-satellites allows for the laser communication terminal to be integrated within the very short timespan imposed by the ‘New Space’ tempo.' ('New Space' is a term referring to the growing ecosystem of private space firms kicking out innovative products at a rapid pace.) The Defense Ministry says the successful outcome of the Keranos project 'makes it possible to use space-based laser communications on mobile, land-based, naval or airborne platforms,' adding that 'this system could be integrated into the Ministry of Defense's future satellite systems.' Jonathan Galic, co-founder and new technologies director at Unseenlabs, says in the ministerial statement that 'this success reflects the capacity of Unseenlabs to rapidly put into orbit a perfectly functional, complex system. The combination of the performances of (our) satellites with the optical innovations of Cailabs opens the way to faster and more secure communications.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/france-claims-worlds-first-space-to-earth-laser-comms/	2024-09-23T07:40:46-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/GettyImages-AB23479-scaled-e1727101217129.jpg
China Indo-Pac military power trumps US, but US remains more influential: Lowy Institute	Soldiers of the 74th Army Group of the People's Liberation Army take part in a battle drill in a coastal area of Guangdong province in June 2020 [Credit Xinhua] SYDNEY — As leaders from the 'Quad' gathered this weekend to toast the Indo-Pacific partnership, a new report is sounding alarms that the US is no longer the dominant military power in Asia. The new report from the Lowy Institute here says that the People's Republic of China 'has closed more than a quarter of the lead that the United States held in this measure in 2018. For the first time, experts surveyed for the Asia Power Index judged that China is better able to deploy rapidly and for a sustained period in the event of an interstate conflict in Asia.' While undoubtedly concerning, the Institute's report also notes there are reasons for cautious optimism, in that Beijing's overall power in the region is beginning to 'plateau' as its population begins to fall and its economy falters under the weight of enormous debt and its reeling real estate sector. The Lowy Institute produces the 'Asia Power Index' each year. 'China’s power is neither surging nor collapsing. It is plateauing at a level below that of the United States, but still well above any Asian competitors,' the new report by Susannah Patton, Jack Sato and Herve Lemahieu says. 'Flatlining economic capability, driven by slower economic growth and longer-term structural challenges, means that China’s economic clout, while still commanding, is no longer growing.' In light of constant Chinese claims that the United States has no business operating in the western Pacific and is a fading power, the Lowy Institute report's authors find that 'US staying power and dynamism in Asia, this year as in years prior, has confounded the pessimists. The United States leads China on six out of eight measures in the Asia Power Index.' US President Joe Biden made clear in an unguarded moment during this weekend's Quad meetings in Delaware that China and the United States are competing in the region. 'China continues to behave aggressively, testing us all across the region, and it’s true in the South China Sea, the East China Sea, South China, South Asia and the Taiwan Straits,' Biden was overheard in what were supposed to be private remarks but were caught on a live mic. Perhaps the biggest surprise in the study is the rapid decline of Russia's estimated influence in the Indo-Pacific due to its invasion of Ukraine. 'Russia, the &#8216;no limits' partner to China, was overtaken by Australia in fifth place in the Asia Power Index rankings. For a second consecutive year, it was among the three countries with the worst declines in comprehensive power in Asia,' according to the report. 'Moscow has paid a heavy price for its disastrous invasion of Ukraine, which continues to sap focus and resources. President Vladimir Putin’s visit to three countries in Asia in 2024 looked more like an effort to shore up dwindling influence than a sign of continued relevance to the region.' By contrast, Japan demonstrated an impressive military and diplomatic rise, in part a reflection of the closer relations forged between the United States and other Pacific allies in the face of China's blatant bullying of the Philippines and dangerous and unprofessional maneuvers involving Australian, Dutch, American and other air and sea assets. 'Japan’s transformation from an economic and cultural powerhouse to one based also in defense and security engagement with its neighbors is among the key trends identified by the 2024 Asia Power Index,' the report finds. 'Tokyo has stepped up as a regional security provider — a development exemplified by its signing of a Reciprocal Access Agreement with Manila.' Japan's increasingly close relations with Australia and South Korea must also play a role in this. India, ranked third below China, has overtaken Japan in terms of overall regional power, but the report notes 'Delhi still has limited ability to project power and influence east of the Malacca Strait. However, the fact that its influence remains well below the level promised by its resources suggests it still has ample potential for further growth as a major power.' Adds the report's authors, 'India’s great strength in Asia is the resources it brings from its huge population, landmass, and economy — already the world’s third-largest in terms of purchasing power parity (PPP).' Among the other secondary powers in the Indo-Pacific, Indonesia’s power 'has grown more than any other since the inception of the Asia Power Index, by 2.9 points in 2024 alone, marking an 11 per cent increase on its 2018 score. The Philippines has overtaken an embattled nuclear power, Pakistan, to reach fifteenth place in the Asia Power Index. Manila’s strategy of seeking closer ties with the United States, as well as a broader range of US-aligned partners outside ASEAN, resulted in an increase in its comprehensive power, driven in particular by its strengthened Diplomatic Influence.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/china-indo-pac-military-power-trumps-us-but-us-remains-more-influential-lowy-institute/	2024-09-23T00:15:52-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/Image-e1727034099652.jpeg
Navy takes ‘really big swing’ with private investment to boost sub industrial base	The Virginia-class USS Oregon (SSN 793) transits the Thames River after returning from routine operations in route to Naval Submarine Base New London in Groton, Conn., Oct. 14. (U.S. Navy photo by Petty Officer 2nd Class Wesley Towner) WASHINGTON — The US Navy today unveiled an unusual 'collaboration' with a private investment fund aimed at boosting America's capacity to crank out modern submarines, in this case with an 'ambitious' development of a shipyard in Alabama. Specifically, the Navy said a private fund, the United Submarine Alliance Qualified Opportunity Fund LP, or USA Fund, purchased the 355-acre Alabama Shipyard outside Mobile 'where it will prioritize U.S Navy maritime infrastructure investments and sustainment activities with the goal of developing an additional 75 [percent] of the site to support submarine production, workforce training, and industrial capacity.' Shipbuilder Austal USA is investing in the fund and was today awarded a $152 million Pentagon contract 'to support continued expansion' of the US sub industrial base. That money came from fiscal year 2024 National Sea-Based Deterrence funds. 'Today’s announcement underscores our commitment to finding innovative and creative solutions to accelerate submarine production and is emblematic of my Maritime Statecraft initiative that seeks to incentivize expansion of our national shipbuilding capacity by engaging new, forward-leaning stakeholders and leveraging the power of public and private investment,' Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro said in a service press release. Del Toro said the move 'answers my call for investment into small-to-medium size shipyards, both active and dormant, that were previously the backbone of our Nation’s maritime power, and I look forward to continuing to work with industry on future initiatives to strengthen our maritime industrial base.' RELATED: Is a new Navy shipyard realistic, or just a ‘tall order?’ 'This Gulf Coast site, with its deep-water port, advanced facilities, and proximity to significant infrastructure and a skilled workforce, is ideally suited for expanding industrial base capacity,' the Navy's release says. 'Positioned next to Austal USA, an existing U.S. Navy shipbuilding contractor, the Alabama Shipyard will support the production of Columbia Class and Virginia Class submarine modules, as well as additive manufacturing and training.' Speaking to reporters ahead of the announcement, Navy officials described a dramatic expansion of the shipyard, to include new facilities where workers for approximately 3,000 new jobs would work or train. US officials have long warned that the US industrial base is not matched to the cadence of shipbuilding the Navy would like, especially now that the US has committed to providing Australia with at least three new Virginia-class subs as part of the AUKUS security arrangement. Today the Navy said sub production 'must double' its current rate, 'requiring an additional 3.5 to 4.5 million submarine module production and outfitting hours annually.' That meant there was plenty of 'demand signal' to make submarine building look like an attractive market to 'private capital,' according to Wendy Jones, director of the Navy's submarine industrial base program. 'It is that we understand that the demand signal we're all orienting towards right now, in one Columbia plus two Virginias per year, is a five-x increase to our industrial base,' she said. 'And that in itself carries weight when it comes to a stable demand signal and [being a] national imperative.' The introduction of a private investment fund, which by nature aims to maximize profit, into such a long-term and infrastructure-intensive national security project carries inherent 'risks,' according to Matthew Sermon, executive director at the Navy's program executive office for strategic submarines. But, he told reporters, the service evaluated those risks and inserted 'contractual mechanisms and authorities that safeguard Navy and national security interests.' 'Think about things like foreign ownership, but also the right to have veto power over critical decisions or how the property is leveraged,' he said. The Navy may be wading into relatively new financial waters, but Jones said that if it works as well as they hope, similar arrangements could follow. 'This is a really big swing,' she said. 'It's a big way to demonstrate what we see and in terms of the value in having private capital run alongside congressional dollars and sustaining something well beyond a president's budget, right? 'This is the opportunity to do that and I don't think this is a single thing, a single instance of working. I think this opens the door for this being a new way of us looking to do business in well into the future with partners who are mission-focused just like are.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/navy-takes-really-big-swing-with-private-investment-to-boost-sub-industrial-base/	2024-09-20T15:17:17-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/04/230418_DVIDS_oregon_sub_7463479-scaled-e1681834011705.jpg
Boeing defense chief Ted Colbert pushed out	Ted Colbert, CEO of Boeing Defense, Space and Security, in a 2019 file phot. (KARIM SAHIB/AFP via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — Ted Colbert, chief executive of Boeing’s defense unit, exited the company today effective immediately amid the unit’s continued poor performance and crippling financial losses. Steve Parker, Boeing defense’s chief operating officer, will take on leadership at the unit while the company seeks out a permanent replacement, Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg said in a memo to employees. 'I want to thank Ted for his 15 years of service at The Boeing Company, supporting our customers, our people and our communities,' Ortberg said in the memo. 'At this critical juncture, our priority is to restore the trust of our customers and meet the high standards they expect of us to enable their critical missions around the world,' Ortberg said. 'Working together we can and will improve our performance and ensure we deliver on our commitments.' Colbert’s ouster comes just a week after Boeing Chief Financial Officer Brian West, speaking to investors at a financial conference, disclosed that margins at the defense unit would be negative during the third quarter amid continued difficulties reversing cost overruns from fixed-priced defense contracts, as well as newly discovered production challenges on the F-15EX and F/A-18 Super Hornet. Colbert, previously the top executive at Boeing’s services division, took the reins of Boeing Defense, Space and Security (BDS) in 2022, a period when the defense company was ailing from pandemic-induced supply chain and labor woes as well as billions in reach-forward losses on programs like the KC-46 tanker, MQ-25 tanker drone and Air Force One replacement. During the company’s commercial heyday, Boeing aggressively bid for those programs under fixed-price contract deals that force the company to pay for any overruns above a certain threshold, knowing that financial losses could materialize during the early phases of development, but gambling future production returns would offset those losses. But when the pandemic and 737 MAX crisis in the 2019-2022 timeframe crippled Boeing's usually lucrative commercial airplanes business, losses on the defense side could not be hidden amid the company's jetliner sales. Colbert — though not responsible for helming those defense deals—was charged with cleaning up the financial mess at BDS, tapping Parker as his No. 2 to help stabilize the division. Colbert publicly vowed that BDS would no longer bid on fixed price development programs or to take potentially-harmful contract terms. The company pulled out of a competition to build a replacement for the E-4B Doomsday Plane last year for those reasons. Despite BDS absorbing $4.4 billion in losses in 2022 — a move meant to reset fixed-price programs to be healthier going forward — the defense division took about $1.6 billion in losses on its fixed-price portfolio in 2023 and has logged more than $1 billion in charges over the first half of 2024. 'We just have to slog through,' Colbert told reporters in July. Colbert’s departure follows that of much of the company’s top leadership this year — including former Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun and the head of its commercial planes unit Stan Deal — due to a safety and production crisis on the commercial side of the company. It also comes as the firm is in the early days of a labor strike at its Seattle facilities, which is expected to impact deliveries of KC-46 and P-8 military aircraft.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/boeing-defense-chief-ted-colbert-pushed-out/	2024-09-20T14:43:31-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/06/boeing_colbert-scaled-e1687095452672.jpg
Singapore, US Defense Innovation Unit collab to tackle ‘unauthorized drones’ in Indo-Pacific	Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III speaks with Singapore Minister for Defense Ng Eng Hen prior to a bilateral exchange at the Pentagon, Washington, D.C., July 15, 2024. (DoD photo by U.S. Navy Petty Officer 1st Class Alexander Kubitza) 'We are proud to contribute to the strategically important effort to deepen bilateral cooperation with Singapore in support of a free and open Indo-Pacific and look forward to working with our Singaporean partners to deliver concrete solutions that address the pressing security challenge of unauthorized drones, as well as critical support for humanitarian assistance and disaster relief,' DIU Director Doug Beck said in a Thursday press release. 'We are eager to see what the international innovation base — starting with the great technology in Singapore and the US — delivers in support of these important missions.' Not just any company can participate in this challenge though; companies have to be characterized as an early-mid-stage company or a non-traditional company, according to the press release. Additionally, the companies either have to be US-owned and -operated, from a NATO country, from the Five Eyes Alliance, part of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. This is the first official collaboration between the DIU and Singapore to come out of a Memorandum of Understanding for Defense Cooperation, according to the press release. The memorandum was signed at the end of May by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Singaporean Minister for Defence Ng Eng He based on the agreement that both nations would dedicate resources to shipboard counter-unmanned aircraft systems and electromagnetic interference resilience. The May agreement preceded another signed in July between the two nations to boost their artificial intelligence ties. However, that agreement came mere days after Singapore signed a similar agreement on civilian artificial intelligence with China. Related: US-Singapore boost artificial intelligence ties, after small nation made earlier agreement with China 'The agreement [with the US] is a next step in Singapore-US security cooperation, and supports the relationship in addressing an evolving issue of common concern,' Ian Chong, associate professor at the National University of Singapore and an expert on the Chinese military, told Breaking Defense in July following the AI agreement. 'Singapore, however, will have to somehow deconflict cooperation with the United States with the digital and cyber cooperation programs it also has with the PRC.' Regarding the new DIU-Singapore initiative, companies have until Oct. 30 to participate in the challenge, and, according to the press release, the winner will receive part of the $300,000 prize pool.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/singapore-us-defense-innovation-unit-collab-to-tackle-unauthorized-drones-in-indo-pacific/	2024-09-20T12:35:23-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/singapore-us-eng-austin-scaled-e1726859265132.jpg
Protest stalls Army $990M loitering munitions contract	AeroVironment’s Switchblade 600 bares its teeth at Sea Air Space. The loitering munition has gotten real-world practice during the Ukraine conflict, as a number of the weapons have been sent from the US to Kyiv. (Aaron Mehta/Breaking Defense) WASHINGTON — A US Army contract award to AeroVironment for $990 million-worth of Switchblade loitering munitions is on pause following a protest filed by Mistral Inc. The protest, which was revealed by AeroVironment in an SEC filling earlier this week, has resulted in the Army filing a stop work order, meaning that production on the order has to halt while the Government Accountability Office (GAO) reviews the case and makes a ruling. According to a GAO docket, the protest was filed Sept. 6. Defense One first reported on the filling. The GAO is expected to rule by Dec. 16, per the filling. If the GAO denies the protest, work will continue as expected; if it sustains the protest, it could force the Army to re-open a competition for the program, formally the directed requirement for Lethal Unmanned Systems (LUS), which was awarded on Aug. 28. AeroVironment has had a successful run of contracts with Switchblade, which comes in two variants, over the last calendar year. In Oct. 2023, the Army announced it was buying a small tranche of the Switchblade 600. Then in May, the program made headlines when it became the first publicly announced winner of a contract from the Replicator program, while the weapon has also seen action in Ukraine. Days after the Replicator announcement AeroVironment CEO Wahid Nawabi told Breaking Defense that the company is expanding production given the expected growth demand. Although not a household name, the Bethesda, Md.,-based Mistral has won at least one contract from DoD this year: a May 17 order from US Special Operations Command with a maximum value of $73.5 million for its GOLAM II loitering munitions. A spokesperson for AeroVironment could not be immediately reached. Voicemails left at Mistral's office and a note sent via its website were not returned by press time.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/protest-stalls-army-990m-loitering-munitions-contract/	2024-09-20T12:13:25-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/04/230405_SAS_underwater_drone_Mehta_crop.png
Secrets don’t make friends: Space Force making strides on allied info sharing, Canadian general says	Vice President Kamala Harris greets Canadian Armed Forces Brig. Gen. Kyle Paul, Space Operations Command then deputy commanding general, transformation, at Peterson Space Force Base, Colorado, May 29, 2024. (US Space Force photo by Staff Sgt. Natalie Rubenak) AMOS 2024 — While challenges remain, the Space Force has made visible progress in recent months in hurdling classification barriers that traditionally have blocked real-world integration of US and allied operations, according to the senior allied officer embedded with Space Operations Command (SpOC). Canada's Brig. Gen. Kyle Paul, who serves as SpOC deputy commander for operations, plans, training and force development (S3/5/7), said on Wednesday that top Space Force leaders are actively pushing for reducing classification levels, and that is showing results. 'I'm now working on my 13th year being integrated with either the [US Air Force] or the Space Force. So, I've seen it evolve over time, from when I was a captain all the way now being a general officer. I am optimistic with now we have strategic level leadership that are driving and mandating that we look at this deliberately,' he told Breaking Defense on the margins of the annual Advanced Maui Optical and Space Surveillance Technologies Conference (AMOS). US officials have publicly warned in recent years that overly onerous classification has delayed or stymied US outreach to allies, preventing the kind of rapid and robust information sharing they say would be critical in the event of a major conflict. The Defense Department's Office of Space Policy in January finalized a rewrite of classification policy that, while not opening much new information to the general public, called for a reduction in the use of Special Access Programs (SAPs) that dramatically limit clearances to handful of senior US officials, and a review of current SAPs to establish whether they could be downgraded to Top Secret or Secret. The policy also calls for minimizing other classification levels, such as Not Releasable to Foreign Nationals (NOFORN), that prevents sharing with non-US citizens, whenever and wherever possible. Paul said that another factor spurring measures to allow more information sharing and better work integration has been an uptick in foreign officers serving with the Space Force. 'I think the fact that we have allied leadership in certain key positions is actually a forcing function to be able to declassify information and ensure that I have what I need to be able to make decisions and advise the commander within headquarters, Space Operations Command,' he added. 'I've heard from our Five Eyes — so, Three Eyes I guess — [partners] on some of the challenges that they've had to be able to integrate their people at the tactical level, and that falls on my shoulders, to be able to push.' (Five Eyes refers to the tight intelligence-sharing relationship between the US, the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand; Paul is referring here to fellow non-US officers from the UK, Australia and New Zealand.) For example, Paul explained, one area of low hanging fruit has been simply looking at how physical spaces and 'secure areas' are set up so as to encourage the widest areas of co-location for combined operations. 'How do we look at configuration challenges, accesses just within a certain area where not everything is classified NOFORN? And so, what if we were to take those entities that are considered to be US-only and put them in a configuration within a physical space where it can be US-only, and still have access for the larger group to be able to operate and integrate. We can do that that. That doesn't hurt my head,' he said. Paul said SpOC already is 'taking steps in that direction' at the 'strategic level in terms of intent,' and is now trying to adapt the concept at the tactical level — 'and actually we're showing some promise to that over the last three months.' He further noted that rather than being a problem, technology now is helping the Space Force to find 'opportunities' to enable wider information sharing through the ability to 'compartmentalize' data within computer systems — rather than having systems and networks that are restricted to foreign or lower-level security level personnel. 'As long as we tag that data, we can pull it appropriately with your credentials that you own, per the individual. And that has been a real step forward that I've seen in the technology area,' Paul said. 'f I have a different credential, I can log into that system, and I can pull the information that only I'm allowed to see. It's no longer a barrier.' That said, Paul acknowledged that there are still challenges with regard to access to US computer networks and data, with regard to federating and expanding networks. For example, he said, one issue is how can the Space Force allow foreign nationals to be able to leverage data from their home stations rather than be forced to travel to the US on temporary duty to do so? 'And I think once we get there — and there is a deliberate effort to do that — it also sends a message of strategic deterrence. Because now we federated that mission, we've no longer got a strategic target on each geographical location, right? You can take out any one of them, and we're still going to operate,' he said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/secrets-dont-make-friends-space-force-making-strides-on-allied-info-sharing-canadian-general-says/	2024-09-20T11:50:42-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/240920_canadian_space_paul_harris_8452321-scaled-e1726846995712.jpg
Exploding pagers, major strike: Israel turns its war aims north in ‘new phase’	Chief of the General Staff of the Israel Defense Forces Herzi Halevi (2nd L) meets with the Commanding Officer of the Northern Command, Major General Ori Gordin (L) in Israel, on September 20, 2024. (Photo by Israel Defense Forces (IDF)/Anadolu via Getty Images) JERUSALEM — Four days in September have transformed Israel’s northern front with Hezbollah. For 11 months since Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack, the Israel Defense Forces and the Lebanese group have traded strikes, a slow drumbeat of occasionally deadly violence that has terrorized locals on both sides of the border but largely played out in the background of Israel’s offensive in Gaza. But then this week Israel is believed to have executed an unprecedented bombing attack against Hezbollah using hundreds of boobytrapped pagers, with walkie-talkies exploding the day after that, killing several people. And today the IDF said it killed a top Hezbollah commander — along with more than a dozen of others in senior command. 'I can now confirm that Ibrahim Aqil was eliminated together with other senior terrorists in Hezbollah’s Radwan Forces,' IDF Spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said in a statement. In the meantime Hezbollah launched 120 rockets and missiles towards Israel today, according to the IDF, after killing two Israeli soldiers in barrages earlier this week. Though the pager operation happened three days ago, a formal change in Israel’s strategy can be traced to a day before that on Monday, especially in retrospect, when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant held separate meetings with US special envoy Amos Hochstein, during which both emphasized that Israel was intent on altering the situation on the northern front. (US officials said the Israelis warned US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin the same day as the pager operation that Israel was going to take some kind of military action, but wasn’t given details, according to The Associated Press.) The new focus on the north comes with an official new war goal: the return and safeguarding of Israelis who had evacuated the north. Today Gallant repeated his prior description of the current fighting as a 'new phase.' 'In the new phase of the war there are significant opportunities but also significant risks. Hezbollah feels persecuted. The sequence of our military actions will continue,' he said. As military operations continue in Gaza and the West Bank, the overall posture of the Israeli military appears to have shifted north. Israel has shifted its 98th Division, which contains the Commando and Paratroop Brigade, to the north. This is a key division that played a major role in Gaza fighting between November 2023 and July 2024. It is joining a number of IDF divisions already deployed there. But beyond the new war goal, Israeli leadership has not detailed exactly how it plans to ensure Hezbollah does not threaten citizens in the north — and Hezbollah has vowed to respond to the pager attack. (A French official told Breaking Defense this summer that Paris would support a deployment of Lebanese military forces to the south, though developments since then, especially this week’s, are likely to have changed the calculus on what was already a preliminary idea.) Whatever the plan, today US President Joe Biden said the US, too, is working on a strategy to allow Israeli citizens to return to their homes, and for Lebanese citizens in southern Lebanon to do the same. 🚨President Biden said at the top of the cabinet meeting that he is working on a solution that will allow civilians in Northern Israel and Southern Lebanon to go back to their homes. He said the secretary of state, secretary of defense and the intelligence community are working… &mdash; Barak Ravid (@BarakRavid) September 20, 2024	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/exploding-pagers-major-strike-israel-turns-its-war-aims-north-in-new-phase/	2024-09-20T10:58:14-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/240920_israeli_commander_north_GettyImages-2172407139-e1726854515144.jpg
Sixth-generation fighter at F-35 costs? ‘That’s not going to happen,’ industry predicts.	A Boeing rendering of a next-gen fighter. (Boeing photo) AFA 2024 — As the US Air Force reassesses its plans for a sixth-generation fighter jet, its top civilian said the service wants to get the price per plane down to F-35 levels, about a third of what it originally projected it would pay. The problem, analysts and defense industry officials told Breaking Defense, is that it may not be realistic or even possible without a complete reimagining of how fighters and drones will fight together in the future. While the Air Force has yet to set a final unit cost target for a manned Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) fighter, Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall said the F-35 represents the 'upper bounds' of what the service wants to pay per aircraft, adding that the F-15EX is 'roughly' in the same price category. 'I'd like to go lower, though,' he told reporters this week at the Air and Space Force Association’s air space and cyber conference. 'Once you start integrating CCAs [Combat Collaborative Aircraft] and transferring some mission equipment and capabilities functions to the CCAs, then you can talk about a different concept, potentially, for the crewed fighter that's controlling them. So there's a real range in there.' For those in industry, Kendall’s comments represent a major break from the Air Force’s original vision for a manned NGAD fighter. 'That’s not going to happen,' one defense industry official told Breaking Defense, adding that there are 'distinct differences' in design parameters, materials and fleet sizes that drive higher costs for a sixth-generation fighter versus older, more prolific jets like the F-35 and F-15. Currently, unit costs for the Lockheed Martin F-35 ranges from about $80 million to $100 million per copy, depending on the variant, while the flyaway cost of a F-15EX is about $90 million. Conversely, Kendall originally estimated unit prices for NGAD would be about $300 million per copy. If the Air Force wants to field an optionally-crewed sixth-generation fighter jet at a price around that of an F-35 or F-15EX, the only plausible option is by taking out most of the aircraft’s key mission systems — things like radar, other sensors and datalinks — and putting them into the CCAs that will fly near the jet, said a second industry official. That would allow the service to focus on optimizing the range, improved stealth and aerodynamic performance of the sixth-generation fighter, but would have a few major downsides, the official said. First, there is a 'pretty significant' expense associated with all of those attributes, even if costs can be cut by segregating the NGAD fighter’s mission systems, the official said. And because the fighter will be reliant on those CCAs for mission capability, those drones may also need to have a similar level of stealth and range, potentially increasing CCA unit costs as well. Potentially even more important, that concept would make the NGAD pilot much more dependent on the survival of the CCAs hosting critically needed subsystems like datalinks and electronic warfare systems, as taking down those drones could erode the fighter jet’s own chance of completing the mission and making it home. In essence, offloading systems from the fighter to CCAs means the two have to be seen as one inseparable package – one which comes with potentially greater risk for the mission and possibly greater cost overall, as CCA prices could swell as a result. 'It's natural to want a Rolls-Royce for the target price of a Cadillac,' said Jeremiah Gertler, senior analyst at the Teal Group. 'The question is whether you get either of those, or wind up with Frankencar.' While aerospace companies are not permitted to confirm their involvement in the ultra-secretive NGAD program, Breaking Defense understands that Lockheed Martin and Boeing were vying for the NGAD contract before the Air Force hit pause on the program this summer. (Northrop Grumman CEO Kathy Warden acknowledged last year that Northrop no longer planned to compete for NGAD, though she has since said the company could reassess that decision depending how the Air Force rescopes the competition.) RELATED: As Air Force deliberates sixth-gen fighter plans, much is at stake for Boeing Asked about Kendall’s comments, Lockheed said its Skunk Works advanced development is adept at delivering both innovative and cost-effective solutions to meet urgent national security requirements. 'As we learn more about the requirements for NGAD, we’ll assess what it will take to meet the need,' the company said in a statement. Boeing declined to comment. Northrop did not respond to a request for comment. Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst with AeroDynamic Advisories, said the focus on the cost-element of Kendall’s comments is burying the more significant acknowledgement from the Air Force — that it no longer needs a 'super fighter' like NGAD and is more interested in disaggregating capabilities and networking them together. Which raises the question about whether it needs a manned fighter altogether if it can just put those capabilities into drones, said Aboulafia, who joked that the Air Force may be 'quiet quitting' the NGAD program. 'The idea of backing away from a next-gen super fighter is just anathema to the service’s DNA,' Aboulafia said. 'There's no doubt about its utility in all military scenarios… it's the formula that's always worked. No drawback at all, except, oh Jesus, it costs $300 million. And we don't want to spend that because you'll never get the mass you need.' While it was 'always the plan' to offload some NGAD mission requirements to CCAs, 'it's possible that the Air Force has learned that more is possible than its earlier assessments,' Byron Callan said in a note to investors on Tuesday. Callan added that the emphasis on lower cost hints that the reworked concept for NGAD will have to be easier to produce and upgrade than an F-35, another potential challenge. Assuming that the Air Force actually can get the price down to what Kendall wants, Callan noted there could be one significant benefit: lowering the price per unit significantly, and offboarding some of the most sensitive and presumably export-controlled systems, would potentially open the door for the Air Force to position it for foreign sales. Previously, experts told Breaking Defense that the $300 million price point for NGAD was totally unaffordable for export customers. While the Air Force has never indicated it would be willing to sell NGAD to allies and partners, if its price dropped to about $100 million, the sixth-generation jet would be on an equal playing field as the F-35, which hasn't lost an fighter competition so far. (Currently, there are two sixth-generation fighters in development by American allies, one by a Franco-German team and one by the UK, Italy and Japan.)

(Photo by ZAID AL-OBEIDI/AFP via Getty Images) BEIRUT — As Iraqi and US officials negotiate the details of the withdrawal of US forces from the region, Baghad could soon get some air defense reassurance courtesy of a new reported $2.8 billion deal to buy South Korean missile systems. Iraq's Ministry of Defense announced Thursday that it signed a contract with a South Korean company to procure a number of advanced medium-range batteries, 'which will support the capabilities of the Iraqi armed forces and military forces to maintain peace and Iraq’s sovereignty.' In the ministry statement Iraq's defense chief said he considered the deal a 'qualitative strategic breakthrough for [the country’s] air defense as it covers all Iraqi airspace and achieves the regional balance of the country.' The Iraqi statement didn't reveal specifics, but South Korean and international press have since reported that South Korea's LIG Nex1 defense firm said it will provide the Cheongung-II air defense system for $2.8 billion. RELATED: How South Korea's defense industry transformed itself into a global player The deal comes as Iraqi armed forces are conducting counter-terrorism operations, mainly against ISIS, and as they've seen armed drone attacks against coalition bases, blamed on Iran-backed militias. With Iraq's purchase, LIG Nex1 has secured its third export deal for the Cheongung-II system — all three Arab countries: the United Arab Emirates, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and now Iraq. South Korean news outlet Yonhap described the system as designed to intercept missiles and aircraft, with an effect range of 40 kilometers against targets up to 15 kilometers in the sky. (In South Korea, the Cheongung-II reportedly operates as the middle layer in a three-layered system with US-made Patriots handling lower tier threats and THAAD handling the upper tiers.) LIG Nex1 is expected to manufacture the missile and integrated system, Hanwha Systems will supply the radar, and Hanwha Aerospace will supply the launchers and vehicles, according to Yonhap. The purchase comes after Iraqi officials have said they have negotiated with the US for an extensive drawdown of foreign troops, a move that experts say is bound to test the Iraqi military's ability to maintain security in the country.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/iraq-boosts-air-defenses-with-reported-2-8b-deal-for-south-korean-cheongung-ii/	2024-09-20T08:42:36-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/240920_iraq_soldier_GettyImages-2171594553-e1726843185359.jpg
B-21, Columbia-class among programs hit under longterm CR, military leaders warn	The B-21 Raider continues to progress in ground testing with the commencement of engine runs at Northrop Grumman’s facilities in Palmdale, Calif. (Photo Credit: Northrop Grumman) WASHINGTON — Increased production of munitions, initial fielding of the B-21 stealth bomber and Columbia-class submarine construction could all be jeopardized by a long-term continuing resolution in fiscal 2025, according to a parade of top Pentagon officials. Congress has about a week to pass a stopgap funding bill by the end of Sept. 30, when FY24 ends and government money runs out. However, after the House rejected a plan by House Speaker Mike Johnson that would have provided federal agencies a bridge until March, House and Senate leaders are scrambling to hammer out a last minute deal. Johnson’s continuing resolution was soundly rebuffed by Democrats, who objected to his addition of the right-leaning SAVE Act to the bill. It was also opposed by more than a dozen Republicans on fiscal grounds or due to concerns that a six-month CR could harm national defense. On Thursday, The Hill reported that Johnson could release a new CR proposal as early as Sunday. 'The aim here is to be pretty minimal, as close to a clean CR as we can do,' House Appropriations Committee Chairman Tom Cole said, according to the report. Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Thursday took procedural steps that would allow the upper chamber to advance its own version of a CR, despite the precedent that spending bills first move through the House. RELATED: Harris administration's Pentagon should focus on defense innovation, top HASC Dem says The Pentagon’s ability to execute its strategy — including its deterrence of China — hinges on getting the funds it needs for innovation and modernization, 'which cannot happen under a CR,' wrote Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in a Sept. 7 letter to Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee. 'Asking the Department to compete with the [People’s Republic of China], let alone manage conflicts in Europe and the Middle East, while under a lengthy CR, ties our hands behind our back while expecting us to be agile and to accelerate progress,' he said. 'We cannot buy back this time, but we can stop digging the hole.' In particular, Austin warned that a six-month CR would leave Congress with little time before an April 30 deadline, when across-the-board sequestration cuts will go into effect unless lawmakers have passed full-year appropriations bills. Austin’s letter to has since been followed by several others by defense leaders, urging Congress to keep a CR short and pass an annual defense appropriations bill as soon as possible. Here’s what officials are concerned about: Army Secretary Christine Wormuth sent lawmakers a letter Wednesday warning that a six-month CR would have 'significant consequences' on the service’s ability to 'maintain national security' and the quality of life for soldiers and their families. 'The Army’s inability to start new programs or realign funds to match emerging needs would reduce our purchasing power and create meaningful costs as well as schedule risk to Army program,' Wormuth continued. More specifically, she said that up to $8.2 billion in 'critical investments' for recruiting, training and weapons development would be delayed, and a subsequent letter said that under a six-month CR, 13 new start procurement programs and three development increases would be delayed. A six-month CR would also impact two planned production rate increases and eight military construction projects When it comes to air and missile defense, for example, that half-year CR would postpone a $403 million award for a Patriot intercept order, and delay development of the Integrated Battle Command System. Plans to buy two new Company-Level Small Uncrewed Aircraft Systems would be halted, while Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) production would be delayed because the service would not move ahead acquiring long-led items like solid rocket motors and guidance kits. For the Department of the Air Force, which encompasses both the Air Force and Space Force, Secretary Frank Kendall warned that a six-month CR would harm personnel. For example, Kendall said a CR would adversely affect basic pay, housing and other routine payments service members need. A prolonged budget impasse would additionally stall efforts to implement recommendations on sexual assault and suicide prevention and response from the Pentagon’s Independent Review Commission, as well as reduce aircraft mission capable rates and aircrew readiness, he added. Modernization projects from both services would also be hampered, Kendall said. For the Air Force, that could mean 'prevent[ing] production increases' of key munitions like the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile-Extended Range (JASSM-ER), Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM) and the service’s new Stand-In Attack Weapon (SiAW). Initial operational capability for the Air Force's B-21 Raider would additionally be delayed, according to Kendall, and there would be impacts to other programs like the recapitalization of the nation’s nuclear ballistic missiles. The Space Force would similarly see development of 'launch and range test system software' halted, Kendall said. And if the CR dragged on for a year, the secretary said his 'operational imperatives' would take a hit, such as efforts to shift tracking capabilities to space. Other high-profile programs to field new space systems like modernized GPS and missile warning/missile tracking would also suffer setbacks, according to Kendall. Writing for the Navy and Marine Corps, Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro said a prolonged CR could delay construction of Virginia-class attack submarines and Columbia-class ballistic missile submarines, as well as inhibit investments needed for the submarine industrial base. The Navy would also not be able to award a contract for a new medium landing ship. A six-month CR would have 'profound' impacts on the Marine Corps' force design efforts, 'slowing key acquisition programs,' Del Toro wrote. For instance, increased procurement of the CH-53K helicopter, amphibious combat vehicle and joint light tactical vehicle would be limited by a CR. In her own letter, Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Lisa Franchetti asserted a six-month CR 'would cause profound, damaging impact' to the service and 'impos[e] unnecessary hardship on our Sailors, civilians and their families,' including the elimination of most new bonus awards. The CR could also impact maintenance of the aircraft carrier Harry S. Truman (CVN-75) and impede the service’s marquee hypersonic weapon program, she wrote.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/b-21-columbia-class-among-programs-hit-under-longterm-cr-military-leaders-warn/	2024-09-20T07:35:09-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/09/b21-northrop-scaled.jpeg
Lasers on ships by 2030: Rheinmetall and MBDA launch joint bid	Germany's Rheinmetall and MBDA have unveiled plans for joint development of a naval based laser weapon (Rheinmetall) BELFAST — Germany’s Rheinmetall and European missile firm MBDA announced a laser weapons cooperation agreement today, in a bid to jointly develop a maritime-based system and bring it to market 'within the next five to six years.' Rheinmetall provided the timeline in a company statement and added that the future solution 'opens up new possibilities, particularly in relation to drone defence on ships.' Both industry partners, 'are convinced that their complementary skills in the field of laser weapon technology will enable them to successfully develop a military laser weapon system,' said Rheinmetall. The cooperation agreement builds off steps taken by both parties in September 2023 to set 'prerequisites' for the development of a 'first laser weapon,' including a commitment to make 'internal preparations' for the new platform’s development phase. The companies have previously teamed for a demonstration onboard the German navy's F124 air defense Sachsen frigate, which fired over 100 test shots. The demonstrator delivered on 'all aspects' of 'combat effectiveness' ranging from, 'detection and tracking…the interplay of sensors, command and weapon engagement systems and effectors; possible rules of engagement,' through to target engagement, according to Rheinmetall. Laser weapons are considered a cost effective alternative to naval based missiles being expended to shootdown cheap drones, with the UK’s in development DragonFire high energy laser, for example, said to cost £10 ($13) a shot. There are obvious applications for that given what is happening in the Red Sea over the last year, where US ships are using expensive rounds to take down small cruise missiles or drones. Though the promise offered by laser weapons is clear, they typically have long research and development phases, largely because of design challenges involving beam stability and power sustainment, both of which are critical to stay on target and destroy it. There's a reason there's an old joke in defense circles that 'lasers are the weapon of the future, and always will be.' US Navy Rear Adm. Fred Pyle, Director of the Surface Warfare Division, or N96, and responsible for managing the service’s laser technology weapon efforts, said in January that the US Navy and industry should be more 'intellectually honest' with one another about capabilities of laser systems. He also criticized a 'tendency to over promise and under deliver.' Still, there is a growing sense that lasers are becoming real utility, particularly for missile defense. For instance, Israel’s Rafael, manufacturer of the 100kW class Iron Beam ground-based laser air defense system, told Breaking Defense in March that the new system is expected to be fielded 'by the end of 2025.' The company claims, there is 'almost zero cost per interception' when employing the high energy solution, which is also said to be capable of destroying a 'wide array of threats from a range of hundreds of meters to several kilometers.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/lasers-on-ships-by-2030-rheinmetall-and-mbda-launch-joint-bid/	2024-09-20T06:55:55-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/Foto-Credit_Miroslav-Gyurosi-2-scaled-e1726836535955.jpg
Debris and a deadly mission: The vital context around Ukraine’s lost F-16	The rite of burial of Ukrainian F-16 pilot Oleksiy Mes, on the Day of Remembrance for Fallen Heroes, as hundreds attended a farewell ceremony for the deceased tactical aviation pilot in the central square of the city on August 29, 2024 in Shepetivka, in Khmelnytskyi Oblast (province) Ukraine. Oleksiy Mes, an F-16 pilot, died on August 26 as a result of an air crash during one of the largest massive missile attacks on Ukraine. On that day, Oleksiy reportedly shot down three enemy missiles and one UAV. (Libkos/Getty Images) FT. LAUDERDALE, Fla. — When Ukraine’s first F-16s finally arrived in country at the start of August, it was cause for much celebration by Kyiv’s supporters. And so the loss of one of those F-16s just weeks later hit especially hard, and immediately launched questions about what went wrong. Some questioned whether the pilots were rushed through training. Others wondered if the crash showed that the F-16 wasn’t even fit for Ukraine’s mission. Meanwhile, the families and friends of Col. Oleksiy 'Moonfish' Mes, the jet’s pilot who had travelled to the US previously to meet with members of Congress and encourage them to send F-16s to Kyiv’s defense, were left to mourn the loss. Information has been locked down about the incident, given its high-profile nature for the Zelneskyy government. The loss of an F-16 so soon after having received them means the issue is 'doubly sensitive, if not more so, and no one is talking officially,' according to one high-ranking defense industry executive. But some details of the incident have come out, and sources have helped fill in some gaps for Breaking Defense, including around the theory that the loss was the result of shrapnel that hit the plane. With it comes a picture of an incredibly dangerous mission where the loss of jets may have been more a question of when, not if — a deadly reality that, Ukrainian experts say, is being exacerbated by the patchwork of capabilities Kyiv has been forced to use in its defense. First, some context. Moonfish’s mission, according to several sources and public reports, was to operate alongside other F-16s, in conjunction with US-made Patriot and other air defense batteries on the ground. The assignment was to take down missiles and drones being fired by the Russians against targets in Ukraine. It’s important to understand how complex that operating environment is. In Aug. 2022, Breaking Defense talked with several pilots and officers from the Ukrainian air force (PSU) who explained how the fleet of aging MiGs and Sukhois have been performing the air defense mission. They recalled successfully shooting down incoming Russian cruise missiles with the Russian-designed, semi-active air-to-air missiles originally designed to be fired from these aircraft. But, they said, the mission was by its nature a hazardous one. 'You have a split-second, if that much time, to decide to lock on and fire one of the air-to-air weapons against these incoming missiles,' said one of the pilots. 'They are coming at high speeds, and they have to be intercepted before they have passed you. Catching them in a tail chase is not possible in many cases.' In these same meetings the PSU discussed how they specifically needed the F-16 for this mission. The American-made jet comes with more agile flight controls, better radars and fire-and-forget weapons that would in theory be more effective against the Kh-32 and other long-range cruise missiles being launched against targets in Ukraine. On the night that Moonfish was lost, he and his squadron were apparently engaged in precisely this kind of operation. According to a statement by the Ukraine General Staff 'during the aerial battle, the F-16 aircraft demonstrated their high efficiency, four enemy cruise missiles were shot down by airborne weapons.' What happened next, according to the statement, was 'during the approach to the next target, contact with one of the aircraft was lost. As it turned out later, the plane crashed, the pilot died.'

(Ukrainian Presidency/Handout/Anadolu via Getty Images) However, the jets are only part of the complex operational sphere. Ukrainian defense industry specialists, who are closely intertwined with the military and support both the air defense units and F-16s, told Breaking Defense that these missile intercept missions involving fighter aircraft and air defense batteries operating jointly require precision coordination. Complicating this coordination, multiple sources said, is the fact that neither the PSU fighters nor the air defense units on the ground are using IFF in these engagements. In the beginning of the war, confusion about IFF with both the Russian and Ukraine sides operating some of the same aircraft presented concerns about mistaking one side’s aircraft for another. This practice of not utilizing IFF has been continued with the F-16s now in service. (The MoD and PSU did not return requests for comment on the use of IFF by press time.) This caused several industry and military sources — and even a member of the Ukraine parliament — to claim the F-16 was a victim of friendly fire. A PSU representative, speaking to multiple outlets, later stated, 'different versions [of the crash] are being considered, including the ‘friendly fire’ of their air defence systems, a technical malfunction and pilot error.' (That doesn’t rule out friendly fire, but stops well short of confirming it; a final answer is likely to only come out following a thorough review.) One scenario floating among the Ukrainian defense community is that the F-16 flew inadvertently through a cloud of debris created by the successful intercept and destruction of one of the incoming Russian missiles. These fragments of the destroyed missile may have caused damage to the engine and other parts of the aircraft, causing the F-16 to break apart and/or the death of the pilot before he could eject. This version is emerging as one of the more plausible scenarios, due to past precedence, as one of the same industry executives told Breaking Defense that 'earlier in the war we lost four other fighters to this same cause of airborne foreign objects disabling the aircraft.' 'There were two MiG-29s and two Sukhoi models lost in this way,' he continued. 'It is very possible that this F-16 now makes it aircraft No. 5. The previous losses did not generate this kind of attention because they were not expensive, modern fighters in the class of the American jet.' Normally, Ukraine gives clear descriptions of what caused jets to be lost, but there are a handful of incidents where the descriptor given is vague and fit what the industry executive described, including the loss of Mig-29s on March 13, 2022 and Oct. 12, 2022, a Su-24 on May 19, 2022, and two Su-27s on June 5, 2022 and March 28, 2023, respectively. Neither the PSU or MOD responded to a request for comment on this claim. The only way to ensure that a similar tragedy does not occur again, said one military officer, 'is to provide us with the additional air defence assets we have been asking to be given for more than two years. 'Until the ground-based air defence network is extensive and redundant enough on its own we will have to keep using fighter jets to protect our cities, our people, our power plants, our hospitals, etc. from Russian missile strikes. It is a dangerous mission, and I fear more aircraft will be lost in this same tragic manner.'

(Vitalii Nosach/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images) Supporters of Kyiv have complained about how long the US has taken to train Ukrainian pilots, while the US has in turn emphasized the dangers of rushing pilot training. Moonfish’s death immediately reignited that back and forth, despite the ongoing lack of clarity on what happened in the air that day. Certainly, there are numerous differences in its overall design of the F-16 compared to the Mikoyan MiG-29s and Sukhoi Su-27s that have been the mainstay of the PSU fighter force. These represent 'challenging hurdles that have to be overcome in the course of a training regime,' said a NATO member-nation test pilot who spoke to Breaking Defense in response to the event. Some of the more significant among these are: Despite these difficulties, however, the record to date was that the Ukrainian pilots had acquitted themselves well in learning to operate the F-16, and despite regular sorties in the month since Moonfish’s death, there have been no reports of pilot difficulties. An unnamed source who spoke to CNN and other media stated, 'the Ukraine Armed Forces do not believe pilot error was behind the incident.' The lack of experience with the F-16 could certainly have contributed in a situation where the pilot, unused to the intricacies of flying the American-jet, was unable to react as he would have with another jet. But the reality is the answers may never be found as to what role, if any, the speed of training had on the mission’s deadly outcome. Speaking this week at the annual Air and Space Forces Association conference outside Washington, Gen. James Hecker, the head of US Air Forces in Europe, said that 'As far as the aircraft accident with the F-16 and unfortunately losing a pilot, there's an ongoing investigation that Ukraine is conducting. We've offered our help in that investigation. We'll see if they take us up on that offer. 'But anything that comes out of that, and any preliminary things that we're taking a look at to develop into training, both in Denmark as well as the US, to see if there's any changes that we need to make to the training to make sure that this doesn't happen again.'

(Photo by Vitalii Nosach/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images) If there has to be a top-level 'lesson learned' from this loss, it may be that integrating a new platform into a military that is engaged in a high-intensity conflict needs to be understood as a gradual process. There are specific examples in the past of post-Soviet militaries operating both western and Russian-designed fighter aircraft, but where they differ from the Ukrainian approach is that those air forces tend to employ those new aircraft in complementary, but distinctly different, missions. Most new F-16 users would not want to immediately put the aircraft into a role that has been filled for more than two years by the MiG-29 and Sukhoi models, as the PSU did when it put the F-16 aircraft into a missile-hunting assignment. More broadly, the situation also serves as a reminder that the F-16s are not a cure-all for the ongoing conflict. But this downing also doesn’t mean the F-16 is a failure. Speaking at an event in July, Hecker stated that it would be unrealistic to expect the F-16s to have an immediate and dramatic impact in the air power dimension of the war. 'It’s not going to be the … golden bullet, that all of a sudden, they have F-16s, and now they’re going to go out and gain air superiority,' he said. What will make a difference in the long run, he explained, is the ability to more effectively employ US air-launched weapons. Up to now the PSU has been 'dropping them off MiG-29s and Su-24s. Now they’re going to have the opportunity to actually drop them off of an airplane that they were designed to come off of, which will give them more capability to change the targets in flight and things like that.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/debris-and-a-deadly-mission-the-vital-context-around-ukraines-lost-f-16/	2024-09-20T06:12:30-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/ukraine-pilot-f16-funeral-scaled-e1726836593725.jpg
EXLUSIVE: Pentagon making ‘significant push’ for money to upgrade Satellite Control Network	BlueHalo's deployable ground system, based on a multi-band phased array antenna design, will replace the Satellite Control Network's old parabolic dish antennas. (BlueHalo) AMOS 2024 — Military commanders and Pentagon officials are pushing for extra funds to speed up the Space Rapid Capabilities Office's Satellite Communications Augmentation Resource (SCAR) program to field modernized antennas for the antiquated Satellite Control Network (SCN), according to Space RCO Director Kelly Hammett. 'There is a significant push for more [funding] currently in discussion with the Congress, with CAPE [Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation office], with others,' he told Breaking Defense on Tuesday on the margins of the annual Advanced Maui Optical and Space Surveillance Technologies (AMOS) conference. Hammet said that though the SCAR program has been in the works for a couple of years, it is being seen as more urgent for keeping satellite communications flowing as top brass have begun to worry more about possible great power conflict with China and/or Russia. 'In the last six months, the importance of SCAR to the future comms architecture for space has been significantly elevated. Why? It's recognized that in a time of conflict, the legacy SCN does not have the capacity to be able to see to the necessary assets to fight the fight when when things go from a peacetime footing to a dynamic space operations environment,' he said. 'When we shift to that footing, the necessary cadence of commanding and controlling satellites to move, hide, run, and fight goes up significantly.' 'It's no longer we're pushing SCAR on everybody else,' he said. 'It's like, &#8216;give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, and give to me as fast as you can.' The current system under SCN includes 19 old-style parabolic antennas located at seven locations around the world. and performs control functions consisting of tracking (determining where a satellite is located), telemetry (collecting information about its health and status) and command (transmitting signals to control subsystems and maneuvering satellites if necessary). SCAR would replace those old antennas, which can only connect with one satellite at a time, with modern phased-array antennas that are capable of simultaneously contacting between 18 to 20 satellites. With the Space Force planning to field more and more satellites, that extra capacity is necessary to keep them all flying, according to officers at the 22nd Space Operations Squadron responsible for that mission. 'Parabolic dishes, you know, have a lot of moving parts. You gotta steer them around. You got motors, you got gears, you got all that, and those are typically the things that wear out and break in corrosive environments,' Hammet explained. 'And so with the phased array, you don't have that. You have electronically steerable beams.' Space RCO — created by Congress in the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act as a semi-independent agency to rapidly field capabilities to US Space Command — launched SCAR in May 2022 with an Other Transaction Authority award worth up to $1.4 billion to BlueHalo. The contract covers delivery of up to 12 of the company's BADGER ground system units, which are based on a multi-band, software-defined, phased-array antenna design, by the early 2030s. Already, first deliveries have been 'accelerated,' Hammet said, with two extra units funded in the fiscal 2025 budget request to be deployed in the Indo-Pacific region rather than a single prototype, bringing the total of funded systems up to three. And, he suggested, there might be an appetite for even more units than originally planned. To that potential end, BlueHalo has invested to ensure it can produce more units at a faster pace, Mary Clum, portfolio president and corporate executive vice president, told Breaking Defense. 'We set up the manufacturing line ready to build at a capacity that's greater than the need. So, 20 per year is the capacity. So we're ready to say we can bring that with the dual lines in the factory and the option to scale to a third, if there is more demand signal,' she said. Clum said that BlueHalo at this point could further accelerate deliveries, for example to provide up to six units by around 2028. 'That's the acceleration we're advocating for,' she said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/pentagon-making-significant-push-for-money-to-speed-satellite-control-network-upgrade-effort/	2024-09-20T04:41:22-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/badger-production-floor-scaled.jpg
‘They run on information’: SAIC nabs $229M NORAD, NORTHCOM modernization contract	An 149th Intelligence Squadron airman conducts training in a computer training lab at Mather Field, California Dec. 2, 2023. (Tech. Sgt. Joseph Courtney, 195th Wing) 'The combatant commands like NORAD, NORTHCOM, they run on information. Their ability to have situational awareness with regards to, I'll say current events, as well as emerging threats, and especially with the intensifying challenges we have from an overall national security standpoint up around the Arctic region [where] we're getting tested more and more by China, by Russia,' Executive Vice President of the company's Air Force and Combatant Commands Business Group Vinnie DiFronzo said. 'This is both with regards to testing near our air borders, as well as the evolving cyber threat. 'If we do not secure this properly and make sure that their systems are operating effectively, then their decision-making is going to be degraded,' he said of the commands. 'And you know, overall US national security will be degraded accordingly.' On Wednesday the company announced it had received the $229 million contract as part of the NORAD and NORTHCOM Information Technology Enterprise Services (NITES) program, which is designed to provide the two combatant commands with IT management services, delivery and maintenance. Though the original request for proposal to industry was pretty 'generic,' SAIC executive Vinnie DiFronzo told Breaking Defense, the needs would likely revolve around moving the combatant commands to the cloud and building a more 'resilient' cybersecurity architecture in line with where the Pentagon sees zero trust principles going. DiFronzo added that the modernization efforts will also likely include artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies. The idea is that this will help the commands efficiently sort through their data so it can be leveraged more easily. He said having AI and ML baked into their systems will also help bolster cybersecurity concerns. 'As a trend going forward, we will be using more AI and ML to be able to address emerging cyber problems, both to mitigate them, as well as to detect those problems as they emerge, because that's an evolving threat as well,' he said. DiFronzo also said SAIC’s recent work on the Air Force's Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS) Cloud Based Command and Control (CBC2) program will help the company provide more advanced IT capabilities for NORAD and USNORTHCOM. The Pentagon awarded SAIC a $112 million contract in January 2023 to develop the ABMS cloud-based command and control software integrator program for NORAD, USNORTHCOM and the Pacific Air Forces. 'We were able to in part leverage the experience that we've had with the Advanced Battle Management System cloud-based C2 program, ' DiFronzo said. 'So [there is] a lot of potential synergy there between this current mission IT system that they have, what we've already done there, to be able to marry that and allow them to modernize more quickly.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/they-run-on-information-saic-nabs-229m-norad-northcom-modernization-contract/	2024-09-19T12:49:45-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/240919_DVIDS_northcom_computer_8201957-scaled-e1726767561824.jpg
Harris administration’s Pentagon should focus on defense innovation, top HASC Dem says	U.S. Rep. Adam Smith of Washington, the ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee, questions Deputy Secretary of Defense Ashton B. Carter, not shown, as Carter testifies during a hearing of the House Armed Services Committee on Sequestration Implementation Options and the Effects on National Defense: Administration Perspectives Aug. 1, 2012, in Washington, D.C. (DoD photo by Glenn Fawcett/Released) WASHINGTON—The top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee would like to see a Kamala Harris administration tackle defense innovation, honing in on how the Pentagon can speed up the purchase of emerging technologies, he said today. 'I'd like to see in a Harris administration, a commitment to the innovation reform agenda at DoD,' said Washington Rep. Adam Smith during The Hill’s future of defense conference. 'That really has, I think, stalled a little bit since Ash Carter left, frankly,' he said, referencing Obama-era Defense Secretary Ashton Carter, who made interfacing with Silicon Valley and harnessing commercial technology a priority during his tenure. Smith’s statements could carry some weight with a future Harris White House, as he is the forerunner to take over the House Armed Services Committee if the Democrats take back the House in November elections. Asked about his agenda if named HASC chairman next year, Smith — who previously led the committee from 2019 to 2022 — said 'number one' is to induce the Defense Department to more rapidly adopt critically-needed technologies, especially in the realm of secure communications, information systems, drones and counter-drone tech, missiles and missile defense 'How do we speed up that process?' he said. 'Overlaying all of it is, get DoD to be better at buying software. And we've got a lot of different ideas for how do we do that.' Other key areas of focus would include personnel-related initiatives — the priority of the HASC’s FY25 National Defense Authorization Act provisions — as well as building on the AUKUS agreement to improve defense cooperation with other allies and partner nations, Smith said, adding that those priorities will likely remain the same regardless of whether he or current chairman Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Ala. leads the committee next year. Earlier this week, HASC members traveled to Silicon Valley for a hearing on defense innovation and fielding technology — the first field hearing the committee had conducted in 40 years, Smith said in opening comments for the hearing. Lawmakers heard testimony from executives at defense startups including Palantir, Saildrone, Skydio, Shield AI and Applied Intuition. During today’s event, Smith added that his intent was not to 'pick nits' about current Pentagon leadership, noting that the wars in Ukraine, in Gaza and other geopolitical issues had directed department interest away from defense innovation. 'What [Defense] Secretary [Lloyd] Austin has been really good at is building coalitions,' he said. 'They've been busy. But I do think that we've lost that central focus on how to change the way the Pentagon does business so it can move more quickly in buying software and new technology.' Congress has little more than a week to pass a stopgap bill to fund the government before money runs out at the end of Sept. 30. Last night, the House voted down a continuing resolution — named because it maintains government funding for a new fiscal year at the same level as the previous one — in a 202-220 vote. A total of 14 Republicans, including Rogers, voted against the draft CR helmed by House Speaker Mike Johnson. The proposed bill would have extended government funding through March, adding about $2 billion for submarines as well attaching a controversial voter ID bill. 'I thought of it as sort of fanatic-on-fanatic violence,' Smith said. 'You had one group of people who were insisting that we had to have this ridiculous anti voting law and a six month CR. You had another group of people insisting, no, we have to dramatically slash the budget. They couldn't even get on the same page.' The Senate will probably vote on its own version of a CR bill, filed by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, sometime next week, said Nebraska Sen. Deb Fischer, the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services strategic forces subcommittee. Fischer said she would be supportive of a shorter CR bill that does not extend into calendar year 2025. 'I would like us to be able to address the needs we have in this current year, get it done before the end of the year, so no matter who wins the presidency, we can start moving ahead and start planning for what we need soon as possible in January,' she said. Virginia Rep. Rob Wittman, the No. 2 Republican on HASC, said the most likely outcome is a CR with very few funding exceptions or additions that extends until some time in December. 'I think we have to get something done fairly soon — that would be by the middle of next week,' he said. 'If the House doesn't, I think the Senate is going to act, and the Senate will send over theirs.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/harris-administrations-pentagon-should-focus-on-defense-innovation-top-hasc-dem-says/	2024-09-19T12:01:45-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/639710-scaled-e1646326785598.jpg
EXCLUSIVE: Space Systems Command head’s ‘action plan’ to focus on command structure, outreach	Lt. Gen. Philip Garrant, commander, Space Force Space Systems Command (left). (US Space Force photo by Senior Airman Kadielle Shaw) AMOS 2024 — Ahead of a formal rollout in coming days, the head of Space Systems Command revealed to Breaking Defense three new 'major efforts' detailed in his 'action plan' — an initiative he hopes will hone the command during his time in the hotseat and beyond. In an exclusive interview on the sidelines of the annual Advanced Maui Optical and Space Surveillance Technologies (AMOS) conference, Lt. Gen. Philip Garrant identified the three efforts as shaping the command's structure to meet the needs program leaders, developing the workforce and reaching out to SSC's 'stakeholders,' including commercial industry and allies. The plan, which he intends to reveal in full during SSC's next set of 'industry days' Oct. 23-24 in Los Angeles, 'will absolutely cover my tenure into '26, but it's designed to be even a little bit more &#8216;future' than that,' he said. But the discussion was not only about the future of SCC. Garrant also weighed in on two key embattled Space Force development programs — the next-generation GPS ground system, and the ATLAS software necessary to update the service's 1980's-era command and control computer network for space domain awareness — citing progress on both. While SSC is fundamentally an acquisition command, Garrant himself has no direct buying power. Instead, the purse strings are controlled by five program executive officers (PEOs) who report to the Air Force's space acquisition head, Frank Calvelli. However, Garrant explained that he does have the responsibility for ensuring that PEOs are properly resourced and staffed. 'As the commander, I'm responsible for the quality of the work that gets delivered, because I'm responsible for the workforce,' he said. Thus, the 'first focus' of his 'commander's plan' is 'making sure that we're structured right, so that the PEOs can do their job,' Garrant said. This includes moving people around to ensure that each of the acquisition leaders are fully supported with the right types of staff. Secondly, he intends to put energy into 'workforce development' for both military and civilian personnel to ensure they are trained in how to manage acquisition programs with a keen eye on getting space capabilities to the field as quickly as possible to meet the looming threats from China and Russia. This includes 'creating the culture and developing acquisition leaders' to truly take to heart the SSC motto developed by Garrant's predecessor, Lt. Gen. Michael Guetlein: 'Exploit what we have, buy what we can, and build only what we must.' Garrant acknowledged that this is easier said than done, in particular with regard to increasing Space Force's reliance on commercial providers by buying available products and services. The goal, he explained, is to make commercial buys 'inherent in the acquisition process' by feeding those programs into the budget planning cycle upfront — 'then that is success.' 'It's really hard,' he said. 'We are very comfortable in the old ways of doing business,' he said. Garrant's final focus for his tenure is 'is a commitment to better connection with our &#8230; external stakeholders, an engagement and a meaningful, almost a back-to-basics approach to when we used to have agreements with the operators on &#8216;here's the capability we're going to deliver',' he said, as well as 'a commitment to be transparent.' Part of that approach to working more closely with operators is being addressed by the Space Force's plan to create Integrated Mission Deltas, or IMDs, that are co-led by acquisition officers under SSC and operations personnel from Space Operations Command, and have responsibility for sustainment of associated kit. The service stood up the first two last September, and is working to expand the concept to all of its mission areas. (Deltas are the Space Force equivalent of Air Force wing and group commands.) Accompanying the IMDs, which are focused on operations, are the Integrated Systems Deltas. The latter, Garrant explained, are focused on development programs. 'You can think of a very traditional, large, Major Defense Acquisition Program,' he said, 'that is still in development early in the acquisition lifecycle.' (A Major Defense Acquisition Program is a research and development program valued at more than $525 million in fiscal year 2020 dollars, or a procurement program worth more than $3.065 billion in FY20 dollars.) In addition to SSC's Space Force stakeholders, Garrant noted that the command also is working on outreach to allied and partner nations. 'We also recognize that there is significant value in engaging with our international partners. Our nation's integrated deterrence strategy requires robust collaboration and information sharing with our allies,' he said in his keynote address at the AMOS conference. 'International partnerships are critical to our long term SDA [space domain awareness] posture, unfortunately, allied partners were traditionally on the sidelines due to a lack of data sharing infrastructures.' SSC is looking to fix that, he said, by creating a new 'standardized interface' to the Unified Data Library (UDL), called the 'Allied Exchange Environment or AXE,' designed 'to facilitate near real-time two-way operational data exchange between the US and foreign allied partners.' AXE, Garrant told Breaking Defense, will be a 'technical infrastructure' that will allow allies and partners to tap into the UDL's space monitoring database. 'We're going to expose the data to the allies, and then the allies can use the data. They can put their own tools on the data. They can ingest the data to their national databases if they want. They can contribute back,' he said. Elsewhere in the discussion, Garrant also addressed two of the Space Force's troubled developmental programs that have been called out by Calvelli for their continued shortfalls: the GPS Next Generation Operational Control System (OCX); and the Advanced Tracking and Launch Analysis System (ATLAS) software. OCX is needed for the Space Force to have 'full control' of the jam-resistant, military-only GPS signal, as well as provide command and control of the latest model GPS satellites. Developed by RTX (formerly Raytheon), the OCX program has been a poster child for broken acquisition, having been originally planned to begin operations more than a decade ago. But now, Garrant said, OCX now is 'on track' toward 'operational acceptance.' 'The site acceptance test is the last milestone for OCX acceptance by the government. We anticipate that this winter. We have had some delays since the last baseline, but frankly, those are attributable to external bases and resources, frankly, outside our control. I won't say it's an excuse, it's an explanation. But we are on track to complete site acceptance tests and formally accept OCX,' he said. ATLAS is being designed by prime contractor L3Harris as the latest Pentagon effort to replace 1970s-era Space Defense Operations Center (SPADOC) computer system for managing data from the military’s network of radar and telescopes that detect and track objects on orbit to provide space domain awareness (SDA) to operators. It too is making progress, Garrant said, after a series of delays. 'So First Lt. Garrant was working on a system to get us off of SPADOC 30 years ago,' he said, referring to the long and storied history of the failed Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC) Mission System (JMS). (Garrant started his career as a systems engineer.) 'We anticipate doing delivery of a minimum viable product for ATLAS this winter, and go into the trial period. Presuming success out of trial period, it would be operational at the end of next year, with the intent of turning off SPADOC' Garrant said. The Space Force originally planned the ATLAS minimum viable capability to debut in 2022. Garrant said that one of the things the Space Force has come to realize about software-heavy command and control programs such as OCX and ATLAS is that they are used differently by operators at different levels. 'A lot of the tools we've been developing, we're realizing are employed by different operational organizations at different levels of command. So, that's a big focus for us is to make sure that we don't have diverging tech baselines,' he said. 'Or maybe we do need diverging operational baselines, but if we do, it's deliberate and informed.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/exclusive-space-systems-command-heads-action-plan-to-focus-on-command-structure-outreach/	2024-09-19T11:19:10-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/8303146-1-scaled-e1716311389831.jpg
France and Italy order new SAMP/T air defense systems	A Eurosam SAMP/T air defense system repels a simulated air attack by NATO fighter aircraft (NATO) BELFAST — France and Italy this week announced separate orders for SAMP/T NG (Next Generation) air defense systems, giving the two nations the capability to intercept hypersonic missiles and neutralize aircraft threats at greater range with the European-made system. Sebastien Lecornu, France’s defense minister, said in a translated social media post on Tuesday that Paris 'will have the first of 8 SAMP/T NG systems' in 2026, as originally committed to in the Military Programming Law — a long-term defense spending plan. He also noted that France will receive 12 of the upgraded systems by 2035. Lecornu was attending a two-day European air and missile defense conference held in Rome where his Italian counterpart Guido Crosetto also shared, per local reports, that Italy has ordered 10 SAMP/T NG systems. Neither Lecornu nor Crosetto disclosed acquisition costs. French manufacturer Thales, which makes the air defense platforms under the Eurosam joint venture with European missile house MBDA of which Italy's Leonardo is a part, welcomed the French order, calling it 'an additional step towards the renewal of the European Medium-Range Air Defence ground capabilities.' Despite the obvious boost for local industry, France remains strongly opposed to the German-led European Sky Shield Initiative (ESSI), centered around development of a common ground-based air defense (GBAD) capability. Berlin has proposed German-made IRIS-T short-range air defense equipment and the US medium-range Patriot PAC-3 system for ESSI. French President Emmanuel Macron has, however, openly criticized non-European solutions, calling them, 'less manageable, subject to timetables, queues, priorities … and too dependent on the outside world.' Paris continues to back SAMP/T for a European-wide requirement, and in parallel refuses to join ESSI. Similarly, Italy has not signed on. Thales also noted that during the air and missile defense conference, Lecornu had 'officialised a contract' with the Organisation for Joint Armament Cooperation (OCCAR) to launch production of seven additional SAMP/T NG sections for the French Air and Space Forces. It added that the sections to be constructed for France will be based on its GF300, multifunction, active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, together with the company’s New Generation Engagement Module (ME-NG). 'The ME-NG is based on a common core hardware and software architecture able to integrate specific national requirements and different radars, to coordinate or to integrate various weapon systems based on diverse munitions,' said the manufacturer. According to Eurosam company literature [PDF], SAMP/T NG is 'capable of simultaneously engaging any combination of air and missile threats further than 150km,' and works off a detection range greater than 350km. The truck-based system is also equipped with six vertical launchers, each fitted with eight Aster missiles. The NG configuration will be specifically equipped with newer Aster 30 Block 1 New Technology munitions. A production contract for the weapon was signed for last year by Eurosam and OCCAR, on behalf of Italy and France. An entire SAMP/T NG platform, compromising launchers, missiles, an AESA radar (GF300 or Leonardo’s Kronos Grand Mobile High Power type in the case of Italy) and an engagement module, can be deployed in under 30 minutes. Standard SAMP/T systems supplied by France and Italy to Ukraine and since deployed against Russia are capable of striking targets in excess of 100km.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/france-and-italy-order-new-samp-t-air-defense-systems/	2024-09-19T08:44:24-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/221123-mamba_rdax_775x440s.jpg
Rolls-Royce selling naval propulsion business to Fairbanks Morse Defense	The world's largest aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN 78) transits the Mediterranean Sea, Aug. 21, 2023. Gerald R.

Ford Carrier Strike Group is on a scheduled deployment in the U.S. Naval Forces Europe area of operations, employed by U.S. Sixth Fleet to defend U.S., allied, and partner interests. (U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Jackson Adkins) WASHINGTON — Rolls-Royce announced today it has reached an agreement to sell its Naval Propulsors and Handling business to Fairbanks Morse Defense for an undisclosed amount of money. The sale will see Rolls facilities in Pascagoula, Miss., and Walpole, Mass., as well as its Canadian location in Peterborough, Ontario, transfer over to Fairbanks Morse. According to the company announcement, the divested business 'supports a range of specialist propellers and waterjets for naval applications, as well as specialized handling systems that enable the deployment and recovery of manned and unmanned craft, and other cargo, from naval vessels.' Rolls says products rolled out of these facilities are on a number of US Navy vessels, including 'Frigates, Destroyers, Combatants, Submarines, Aircraft Carriers, Amphibious ships, Fleet Support and Auxiliary Ships, as well as U.S. Coast Guard Cutters.' Fairbanks Morse, headquartered in Wisconsin, is focused primarily on providing components, including engines, for naval vessels, meaning the Rolls business unit should fit snugly into its portfolio. 'When you look at the 150-year history of Fairbanks Morse Defense, you will find a handful of distinctive moments that completely transformed this company. We believe the acquisition of Rolls-Royce naval propulsors and handling businesses will become one of those moments,' George Whittier, CEO of Fairbanks Morse Defense, said in a statement. 'Rolls-Royce Naval Propulsors &amp; Handling is an industry leader and trusted supplier to navies around the world. We are pleased to collaborate with Fairbanks Morse Defense, who recognizes the value of this business and the outstanding opportunities for its strong future.' added Adam Riddle, chairman and CEO of Rolls-Royce North America. A timeline for when the deal will be closed was not disclosed by either company.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/rolls-royce-selling-naval-propulsion-business-to-fairbanks-morse-defense/	2024-09-19T07:16:43-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/10/7987135-e1696858610380.jpg
Lockheed nearing test of sea-launched JAGM, pitches for US and Australia	Concept art of a Lockheed Martin JAGM flying over water. (Lockheed Martin) MELBOURNE — Lockheed Martin plans to conduct a vertical launch, live fire demonstration of the Joint Air-to-Ground Missile (JAGM) next year as it rolls out a plan to evolve the munition into a family of 'multi-domain missile systems,' one the company hopes to sell to both the US and Australia in the future. At the Land Forces exhibition in Melbourne, Australia, last week, the company displayed a model of a generic vessel which resembled the US Navy’s MkVI Patrol Boat, equipped with four JAGM Quad Launchers (JQLs) — Lockheed Martin’s vertical launch system which enables JAGM to be launched from medium and large surface vessels as well as tactical ground vehicles such as the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle. The JAGM includes the warhead and 'back-end' of the AGM-114R (HELLFIRE Romeo) but also the integration of additional multi-mode seekers including a fire-and-forget millimeter wave (MMW) radar for moving targets which allows it to rapidly engage multiple 'slow-moving fixed wing aircraft, helicopters and UAS simultaneously,' according to company literature. Any integration of the JQL on board a surface vessel will mark the first time JAGM has been fired at sea. Currently, Lockheed’s out-of-production AGM-114 Longbow Hellfire missile is integrated on board LCS ships in the Middle East, designed to engage small surface craft. Obviously, the region has seen an influx of threats that a more up-to-date weapon could be useful in countering. Potential applications, a defense source told Breaking Defense, could include the engagement of uncrewed surface vessels (USVs) and uncrewed aerial systems (UAS) which continue to be operated by Iranian-backed groups against US and international naval vessels and commercial shipping in the Red Sea since last year. Media coverage of the JQL configuration was first reported in 2020, but since then the effort has gone quiet. But speaking to Breaking Defense at the conference, Patrick Sweeney, Lockheed’s senior manager for international business development, confirmed the effort was still moving forward. Sweeney said the JAGM munition itself requires no hardware changes to be launched in the maritime environment, before stating 'load exercises' had already been conducted with the JQL. 'We are still in the development phase of the vertical launch capability and demonstrating to US DoD which is our near-term goal,' he said. 'JQL brings the JAGM family of missiles and M299 launcher to vehicles and surface ships using designs and technologies from the MK 41 Vertical Launching System,' Lockheed documents read. The JQL currently features a pair of naval variants which could see it integrated above or below decks for patrol boats and frigates/corvettes respectively. Lockheed Martin is also pitching JAGM to international partners including the Australian Defence Forces (ADF) in a move which would provide 'certain levels in commonality' with the DoD, Sweeney added. The ADF is preparing to receive its first AH-64E Apache attack helicopters from Boeing next year, with JAGM being proposed as a potential armament solution for the platform, which would require no additional integration given it remains in service with US Army Apaches. Sweeney also confirmed to Breaking Defense that Lockheed is proposing it’s next-generation JAGM Medium Range (MR) missile for the ADF — a capability which remains in development as an internal effort within the company but has already proven its ability to double range from eight to 16km. Additional opportunities in Australia include the Land 8710 Littoral Manoeuvre Vessel program which could see landing craft equipped with JAGM for over-the-beach fire support. 'Everyone wants increased range,' Sweeney concluded.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/lockheed-nearing-test-of-sea-launched-jagm-pitches-for-us-and-australia/	2024-09-19T06:38:11-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/JAGM-e1726751726585.png

Anduril announces IVAS team-up with Microsoft	A US Army soldier detects small drone threats through Lattice IVAS integration. (Anduril) WASHINGTON — Oculus founder Palmer Luckey is officially throwing his defense firm Anduril's hat into the ring to help develop a combat-suitable mixed-reality device for soldiers, announcing a new partnership with Microsoft. After teasing his tech startup's broader entrance into the military mixed-reality space, Palmer is now disclosing at least one entry point: the integration of new sensors and the firm's Lattice platform into the US Army’s latest version of the Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS). 'This is Anduril's bread and butter, and we’ve been building the backbone for this for years,' Luckey said. Robin Seiler, Microsoft’s corporate vice president for mixed reality, said the aim is to 'expand the impact' the system could have on the battlefield. 'Soldiers using IVAS get instant alerts and can track movements in real-time, without needing to be involved in the detection process. This speeds up the early warning system, which is critical for improving response times and increasing soldier survival,' a Microsoft told Breaking Defense. While the collaboration sheds new light on Microsoft’s plans to upgrade its current IVAS offering, a host of questions remain about the path ahead for the tech giant's mixed-reality program and just which alliances are forming to compete anew if the Army greenlights a new competition. In 2018, the Army first selected the Washington-based tech company for its coved IVAS program and tasked the team with militarizing the commercially available HoloLens 2. By 2021, the service awarded Microsoft with a production deal valued up to $22 billion with plans to begin fielding the device that same year. But behind the scenes, soldier testing suggested it was a technology not suitable for combat, leading Army leaders to pause development and reset the program. After several false starts, the Army rolled out an iterative development plan based around three different versions — 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2. That 1.2 version was billed as the big leap ahead and one that could potentially push past tech and user complaints that had ranged from software glitches to physical side effects like dizziness and nausea. Microsoft overhauled the 1.2 form factor by ditching the helmet-like display that soldiers were not able to easily take off and replaced it with a display that could be flipped up. The field of view was also shrunk from 70-degree down to around 60-degrees to provide more clarity and better alignment with a user’s eyes. As a result, Army leaders including Chief of Staff Gen. Randy George have tasked Army Rangers with racking and stacking all of the service’s night vision devices to include IVAS. That analysis is expected back this fall and could help decide how the Army envisions soldiers using IVAS and just which units and individuals should have it. The feedback may also help drive requirements for a new IVAS form factor. Service officials have been preparing tech companies for an upcoming IVAS Next competition that could replace Microsoft as the prime contractor, and multiple industry sources have told Breaking Defense they are waiting for the service to release a formal solicitation, possibly before the end of the year. That solicitation is expected to shine a light on the Army’s path ahead for the program and could be a key marker as potential competitors set themselves on the starting block. (For now, most are remaining tightlipped about their exact plans, although both Microsoft and Kopin have said they will compete.) As for Anduril's IVAS Next ambitions, the company has not released any details. But during AWE 2024 in June, Luckey teased a new headset underdevelopment saying he is 'still very much in the hardware space.' 'I'm actually building a new headset right now,' Anduril's founder told the audience. 'It's driven … by military requirements, but it's also going to be used for non-military stuff.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/anduril-announces-ivas-team-up-with-microsoft/	2024-09-18T21:01:33-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/IVAS-partnership.jpg

B-21 Raider bomber shows off in new video, flying up to twice a week	A B-21 Raider conducts flight testing, which includes ground testing, taxiing, and flying operations, at Edwards Air Force Base, California. The B-21 will interoperate with our allies and partners to deliver on our enduring commitment to provide flexible strike options for coalition operations that defend us against common threats. (U.S. Air Force photo) AFA 2024 — The flight test program for the Air Force’s newest stealth bomber is heating up, with the Northrop Grumman-made B-21 Raider sometimes taking to the skies as much as twice a week, program officials said today. Tom Jones, president of Northrop's aeronautics sector, said the bomber’s progress during testing will pave the way for the system to be 'a daily flier' later into the program. 'We’re very pleased with how it’s going… We’re actually able to generate two test flights sometimes within a week, which, if you think about how far ahead we are, that’s great,' he said. After the bomber’s first flight in November, the Air Force and Northrop have focused on 'expanding the operating envelope' for the aircraft and testing its various mission systems while in the air, said William Bailey, director of the Air Force’s Rapid Capabilities Office, which oversees the B-21 program. In addition to the flight test aircraft, the Air Force also has two B-21s undergoing ground-based evaluations. One of those has completed structural testing, which is helping the Air Force and Northrop understand how the aircraft is performing and to validate the digital models of the B-21, Bailey said. It is also conducting fatigue tests on another aircraft, which informs the team on how the bomber will age and perform over time, he said. The process is 'not as flashy' as flight test, 'however if you intend to build a lot of these and operate them for a long time, this is very important.' Testing continues for the B-21 Raider, a dual-capable penetrating strike stealth bomber capable of delivering both conventional and nuclear munitions. Ellsworth Air Force Base, Whiteman Air Force Base, and Dyess Air Force Base are expected to receive the B-21.

Last week, the Air Force approved Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri, and Dyess AFB, Texas, as the second and third basing locations for the Raider. 'Potential consideration for forward facing, either temporary or permanent, of this weapon system to be able to deter the various actors around the globe, I think, might be of interest to the senior policymakers,' Gen. Thomas Bussiere, Air Force Global Strike Command commander, said during the panel. The Pentagon’s top acquisition official approved the B-21 for low-rate production in January.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/b-21-raider-bomber-shows-off-in-new-video-flying-up-to-twice-a-week/	2024-09-18T14:10:21-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/b21-flight-scaled-e1716403239343.jpg
Air Force special ops CV-22 Ospreys could be ready to deploy in weeks, commander says	A CV-22 Osprey prepares to take off Feb. 8, 2019 at U-Tapao airfield, Thailand. (1st Lt. Renee Douglas/ 353rd Special Operations Wing) AFA 2024 — Within a few weeks, Air Force CV-22 Ospreys will be ready to deploy for the first time since a fatal Osprey crash in November, the head of Air Force Special Operations Command said today. About 60 percent of AFSOC’s CV-22s are back to being fully operational, with the rest to follow by late 2024 or early 2025, said Lt. Gen. Michael Conley during a roundtable at the Air Force Association’s Air, Space and Cyber conference. The CV-22 units in Japan and the United Kingdom 'are almost back to full mission readiness. We will deploy out here in the coming weeks, back to support other geographic commanders,' he said. 'My whole fleet is not operationally running yet, but I have enough capacity and the right crews training to provide the capabilities on the battlefield.' Conley, who took the helm at AFSOC in July, declined to comment on where specifically the Ospreys will deploy, stating only that it will not take place in the Indo-Pacific or European theaters, which already have permanently stationed V-22 squadrons. The Pentagon grounded all versions of the Osprey in December after a CV-22 flying a training mission crashed off the coast of Japan on Nov. 29, killing eight crewmembers onboard. The Pentagon in March gave the services the green light to begin returning the Bell-Boeing-made tiltrotor to flight, putting into action a phased approach that involved retraining crews, reviewing maintenance records and instituting changes to emergency procedures meant to improve flight safety. In August, the Air Force released its accident investigation report on the crash, which found that it was caused by a 'catastrophic failure' of the Osprey’s proprotor gearbox, but also listed decisions made by the aircrew as a factor that contributed to the accident. In particular, the report pointed to the aircrew’s actions in light of multiple 'left-hand proprotor gearbox (PRGB) chip burn' advisories. Per Air Force guidance at the time, crews were directed to land as soon as possible if they receive that warning three times during a flight, but service regulations also provide commanders some discretion based on their circumstances and mission. Conley said that guidance has changed so that crews are now advised to land 'as soon as practical' after a single chip burn warning, and to land 'as soon as possible' after two warnings. 'At the end of the day, there will always be aircraft commander and crew discretion. It's the nature of what we do. The environments are unique, depending on where we’re flying, what we're dealing with,' he said. 'But we have tightened up the guidance to make it less ambiguous to the crews up there.' The Air Force has sometimes taken a different, and perhaps more cautious approach to Osprey operations than the Marine Corps, having previously suspended V-22 flight operations due to safety concerns at times where the other service kept flying. Last week, Aviation Week reported that the Air Force is considering assuming airworthiness authority for the CV-22 from Naval Air Systems Command, which manages Osprey procurement and support for the US military through the PMA 275 program office. Asked about the potential move, Conley said it was a question for Air Force Materiel Command head Gen. Duke Richardson, and that AFSOC’s relationship with NAVAIR, the Marine Corps and PMA 275 'is probably as strong as it's ever been.' 'I'd say that over the last eight or nine months, we've had the time, and we've kind of looked at the program in a holistic view. We've considered lots of things, and there's been lots of ideas, lots of recommendations, and we're still kind of calling through those on what is feasible, what makes sense,' he said. 'I don't think anyone's close to a decision on whether we need to break from the current construct.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/air-force-special-ops-cv-22-ospreys-could-be-ready-to-deploy-in-weeks-commander-says/	2024-09-18T13:53:01-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/5104340-scaled-e1726689615943.jpg
After apparent mass pager attack, Hezbollah has few avenues for response, experts say	Mourners carry the coffins of people killed after hundreds of paging devices exploded in a deadly wave across Lebanon the previous day, during their funeral procession in Beirut's southern suburbs on September 18, 2024. (Photo by ANWAR AMRO / AFP) (Photo by ANWAR AMRO/AFP via Getty Images) BEIRUT — As Hezbollah contends with what appears to be a second wave of exploding personal devices today, experts here said that the armed Lebanese group has been dealt a 'severe blow' and will likely struggle to respond to what's suspected to be an unprecedented, sophisticated attack by Israel. 'If Hezbollah will retaliate, it won't be soon,' retired Lebanese armed forces Gen. Maroun Hitti told Breaking Defense, adding that the group would likely need at least a month to gather itself. 'Israel has managed to interject an element of doubt and mistrust between Hezbollah fighters, potential Hezbollah recruits and the Hezbollah leadership,' Des Roches, associate professor at the Near East South Asia Center for Security Studies, told Breaking Defense. When Hezbollah does respond, Des Roches said he expected it to mirror previous responses to Israeli attacks, namely firing rockets and missiles south toward Israeli targets. Even then, 'now that their communications are compromised they'll be less capable of conducting coordinated operations,' he said. Hitti agreed that Hezbollah would have to 'review its methods and security before undertaking any military action.' Beyond that, he said, Hezbollah 'is incapable to respond in a large military operation, or it will have to deal with a larger blow from Israel.' But Andreas Krieg, a senior lecturer at King's College London, pointed out that Hezbollah isn't necessarily bound by geography to retaliate at the southern border or even in the Middle East. Krieg, also CEO of risk consultancy MENA analytica, said that since the purported Israeli operation was done in the 'grey zone' without public attribution, Hezbollah could respond in kind, using 'black ops' to strike at Israeli or Jewish targets overseas. (Hitting targets inside Israel, he said, would be 'very difficult at this stage' considering the level of vigilance Israel's security services are likely to have.) Hezbollah is believed to have an extensive overseas capability, specifically through its sub-group known as the Islamic Jihad Organization. The US Intelligence Community says the IJO is a 'highly compartmented unit that is primarily responsible for overseas terrorism operations, including against Western targets.' Krieg also suggested Hezbollah could use proxies to carry out a retaliation operation for it. An overriding consideration, however, remains escalation. Since Hamas's Oct. 7 attack, Hezbollah and Israel have been trading fire, but for the most part — until this week — stopping short of conducting the kind of strikes that are likely to spark a wider regional war. 'There may be one or two [attacks on] of Israeli interests or perceived Israeli interests abroad, just because they feel they have to do something in order to keep control over their base,' Des Roches said. For now Hezbollah announced in a statement on Tuesday that it is conducting a wide-ranging security investigation 'to find out the reasons that led to these simultaneous explosions.' The public could learn more about Hezbollah's next move Thursday when Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah is scheduled to make a public address.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/after-apparent-mass-pager-attack-hezbollah-has-few-avenues-for-response-experts-say/	2024-09-18T12:58:35-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/240918_hezbollah_pager_funeral_GettyImages-2172014476-e1726689211855.jpg
CDAO opens big door for small biz with $15 billion, 10-year Advana recompete	Futuristic monitor showing information data on a dark background. (Yuichiro Chino/Getty Images) WASHINGTON — The Pentagon’s prized platform for big-data analytics, Advana, is about to become a high-stakes test case for the Defense Department's ability to keep up with Silicon Valley. After seven years of operating the platform through consummate DC consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton, the DoD wants to open the 'walled garden' of Advana to a wide array of vendors, including small businesses and 'non-traditional' contractors with no experience running the maze of defense procurement. To make that happen, today the Chief Digital &amp; AI Officer (CDAO) announced plans for a 15-year, multi-vendor contract worth up to $10 billion. 'One thing we want people to take away is you don’t have to do everything,' said Bonnie Evangelista, the deputy CDAO for acquisition, in a sidebar with select reporters at the Sept. 18 industry day for the new approach. 'You don’t have to do every part of the tech stack &#8230; if you do a single piece and you do it really well, you can have a contract.' Opening up Advana is a pillar of CDAO Radha Plumb’s yet-larger plan, called Open DAGIR, to overhaul Pentagon AI from the back office to the battlefield. The other pillar announced to date is a similarly ambitious opening-up of Palantir’s Maven Smart System, a AI toolkit in high demand by military planners at commands worldwide. RELATED: GIDE goes wide: Defense AI chief seeks host of industry players for global battle network While Maven ignited controversy early on over the use of AI for military targeting, Advana has quietly made itself essential. Originating as an obscure Pentagon comptroller project to help track financial transactions ahead of an audit, it proved capable of helping more and more officials manage more datasets for more missions. In 2021, Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks issued a 'data decree' memorandum [PDF] that declared 'The Advancing Analytics (Advana) platform is the single enterprise authoritative data management and analytics platform for the Secretary of Defense' — and required specific approval before using any competing platform. That official status means CDAO is tinkering with one of the most high-profile pieces of software in the Pentagon, one relied on daily by decisionmakers from the Secretary of Defense down. So any missteps on this new path will be very visible — but so were the growing pains of the existing system as Advana struggled to keep with rising demand. The new approach, first described in detail today, calls for an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract vehicle that can handle up to $15 billion in total awards. While the overall IDIQ will be in place for a decade, CDAO made clear today that there will be many opportunities along the way to bring in new vendors or kick out companies that no longer perform. 'There will be multiple awards,' Evangelista told reporters. 'We are planning for on-ramping and off-ramping [vendors] over the ten years, because technology change.' How many companies does CDAO hope to bring on board? 'I don’t know the right number,' Evangelista said frankly. 'Part of today is to help us understand what is the right number.' CDAO expects further rounds of back-and-forth with industry before it settles on specific contract language and technical standards, each of which is tricky enough to figure out on its own but which must also work together smoothly to allow multiple contractors to plug-and-play in the same system. 'This is the first industry day of this scale,' said Garrett Berntsen, the recently hired deputy CDAO for mission analytics. 'We also have an RFI [Request For Information] that’s public that we’re seeking feedback on, [and] there will be additional future events.' 'You can’t just plop something this massive down,' Berntsen told reporters. 'We’re getting lots of feedback.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/cdao-opens-big-door-for-small-biz-with-15-bilion-10-year-advana-recompete/	2024-09-18T12:29:55-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/GettyImages-1331215115-e1726684328825.jpg
Lot full? In an increasingly crowded orbit, MITRE studies how many LEO sats are too many	The orbital population of active and inactive satellites continues to grow, especially in low Earth orbit. (Image credit: NASA) AMOS 2024 — Space is supposed to be big, 'vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly big,' as a wise man once said. But low Earth orbit (LEO), where most satellites now linger, is not as big as it may seem. And with thousands of satellites floating there now and tens of thousands more on the way, there will be, eventually, no room left. When that will happen is unclear, but a new study by MITRE takes a stab at establishing a framework to determine at what point does the sheer volume of space traffic in LEO overwhelm the environment — making it impossible for satellites to function due to interference and the risk of collision with each other and orbiting debris. The study, called 'Integrating Orbital Carrying Capacity into International Policy Constructs: Leveraging Best Practices from Aviation's Risk-Based Norms,' is based on adapting the approach the international air traffic control system uses to manage airspace to prevent planes from colliding, said Kevin Toner, vice president of MITRE's Center for Government Effectiveness and Modernization. Toner, along with several other MITRE officials, spoke with Breaking Defense on Monday on the margins of the annual Advanced Maui Optical and Space Surveillance Technologies (AMOS) conference. The paper, the officials explained, will be presented in full at the 75th International Astronautical Conference in October. As the number of satellites in LEO, roughly 300-2,000 kilometers above the Earth, continues to skyrocket global concerns are growing about what is known as 'carrying capacity' in the orbital regime have also grown. Like any physical space, LEO has a limited capacity, meaning there's only so much room for satellites without significantly increasing the chance deadly on-orbit crashes — which in turn create more space junk that can crash into other things. For example, the issue of LEO crowding and concerns about equitable access for developing countries came to the fore at the March meeting of the Science and Technical Subcommittee of the UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS). The primary source of worry is the plethora of mega-constellations comprising thousands of satellites being launched by commercial companies and governments, including militaries, around the world. SpaceX alone has already put some 6,000 Starlink satellites in LEO, and hopes to expand its broadband network to over 40,000. The company also is launching hundreds of its militarized Starlink, called Starshield, for the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) and has Space Force interest as well. Amazon's Kuiper Project in 2023 launched the first two of a planned 3,000 satellite constellation, and OneWeb has 630 of its planned 648 satellites on orbit. Not to be left out, China's state-owned Shanghei Spacecom Satellite Technology (SSST) on Aug. 6 launched the first 18 of a planned Starlink clone, called Thousand Sails (G60), that it hopes eventually will include some 15,000 satellites. China also reportedly has plans for another mega-constellation called Guowang, to include some 13,000 satellites. Meanwhile, the Space Force's Space Development Agency is on its way to orbiting up to 500 satellites in LEO for its planned Transport Layer of data relay satellites; and another 100 or so for its Tracking Layer of missile warning/tracking satellite. MITRE's study suggests that the key to managing LEO in a way that allows the maximum number of users lies breaking the problem down into specific altitude bands and considering not just macro-numbers but the timing of when congestion occurs. 'Broadly, there are lots of definitions of carrying capacity. Some are a number: this is the max. I think one of the points we try to make in the paper is that there are other aspects, like time, for example. At what time and in which orbits comparatively do carrying capacities vary?' Tone said. With those considerations at hand, along with an understanding of how and when satellites are moving around, the next question the MITRE paper looked at is 'how do you optimize [the amount of space traffic] by thinking about it the same way air traffic controllers think about airspace, whether it's Class A, Class B, or Class C,' he said. The most 'heavily congested' air corridors are Class A, 'where you always have aircraft moving down these highways,' Toner explained. Class B are certain areas where large numbers of aircraft converge, such as airports; and Class C are less populated air traffic lanes. To translate to space terms, the orbital region between 700-900 kilometers is an already crowded danger zone akin to Class A air corridors. The Earth's poles, where most LEO sats converge at one time or another, could be compared to Class B. And the more lonely orbits of above 1,000 kilometers are like Class C. The goal of the MITRE framework proposal is to help 'facilitate international collaboration and standard-setting' according to a fact sheet provided to Breaking Defense. 'It provides a pathway for developing globally harmonized policies that ensure the safety and sustainability of space activities,' the fact sheet adds.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/lot-full-in-an-increasingly-crowded-orbit-mitre-studies-how-many-leo-sats-are-too-many/	2024-09-18T10:41:39-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2013/07/spaceDebrisnbasa-e1644614491811.jpg
In new ‘Navigation Plan,’ CNO puts Navy’s targets on China’s 2027 deadline	Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Lisa Franchetti participates in a wreath laying ceremony at the Anitkabir &#8211; Atatürk Mausoleum, in Ankara, Türkiye, June 3, 2024. (US Navy photo by Chief Mass Communication Specialist Amanda Gray) WASHINGTON — The Navy's top officer today released a new Navigation Plan, placing the service's strategic focus squarely on preparing for a future conflict with China, potentially within the next few years. 'The challenge posed by the [People’s Republic of China] to our Navy now goes well beyond just the size of the PLA Navy fleet. Ships matter greatly but gone are the days when we assessed threats based purely on the number of battle force ships or tonnage,' Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Lisa Franchetti wrote in the new document, published today. 'Through operational concepts like multi-domain precision warfare, grey zone and economic campaigns, expansion of dual use infrastructure (e.g., airfields) and dual use forces (e.g., Chinese maritime militia), and a growing nuclear arsenal, the PRC presents a complex multi-domain and multi-axis threat.' The 'Navigation Plan,' or NAVPLAN, is an overarching strategic document routinely published by the Navy’s top admiral. (Prior to today, the most recent NAVPLAN was published in July 2022.) Similar to the Marine Corps’ Commandant’s Planning Guidance, the document provides an outlet for the Navy’s top officer to share their vision for the future with the fleet. Franchetti’s new NAVPLAN is heavily focused on the 2027 timeline that Chinese leadership have said they’ve given to their military to be prepared for a conflict — likely over the status quo of Taiwan — with the United States or any American allies who might intercede. It highlights long-range fires, non-traditional sea denial, counter C5ISRT, terminal defense and contested logistics as 'key capabilities.' An integral part of the Navy's efforts to counter China will be what the CNO has dubbed 'Project 33.' (Thirty-three alludes to the fact Franchetti is the 33rd officer to serve as the chief of naval operations.) Key aspects of Project 33 include eliminating ship, submarine and aircraft maintenance delays; scaling the use and integration of robotic and autonomous systems; boosting recruitment and retention; and 'train[ing] for combat as we plan to fight, in the real world and virtually.' Franchetti’s document also alludes to the financial pressures the Navy is under and how the service will 'eventually face deep strategic constraints' on its ability to simultaneously conduct daily operations and invest in future modernization short of any budgetary boost. 'This 2024 Navigation Plan reflects our current emphasis on readiness and capability considering near-term budgetary and industrial realities, while continuing to advocate for the resources needed to expand all aspects of the Navy’s force structure necessary to preserve the peace, respond in crisis, and win decisively in war,' she wrote. The document also makes a lesser mention of Russia, stating the 'wounded and isolated' country 'remains dangerous,' as well as the ongoing attacks by Hamas and the Houthis in the Middle East. 'Moscow, Beijing, Tehran, and Pyongyang have strengthened their linkages and are actively targeting the U.S., our allies, and our partners in the information domain,' the document said. 'Damage to undersea pipelines and cables underscored how seabed infrastructure has become targetable.' The NAVPLAN sets several goals for the larger service and designates a 'single accountable official' for each target with a 2027 deadline. The vice chief of naval operations for example will 'achieve and sustain an 80 percent combat surge ready posture for ships, submarines and aircraft.' The service’s top requirements officer, also called the N9, will integrate robotics and autonomous systems for 'routine use' by operational commanders, according to the document. 'We must meet all the objectives in this Navigation Plan to field the people and capabilities needed to fight and win today, in 2027, and beyond,' Franchetti wrote. 'As we accelerate where possible, we will also continue the crucial work already underway to enhance the critical capabilities and enablers laid out in prior Navy guidance.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/in-new-navigation-plan-cno-puts-navys-targets-on-chinas-2027-deadline/	2024-09-18T09:00:54-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/8446820-scaled-e1726655704624.jpg
Norway’s Kongsberg to build new missile factory in Virginia	A Naval Strike Missile produced by Kongsberg. (Photo courtesy of Kongsberg.) WASHINGTON — The aerospace and defense arm of Norwegian contractor Kongsberg announced Tuesday it's building a missile production facility in James City County, Va., that will boost capacity for the Naval Strike Missile and Joint Strike Missile. 'The new missile production facilities in the U.S., Australia and Norway address the strong and long-term demand for our unique technology and the critical need to strengthen collective defense capabilities,' Geir Håøy, CEO of Kongsberg, said in a company statement. 'Kongsberg has a proud history in the U.S. and we are delighted to continue to invest in the country to support American interests while creating jobs locally.' The factory will bring 180 jobs to the region and include a $100 million investment over the next several years, according to the company. Kongsberg also has a factory in Johnstown, Pa., which it said this week will expand to include hiring 20 additional employees. The company's new Virginia factory will focus on producing the Naval Strike Missile and Joint Strike Missile. NSM is an anti-ship missile used by the US Navy and produced jointly by Kongsberg and RTX. It carries a 500-pound class warhead, advanced seeker and a programmable fuze, according to RTX. The Joint Strike Missile is derived from NSM and is being integrated for use onto the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter in conjunction with Lockheed Martin. Air forces from Norway, Japan, Finland, Australia and the United States have all placed orders for the weapon. 'Today’s announcement by Kongsberg Defense and Aerospace represents a significant investment in our local community,' said Rep. Rob Wittman, a senior member on the House Armed Service Committee, in a written statement. 'Kongsberg’s decision to expand their U.S. presence and build a new missile production facility in James City County was made with the goal of helping meet increasing global demand for the Naval Strike Missile and Joint Strike Missile,' he continued. 'This new facility will create nearly 200 new jobs locally while investing over $100 million into the economy of the Commonwealth in the coming years.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/kongsberg-to-build-new-missile-factory-in-virginia/	2024-09-18T08:28:06-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/image001-e1726668794703.jpg

Italy plans out $15B-plus spending on dozens of F-35s and Eurofighters	An Italian air force F-35A Lightning II assigned to the 32nd Wing, Amendola Air Base, Italy, prepares to land at Aviano Air Base, Italy (US Air Force) BELFAST — Italy expects to dole out billions more in defense spending on Lockheed Martin F-35 fifth-generation and Eurofighter Typhoon fourth-generation combat jets under targets laid out in a new multi-year military spending document. Published on Monday, the defense ministry paper [PDF] sets out 2024-to-2026 funding plans and notes that 25 additional F-35 aircraft will be procured at an estimated value of €7 billion ($7.8 billion). The new order, which also includes related items like engines and logistics support is split between 15 F-35A conventional takeoff and landing (CTOL) models for the Italian Air Force and 10 Italian Navy F-35B short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) platforms. The document says the move will be made to meet the 'operational needs' of the Italian armed forces and will bring the country's total fleet up to 115 aircraft, according to an online translation. Though that's still short of a targeted 131-plane fleet, it says the buy will 'improve Italy's geopolitical positioning' in the context of European security. (F-35 maker Lockheed Martin says that Rome currently has 60 F-35As and 30 F-35Bs.) Funding of €1.9 billion ($2.1 billion) has already been allocated to support the F-35 order, alongside €60 million ($67 million) for 'adaptation' at Grottaglie air base, which is being prepared to host Italian Navy F-35B jets. Additionally, 24 Eurofighters, built to the new Tranche 4 configuration, are to be procured as a replacement for 26 older Tranche 1 models, designated F-2000 in Italian service, at an estimated cost of €6.9 billion ($7.7 billion). The older Typhoons are set to be phased out in 2029. Approval for a ministerial decree for such an acquisition is currently 'in progress,' the spending document says. The plan to acquire additional Typhoons formally commenced in July, based off a government motion to do so, reported Janes. Elsewhere, the spending document reveals that a payment of €550 million ($611 million) has been committed to by Italy for the sixth-generation Global Combat Air Programme (GCAP) with the UK and Japan, though there is no indication of how the funding will be spent exactly. That investment in GCAP R&amp;D 'aims to guarantee' Italy's position in the international program and to allow local industry access to 'final development,' of the future fighter, the document says.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/italy-plans-out-15b-plus-spending-on-dozens-of-f-35s-and-eurofighters/	2024-09-18T07:20:04-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/6665223-e1726662155775.jpg
Air Force cyber official says AI could help DAF sort through nearly 2.5 million daily cybersecurity alerts	U.S. Air Force Lt. Gen. Thomas Hensley, 16th Air Force commander, is greeted by Col. Craig Bailey, 9th Maintenance Group commander, on Beale Air Force Base, California, Aug. 24, 2023. Maj. Gen. Hensley visited the 9th MXG during an infrastructure tour of Beale AFB and was briefed on how the U-2 Dragonlady functions. (U.S. Air Force photo by Senior Airman Alexis Pentzer) Lt. Gen. Thomas Hensley, commander of the 16th Air Force, the service’s information warfare organization, said the Department of the Air Force (DAF), which includes the Space Force, receives an overwhelming nearly 2.5 million cybersecurity alerts each day. And, he said, that number will only grow as the DAF connects more weapon systems and more battle management systems. 'So AI/ML, [will] take all of this data, do the metadata analysis, do the content triage and filter up the information that only human beings can do, and that's the nuanced, focused, analytical work,' Hensley told Breaking Defense in an interview at the Air, Space and Cyber Conference Tuesday. Regarding the popular concern that AI is going to succeed in taking over human jobs, Hensley said, 'this is not the case.' 'It's going to help human beings do their job better,' Hensley said, adding that hiring more people to monitor and analyze the millions of cyber alerts a day is not a viable solution. 'What I tell people is we're not going to mass [hire] our way out of this. We're not going to be able to hire more people to monitor all the sensors, and so we've got to be smarter with the technology that we have,' he said. The idea of an AI or ML platform that could sort through and analyze data at a basic level may not be too far fetched for the DAF. It previously released a large language model for Airmen, Guardians, civilians and contractors called the Non-classified Internet Protocol Generative Pre-training Transformer, or NIPRGPT, which serves as the DAF’s rendition of the popular public generative AI known as ChatGPT. NIRPGPT’s goal is to help users with communications and more mundane tasks on a secure system. While the DAF is focused on implementing AI and ML capabilities for speed and efficiency purposes, Hensley emphasized cybersecurity will remain a focused priority. He said the cutting edge systems must have cybersecurity 'baked in from the beginning' if they want to withstand today’s information warfare environment, a philosophy he mentioned has been a critical lesson learned from the war in Ukraine. 'I think the key there is starting with cybersecurity, protecting your information. That is the foundation of all that we do. So whether it's, you know, using our day-to-day computer to do day-to-day work, or it's the weapon systems that we employ, it's the battle management systems that we utilize, we have to protect the networks,' he said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/air-force-cyber-official-says-ai-could-help-daf-sort-through-nearly-2-5-million-daily-cybersecurity-alerts/	2024-09-18T06:02:08-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/7995666-scaled-e1726608345988.jpg
Space Force chief: Commercial imagery analysis aided Niger withdrawal — just don’t call it ‘intel’	U.S. Air Force Tech. Sgt.

(U.S. Air Force photo by Senior Airman Amanda Jett) AFA 2024 — A Space Force pilot program provided rapid 'situational awareness' reports, written by commercial imagery analysis firms, to security forces on the ground during the US military’s recently completed withdrawal from Niger, the Chief of Space Operations said here this morning. 'Last February, I told you we're kicking off a pilot program for tactical surveillance, reconnaissance and tracking for TacSRT,' he told a standing-room-only audience at the Air Force Association’s massive annual conference. 'This $40 million effort was intended to support AFRICOM requirements … [and] complement the exquisite work done by the intelligence community with unclassified operational planning products delivered on tactically relevant timelines.' Since then, the pilot has provided updates on flooding in Kenya and extremists in central Africa, Saltzman said. 'But,' he said, 'the thing that stands out most to me was the Space Forces Europe used TacSRT to support us forces as they completed their withdrawal from Air Base 201 in Niger [this] August.' 'Throughout the withdrawal, the team maintained overwatch of everything within five kilometers of the base,' he said. 'On average, the timeline from collection on orbit to delivery into the hands of security forces was about three and a half hours — but the team got it down to as little as one and a half hours … by the end of the event.' Peppered with reporters’ questions at a subsequent roundtable, Saltzman took pains to distinguish what TacSRT did from traditional intelligence provided by US spy agencies, let alone military targeting. 'This is not like traditional collection and purchase of imagery, It’s something different,' he emphasized. 'It’s not about targeting. This is about providing situational awareness.' Saltzman may have been treading carefully here because of ongoing tension over whether Space Force was treading on others' space imagery turf. EXCLUSIVE: GMTI emerges as new front in Space Force-NGA turf battle Under current law and policy, the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) has responsibility for buying imagery from private firms, while the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) buys commercial analytic products, such as computer models and digital maps. (In fact, NGA just announced a contract for them worth up to $290 million.) At least some officials at these long-established satellite intelligence agencies have pushed back against the Space Force's ambitions for commercial satellite imagery. Saltzman has touted how Space Systems Command has provided 'near-real time information and support' in earthquakes, floods, and wildfires around the world. TacSRT, he said, 'was a pathfinder, with the idea being that we could expand the program if it proved to be value added, and that's exactly what it did.' Through a virtual 'marketplace' of vetted commercial providers, Saltzman explained, the Space Force puts out broad requests and gets, not raw images, but situation reports. In the Niger case, he said, they asked for anything anomalous occurring within 'five kilometers' around the air base. 'TacSRT doesn’t buy imagery,' he said. 'What TacSRT has done, in this pilot in particular, is we simply ask a question into the marketplace: ‘Hey, what generally does it look like around Air Base 201? Are there any items of interest? Trucks that are massing, or do we see people that are milling around?' 'We simply ask the question, and commercial industry provides us products that try to help us answer the question,' he summed up. 'This is just situational awareness, again, operational planning products, not intelligence products.' Now that TacSRT has proved its value in real-world operations, Saltzman said, his plan is to scale it up. That could escalate a budgetary battle already underway in the appropriations committees on Capitol Hill. 'The next step is just giving [them] more money so we can expand,' he said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/space-force-chief-commercial-imagery-analysis-aided-niger-withdrawal-just-dont-call-it-intel/	2024-09-18T04:35:59-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/240917_DVIDS_niger_withdrawal_8576322-scaled-e1726602241808.jpg

Air Force’s interim tanker buy in limbo as service mulls next-gen refueler timeline	A KC-46A Pegasus aerial refueling aircraft connects with an F-15 Strike Eagle test aircraft from Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, on Oct. 29th, 2018. (U.S. Air Force photo by Master Sgt Michael Jackson) AFA 2024 — As industry eagerly awaits the Air Force's decision on an interim tanker plan, service officials now say the potential acquisition hinges on the fate of a different plane: the service's future next-gen tanker and, specifically, how quickly they can make it operational. In a briefing with reporters Monday, Air Force acquisition chief Andrew Hunter said the service’s efforts are now focused on completing an analysis of alternatives for the Next Generation Air-refueling System (NGAS), a future tanker concept that's currently in early stages but one that officials believe will be critical for refueling operations in contested environments like the Indo-Pacific. The results of that analysis, Hunter said, will ultimately determine the shape of the nearer-term tanker buy. The service’s most recent tanker strategy unveiled in March 2023, which called for an interim buy of roughly 75 tankers to continue recapitalizing the aging KC-135 Stratotanker, is broadly 'still the case,' Hunter emphasized during a roundtable at the Air, Space &amp; Cyber here in Washington. However, that 'construct' is 'critically dependent on getting after NGAS' and how quickly the service can field the aircraft. 'So we need to understand the NGAS part of the story to truly make additional progress on tanker recap,' Hunter said. Essentially, when the service unveiled its new tanker strategy — doing away with a three-pronged approach known as KC-X, KC-Y and KC-Z in the process — officials expected the interim purchase would buy time to field the NGAS by the mid-2030s. But as the NGAS analysis of alternatives proceeds, officials expect to get a better idea of what the NGAS program will look like, including what a realistic timeline could be. A longer timeline would, presumably, necessitate more interim capability, for instance. A congressional mandate requires the Air Force to maintain a minimum inventory of 466 tankers, the bulk of which are currently Eisenhower-era KC-135s, also known as Stratotankers. Some of that fleet is currently being replaced by Boeing’s KC-46 Pegasus, and the potential interim tanker buy, perhaps for more KC-46s or for another airframe, would continue that process and enable more KC-135 divestments. Asked whether the Air Force would be challenged to maintain KC-135s in the event the service dramatically changes the interim tanker buy or skips it altogether, Hunter replied that KC-135R variant of the aircraft would be maintained 'as necessary until we are able to replace them.' Additionally, Hunter said the service does not currently intend to propose altering the tanker inventory requirement. In a roundtable with reporters today, US Transportation Command chief Gen. Jacqueline Van Ovost stressed that she needs the Air Force to ensure KC-135s remain 'credible' in the event they need to be relied on. Van Ovost’s command formulates the number of tankers needed to fulfill war plans. 'The crews need to be trained for the high-end fight, to this contested logistics fight. And I need the capabilities to fight [with these] airplanes in the environment I intend to fly them in,' she said. As for NGAS, the Air Force has released a small number of requests for information (RFI) to industry in a bid to gather feedback on the service’s plans, the most recent coming last week for the aircraft’s mission systems. Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall said the RFI will help establish a 'competitive vendor pool' and that results could be incorporated into the rest of the tanker fleet. Hunter said that RFI demonstrated a new approach with industry, allowing the Air Force to engage vendors earlier in the process. A separate RFI for the NGAS airframe will be issued after the analysis of alternatives completes, he added. Any downward revision in the interim tanker plan, including an outright cancellation, would likely be a blow to Boeing. Hunter himself originally suggested the Air Force was leaning toward the company’s KC-46 for the interim buy, and analysts told Breaking Defense at the time that the beleaguered aerospace giant’s position only strengthened when Lockheed Martin bowed out of a partnership with Airbus to compete for the effort. Boeing’s current contract with the US Air Force for 183 KC-46s is set to complete deliveries in 2029, and a fixed-price development contract for the Pegasus has forced the company to eat over $7 billion in losses on the program. A sizable new round of procurement for the tanker, Boeing officials have said, offered a chance to help recover losses.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/air-forces-interim-tanker-buy-in-limbo-as-service-mulls-next-gen-refueler-timeline/	2024-09-17T15:42:17-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/03/4957126-scaled-e1710866898956.jpg

Boeing encountering workforce challenges amid F-15EX, Super Hornet production line changes	Boeing's F-15EX features fly by wire flight controls and new electronic warfare equipment (Boeing) WASHINGTON — Workforce fluctuations as Boeing ramps up F-15EX production and sunsets the F/A-18 Super Hornet line are driving up cost and inefficiency, and recovery from those challenges will not be immediate, the head of the company’s fighter programs told Breaking Defense today. 'It will take time — we’re rebuilding a workforce that needs the experience,' said Mark Sears, Boeing’s vice president for fighters. '[In] aviation, the learning curve is steep in terms of how people learn how to do this work — F-15 in particular [and] these older platforms is even harder. And so for F-15, you can be a good mechanic, but it's mostly about the number of times you do a job that makes you a good mechanic.' Over the past year, Boeing has decreased the number of mechanics working on the Super Hornet from 300 to 200 workers as production of the aircraft slows down, Sears said. That has forced the remaining employees to take on an additional portion of the workshare. Conversely, on the F-15EX where production is increasing from a rate of one aircraft to about 1.5 aircraft per month, Boeing has added about 150 new mechanics this year, who are working on the aircraft for the first time and are still building proficiency. 'There's a significant learning curve on F-15,' Sears said. 'If you walk the F-15 [production] line, it's kind of like a museum of what aerospace manufacturing is. You start in the back of the line, looks like it did in 1969. You go to the forward part of the line, where we just digitally remastered the forward fuselage, and that's advanced modern manufacturing techniques.' Last week, Boeing Chief Financial Officer Brian West said that the company expects margins to be negative at its defense division for the third quarter due, in part, to higher-than-expected costs associated with the shifting production outputs on the F-15EX and F/A-18 lines. Boeing eventually intends to increase production of the F-15EX to two fighters per month, but the company won’t see output at that level until around 2026, Sears said. Meanwhile, the Super Hornet line is set to close down in 2027. Sears noted that the production issues at Boeing are further complicated by its supply chain, which has seen a similar shift in its blue-collar workforce since the COVID-19 pandemic, with some suppliers noting that the average level of experience has dropped from around 20 years to six years. The company is taking some steps to try to drive up production efficiency on the F-15EX line. First, the company is redesigning certain portions of the airplane that are difficult to build, bringing those elements in line with modern manufacturing techniques. The balance there, however, is ensuring that those design changes are significant enough to improve ease of assembly while not triggering the need for the Air Force to perform additional flight testing, Sears said. One example is the F-15’s center fuselage, which is broken into five main sections. The company is redesigning one of those segments — the most complex part of the structure because of how the plane’s landing gear is affixed to it, he said. 'It’s area where, when we make a defect, if we have a defect … it is the most complex part of the airplane for us to have to analyze, to disposition it, to tell them how to fix it,' Sears said. Boeing is also rewriting all its production and technical manuals to simplify instructions for new mechanics, but it will take a couple years to get through all 14,000 jobs on the line, Sears said. 'We're starting in the most complex areas first with the oldest engineering that we're trying to simplify, and then we'll work our way up to the most modern parts and engineering, which shouldn't be as much of a change,' he said. Earlier this year, Boeing announced plans to buy GKN Aerospace’s St. Louis-area facility and absorb its workforce. The plant, which was once part of McDonnell Douglas before that company was acquired by Boeing, is the sole source of about 100 parts used on the F/A-18 and F-15. 'We've always had kind of a shared destiny with that site, and now that it's part of The Boeing Company again, the merger of that back into the organization has gone well,' Sears said. 'The performance has not degraded and probably improved, and the collaboration between us and the site has gone really well.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/boeing-encountering-workforce-challenges-amid-f-15ex-super-hornet-production-line-changes/	2024-09-17T13:23:30-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/DSC_4278-scaled-e1725903116738.jpg
Sweden moves to ramp up defense spending by $1.3 billion in 2025	A US Air Force MC-130J Commando II conducts surface ship rendezvous with a Swedish Visby-class corvette and the USS Ross as the ships exercise anti-surface and anti-submarine warfare (US Army) BELFAST — Sweden plans on increasing defense spending by 13 billion SEK ($1.3 billion) next year by adding a proposal for the new funds to its 2025 state budget. The uplift will take the Nordic nation's annual military spending in 2025 to 138 billion SEK, equivalent to 2.4 percent GDP, which is above NATO's minimum defense spending target. Additionally, Stockholm is proposing a long term ramp up in spending, amounting to more than 170 SEK billion in extra funding between 2025-2030. The new pledge also includes a forecast of reaching 2.6 percent GDP spending on defense in 2028. The latest commitments are in line with recommendations made in a Swedish Defence Commission report earlier this year, which advocated for 'increased ambition' militarily, in light of Russia's war in Ukraine and Stockholm's entry to NATO. In a statement today, the Swedish government was clear about the need for the spending plan. 'The security situation demands a stronger defence,' it said. 'Russia’s war against Ukraine is a defining factor for security in Sweden’s neighbourhood. As the Budget Bill makes clear, the Government proposes significant resource increases to strengthen Sweden’s defence capabilities and enable extensive growth of the country’s total defence.' Stockholm also added that as part of proposals for a total defense bill it plans on proposing 'significant resource increases for the country's armed forces between 2025-2035, 'in accordance' with the Defence Commission’s report on strengthening national defense capabilities. Today we announce that the 🇸🇪government will increase the Swedish military budget next year by 13 billion SEK (+10%), bringing the total amount to 138 billion SEK. Sweden’s military budget will therefore reach 2,4% of GDP in 2025. (1/7) pic.twitter.com/anrreLNljM &mdash; Pål Jonson (@PlJonson) September 17, 2024 Sweden's new statement did not single out any acquisitions that will receive new investment or service level modernization, but as Stockholm is set to honor the Commission's guidance, changes on the way are likely to include the Swedish Army moving to three mechanized brigades and one infantry brigade by 2030; upscaling air defense capabilities to counter drones; and additional orders of air-to-air and cruise missiles. In a series of posts related to the spending plan on X (formerly Twitter), Pål Jonson, Sweden's defense minister, urged NATO-affiliated 'European allies' to 'assume a larger responsibility for Europe’s security.' Sweden has already started contributing to the alliance, and subject to parliamentary approval, noted today's statement, will also play a role in future alliance air surveillance missions and add to standing maritime forces. Improvements to funding for Ukraine will also see a new 'framework' established for 2024-2026, with total military aid for Kyiv pushed to 25 billion SEK per year. Meanwhile, Jonson said that the Swedish government is 'adding funds' to the Swedish Defence Research Agency so the organization can look further into disruptive technologies. He further stated that the total defense bill will be presented to parliament 'next month.' Bloomberg reported Monday that Sweden had agreed to lead a new NATO base for forward land forces in Finland in partnership with its Nordic neighbor. The location of the base was not disclosed by Stockholm or Helsinki.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/sweden-moves-to-ramp-up-defense-spending-by-1-3-billion-in-2025/	2024-09-17T12:25:10-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/6424417-scaled-e1726593315486.jpg
More than a ‘paperwork exercise’: Air Force reoptimization plan moving forward	AETC head Lt. Gen. Brian Robinson in a file photo (DVIDS) AFA 2024 — The Air Force’s overall plan to reorganize under the heading of 'reoptimization' for great power competition is inching forward, with officials using this week’s Air and Space Forces Association to make the case for why stark organizational changes are needed. The reoptimization should, as Air Education and Training Command (AETC) chief Lt. Gen. Brian Robinson put it, emphasize 'mission over function,' breaking down longstanding stovepipes that separate warfighters — and the associated training, wargaming and experimentation — with acquisition. At a panel today, Robinson told a story about a visit by Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall to AETC in November 2022. At one point during the visit, Kendall 'looked over at me in the conversation, [and asked] ‘How are we going to train on the CCAs?' And my answer back was, Mr. Secretary, what is a CCA?' The visit would have taken place before the Collaborative Combat Aircraft concept came to dominate public discussion as the future of American airpower, but Robinson acknowledged the nervous laughs from the crowd as the right reaction. At the time, Robinson said, CCA was more of an acquisition issue and not yet something for which airmen seemed to need to be trained — the kind of assumption the reoptimization hopes to dispel. 'We've got to be holistically integrated in that way, thinking about the entire mission setting,' Robinson said, adding that the CCA program has now done a much better job of integration across the service. One key effort under the Air Force’s reoptimization drive is the creation of a new Integrated Capabilities Command (ICC), which officials have said will assume the role of crafting the service’s requirements. A related Integrated Capabilities Office, opened by the Air Force in July, will largely advise senior leaders on acquisitions with a specific focus on Kendall’s operational imperatives. Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Allvin intended to stand the office up this year, and made a step toward that goal during the conference here. The service has now opened a 'provisional' ICC with a staff of about 100 people working from their current locations, Allvin said Monday, and aims to eventually bring on about 800. The provisional command will be led by Maj. Gen. Mark Mitchum, though the full ICC is expected to be led by a three-star general. 'We have to have the full manning documents understood. Have do the full strategic basing process, full congressional notification, full nomination of the leadership, which is, if it's going to be a three star, has to be nominated, confirmed. So all of that will happen,' Allvin told reporters. 'I would like to have it done, the full one, within calendar year 2025.' Lt. Gens. David Harris and Dale White, who have key roles in standing up ICC, both emphasized a sense of 'urgency' to stand the office up and get work underway. Industry, operators and acquisition form a 'trinity' that will be needed to keep the Air Force up to speed to counter potential threats in the future, Harris said, with the new organization mixing experimentation, acquisitions and warfighting. 'I think those that believe this is just a paperwork exercise or org chart exercise, I think you're going to see something very different. Warfighter integration means something' real, added White. Any great power conflict, said White, is 'going to be a technologically based war. And capability development is clearly a warfighting function. We have to embrace that. We have to operate that way, and we have to organize that way.'

Honeywell to demo new kinetic, soft-kill C-UAS for Air Force	The 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment and the Threat Systems Management Office operate a swarm of 40 drones to test the rotational units capabilities during the battle of Razish, National Training Center on May 8, 2019. (US Army/Pvt. James Newsome) AFA 2024 — Early next year, the US Air Force will see a demo of a new Honeywell system that combines kinetic interceptors, directed energy and electronic warfare capabilities to protect high-value targets from swarms of inbound drones. The company used this year’s Air &amp; Space Forces Association conference outside of Washington, DC, to announce its Stationary and Mobile Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) Reveal and Intercept capability that cobbles together host technologies from other vendors. In a subsequent statement to Breaking Defense, a Honeywell spokesperson said the system marries up radar, electro-optical/infrared, and artificial intelligence detectors, and then knocks the drones down by either launching a kinetic interceptor, using a directed energy weapon or severing the radio contact back to the controller. 'This system’s multi-layered defensive capabilities set it apart in the industry and enable it to not only track and detect, but also defeat multiple threats,' Milas said in the press release. The Air Force Global Strike team has now tasked Honeywell with demonstrating the system in January 2025, at which time the C-UAS system will be used to first detect an unspecified number of drones moving at a high speed before disabling them. The growing role of drones on the battlefield inside Ukraine and in the Middle East has not only pushed the US military to ramp up its hunt for new capabilities, but also systems to defeat them. Part of that focus has revolved around existing kinetic options like Stinger missiles, while also testing out new directed energy ones like high-energy laser and high-powered microwaves that may one day drive provide a cheaper per unit kill option.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/honeywell-to-demo-new-kinetic-soft-kill-c-uas-for-air-force/	2024-09-17T11:32:35-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/220309_DVIDS_drone_swarm_5356116-scaled-e1664320365372.jpg
Northrop releases new software, hardware ‘ecosystem’ aimed at CJADC2-style integration	Hardware components of Northrop Grumman's NG InSight suite of integration and communication products. (Carley Welch / Breaking Defense) AFA 2024 — Northrop Grumman says it has developed a new product line, coined NG InSight, that it's calling a 'modular ecosystem' of software and hardware designed to connect, well, just about everything. 'So the key is really integrating across different domains, services, partner nations, so it brings together capabilities,' Jenna Paukstis, vice president of the networked solutions division at Northrop, told Breaking Defense on the sidelines of the Air, Space and Cyber Conference Monday. Paukstis said the new line, which is essentially a system of systems, includes physical hardware components like open system processors, multifunction apertures and modules that can be plugged into both new and legacy platforms manufactured by anyone, not just Northrop. These hardware components can go on airborne platforms, ground-based terrestrial systems, maritime systems and some of the cryptologic and advanced intelligence capabilities which are part of smaller components, can go into space on payloads, she added. On the software side, the product line includes tech dedicated to signals intelligence, communications, networking and other non-kinetic effects like electronic warfare capabilities, which Paukstis said can operate in a secure, 'resilient' manner, allowing for information sharing in contested and congested environments. 'Now the Air Force, ground and maritime forces, if they can rely on high-speed, low-latency connectivity from space, what missions can they now do with that connectivity?' Pauksitis asked. 'So now you can get access to critical data when and where you need it in a secure and adaptable setting.' These software components also serve both defensive and offensive purposes. Offensively, NG InSight is capable of non-kinetic effects that are 'essential for disrupting, deceiving or neutralizing adversarial capabilities, allowing forces to weaken enemy operations while protecting friendly assets,' a Northrop press release read. On defense, the release says the ecosystem enables 'the rapid interception, processing and analysis of adversaries, providing critical intelligence that can shape battlefield outcomes with speed and precision.' For all Northrop says the family of systems can do, Paukstis highlighted its flexibility as a selling point. 'So you can think about developing this product line of capabilities that you can then reuse, which helps with the speed. It also helps with affordability. But of course, every customer needs it slightly different, right? So you can put that together and tailor it based on their mission needs.' The US military has long sought simpler ways to connect countless assets around the world, a key demand of its sprawling Combined Joint All-Domain Command and Control (CJADC2) program, which works to create an all-seeing, all-connected battle network. Northrop is positioning NG InSight as a one-stop shop solution for CJADC2's 'information layer.' 'To achieve CJADC2 we have to seamlessly integrate 4th and 5th generation platforms and be able to communicate across services and domains with a focus on speed and scalability,' a Northrop spokesperson said in an email to Breaking Defense. 'NG InSight does just that — we increase the ability to &#8216;Fight Tonight' by rapidly upgrading existing platforms with near-term technology enhancements for electronic warfare, communications, networking, geolocation, targeting and multifunction sensors.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/northrop-releases-new-software-hardware-ecosystem-aimed-at-cjadc2-style-integration/	2024-09-17T10:49:22-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/240917_northrop_insight_box_WELCH-scaled-e1726595250934.jpg
Russia ‘should know better’ than to put an anti-satellite nuke in space, NORAD chief says	Russian President Vladimir Putin delivers a speech during his visit at the Vostochny cosmodrome, some 180 km north of Blagoveschensk, Amur region on April 12, 2022. (Photo by YEVGENY BIYATOV/Sputnik/AFP via Getty Images) AFA 2024 — A senior US military official said today that it's 'highly concerning' that Russia is apparently considering putting an anti-satellite nuclear weapon in space — a threat that, if realized, 'would affect virtually every man, woman and child on Earth.' 'Russia is the OG [original gangster] space power. They put up Sputnik, the first man, the first woman in space. They know better; they should know better,' NORAD commander Gen. Gregory Guillot said, saying the weapon would be a 'violation' of the 1967 Outer Space Treaty. 'Secondly, it's indiscriminate. It's not just going to potentially affect US satellites. It will affect Russian satellites, Chinese satellites, Indian satellites, European satellites, Japanese satellites. Those kind of impacts will have real repercussions for those of us here on planet Earth. 'So, the world can’t and shouldn't accept that somebody would place a nuclear weapon in orbit,' he told an audience at the Air, Space &amp; Cyber Conference in Washington. This spring the Biden administration, citing 'credible information,' accused Russia of using a satellite in orbit to conduct tests that could presage the placement of a nuclear-armed anti-satellite weapon. 'The United States has been aware of Russia’s pursuit of this sort of capability dating back years, but only recently have we been able to make a more precise assessment of their progress,' Mallory Stewart, assistant secretary for the Bureau of Arms Control, Deterrence, and Stability, told the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in May. Stewart noted that Russia claimed the satellite already in orbit was only there for 'scientific purposes,' but the US government suspected otherwise based in part on the satellite's unusual altitude. In earlier testimony before Congress, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Space Policy John Plumb said a Russian space-based nuclear capability 'could pose a threat to all satellites operated by countries and companies around the globe, as well as to the vital communications, scientific, meteorological, agricultural, commercial, and national security services we all depend upon. Russia has dismissed the accusation as 'fake news,' but the denial does not appear to have changed the conclusions of US space officials. On Tuesday Lt. Gen. Douglas, the commander of US Space Forces — Space, listed various threats that have emerged to US assets in orbit since the founding of the Space Force in 2019. Among them, he said, 'we have a possible threat from Russia on maybe a nuclear capability in space.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/russia-should-know-better-than-to-put-an-anti-satellite-nuke-in-space-norad-chief-says/	2024-09-17T10:37:53-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/240917_putin_rocket_GettyImages-1239929978-scaled-e1726593428608.jpg
Not a one-way street: DoD will receive, not just give, data to Commerce’s space traffic system	The Satellite Dashboard is an example of an open source tool to monitor close approaches of satellites and debris in space, produced by the Center for Strategic and International Security, the Secure World Foundation, and the University of Texas at Austin. (Satellite Dashboard) AMOS 2024 — While the Commerce Department's new space monitoring system for non-military users will rely heavily on data from the Defense Department, especially in its initial stages, the Pentagon also will eventually benefit from commercial data obtained by the Traffic Coordination System for Space (TraCSS), according to Commerce officials. 'DoD is going to be a TraCSS user, and they're going to have rule-based access to the data that they need to extract — which mainly at this point is the owner/operator ephems [ephemeris]. Because we're ingesting owner/operator ephems, they won't be ingesting them in Space-Track.org anymore,' Sandy Magnus, chief engineer at the Office of Space Commerce (OCS) said Monday. A satellite ephemeris is a set of data that provides the location of a satellite at specific times. based on observations and analytical models, and are used to provide space situational awareness (SSA). Space Force's 18th Space Control Squadron manages Space-Track.org, which currently provides rough ephemeris of the some 47,000 satellites and dangerous space junk tracked by US Space Command (SPACECOM) via telescopes and radar. Speaking to Breaking Defense along with several other OCS officials in the margins of the annual Advanced Maui Optical and Space Surveillance Technologies (AMOS) Conference in Hawaii, Magnus explained that her office will provide all the software Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) the Space Force and SPACECOM will need to 'extract' that unclassified commercial data from TraCSS. But DoD will be responsible for ensuring that data is translated into formats usable by military operators. 'They're going to do whatever magic thing they have to do on the DoD side to get it back in their classified catalog, or wherever they keep it,' she said. Commerce officials stressed that DoD is providing only its unclassified data about the whereabouts of space objects to TraCSS, although some of that information also might be 'controlled unclassified information,' of CUI. Under DoD policy, which is somewhat controversial, information dubbed as CUI isn't shareable with private operators for various reasons, including national security concerns. So, while satellite ephemeris data and other basic data about satellite functionality will be freely available once the TraCSS website is up and running, the full TraCSS database of collision warnings won't be, the OCS officials said. Instead, TraCSS will provide what are known as 'conjunction data messages' or CDMs — essentially, warnings that a satellite is likely to come close to another space objects and thus there may be a possibility of a collision — to the commercial or foreign government owner/operators involved. That said, TraCSS will go above and beyond DoD's current CDM process by publicly providing the specifics of a potential crash in what are deemed emergency situations, explained Mariel Borowitz, OCS director of international SSA engagement. 'When those events are above some threshold of risk, so they get termed to be emergency events, then we're going to make those open and so that's a change from what's been in the past,' she said. 'I think that is a significant difference from the status quo today.' OCS has a study ongoing to figure out what the threshold for an emergency is, which, for example, would include the predicted probability of a collision. The study is bouncing off of NASA research done about a decade ago, but using updated information about the environment, the Commerce officials explained. It is expected to be finished by the end of the year. OCS Director Richard DalBello noted that developing criteria to judge what makes sense and how to 'value what exists' before determining operational parameters for TraCSS is 'the logic that has underpinned all of the work we've done.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/not-a-one-way-street-dod-will-receive-not-just-give-data-to-commerces-space-traffic-system/	2024-09-17T07:59:38-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/220126_csis_space_dashboard.png
NGA picks 10 commercial firms to compete for $290M pot for unclassified data analytics	An image of Qinhuangdao Port (coal terminal), Qinhuangdao, Hebei, China, February 20, 2023, taken by Planet's SkySat constellation. (Image credit: Planet) WASHINGTON — The National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGA) has tapped 10 commercial space and data crunching companies to provide unclassified computer vision and artificial intelligence-based analytic services under a contract vehicle worth up to $290 million over five years. Under the Luno A indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) award, each of the vendors will compete for tasking orders from NGA designed to help agency personnel improve its intel products — which then are disseminated to users in the national security community from the president to Pentagon leaders to military commanders in the field. 'Luno A provides national security community users with access to the commercial data and analytic services that add new context to analytic assessments by characterizing things such as worldwide economic, environmental and military activities. Deliverables will be driven by validated user requirements, mission-specific and responsive to the community’s needs,' NGA said in a Sept. 13 press release. RELATED: Ursa Major wins, matches $12.5M investment from DoD to improve solid rocket motor production Information gathered primarily from commercial remote sensing satellites will include, for example, data about economic development around the world and environmental crises as well as information about foreign military capabilities. The unclassified information gathered under Luno A will be integrated with that from other NGA sources, including classified sources, as best seen fit by the analysts working with it, an agency spokesperson told Breaking Defense in January when it made a request for industry proposals. Likewise, the spokesperson said intel 'will be shared with partners, allies, and customers through a variety of mechanisms, depending on the specific mission need being met.' The 10 chosen companies are: An NGA spokesperson told Breaking Defense in a Sept. 13 email that the agency has yet to issue any individual task orders under Luno A.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/nga-picks-10-commercial-firms-to-compete-for-290m-pot-for-unclassified-data-analytics/	2024-09-17T06:00:48-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/01/Screen-Shot-2024-01-22-at-1.30.07-PM-e1705948890725.png
Ursa Major wins, matches $12.5M investment from DoD to improve solid rocket motor production	Navy Strategic Systems Programs (SSP) conducted a successful test of the Second Stage Solid Rocket Motor (SRM) on August 25th in Promontory, Utah as part of the development of the Navy’s Conventional Prompt Strike (CPS) offensive hypersonic strike capability and the Army’s Long Range Hypersonic Weapon (LRHW). (US Navy photo) WASHINGTON — Ursa Major, a Colorado-based privately funded defense contractor, announced today it will match a $12.5 million investment from the Pentagon to begin work on maturing its solid rocket motor manufacturing process. The initial Defense Department investment stems from the Office of Strategic Capital, a Pentagon office focused on strengthening critical supply chain technologies, and the work will be done in conjunction with the US Navy’s Program Executive Office for Integrated Warfare Systems. Breaking Defense sought a comment from the Navy, which deferred to the Office of Strategic Capital. A spokesperson for OSC did not respond to a request for comment by press time. 'We are proud to work with OSC on their mandate for expanding the defense industrial base by bringing new innovations into the DoD ecosystem,' Dan Jablonsky, Ursa Major CEO, said in a company statement. 'Ursa Major is revolutionizing manufacturing approaches used in propulsion development in the United States, building flexibility of production and scalability into manufacturing for our defense customers.' The work, which was initially awarded in July, will focus on propellant manufacturing, additive manufacturing and composite case winding, the statement added. Separately, Ursa Major announced in April it was working with the Navy to apply its manufacturing process for the Mk104 Dual Thrust Rocket Motor, which is used on the service’s SM-2, SM-3 and SM-6 missiles. The announcement comes as numerous defense tech companies are all eyeing the solid rocket motor industry. Breaking Defense previously reported that Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics struck a deal to partner on the technology, Anduril made acquisitions to enter the space, and Northrop Grumman launched an innovation campaign around SRMs. It’s also among the first big public pushes by the Office of Strategic Capital, a relatively new office introduced by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin during the 2022 Reagan National Defense Forum and aimed specifically at infusing private capital into defense tech startups. 'Our partners in the private sector have flagged a consistent problem,' Austin said at the time. 'Even when they can see a way to deliver a promising technology to a military customer, securing the necessary capital to scale is hard — and sometimes impossible. So we’ve listened, and we’ve acted.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/ursa-major-wins-matches-12-5m-investment-from-dod-to-improve-solid-rocket-motor-production/	2024-09-16T21:01:16-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/08/210825-N-NO191-0002-e1726510358325.jpg
News on CCA, next-gen fighter from day one of AFA [VIDEO]	AFA 2024 — Day one of the annual Air and Space Forces Association conference is in the books. And while there wasn't a single major piece of news that dominated the day, there were plenty of tidbits and hints about where the Air Force is going with its key modernization programs. Breaking Defense Editor-in-Chief Aaron Mehta and Air Warfare Reporter Michael Marrow of Breaking Defense give you the run down on what you need to know from the show floor and preview day two, in the video above.

CCA drones may not be tied to NGAD, need line-of-sight control: Kendall	Frank Kendall, secretary of the US Air Force, speaks during the US Chamber of Commerce's Global Aerospace Summit in Washington, DC, US, on Tuesday, Sept. 10, 2024. (Ting Shen/Bloomberg via Getty Images) AFA 2024 — As the US Air Force goes back to the drawing board to decide what it wants from its much-anticipated next-gen fighter jet, the Air Force secretary revealed today the plane may not be called on to play quarterback for a coterie of loyal wingman drones as originally envisioned. Frank Kendall said that while his service is 'moving towards greater reliance on uncrewed aircraft,' it was a 'question mark' as to whether the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) fighter would control the Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) drones. Kendall made the remarks at a roundtable at the Air and Space Forces Association Air, Space & Cyber annual conference here in Washington, where last year he described NGAD and CCA in terms that suggested nearly intertwined programs — with aircraft numbers based in relation to one another. CCAs were also envisioned operating with current fighters like the F-35. But since then the Air Force has paused development of NGAD and reexamined basic assumptions about the aircraft — even, apparently, absolute certainty it would have a human pilot on board. ('We're probably going to do one more version, at least, of crewed, more traditional aircraft,' he said today.) Kendall did say that any fighter jet controlling CCAs would be manned, noting 'I don't see us going away from that combination anytime soon.' Kendall also revealed new details about how CCAs, expected to be fielded before the end of the decade, will operate. He said the Air Force previously envisioned a single fighter controlling roughly three-to-five CCA drones, but the service is 'talking about bigger numbers than that now.' The secretary also has previously told Breaking Defense the Air Force is still working out thorny ethical issues associated with employing the drones, and explained today that some operational limits should be expected as a result. 'One of the things you have to have if you're going to use CCAs and have them be armed and lethal is that they have to be under tight control. And for me, one of the elements of that needs to be line-of-sight communications,' Kendall said. Line-of-sight communications refers to direct links between a transmitter and receiver without obstructions like the curvature of the earth. 'We're not going to have aircraft going out and doing engagements uncontrolled, so the default, if they lose communications, would be for them to return to base, which takes them out of the fight,' he continued. 'So we don't want that to happen. And when they do do engagements, we want them under tight control.' NGAD Cost While work on NGAD remains stalled, Kendall said today a decision on what to do with the fighter should be reached within the next few months, despite numerous variables that officials have to weigh. One key factor officials have to balance is price, as more expensive options could prevent the service from fielding the fighter in sufficient numbers. Kendall today doubled down on aiming for a cost target roughly in the ballpark of an F-35, arguing that — assuming NGAD does, in fact, control loyal wingmen — 'once you start integrating CCAs and transferring some mission equipment and capabilities functions to the CCAs, then you can talk about a different concept, potentially, for the crewed fighter that's controlling them.' Air Force acquisition chief Andrew Hunter stressed in a later roundtable with reporters today that the service is 'looking for an affordable design concept' for NGAD that in turn would enable the jet to be fielded 'in sufficient numbers.' Hunter conceded that it’s possible the cost target can’t be reached, though he emphasized that analysis has to finish first. And, Kendall said, the Air Force will field the fighter even if a more expensive option proves to be the most cost-effective. A team of advisors led by Tim Grayson, a special assistant to Kendall, is looking at the NGAD platform in a wider context to include the role for a next-gen tanker and future tranches of CCA, Kendall said. Yet even after all of those questions are settled, underlying technological concerns may not be the biggest challenge. 'Then by the way, we’ve got to figure out how we’re going to pay for it, which I think may, at the end of the day, be our biggest problem,' Kendall said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/cca-drones-may-not-be-tied-to-ngad-need-line-of-sight-control-kendall/	2024-09-16T16:33:57-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/240916_kendall_global_aerospace_GettyImages-2170543390-scaled-e1726528408175.jpg
Del Toro warns appropriators of widespread delays for Navy if 6-month CR passes	The Virginia-class attack submarine Minnesota (SSN 783) is under construction at Huntington Ingalls Newport News Shipbuilding. (U.S. Navy photo courtesy of Newport News Shipbuilding/Released) WASHINGTON — Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro warned congressional appropriators that numerous high-profile shipbuilding efforts — Columbia and Virginia-class submarines as well as certain aircraft carriers — would suffer programmatic setbacks if lawmakers pass a six-month continuing resolution. 'This lengthy delay in new funding would force the Department of the Navy to operate at last year's funding levels with the negative consequences lasting far beyond the time frame of the CR, impeding our ability to field the force needed to defend our nation while imposing unnecessary stress on our sailors, Marines, civilians, and their families,' he wrote in a letter dated Sept. 12 and made public by Del Toro's office today. Under a six-month CR, according to Del Toro, both the Virginia- and Columbia-class programs would face schedule delays or postponed construction cycles. 'A six-month CR risks delaying critical investments in the submarine industrial base and the Australia, United Kingdom, and United States (AUKUS) partnership,' he wrote. The half-year CR would also further delay the John C. Stennis (CVN-74), an aircraft carrier that has been undergoing its mid-life overhaul for more than five years and is past due to return to the fleet. The secretary further wrote there would be delays to the 'ongoing and planning Nuclear Command, Control and Communications engineering activities' being done in conjunction with US Strategic Command as well as development and procurement of conventional munitions. In total, Del Toro said 20 construction projects, five research and development efforts, up to 58 ship maintenance availabilities, as well as procurement of five ships and various aircraft and munitions programs would also be set back under the six-month CR. 'The Department of the Navy stands ready to assist Congress in any way possible to ensure it has the information and resources to pass this essential legislation' he wrote.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/del-toro-warns-appropriators-of-widespread-delays-for-navy-if-6-month-cr-passes/	2024-09-16T15:13:21-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/11/231108_DVIDS_submarine_construction_820194-e1699443296744.jpg
Space Development Agency eyes laser link between different contractors’ birds	A trail of a group of SpaceX's Starlink satellites passing over Uruguay. (Photo by MARIANA SUAREZ/AFP via Getty Images) AFA 2024 — As of this weekend, York Space Systems has gotten the laser communications system working on their recently launched satellites for the Space Force’s nascent Low Earth Orbit network, the director of the Space Development Agency said this morning. The next step, Derek Tournear told reporters, is to get York’s satellites linked by laser to SpaceX’s birds. The two contractors have gotten their tech to connect successfully in extensive, rigorous tests on the ground, he said, which gives him confidence that they can now make it work in space. But it really had better work, because the stakes are make-or-break for SDA’s ambitious Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture (PWSA). 'I'm excited to report that, over the weekend, York was able to get optical communication networking working on their satellites,' Tournear told reporters. 'Now we have both a set of transport satellites and a set of tracking satellites with the optical connectivity.' 'The next step on that, obviously, is to have the York and SpaceX satellites talk to one another and form a complete mesh network,' he said. 'It’s critical that it works.' Why so serious? 'The whole idea' of PWSA, he said, is to move away from traditional Pentagon 'stovepipes,' where different government agencies and armed services hire different contractors to build different systems using different protocols that can’t share data without elaborate kludges or painstaking manual re-entry. Instead, PWSA is meant to use what’s known as open architecture, where everything can talk to everything else and any company can plug-and-play its products as long as they meet certain common standards. This kind of seamless machine-to-machine exchange of data is critical to the Pentagon’s emerging global battle network, known as CJADC2. In more civilian terms, PWSA’s open architecture is meant to function a lot like the app store on a smart phone – except it (a) includes hardware, not just software, and (b) has to work in wartime while hurtling through space at just under five miles per second. 'I describe PWSA, the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture, as the Android model, right?' Tournear explained. As the government, he said, 'we endorse interfaces and standards between them, we set up a test bed, [specifically] our optical test bed that’s at Naval Research Laboratory, [where] vendors have to bring their equipment, plug it into NRL, and show that they can talk to the gold standard – the government gold standard – as well as the other vendors to make sure all that works.' As long as a company’s tech meets the compatibility standards so it works when plugged in to the wider network, Tournear emphasized, the government doesn’t care how it works or need to know any sensitive trade secrets, a perennial sticking point in Pentagon IT contracts. 'We don’t care what’s in the black box behind that interface,' he said. 'The whole point of this PSWA [approach] is to build up a market, where we have multiple vendors to keep the price low [and] keep the innovation pushing forward. So if we get vendor lock, if only one works, or if they can't talk to each others, that falls apart pretty quickly.' Tournear said he is confident the tech will work on orbit, because it’s been tested so thoroughly on the ground. 'I deem this pretty low risk is because that has been where the focus of most of our systems engineering has been day to day,' he said. 'That's why we have forced them to go to NRL, to demonstrate this interoperability, to make sure it all works.' 'Obviously you want to make sure,' he said. 'But I think that the risk that it actually fails is pretty low.' Spokespeople for York and SpaceX did not immediately respond to Breaking Defense's request for comment, but assuming the laser link does work as planned, Tournear has an ambitious schedule to build out the network of numerous (aka 'proliferated') Low Earth Orbit satellites for a wide range of missions. The initial set of PWSA satellites now on orbit is called Tranche 0, and while relatively few, he said, they’re demonstrating the core capabilities all work. On the communications side, those capabilities include not only laser links — both satellite to satellite and space to ground — but also the traditional and internationally ubiquitous Link-16 protocol, which uses radio waves. 'One hundred percent of our links work' for Link-16, Tournear said. 'We've demonstrated that a lot of different platforms, including aircraft [in flight] and down to aircraft carriers at sea. All that works.' Tranche 0 surveillance satellites have also successfully tracked an array of real-world events, from missile launches to the SpaceX Starship’s reentry. 'We demonstrated that with our first set of launches, the SpaceX birds with the Leidos sensors,' Tournear said. 'We expect the L3Harris birds with the L3Harris sensors to be online and collecting data later, probably in early October.' Overall, 'Tranche 0 is an unmitigated success,' Tournear exulted. 'We've been able to check out all the boxes that we needed to prove the concept works, and then Tranche One with approximately 160 satellites — that will all be launched next year — will actually make this operational.' After that, 'Tranche 2, obviously, is in build,' he went on. '[For] Tranche 3, we passed the Warfighter Council, which is the body we use to vet all requirements. … We expect the solicitation for the integrator portion of that later this year, with the satellite solicitations to go out early next year, so we can get Tranche 3 ready to launch by the end of calendar year '28.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/space-development-agency-eyes-laser-link-between-different-contractors-birds/	2024-09-16T14:34:34-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/220830_starlink_sky_streak_GettyImages-1231167449-scaled-e1661980807658.jpg
Lockheed announces new ‘extreme range’ version of JASSM cruise missile	A model of Lockheed Martin's AGM-158 XR. (Valerie Insinna/Breaking Defense) WASHINGTON — A new 'extreme range' prototype of Lockheed Martin’s AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile could be ready for flight testing in one or two years, a company official said today. The Pentagon has not committed to buying the new weapon, known as AGM-158 XR, said Michael Rothstein, Lockheed’s vice president of air weapons and sensors. However, Lockheed is putting its own funds toward early development work on the missile, which he said could 'significantly' expand the missile’s reach past the JASSM and the Long-Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM) variants currently being produced for the Air Force and Navy. 'I can't give you any numbers at this point from a classification perspective' on the range of the weapon, Rothstein said. 'It's not minor. It's not on the edge.' Lockheed envisions the XR variant as the natural follow-up to the JASSM-D and LRASM-C3 currently in development for the Air Force and Navy. The most visible difference between AGM-158 XR and previous variants is its stretched design, but Rothstein noted that there are other 'smart' modifications internal to the missile to increase modularity. The most obvious benefit of the AGM-158 XR’s longer range is that it keeps the pilot further away from a threat. And because operators won’t have to drive in close to a target in order to strike it, it also cuts down the distance it takes for a combat aircraft to refuel and rearm — saving fuel and allowing it to conduct additional strikes over a given time period, Rothstein said. The larger, heavier size of AGM-158 XR means that it cannot be carried by the F-16 and that other aircraft like the F-35 or F-15 that could use it will not be able to fly as far, Rothstein said. But in the latter case, that impact is negated by the longer range of the weapon itself. The AGM-158 XR is still 'several years out' from being ready for fielding, Rothstein said, adding that the timing would also depend on the services’ own budget priorities. Looking at 'the operational benefits, I think the war fighters go, 'It makes perfect sense.' And then leveraging, rather than a new weapon, leveraging a hot production line [and] mature supply chain, all that makes sense, too,' Rothstein said. 'So the initial feedback we think is positive.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/lockheed-announces-new-extreme-range-version-of-jassm-cruise-missile/	2024-09-16T13:44:36-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/IMG_1718-scaled-e1726518720288.jpg

‘Partnership of convenience’: PACAF chief sees ‘potential limits’ in Chinese, Russian military ties	Chinese Vice President Han Zheng meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Vladivostok, Russia, Sept. 4, 2024. (Photo by Wang Ye/Xinhua via Getty Images) AFA 2024 — Despite China and Russia's pledges of a 'no limits' partnership and a 'new era' of cooperation, the top US air commander in the Indo-Pacific isn't quite buying it, saying there do, in fact, appear to be limits and that it's more akin to a 'partnership of convenience.' 'In terms of the exercises between [China] and Russia, I do see that there are potential limits to that cooperation,' Pacific Air Forces Commander Gen. Kevin Schneider said in a roundtable with reporters at the Air and Space Forces Association Air, Space and Cyber conference today. 'Politically, it is unclear to me their long-term goals and objectives other than to counter what the United States and allies and partners are doing.' He said he 'would describe [their cooperation] a little bit more as a partnership of convenience, vice a deep-seated connection the way that we have a connection of values with our allies and partners.' In the time since declaring their partnership just prior to Russia's invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, Beijing and Moscow have sought to deepen military ties, with the West accusing China of being a 'decisive enabler' in Russia’s ongoing war against Kyiv. Russia and China have since launched a joint, world-spanning military exercise that includes air and naval drills, which Russian President Vladimir Putin reportedly said was underway 'in the context of growing geopolitical tensions.' Schneider said today it’s too soon to offer assessments of the exercises and that full intelligence readouts would be available later. Beijing's Aggression Holds Opportunities For US Outside the Moscow connection, one key US ally in the region, the Philippines, has also had to grapple with escalating tensions with China, most recently culminating in events like when Chinese vessels rammed Philippine ships. Echoing comments from Gen. Romeo Brawner, chief of staff of the Philippines armed forces, Schneider slammed Beijing’s alleged 'illegal, coercive, aggressive and deceptive' activity that he said is conversely driving more countries to cooperate with the US. 'Allies and partners around the region are seeing with incredibly clear eyes how these challenges, how these impingements on sovereignty, how these these attacks in the diplomatic and information space are affecting them,' he said. 'More and more doors are being opened across the region and the world, as like-minded allies and partners continue to find opportunities to do more together.' Washington and Beijing recently wrapped the latest meeting of a regular security summit, where US officials have said they directly raise concerns on Chinese activity in the South China Sea, among other topics. Besides a run-in with the Philippines, which the US is treaty-bound to defend, officials have said they are concerned that China may attempt to invade Taiwan in the coming years, in turn inviting a US response. Officials say open lines of communication like these talks offer a critical venue to lower the risk of conflict, though the Air Force’s top civilian warned today that the risk of war between the US and China only rises as Beijing’s military prowess grows. 'I am not saying war in the Pacific is imminent or inevitable. It is not.' said Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall. 'But I am saying that the likelihood is increasing, and will continue to do so.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/partnership-of-convenience-pacaf-chief-sees-potential-limits-in-chinese-russian-military-ties/	2024-09-16T10:22:34-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/240916_putin_china_vp_GettyImages-2169636318-scaled-e1726505313220.jpg
Return to Key West? Solving the DoD spacepower roles and missions debate	U.S. Army and U.S. Space Force Spur holders and candidates pose for a photo after a Spur Ride at Fort Bliss, Texas, April 30, 2024. Spur Rides are a time-honored tradition in cavalry units throughout the U.S. Army and typically involve cavalry soldiers, though cavalry Soldiers welcome fellow U.S. servicemembers to the challenge when possible. (U.S. Air Force photo by Senior Airman Nicholas Paczkowski) In recent weeks, several editorials and online comments have been traded regarding whether the Army should have its own space forces or whether all space forces should reside within the US Space Force. Emotions run high when military services fight over roles and missions, but it’s important to remember that these fights are part of a longstanding clash between services over capabilities. The good news is that there is a historical solution we can draw from in order to resolve the question which service should control what spacepower functions and capabilities: A new Key West agreement. In the late 1940s, then-Secretary of Defense James Forrestal directed that the Joint Chiefs meet in Key West, Florida, to work out the issues between the Navy, Army, and Air Force, or else, as he warned, 'I shall have to make my own decisions.' This conference was necessary because the National Security Act of 1947, which had recently become law, created a separate Air Force pulled from the Army — but did not fully sort out whether the Navy’s air arm should be moved over as well. The Key West conference decided on keeping a naval air arm for fleet-related matters and maritime campaigns, and that the Air Force would lead most every other major airpower function, such as airlift and strategic bombardment. This arrangement, as imperfect as some may find it, has remained for the last seven decades. When the Space Force was established in 2019, circumstances were somewhat different than 1947. The guidance in law was very broad, the direction from the White House was not much clearer, and the budget and personnel numbers were and still are largely insufficient to organize, train and equip a Space Force as it was conceptualized by the president and a bipartisan group of members of Congress. Due in part to the compromise position that placed the new service within the Department of the Air Force, rather than in its own separate department, many of those in the Army and Navy who were open to transferring personnel and space systems to the new service changed that stance to one of opposition and protectionism. They perceived that additional funding for the Air Force and its increased influence in the Joint Chiefs meetings and in requirements forums was an existential threat. Thus, the Army, as one example, began to push for more resources and personnel while transitioning some capabilities to the new service. Now, the Army sees the need to do more with space to ensure it has the spaceborne effects needed for supporting land warfare. On the other hand, the Space Force’s strongest supporters argue that the Army should not be allowed to have any space forces of their own. To resolve this argument requires a Key West-type conference. And to ensure focus for the discussion, several foundational actions must be accomplished: First, identify the problems to be solved. Are they doctrinal, legal, policy, or technical? Should the Space Force be responsible for all in-space and from-space warfighting functions such as anti-satellite warfighting, while the Army or other terrestrial services control ground-based counterspace systems? These questions can be subjective to the services and even in sub-groups within the services. Second, what are the core space capabilities or space-derived effects that the Army, Navy, and Air Force believe are absolutely vital for them to control? The Space Force and its combatant command cousin US Space Command were created to address the threats in the space area of responsibility. As each service wants to have control over everything that touches their operating domain (air, land, sea), would a mixed approach be better than an 'all in one basket' approach? Consensus on this question has critical implications for the organizing, training, and equipping functions as well as requirements for the combatant command itself. Third, what is the political landscape surrounding these topics, especially given that a new administration is coming in. One administration might believe that supporting the other military services should be the sole purpose of the Space Force, while others might believe that achieving space superiority is as vital to the nation as are air superiority and sea control. Knowing the views of the political masters is vital to the service chiefs knowing their boundaries in policy as they address this issue. Once these questions have been answered, preferably by policy guidance and direction from the White House (and preferably in partnership with Congress), then an agenda can be set to maximize the chances of an organizational construct for space that all of the military services can support. This issue needs to be resolved soon, and it needs to be hashed out at the highest level of military leadership so that the questions are sorted once and for all. Adversaries are deploying weapon systems that target our critical space infrastructure. We cannot afford to be duplicative or otherwise distracted by inter-service squabbling. We instead must be unified to deter attack in space and to protect our vital critical space infrastructure.

General Atomics is ready to rewrite the rules of airpower … again	Artist rendering of GA-ASI’s Collaborative Combat Aircraft. Tough new threats to the U.S. Air Force and its allies mean air combat must evolve. Prospective adversaries are fielding more capable combat aircraft than ever and are also building more of them. Air superiority will remain central to national power, but the old American orthodoxy around it can’t keep up. Human-flown fighters are essential, but they’re also expensive and time-consuming to design and produce. Complicating the challenge is the need to recruit, train, and retain human pilots. Today, current-model fighter production in the United States is all but maxed out. Even a miraculous rain shower of new money—which isn’t in anybody’s forecast—could not build many more aircraft quickly or add many more pilots to result in a substantially larger fighter force soon. As for future-model fighter production, the defense establishment has balked at the cost, complexity, time, and even basic philosophy associated with a new platform. All this means that it’ll be years before the Air Force, the joint force, and international allies can field an exquisite new 'sixth-generation' fighter. Daunting as these challenges are, the good news is that the Air Force and its partners have an answer: the Collaborative Combat Aircraft, or CCA. The new school of air superiority These highly capable autonomous jets fly alongside, or far ahead, of traditional combat aircraft formations. They sense, communicate, and act just like traditional warplanes, but also in some ways that no previous class of aircraft could. Following months of test and evaluation, it’s clear that the strongest contender to become the U.S. and international CCA is the model offered by General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, Inc. CCAs solve several problems at once. Because they’re smaller and don’t need onboard accommodations for a crew, they’re much less expensive per copy than a fighter. This—and the freedom from having to match every aircraft with at least one pilot—also means they can be put into large-scale production quickly. Large numbers of CCAs then can give 'mass,' as military planners call it, to the U.S. and allied air forces—sheer numbers of aircraft that can outmatch hostile forces. This means the friendly aircraft sent to make first contact with hostile ones can be unmanned, keeping precious human pilots back from danger. It means air component commanders can take on more risk with those aircraft and those engagements. And it means that, in the event of a conflict, the U.S. Air Force and its allies and partners can quickly replace units lost to attrition—something that cannot be said about traditional fighters and certainly human pilots. The task now before the Defense Department, military services, and international allies is what specific Collaborative Combat Aircraft to produce. GA-ASI’s proven status as the leader in uncrewed aircraft makes it the obvious answer. Experience matters Having spent more than 30 years inventing, testing, proving, and operating unmanned systems, no one has more experience. The company has delivered more than 1,100 aircraft and built a fleet for U.S. and international users that has recorded more than 8 million flight hours, many of them in combat. Autonomous combat jets have been a big part of that experience. The company’s MQ-20 Avenger® has been operating since 2009 and contributed heavily toward Air Force and other programs that support operationalizing combat aircraft autonomy. GA-ASI has logged more than 37,000 hours of jet flights of every kind, including detailed air combat simulations, and the company has more than 1,000 software engineers dedicated to further refining the artificial intelligence, machine learning, and other systems that make these aircraft work. Most recently, the Air Force Research Laboratory commissioned GA-ASI to build the XQ-67A Off-Board Sensing Station, an unmanned jet that proves out many of the key concepts for new-generation aircraft. XQ-67A validates that an aircraft can be built from a highly producible common core, which enables not only high rates of production but great variation in models. Think of the core like the base model of a vehicle used in automotive production. Factory workers build a steel cage, common chassis, and other components, and can then turn that into a family car or a luxury sedan, depending on customer orders. This lowers unit costs, speeds production, and provides greater choice for buyers. No other aerospace and defense manufacturer is poised to deliver a CCA as capable as the one built by General Atomics, or one as economical, producible, and flexible. This is important because the builder for this program must be able to deliver a high-performing aircraft at scale on time and on budget. Only a well-established manufacturer with deep expertise and active production could do so. GA-ASI is already ahead of its time. Another thing the Air Force must guard against are calls to turn CCA into an ever-fancier, ever-whizzier, ever-more-expensive boutique aircraft. Some in the aerospace world likely feel this type of platform gives them the advantage, but the risks are so great that it would put the Air Force right back where it started: not with agile mass for air combat but with a handful of silver bullets too precious to actually use—and unable to even the odds against prospective adversaries. When the city police department needs a new fleet of patrol cars, it doesn’t buy Lamborghinis. The virtue of CCA is that it can be good enough to get the job done for U.S. and international military forces, but also be practical and cost competitive. General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, Inc., offers all that and is ready now to start delivering this new wave of aircraft, which will rewrite the rules of airpower.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/general-atomics-is-ready-to-rewrite-the-rules-of-airpower-again/	2024-09-16T05:25:15-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/Cam_FromRight_02.jpg
Trust but verif-AI: Army will let genAI draft acquisition documents, with guardrails	Members of the 56th Air and Space Communications Squadron at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam operate cyber systems at Alpena Combat Readiness Training Center, Alpena, Michigan, July, 12, 2021. (U.S. Air Force photo by Tech. Sgt. Amy Picard) WASHINGTON — Generative artificial intelligence startup Ask Sage recently announced it had deployed its genAI software to the Army’s secure cloud, cArmy. The press release touted a host of processes the new tech could automate, such as software development, cybersecurity testing, and even parts of the federal acquisition system — 'to include drafting and generating RFIs, RFPs, scope of work, defining requirements, down-selecting bidders and much more.' That last litany of tasks may prove one of the most delicate the Department of Defense has yet asked algorithms to tackle in its now year-long and deeply ambivalent exploration of what's called genAI. It's also an area where both Ask Sage and the Army told Breaking Defense they will be watching closely, monitoring the effectiveness of several layers of built-in guardrails. Automating acquisition is an especially ambitious and high-stakes task. Protests by losing bidders are so common that program managers often build a three-month buffer into their schedules to account for a 'stop work' order while GAO investigates. Flaws in official documents — such as the 'RFIs [Requests For Information], RFPs [Requests For Proposal], scope of work, [and] requirements' mentioned in the Ask Sage release — can lead to court battles that disrupt a program. And early experiments in using genAI for matters of law have been less than successful, with multiple lawyers facing sanctions after using ChatGPT and similar software for legal research only to have it 'hallucinate' plausible but completely fictional precedents. RELATED: Pentagon should experiment with AIs like ChatGPT — but don’t trust them yet: DoD’s ex-AI chiefs The first and last line of defense, Ask Sage and Army officials said, is the human using the technology. But there are also algorithmic protections 'under the hood' of the software itself. Instead of simply consulting a single Large Language Model (LLMs) the way ChatGPT does, Ask Sage uses multiple programs — not all of them GenAI — as checks and balances to catch and correct mistakes before a human ever sees them. 'All contracts will still go through our legal process and humans will remain in the loop,' said the Army, in a statement from the office of the service Chief Information Officer to Breaking Defense following Ask Sage's announcement last week. 'We are exploring ways to use LLMs to optimize language in contracts [because] LLMs can analyze vast amounts of contract data and understand requirements for compliance with complex legal frameworks. This cuts down on the human-intensive work required to research and generate the language and, instead, uses LLMs to get to an initial solution quickly; then humans work with the LLMs to refine the output. … The human workload can then focus on applying critical thinking.' The old arms-control principle of 'trust but verify' applies, said Nicolas Chaillan, the former chief software officer of the Air Force, who left the service in frustration over bureaucracy in 2021 and founded Ask Sage in a burst of genAI enthusiasm just last year. 'It’s always reviewed by a human,' he told Breaking Defense in an interview. 'The human is going to read the whole thing.' RELATED: SOCOM acquisition chief: AI will be 'key to every single thing' But anyone who’s ever mindlessly clicked 'Okay' on pages of tedious privacy policies and user agreements knows very well that humans do not, in fact, always read the whole thing. AI ethicists and interface designers alike wrestle with a problem known as automation bias, in which everything from poor training to subtle perceptual cues — like highlighting a potential hostile contact in threatening red rather than cautionary yellow — can lead operators to blindly trust the machine instead of checking it. So Ask Sage does try very hard to build error correction, hallucination detection, and other safeguards into the software itself, Chaillan said. AI Checks And Balances First and foremost, Chaillan told Breaking Defense, the Ask Sage software doesn’t just consult a single Large Language Model. Instead, it’s a 'model-agnostic' intermediary or 'abstraction layer' between the human user and their data, on the one hand, and a whole parliament of different AI models — over 150 of them. 'You don’t want to put all your eggs in one basket,' Chaillan said. 'We're never getting locked into Open AI or Google' or any other specific 'foundation model' developer, he said. 'We can add models and even compare models and see which ones behave the best,' even picking different models as for different tasks. For some functions, there are also non-AI algorithms — old-school, predictable, determnistic IF-THEN-ELSE code — that doublecheck the AI’s work. 'I always want to have .. those right guard rails — and it took way more than just genAI to solve,' Chaillan emphasized. 'So it's a mix of genAI with traditional code and special training of the models and guards rails to get to a right answer. You couldn't do it just with genAI.' 'We make it self-reflect,' he said. 'When it generates a piece of document, we then pass it again to another model to say, ‘Hey, assess this language. What could be the potential legal risks? Is this compliant and following the FARS and DFARS requirements?'' 'It's not just a ‘one pump and go’ like you do on Chat GPT, where you type a piece of text and you get a response,' he said. In fact, even the human input is constrained and formalized to prevent errors: 'Writing an RFI is not just one prompt,' he went on. The software guides the user through a whole checklist of questions — what type of contract is best here? What’s the scope of work? How should we downselect to a winner? — before generating the output. That output can include not only the draft document, Chaillan said, but also commentary from the AI highlighting potential weak points where the algorithms were unsure of themselves. (That’s a far cry from the brazen self-confidence of many chatbots defending their errors). 'They get a report before reviewing the document to say, ‘Hey, you should pay attention to these sections. Maybe this isn't clear,’' he said. 'You give them a list of things that could be potential issues.' In fact, Chaillan argued, the AI is often better at spotting problems than human beings. For software development, 'the code is actually better than it is when written by humans,' he said, 'with the right models, the right training, and the right settings.' The software is even superior, he claimed, when it comes to parsing legal language and federal acquisition regulations — which, after all, are not only voluminous but written in convoluted ways no human brain can easily understand. 'Humans can’t remember every part of the FARS and DFARS — and there’s conflicting things [in different regulations],' he said. 'Ask 10 people, you’d get 10 different answers.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/trust-but-verif-ai-army-will-let-genai-draft-acquisition-documents-but-with-guardrails/	2024-09-16T04:20:54-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/240716_gide_finger_computer_6733216-e1721160785247.jpg
