SDA asks industry to propose 60-day studies of ‘novel’ capabilities for Iron Dome	Artist's illustration of a hypersonic missile tracking satellite constellation. (Graphic by L3Harris) WASHINGTON — The Space Development Agency (SDA) is soliciting 'executive summaries' from interested vendors for fast-track studies of how the agency's Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture (PWSA) satellite network in low Earth orbit can be best exploited to support President Donald Trump's 'Iron Dome For America' missile shield. 'SDA is interested in industry’s perspective on implementing the Iron Dome for America architecture, and is particularly interested in building on and integrating PWSA’s current contributions to global kill chains and missile defense,' the agency wrote in a Feb. 11 solicitation. The agency is asking for 'novel architecture concepts, systems, technologies, and capabilities that enable leap-ahead improvements for future [PWSA] tranches, capability layers, or, enable new capability layers to address other emerging or evolving warfighter needs,' it adds. In his Jan. 27 Iron Dome for America executive order, Trump called for the development and deployment of a PWSA 'custody layer.' SDA has defined its potential custody layer as a hybrid constellation of government and commercial satellites to provide operators with near-real time ground target tracking and targeting information. The SDA solicitation lists eight specific areas of interest: The call for studies on speeding HBTSS 'missile defense capabilities' is interesting, as its wording differs somewhat from language in an earlier solicitation from the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) on the sensor system. The MDA call asks industry for ideas about how to accelerate deployment of an HBTSS 'layer' — a term that connotes a constellation of actual satellites, rather than simply related 'capabilities.' The fate of HBTSS and authority over how such high-precision sensors are pursued has been a bone of contention between the two agencies, and driven some concerns from Capitol Hill. Two prototypes were launched last February, but at the time MDA and SDA said that the birds would not be integrated into SDA's PWSA. Instead, technology advances and lessons learned from the HBTSS program were being migrated into sensors being developed by SDA for its Tracking Layer of missile warning/missile tracking satellites. The SDA solicitation says that the results of the studies and any recommendations for how to flesh out the Iron Dome for American architecture will be shared with the Space Force, MDA and other US government agencies. The agency 'strongly encourages' interested vendors to reply by 5 p.m. on Feb. 28.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/sda-asks-industry-to-propose-60-day-studies-of-novel-capabilities-for-iron-dome/	2025-02-12T12:57:24-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/220329_l3harris_HBTSS_gfx.png
GAO calls on Coast Guard to improve cyber for Maritime Transportation System	A team from the U.S. Coast Guard Academy participated in the National Security Agency’s 20th annual National Cyber Exercise (NCX), a three-day cyber competition that tests the offensive and defensive cybersecurity skills virtually, April 8-10, 2021.(U.S. Coast Guard photo by Petty Officer 2nd Class Hunter Medley) WASHINGTON — The Government Accountability Office released a report today calling for the US Coast Guard to improve the cybersecurity infrastructure of the Maritime Transportation System (MTS), the complex network of ports, waterways, ships and other vessels that are used to transport goods and passengers. The government watchdog found several gaps in the MTS's cybersecurity practices in its study, which was conducted as a result of the 2023 National Defense Authorization Act. These include inconsistencies in cyber incident data, incompetencies in cyber professionals and a lack of a cohesive cybersecurity strategy to protect the MTS. 'Owners and operators of maritime facilities and vessels (MTS owners and operators) collectively manage these goods and services via technology systems that are often interconnected with internal and external systems and networks, including the internet,' the report explained. 'Although these technologies facilitate MTS operations, they are also vulnerable to cyberattacks with the potential to cause significant and catastrophic damage to maritime infrastructure. Consequently, the safe operation of the MTS is critical to our national and economic security.' The report emphasizes that the Coast Guard must fill the gaps as the MTS, which handles more than $5.4 trillion in goods and services annually, 'faces significant and increasing cybersecurity risks' from China, Iran, North Korea and Russia and other 'transnational criminal organizations.' Additionally, the increasing reliance on technology makes the MTS more susceptible to cyber threats. Related: US cyber vulnerabilities fuel N. Korea’s nuclear arsenal, but solutions are near: DARPA official The GAO outlined five recommendations the Coast Guard should implement to ensure the MTS is resilient against cyber attacks: The Department of Homeland Security concurred with all five recommendations and provided the Coast Guard’s planned actions to address them. 'Although the maritime critical infrastructure subsector is owned and operated by private industry and state and local governments, the federal government has a significant role in addressing cybersecurity risks facing the MTS,' the report reads.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/gao-calls-on-coast-guard-to-improve-cyber-for-maritime-transportation-system/	2025-02-12T12:30:26-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/6596254-e1643140442121-scaled.jpg
Space Force doubles down on acquisition reform ahead of DoD moves	Former Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Space Acquisition and Integration Frank Calvelli in 2022 developed nine space acquisition tenets that are guiding Space Force reform efforts to speed development of new capabilities. (US Air Force photo by Eric Dietrich) WASHINGTON — The Space Force is 'aggressively' pushing forward with acquisition reforms put in place under the Biden administration to fast-track new capabilities and cut costs — including rapidly moving toward the use of fixed-price contracts and cracking down on contractor performance, according to a senior official. The business of acquisitions is to deliver and integrate warfighter capability as fast as possible, and that's it,' Maj. Gen. Stephen Purdy, acting head of the Air Force’s space acquisition shop, told the annual Defense and Intelligence Space Conference on Tuesday. His walk-through of activities to flesh out former space acquisition czar Frank Calvelli's 'nine space acquisition tenets' showcased how the Space Force already is positioned to meet expected guidance for accelerating weapons system development from new Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth. Calvelli's tenets, Purdy said, 'were all about speed, all about getting back to acquisition basics' and not only is the Space Force 'continuing' to push on implementing them, but 'doing it more aggressively.' For example, he said that of the 'about 59 major programs' in the service's unclassified portfolio, there are 38 that are designated as major capability acquisitions; i.e., 'traditional acquisition activities.' Another 12 are being managed as middle tier acquisitions (MTAs) aimed at developing prototypes and/or fielding capabilities within five years, and eight fall under what is known as the 'software pathway,' which uses iterative processes to bring new software into use. Finally, the service has one program being acquired under the 'quick start' effort initiated by former Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall and approved by Congress in the fiscal 2024 National Defense Authorization Act. Purdy elaborated that the number of programs using the software path approach has increased '300 percent' from 2023, going from two to eight. In addition, he said the Space Force's use of MTAs has increased over the past six months or so, although caveating that he hadn't 'done the numbers' to calculate that increase. 'If you look at a lot of the guidance that's coming down from DoD, and also pending guidance from the Hill and the Wicker act [the Fostering Reform and Government Efficiency in Defense (FORGED) Act introduced by Senate Armed Services Committee Chair Roger Wicker, R.-Miss.] there's a desire to move into software pathways and MTA and OTA [Other Transaction Authority] kind of constructs,' he stressed. Purdy expressed strong interest in a number of the changes proposed by Wicker in the FORGED Act, calling it a 'really interesting document' including 'a lot of really interesting ideas.' While noting that it is difficult to precisely quantify the multitude of Space Force contracts in play, Purdy said that by his 'rough numbers' about half have been awarded on a cost-plus basis and half on a fixed-price basis. 'So a good start, but I want to keep moving us down that fixed-price path,' he said. He further warned industry leaders that the Space Force is reviewing several high risk programs that are now under cost-plus contracts, with an eye towards 'converting' them to fixed-price awards or 'breaking them apart' into smaller pieces. 'I'm really looking to explore risk exposure on our programs,' he said. 'There are a couple of programs that we have that I would declare [carry] nearly unbounded risk exposure. What does that mean? They're sitting in a cost-plus environment; there's really difficult technology; and basically this is like future Nunn-McCurdy's' The 1983 Nunn-McCurdy Act requires the Pentagon report to Congress when defense programs exceed certain cost estimates, and critical breaches can lead to cancelation. 'So, we're going to look hard at figuring out how to get out of that, and that's going to be painful on all sides,' Purdy said. Meanwhile, Purdy explained that the Department of the Air Force and the Space Force are pursuing 'accountability' measures, as envisioned by Calvelli, to ensure good performance both from contractors and from department program managers. 'Accountability is a two-way street,' he said. Since May 2022, Purdy said 14 major acquisition programs have had 'contracts or entire programs restructured or canceled' largely because 'performance costs have skyrocketed. 'We weren't getting the capability we need. And unlike the Space Force acquisition of old, we stopped just piling money into that. And so we've stopped these contracts, and we've re-competed for the most part,' he said. 'We're also looking at taking action against poor performing US government program managers,' Purdy added. If problems are found, a first step will be 'to give them help — provide guidance and provide additional acquisition help,' he said. But 'if it's not making it, we'll look at removals.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/space-force-doubles-down-on-acquisition-reform-ahead-of-dod-moves/	2025-02-12T11:40:24-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/02/240228_calvelli_afa_warfare_8238576-scaled-e1709151317344.jpg
Russia overtakes all of Europe on defense spending in key metric: IISS military balance	Russia's Orlan family of drones, on display at the World Defense Show, Saudi Arabia (Breaking Defense) BELFAST — Based on one key economic metric, Russian defense spending eclipsed all other European countries combined last year and is projected to increase further in 2025, according to a leading defense think tank. New analysis from the United Kingdom’s International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) found that Moscow's military expenditure spiked by over 40 percent to almost $146 billion in the past year, equivalent to 6.7 percent GDP, and is on track to hit 7.5 percent GDP in 2025. When adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP), Russia spent nearly $462 billion in 2024, effectively leapfrogging Europe’s collective spending. PPP is a tool used to remove price level differences between currencies in order to better demonstrate the purchasing strength of one over another. 'The PPP comparison is important to make, just to take into account the lower domestic input costs that Russia has….it's a good indicator of why Russia is able to fund so much more with a seemingly smaller budget in US dollar terms,' Fenella McGerty, senior fellow for defence economics at IISS told media today. The spending figures are included in the think tank’s newly published Military Balance report — a comprehensive annual review of global defense capabilities, military budgets and other related economic trends. Ukraine's offensive operations are having an impact however with IISS figures indicating that Russia lost 1400 main battle tanks last year, and 4000 in all since the war started. 'Indeed, the IISS assesses that Russia will not have sufficient main battle tanks to conduct effective offensive operations beyond early 2026 if it maintains the same operational tempo and suffers the same losses as in 2024,' Bastian Giegerich, IISS Director-General told media. He also said that the conflict had 'demonstrated increasing connections between European and Asia Pacific security' which included North Korea entering the conflict by deploying 10,000 troops, China’s decision to sell dual-use technologies to Russia and the 'growing prominence' of South Korea selling equipment to countries including Poland. Documenting battlefield developments from 2024, Giegerich acknowledged that neither Russia or Ukraine had been able to leverage a strategic advantage and explained that Kyiv was 'increasingly strained by attrition and recruitment challenges.' He added that Ukraine's 'inadequate combat mass has driven focus on fast innovation cycles, developing a growing range of UAVs and using one-way attack UAVs to strike deep inside Russia.' Operational realities are also tempered by a decisive political shift in attitude toward the war by US President Donald Trump, his messaging around delivering a peace deal and the need for Europe to spend more on its own security. Giegerich said that 'strategic options are narrowing' for Ukraine, because of Trump's pledge to 'end the war quickly' and if Kyiv is to continue to stand up to Russian aggression, 'international support will have to increase significantly beyond current levels.' Such analysis arrived shortly before Pete Hegseth, US defense secretary, said this morning that it was 'unrealistic' to expect a return to Ukraine's pre-2014 borders, suggesting the same logic applies to the chances of the eastern European country joining NATO. The alliance has long stated that Ukraine belongs in NATO but has not set a timeline for membership. Speaking at NATO's headquarters in Brussels as part of a Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting, Hegseth also ruled out US troops being deployed to Ukraine as part of any future security guarantee for Kyiv. 'Safeguarding European security must be an imperative for European members of NATO,' he added. 'As part of this Europe must provide the overwhelming share of future lethal and nonlethal aid to Ukraine.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/russia-overtakes-all-of-europe-on-defense-spending-in-key-metric-iiss-military-balance/	2025-02-12T11:20:11-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/02/426550469_3262973424011488_4921886411513523113_n-e1707497379649.jpg
House unveils budget plan with $100B boost for defense	(L-R) U.S. House Majority Whip Rep. Tom Emmer (R-MN), Speaker of the House Rep. Mike Johnson (R-LA), House Republican Conference Chair Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) and House Majority Leader Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA) leave after a news briefing at the U.S. Capitol on November 2, 2023 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images) WASHINGTON — House Republicans on Tuesday revealed a budget resolution that would add $100 billion in defense funding, one-third less than the Senate blueprint which would raise defense spending by $150 billion. What that means exactly for major weapons programs is unclear. Details of what that funding would pay for will be determined by the House and Senate Armed Services Committees only if the resolution is adopted by both the House and Senate — an open question, given the House and Senate’s competing approaches on how best to pass President Donald Trump’s agenda. Republicans intend to use a process called budget reconciliation to move a laundry list of Trump spending priorities through Congress without threat of filibuster. Unlike the Senate — which opted for a two-bill strategy that starts with approving additional funds for defense, border security and energy — the House is pursuing what Trump has called 'one big beautiful bill' that would also raise the debt limit by $4 trillion, include $4.5 trillion in tax cuts and cut government spending. 'This budget resolution is a key step to start the process in delivering President Trump’s America First agenda,' House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said in a statement on X. 'With nearly every House Republican directly engaged in this deliberative process, this resolution reflects our collective commitment to enacting the President's full agenda—not just a part of it.' The House Budget Committee will take up the resolution on Thursday as its Senate counterpart works through its own plan in hearings scheduled for today and Thursday. RELATED: Senate Republicans release budget plan with $150B more for defense At the start of the Senate Budget Committee’s markup process for their budget resolution this morning, chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said lawmakers must move with haste to pass additional funding, and implored his House Republican colleagues to consider backing the Senate version of the bill. 'The problem we have now is that ICE is running out of money,' he said. 'To my colleagues in the House, I hope you can pass one big beautiful bill … but we gotta move on this issue.' Over the course of the hearing, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle broadly expressed support for additional defense funding — although some Democrats questioned whether reconciliation was needed as a vehicle to boost money for defense. 'I’m on the armed services committee. Do you need to use reconciliation to do defense spending?' said Sen. Tim Kaine, R-Va. 'We not only spend hundreds of billions on defense, in a bipartisan agreement, just last year, we twice added to that. … Let’s just be clear about what this is about: This is an effort to amass savings off the backs of everyday people whose programs are cut, plus tariff revenue, and to direct all of that towards tax cuts for the wealthiest.' Sen. Tom Kennedy, R-La, expressed confidence in Johnson and said he wanted to see lawmakers come together on a single tactic for getting a reconciliation bill across the line. 'I just want to see us pass something. I don’t see this as a competition,' he said. 'Weakness invites the wolves. We have to spend more money on defense.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/house-unveils-budget-plan-with-100b-boost-for-defense/	2025-02-12T10:14:41-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/02/240229_rep_mike_johnson_GettyImages-1770847690-scaled-e1709241354686.jpg
Want ‘Competitive endurance?’ Focus on maneuver in space	Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman delivers a keynote address on the state of the Space Force during the Air and Space Forces Association 2024 Warfare Symposium in Aurora, Colo., Feb. 13, 2024. (US Air Force photo by Eric Dietrich) For almost two years, the Chief of Space Operations has championed his proposed theory of success, Competitive Endurance, which includes a detailed white paper published January 2024. Yet despite his urging of Guardians to challenge the theory and share their ideas broadly, the public discourse has been underwhelming. Space Security professionals owe the CSO the critical thinking and feedback he calls for, so here are some thoughts. Although the theory gets a lot of things right, it does not completely account for the significant risks inherent within its own assumptions. Identifying and challenging the assumptions upon which the theory is built is the essential next step to assess potential risks and ensure a coherent strategy for competition emerges. In doing so, the principle of maneuver becomes an important element vital to completing the theory and mitigating the inherent risks. There are two critical assumptions inherent within the theory that, when challenged, reveal significant risks to achieving its intended goal: space superiority. The first critical assumption is that competition and conflict follow linear logic. The reality of strategy is that competition and conflict instead follow paradoxical logic — where strategic competitors deliberately confound logical actions. This is not to argue that a theory of success should follow non-linear logic; rather, it must better account for uncertainty and surprise against a thinking and cunning adversary. The second critical assumption is that strategic competitors will come to the same logical conclusion: that their use of space and counterspace capabilities against US military forces will be impractical and self-defeating. The reality is that strategic competitors are likely to assume a lower risk threshold for initiating or extending conflict into space than the theory assumes — an error of mirror imaging and strategy mismatching. Strategic competitors possess fundamentally different principles and values, see escalation and competition in considerably different ways, and are attempting to achieve their strategic objectives against US and ally military forces that increasingly depend on space capabilities. The Space Force must carefully consider the importance of maneuver as a way to attain the necessary flexibility and adaptability against uncertainty and surprise. Integrating maneuver within a revised Competitive Endurance will improve the Space Force’s ability to achieve and maintain space superiority throughout the competition continuum. The principle of maneuver as a core component of its theory of success, will enable the service to better posture forces, deter nefarious activity, impose dilemmas, and ultimately hedge against unanticipated strategic challenges. (It is interesting that Competitive Endurance already acknowledges the importance of contesting and controlling the space domain just as other services do, yet stops just short of acknowledging how maneuver has proven to be an essential principle in achieving domain control throughout history.) In addition, integrating maneuver within Competitive Endurance enhances and complements its three tenets, further mitigating the inherent risks. The capacity to maneuver complements space domain awareness to better deny operational surprise by enabling space forces to preempt or respond to hostile action, let alone deter such hostile action in the first place. Maneuver also complements resilience to better deny a first-mover advantage by making systems more difficult to precisely target and by enabling changes in force posture to disrupt and complicate a competitor’s decision-making process. Lastly, it also complements counterspace campaigning by expanding the types and numbers of flexible deterrence and response options that allow US Space Command to better confront challenges and mitigate the risk of escalation. Integrating maneuver will also have positive impacts on national and economic security in indirect ways. It will help signal to industry the importance of maneuver-related technologies, convincing them there is a market worth investing their R&amp;D in. Such investment will also complement other related commercial and civil efforts tied to on-orbit servicing, refueling, and active debris removal capabilities. Even more promising are the potential opportunities for partnering and building interoperability with allied space maneuver capabilities and even open up areas of investment from allied commercial space industries. Despite these benefits, there is currently a level of uncertainty on the utility of leveraging the principle of maneuver in space. Such uncertainty has already led to cuts in maneuver-related technologies. However, to attain the necessary flexibility and adaptability needed in the near-future, the Space Force must invest in maneuver capabilities now so that they are delivered for tomorrow. In strategy, few things ever work out the way they are intended, and the probability of things working out the way Competitive Endurance anticipates is unlikely, especially in an immature space domain where even greater uncertainty exists — exacerbating such improbability. While Competitive Endurance serves as a logical departure point for hypothesizing strategic success in space, it must now evolve to articulate how it will attain the necessary flexibility and adaptability needed for an uncertain operational environment. To do so, Competitive Endurance must integrate maneuver as an instrumental component, much like it has done so with resiliency. Such a revision would enhance and complement the current theory of success and provide improved strategic direction to the national security space enterprise commensurate with the evolving operational environment. Changes in strategic and operational environments should drive changes in strategic approaches — like a theory of success — that then drive changes in space capabilities and operating concepts. The other military services demonstrated this throughout the twentieth century; the US Space Force now has an opportunity to demonstrate its ability to do this as well.

Cummings, ATRX team to develop hypersonic drones	If tests prove out, ATRX's engines will power a Cummings Aerospace-designed UAS with hypersonic flight. (ATRX) LONDON — Cummings Aerospace has signed a new agreement with propulsion specialist ATRX to rapidly design and develop affordable supersonic and hypersonic unmanned systems, company executives told Breaking Defense ahead of this week's announcement. The deal will see Cummings build out large-scale versions of its Hellhound UAS, equipped with ATRX’s Air Turbo Rocket (ATR) to undertake subsonic, supersonic and ultimately hypersonic flight tests. Speaking to Breaking Defense on Feb 5, company executives laid out how the partnership will explore multi-mission capabilities, which could include the integration of weapons, specialist payloads and even counter-hypersonic capabilities. A first, vertically-launched test flight is expected to take place in the next 18-24 months, executives said, with a Hellhound UAS up to 12x larger in size compared to the loitering munition variant due to participate in the US Army’s Low Altitude Stalking and Strike Ordnance (LASSO) loitering munition competition later this year. Follow-on development cycles are expected to occur every 18-24 months, as the team looks to integrate increasing levels in complexity across the program. Cummings Aerospace CEO Sheila Cummings said the strategic alignment with ATRX is designed to offer customers more affordable, flexible and rapidly prototyped solutions. 'The modern battlefield demands systems that are capable of flying faster and further into contested airspace. This partnership with ATRX will allow us to develop ATR-powered UAS that can offer both of these characteristics in a single vehicle, at an affordable price,' she told Breaking Defense. 'We have concepts for hypersonic but have not built them yet. A lot of our focus is on hypersonic and rapid capability for our warfighters and we are seeing this as an ideal time to bring these ideas to industry and customers, to capture research and development funding to bring to a technology readiness level,' she added before stating that potential customers had already mentioned interest in a supersonic UAS capability. 'It's all part of the whole standoff objective, right? So the farther back, the faster you can get to a particular location. And sometimes, in order to maximize that standoff range, you need more propulsion power, which means you need more speed. So supersonic is definitely among those capabilities that has been mentioned for UAS solutions,' Cummings said before adding that counter-hypersonic capability was another concept being considered by engineers across both companies. ATRX’s CEO Felix Bustos III confirmed his company is currently working up a prototype hypersonic engine, which he suggested is a version of a Ramjet. 'It allows capability to go from standstill on a runway or vertical take-off to Mach 5. We have the hardware in development and are on a fast track to develop that capability which will provide a very unique capability for the warfighter,' he told Breaking Defense, before confirming it would be 'highly maneuverable in flight.' Cummings Aerospace could also support ATRX’s development of the Hummingbird space plane, which Bustos described as a 'wholly different mission set' to Hellhound. The Hummingbird is being designed with a view to deploying satellites from low earth orbit. 'Data obtained through the whole [Hellhound] program directly applies to next phase which is the Hummingbird space plane. A mix of government and private financing will allow us to move fast,' he said. 'Being able to validate the performance of our ATRs using a bespoke UAS based on a flight-proven airframe will de-risk and accelerate our space plane development efforts. Space planes are very much needed with more than 50,000, mostly commercial, satellites that need to be launched into orbit in the next few years,' he concluded.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/cummings-atrx-team-to-develop-hypersonic-drones/	2025-02-12T05:15:46-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/Air-Turbo-Rocket-Hot-Fire-Test-e1739305860907.png
Space Force sees light at the end of the development tunnel for OCX, ATLAS	Space Force Maj. Gen. Stephen Purdy (Image: Space Force Association) WASHINGTON — The Space Force's two biggest problem children — the next-generation ground system for GPS satellites and a crucial software update for the service's space domain awareness network — are both expected to soon overcome their long-standing development woes, according to the acting head of the Air Force's space acquisition shop. Speaking to the the annual Defense and Intelligence Space Conference sponsored by the National Security Space Association, Maj. Gen. Stephen Purdy was optimistic that both programs would be in the hands of operators as soon as fall. Purdy currently is warming the Air Force space acquisition chair left empty by the departure of Frank Calvelli in January with the change of administration. In particular, Purdy highlighted testing progress being made by the GPS Next-Generation Operational Control System (OCX) program — citing the fact the ground system is 'in operator hands touching actual satellites right now,' having 'hit 40 contacts with live satellites' as of Feb. 5. Overall, he said, the program has now made it through testing of 97 percent of its requirements. Calvelli, in an exclusive Jan. 15 exit interview with Breaking Defense, called the failure to get OCX working during his term as the first Department of the Air Force Space Acquisition Executive one of his 'greatest regrets.' Under development by RTX Space (formerly Raytheon) for nigh on 15 years, OCX is needed to allow some 700 weapon systems across the US military to fully access the encrypted M-code GPS signal that will be harder for adversaries to jam. Further, OCX Block 3F, which is the final planned version of the update, will be needed to allow Space Force Guardians to operate the GPS Follow-On, or GPS IIIF, constellation, currently expected to begin launching in 2027. Purdy said the OCX program office at Space Systems Command is working toward a decision on whether the ground system is ready to operate this summer; followed by a decision on actually fielding it. If all goes well, he said, GPS satellites then will be 'transitioned' to the new ground system — something Calvelli in January said he hoped would happen by the end of this calendar year. 'I know that's been a long-running program, but we're a little further along than perhaps you're tracking,' he said. Meanwhile, operational testing of the Advanced Tracking and Launch Analysis System (ATLAS) software to modernize the Space Force's core command and control capabilities for space domain awareness, is going smoothly, Purdy explained. ATLAS is the Pentagon’s latest effort, following a plethora of failed attempts, to replace the 1980s-era Space Defense Operations Center (SPADOC) computer system for managing data from the military’s network of radar and telescopes that detect and track objects on orbit. Purdy said that so far the testing program has 'resolved or mitigated' all of problems dubbed 'Category 1 Deficiencies' — which are those that could cause a catastrophic failure — as well as 'most if not all' of the Category 2 problems. 'So, that software is looking pretty good,' he said. Noting its 'really interesting performance,' Purdy said that if all continues to go well, ATLAS is expected to pass 'operational acceptance,' which he explained is the 'equivalent' of initial operational capability, this summer. The Space Force originally planned for ATLAS to become operational in 2022, but the program has been troubled by technical issues with integration into the Space Force's legacy systems and schedule delays. Meanwhile, the Space Systems Command on Jan. 30 announced that it had awarded a $90M sole-source contract to L3Harris for continuation of the ATLAS program. 'This sole-source award will ensure a seamless continuation of the ATLAS program to achieve ATLAS Minimum Viable Capability Release (MVCR) Operational Acceptance and will deliver a modernized and integrated SDA system,' the press release said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/space-force-sees-light-at-the-end-of-the-development-tunnel-for-ocx-atlas/	2025-02-11T13:28:33-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-11-at-3.30.29 PM.png
US cyber vulnerabilities fuel N. Korea’s nuclear arsenal, but solutions are near: DARPA official	Darren Cofer, principal fellow at Collins Aerospace demonstrates the company's Secure Mathematically-Assured Composition of Control Models (SMACCM) capabilities at a DARPA demonstration day. (Photo courtesy of DARPA.) WASHINGTON — The US’s vulnerable cybersecurity systems are indirectly allowing North Korea to bolster its nuclear arsenal, but thanks to existing technology this can be easily avoided, an official from the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency said Monday. North Korea is able to use the funds it acquires from ransomware attacks on US systems and those of other countries to pay for the development of nuclear weapons, Kathleen Fisher, director of DARPA’s Information Innovation Office, said during an agency event Monday. However, thanks to the advanced technology DARPA has funded and industry and the Pentagon have been able to develop, stopping the ransomware attacks is preventable. The problem lies within getting the tech into the hands of the right people, which is often bogged down by bureaucratic processes like authority to process (ATO) procedures, Fisher said. 'We are essentially funding nuclear weapons development in North Korea with our bad software practices,' she said. 'We know how to do better. It's like all of that [North Korea’s ransomware attacks] is even worse, because we know how to do better. Imagine a world where our software is not riddled with these vulnerabilities.' 'This is compounded by our current ATO process, which means that it takes a very long time to update the software in our systems, because the ATO process is so slow, we have many mission critical systems that have known vulnerabilities, exploitable vulnerabilities in them that we can't update for very long periods of time because the ATO process is so slow,' she said. 'We can't afford to continue that practice — the learned helplessness that is afforded in that practice.' ATO procedures have long been viewed as a thorn in the side of the Pentagon’s acquisition process because of their redundancy. Different organizations typically have their own Authorizing Officer (AO) who has to give a piece of software an ATO before it can be implemented. AOs often have different criteria, so the software company going through this process has to operate a little differently each time, dragging the process down when the office next door may already have been cleared to use the same software. Related: Pentagon announces new reciprocity guidance to streamline software adaptation Last May, the DoD issued new guidance that enforced the concept of ATO 'reciprocity,' which essentially means if one office certifies that a system is cyber secure, then all offices can accept it instead of having to redo the certification process. However, Fisher said that the lack of reciprocity in software systems is still prolific, hindering the advancement of cybersecurity software. Though the dilemmas that ATOs pose are likely not going to be resolved anytime soon, the defense industrial base (DIB) still must focus its energy and resources in building resilient cybersecurity into software systems, Fisher said. One technology practice that Fisher said should be more widely adopted to prevent ransom attacks are 'formal methods' — mathematically based approaches to produce software that come with checked guarantees and proofs that the code 'cannot go wrong.' Some use cases of formal methods include DARPA’s previous High-Assurance Cyber Military Systems (HACMS) and Assured Micropatching (AMP) programs along with the current Verified Security and Performance Enhancement of Large Legacy Software (V-SPELLS) program. These programs, along with others, have showcased that using formal methods can ensure adversaries cannot penetrate systems. For example, with the HACMS program, run by Collin Aerospace (Rockwell Collins at the time), Secure Mathematically-Assured Composition of Control Models (SMACCM) were developed to showcase new tools for building unmanned aerial vehicle software that was resilient to adversarial hacking. During demos of the program, when a group of fictional hackers tried to hack into the drone’s system, nothing happened — an indication that everything went as planned. The DIB and industry partners sometimes have to adopt less-traditional methods of acquiring cyber-secure tech to ensure the tech gets in the hands of operators and software engineers. For example, it is increasingly common for DARPA to conduct the research required to see if a method or technology is possible to execute, and then once it proves its worth industry can adopt it, Col. Rob Gerbracht, the Marine Corps Operational Liaison for DARPA told reporters Monday. Then, it makes its way back into the Pentagon, he said. 'Some of the technologies that DARPA leaps forward end up in the commercial sector and come back to us in the defense industrial base, far after they had actually been introduced,' Gerbracht said. 'Sometimes that's the easiest way to do it,' Fisher added. 'Everything is on the table to get maximization as fast as possible. DARPA isn't about creating technology for the sake of creating technology, it's about creating technology to change the world for better national security, for the warfighter’s safety.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/us-cyber-vulnerabilities-fuel-n-koreas-nuclear-arsenal-but-solutions-are-near-darpa-official/	2025-02-11T12:15:57-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/VM11348-1-scaled-e1739284493789.jpg
US needs to engage, as well as deter, China to maintain space leadership: CFR report	(Graphic: iStock, Getty) WASHINGTON — In order to protect its leadership in space, the United States needs to out-compete China and deter its ability to successfully attack US space assets, but also needs to seek 'targeted' engagement with Beijing to improve communications and find areas of mutual benefit such as space traffic management, finds a new report by the Council on Foreign Relations. The report, 'Securing Space: A Plan for U.S. Action,' was crafted by an expert task force co-chaired by retired Space Force Lt. Gen. Nina Armagno and former California Congresswoman Jane Harman. Recognizing that space has become both a 'strategic vulnerability' and a 'strategic imperative' for the United States, the report lays out both hard and soft power actions that the authors maintain are necessary for the US government in order to keep its current leadership role in the face of increased competition. 'In the increasingly chaotic realm of space, the United States’ position is slipping. In 1957, the Soviet Union’s launch of the Sputnik satellite was a wakeup call, spurring the United States to assume a dominant role in space. Today, nearly seventy years later, the United States is in danger of losing that privileged position. In many ways, the country risks another Sputnik moment,' the report finds. The US government thus 'needs to act now to address threats to space assets; champion space traffic management to support the growing space economy; and incorporate commercial perspectives into civilian and national security space policy,' it sums up. The CFR report makes seven recommendations for the new Trump administration as it crafts its approach to space across the civil, commercial and defense spheres:	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/us-needs-to-engage-as-well-as-deter-china-to-maintain-space-leadership/	2025-02-11T11:10:16-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/11/iStock-1333071678-e1669760260420.jpg

Microsoft announces plan to slide $22 billion IVAS contract over to Anduril	The Army received the new IVAS 1.2 prototype for a series of tests. (US Army) WASHINGTON — Microsoft is seeking to transfer its entire IVAS contract over to Anduril, in a stunning twist to the long-running saga to deliver mixed-reality goggles to troops. The move — which would see Anduril assume oversight of the entire program, including development of the current hardware and software, hiring decisions on staff and takeover of production — comes as the Army is considering launching a follow-on IVAS competition given the years-long delays on getting the system operational. The service has not blessed that newly unfurled 'contact novation' and did not respond to questions from Breaking Defense about the program or the proposed shift. However, executives from both companies expressed confidence the Army will back the move. 'We've been working together for quite some time now… [and] we are signing a strategic partnership that will take IVAS into the future,' Robin Seiler, Microsoft's corporate vice president for mixed reality, told reporters ahead of today’s official announcement. Seiler added that Microsoft Azure would be the preferred hyperscale cloud for IVAS. The bid to slide current contact work on the 10-year, $22 billion contact comes at a critical juncture for the program. Despite years of program challenges and a heads-up display redesign that is still being tested, Army leaders have not officially said if they will cancel IVAS work under the original contract or do a limited production run. However, they are gearing up for a new competition and even meeting with companies today to answer questions about an IVAS Next competition and possible requirements. Anduril founder Palmer Luckey, who made his tech breakthrough with the commercial Oculus VR headset, has been teasing development of a new mixed-reality device with military applications. In September 2024, the tech startup announced its steps toward assuming the IVAS contract with a Microsoft partnership for the integration of new sensors and the Lattice platform into the device. So, with IVAS Next in the wings and their positioning as a likely competitor, why would Anduril want to take over the troubled program now? By taking over management of the current contract just ahead of findings of a make-or-break operational assessment, Luckey’s team could be asked to produce a limited number of the latest IVAS devices designed by Microsoft, or left with a canceled deal. At the same time, though, his team would have additional time working with Army leaders on the program, and access to a mix of production and research and development funding, Luckey confirmed. One industry source who has been anticipating today’s announcement previously said it’s that access to government funding that will give Aundril an advantage over other IVAS Next competitors. 'They should invest their own capital to architect and develop IVAS technology which the Army can acquire and field affordably,' the industry source said. 'If they use the contract as a vehicle to capture Army subsidies, they will be re-running the problematic defense prime playbook we have seen for decades.' When asked about the perception of such an unfair advantage, Luckey said that is just the reality of being the incumbent and there was always going to be a company in that position. 'The people who are already doing it will definitely have an advantage over people who are coming in and starting from scratch,' he added. 'Anduril is no stranger to fighting incumbency. I think that if people have better things, they're gonna be able to come in.' The first Trump administration started the IVAS effort based around Microsoft’s commercially available HoloLens 2 heads-up display, with the goal of providing soldiers with a single device they could use both in combat (including under the cover of darkness) and for virtual training. That work eventually led to a 10-year production contract valued up to $22 billion. However, shortly after the 2021 award, a host of problems publicly emerged including soldiers complaining of discomfort, dizziness, nausea, and system reliability. Although Army leaders publicly stood behind the program at first, they began tempering expectations and even split the program up into three initial versions — the 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2 iterations of the goggles. (The service has acquired 5,000 1.0 units, with plans to possibly acquire an additional 5,000 1.1 units for limited use.) Version 1.2 was billed as the key make-or-break upgrade — an iteration to correct past problems, in part, by transitioning the device from a helmet-like display with a 70-degree field-of-view, to a hinged, flat design with a 60-degree field-of-view that soldiers can flip up. The service hasn’t released details of initial testing with that new redesign, and a recent Director of Test and Evaluation report on fiscal 2024 activities said the service is now expected to detail findings of an operational assessment of IVAS 1.2 in the April through June timeframe. That testing is designed to help Army leaders decide if they want to skip production, do a limited run or dive into a larger bulk purchase. Based on that decision, Luckey said Anduril would be ready to move out, and any large-scale buy of IVAS 1.2 or Next could eventually be produced at the company’s future Arsenal-1 facility in Columbus, Ohio. But while the Army continues preparations for that key test, it conducted other assessments that will factor into the path ahead. For instance, members from the 75th Ranger Regiment were tasked with running IVAS 1.2 through the ringer alongside dedicated night vision systems like the Enhanced Night Vision Goggle-Binocular (ENVG-B) and another system dubbed PVS-14, one service official told Breaking Defense last year. While companies wait for additional information on Army IVAS Next plans, Luckey said he anticipates the service buying a variety of heads-up displays, from different vendors that are tied together via a common architecture and common application layer. That hardware design, he surmised, will vary depending on the soldier's job. 'I think you're going to see things ranging from glasses that look a lot like the Oakley’s you wear everyday, all the way up to things that look like an Iron Man helmet,' he told reporters. 'Anduril is going to make some [slice] of those things but… pretty much everybody that's working on IVAS Next [are companies] that I'm interested in working with.' Not all companies preparing to compete in IVAS Next have publicly announced plans. However, Massachusetts-based Kopin has also said it’s interested in competing, while companies like Palantir have been attending industry days.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/microsoft-announces-plan-to-slide-22-billion-ivas-contract-over-to-anduril/	2025-02-11T08:15:01-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/08/7941063-scaled-e1691079418376.jpg
Twin political paths President Trump can take to ensure nuclear deterrence	US President Donald Trump (2L) and Russia's President Vladimir Putin wait ahead a meeting in Helsinki, on July 16, 2018. (Photo credit ALEXEY NIKOLSKY/AFP via Getty Images) President Donald Trump enters office at a possible inflection point in the ongoing nuclear competition with China and Russia. Though it is a moment of great peril for the US nuclear modernization program, it is also one of great opportunity — should Trump choose to seize it. Both China and Russia have exploited America’s glacial effort to modernize its aging nuclear arsenal and atrophied defense-industrial base by rapidly expanding their own. Beijing has grown the world’s largest fleet of nuclear-capable land-based missile launchers. And Moscow has locked in a glaring theater nuclear advantage in Europe that helped constrain former President Joe Biden’s support for Ukraine’s defense against Russia. Compounding these developments is the fact that Washington, due to its deficient defense-industrial capacity, cannot reverse these trends in the near term by simply accelerating its troubled nuclear modernization program. And yet, despite the long-term structural problems with nuclear modernization, Trump still has readily available options at his disposal. Two near-term options, in particular, stand out. Both are political in nature, dealing with the 'software' of nuclear alliances and the mechanics of US domestic leadership. And both would generate immediate deterrence payoffs. First, Trump should move quickly to initiate political consultations within NATO to integrate Poland, in some form, into the alliance’s nuclear mission. Following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the deployment of Russian short-range nuclear weapons in Belarus, Warsaw has expressed interest in joining NATO’s nuclear-sharing program — an arrangement in which forward-stationed gravity bombs remain in US custody in peacetime, but are carried by allied aircraft during crises and wartime. Poland’s fervor to host US nuclear weapons is undoubtedly a reflection of NATO’s failure to adjust to two transformations in the post-Cold War European security environment: the migration of the alliance’s center of gravity from Germany to Poland, and Moscow’s massive theater nuclear buildup that dwarfs the hundred or so American gravity bombs based in countries far from Russia’s border, like Germany. Integrating Poland into NATO’s nuclear-sharing system would address NATO’s changing geography and Warsaw’s growing fear of Russia’s theater buildup. Washington would not necessarily have to station gravity bombs in Poland, where they would be more vulnerable to preemptive attack. Polish pilots, after all, could always fly dual-capable aircraft based in Germany, as both nation’s pilots will soon be trained on the F-35A. A larger wrinkle would be to bring Finland into the nuclear fold and field weapons in both Poland and Finland — whether permanently or only for temporary rotations. This alternative might appeal to Helsinki, which has expressed a nascent interest in revising its long-held prohibition of nuclear weapons transiting its territory. It would mean Poland was not the only nuclear-armed NATO member along Russia’s border. And it would have the bonus effect of creating a nuclearized perimeter on Russia’s frontier that would greatly complicate Kremlin planning. Of course, one can never know what, exactly, will deter Moscow. But Russia has a historic tendency to pick on the 'little guy' — and a nuclear-capable NATO frontline is no small matter. The fundamental point, though, at least in the short term, would be for Trump to send a political message to Russia via allied consultations that American security is indivisible from NATO. To be sure, this option is not a rationale for dramatically scaling back US conventional forces in Europe — which would only weaken the alliance’s overall deterrence. Nor should it be wielded as a bargaining chip in whatever negotiations Trump might pursue regarding the Russia-Ukraine war. Nuclear consultations should be treated on their own terms: as an effort to reinforce NATO via two allies who are already devoting vast resources to their own defense. The second option readily available to Trump would be for him to get the White House back in the business of explaining to the American people the mounting threats they face — and what this means for their security. Here, Trump has a tremendous opportunity to outshine Biden, who neglected his duty to make the public case for greater defense spending. The simple act of adequately resourcing the military will have a deterrence effect by showing Beijing and Moscow that Washington is serious about defense. But sending this message will be impossible unless Americans hear from their president why they should support a larger defense budget. Indeed, Trump can rip a page directly out of the Cold War playbook of Ronald Reagan, the last president to make the case for and oversee a military buildup to counter a nuclear-armed peer adversary. Beginning in the mid-1970s, Reagan hammered home the point that the country was on the wrong end of adverse trends in the Soviet-American strategic balance. And he clearly articulated, in speech after speech, why the country required modernized missiles and bombers to penetrate improved Soviet air defenses. Reagan’s rhetoric and preparations to deploy these new capabilities ultimately had a demoralizing impact on the Soviets and yielded a landmark arms-control agreement on theater nuclear forces. Indeed, the Kremlin, as one Soviet official later recalled, was 'already compromising' before the US nuclear buildup even began to pick up steam in the mid-1980s. Fortunately for President Trump, the measures discussed above don’t require immediate solutions to America’s troubled defense-industrial base. They simply require the will to speak frankly with allies and the American people. That nuclear modernization is beset with delays, a work-force shortage, and funding gaps is no reason to surrender to despair. President Trump, like Reagan, can achieve peace through strength if he seizes the opportunities before him.

Aussies hoping AUKUS relationship will spare them Trump’s steel, aluminum tariffs	US President Donald Trump displays a signed executive order in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, US, on Monday, Feb. 10, 2025. Trump ordered a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports, escalating his efforts to protect politically important US industries with levies hitting some of the country's closest allies. Photographer: Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images SYDNEY — Last week, made its first payment of $500 million USD to the United States to bolster the submarine industrial base, part of an eventual $3 billion investment inside the US to help speed up production of the Virginia-class nuclear powered attack submarine. It was a move that drew rare praise for a foreign government from Trump administration officials. Now, just days later, Australia finds itself hoping that goodwill can carry over after US President Donald Trump used an Executive Order to slap 25 percent tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports from around the globe. There is hope for an exemption, although, as has happened multiple times in the first few weeks of the new administration, the message coming from the White House is sometimes difficult to ascertain with any precision. When Trump signed the executive order for the tariffs, he told reporters that there would be 'no exemptions.' But he also said he had had a 'warm and constructive' call with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, during which the PM made the case for an exemption. Trump noted the trade surplus that America has with the Lucky Country, 'and the reason is they buy a lot of airplanes,' he said at the White House after speaking with Albanese. He added that he told the prime minister the exemption is 'something that we'll give great consideration to.' During a discussion today with reporters after the call with Trump, Albanese was very careful to say several times that 'we agreed on wording to say publicly, which is that the US president agreed that an exemption was under consideration.' Clearly echoing his conversation with Trump, Albanese noted that 'the US has a trade surplus with Australia that it's had since the Truman administration.' He noted that the US only imports about one percent of its steel and two percent of its aluminum from Australia. The fifth largest steel maker in America is an Australian company, BlueScope, which has invested about $5 billion into the US, the prime minister said. At least one AUKUS supporter is concerned: Rep. Joe Courtney, a Connecticut Democrat who is a major backer of the trilateral agreement, said in a statement that 'What we're seeing is a completely needless, almost insult to the people of Australia by raising tariffs of Australian products coming into this country.' 'They are buying three nuclear submarines, cash on the barrelhead, full price, no gimmes, no giveaway,' Courtney continued. 'So again, by all the measurements that President Trump talks about trade issues that we're being ripped off by other countries, in this case, every one of those arguments fails.' One Australian defense expert, John Blaxland of the Australian National University, compared his country's 'circumstances with its strategic cousins in Canada. There, tariffs are driving a strong nationalist reaction, while also triggering a period of reflection on trade and national security priorities internal to the nation.' Australia and Canada share many characteristics, as both are wealthy Commonwealth countries with parliamentary democracies and they have extremely close relations with the United States. And yet, Canada has found itself in Trump's crosshairs, to the point Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has warned that Trump's threats to annex Canada are 'a real thing.' Blaxland noted that 'the imposition of tariffs likely will have a corrosive effect on American soft power — of the latent good will in the Australian political scene towards positive US-Australian security and economic dynamics.' The good news for Australia is that steel and aluminum are not huge industries here so the country is not 'likely to suffer to any great degree as a result — as the pain probably will be diffused internationally,' he added. How should Australia measure its relationship with the United States, given the fact they are treaty allies, are working together to build a unique alliance based on the purchase and construction of nuclear-powered submarines and have fought side by side in every war since 1918? 'Do not be misled by the idea that there's any altruism in Washington towards Australia. Australians love to delude themselves to this,' former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull told the Australia Broadcasting Corporation. 'If we want to be respected, we have to stand up.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/aussies-hoping-aukus-relationship-will-spare-them-trumps-steel-aluminum-tariffs/	2025-02-11T06:38:07-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/trump-steel-tarrif-scaled-e1739283017690.jpg
Air Force pauses ‘reoptimization’ planning as service awaits new leadership	An F-15EX fighter jet taxis to its parking spot at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio (US Air Force) WASHINGTON — The Department of the Air Force has halted planning for a sweeping overhaul of its internal structures amid an order from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to wait for new, Senate-confirmed leadership before proceeding, the service confirmed today. 'On Feb. 6, the Secretary of Defense directed the Department of the Air Force to pause all planning actions connected to its Reoptimizing for Great Power Competition efforts. The planning pause remains in effect until a Senate-confirmed Secretary and Under Secretary of the Air Force are in place and have the opportunity to review the initiatives,' an Air Force spokesperson said in a statement. 'The Department of the Air Force welcomes the opportunity for our new leaders to assess all ongoing actions and ensure compliance with DoD directives. We will issue clarifying guidance, as necessary,' the spokesperson said. The pause does not require reversing reoptimization actions already undertaken, they added. Formally launched last year, the Department of the Air Force’s 'Reoptimizing for Great Power Competition' initiative aims to revamp Air Force and Space Force internal structures and processes; for example, by ensuring acquisitions are more integrated, and overhauling airman education and training. The pause on reoptimization planning was previously reported by Air &amp; Space Forces Magazine. The reorganization was launched, former Air Force Secretary Kendall explained last year, with the intent to properly prepare airmen and Guardians for potential conflict with China. The overarching effort entails two dozen changes across the Air Force and Space Force, officials said when it was unveiled. The pause comes amid a wide-ranging review of DoD initiatives under the new Trump administration, where officials have now focused their gaze on purported diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. Lawmakers have also voiced some skepticism of the reoptimization drive but have yet to substantively impede its progress. Trump has nominated Troy Meink, the National Reconnaissance Office’s No. 2 official, to serve as the next secretary of the Department of the Air Force. The president has additionally picked Matthew Lohmeier, a former Space Force lieutenant colonel removed from his post in 2021 over comments he made on a podcast, to serve as the department's next under secretary. Hearing dates for the two nominees have not yet been set, and it’s not clear how long the pause for reoptimization planning may last as a result.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/air-force-pauses-reoptimization-planning-as-service-awaits-new-leadership/	2025-02-10T12:33:37-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/02/240216_f15ex_taxi_6959449-e1708094519988.jpg
DoD acquisition reform guidance expected soon, with focus on rapid prototyping	US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth visits Joint Task Force North, US Northern Command, along the southern border at Fort Bliss, Texas earlier this month. (US Army/ Sgt. 1st Class Andrew R. Sveen) WASHINGTON — Defense industry insiders are preparing for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to issue new guidance for the Pentagon's acquisition process aimed at getting new tech into the field at a faster clip, Breaking Defense has learned. Hegseth is expected to sign out a new memo kickstarting the process as early as this week, according to two sources. Though that timing could shift and memo contents remain under wraps for now, it is expected to be the first of several steps designed to accelerate the process of buying and fielding new weapons and software. Both sources predicted an expanded role for the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) and its push to circumvent the traditional acquisition process. The wait for more details about priorities and the road ahead comes after Hegseth promised to 'rebuild' the military last week, to include the Department of Defense’s 'acquisitions process [and] how we rapidly field new technologies.' 'There's a lot of programs around here that we’ve spent a lot of money on that, when you actually wargame it, don't have the impact you want them to,' he said during a townhall-style event on Feb. 7. 'That means I'm going to take a lot of arrows, and I'm prepared to do so. That's fine,' he later added. 'We need the best systems in the hands of warfighters where they need it, to the COCOMs [combatant commanders] to deter and send the signals that when that fight comes, we're ready to win and win decisively.' Just how broad this shakeup will be remains to be seen, but a third source that works closely with a broad swath of defense companies said a new look at acquisition is par for the course when a new secretary hits the Pentagon. 'With all new administrations, there is a pretty much ‘stop, relook and clarify priorities period,’' the source said. 'And right now there is a sense of urgency with acquisition reform.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/dod-acquisition-reform-guidance-expected-soon-with-focus-on-rapid-prototyping/	2025-02-10T12:00:11-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/Hegseth2-e1739216330555.jpg
Promising biotech startups ‘dying on the vine’: In-Q-Tel	DNA molecular structure with sequencing data of human genome analysis. (Getty Images) WASHINGTON — Driven by the spread of CRISPR gene-editing techniques and rapid advances in AI-powered biochemical models, biotechnology is taking off. But not all biotech is equal in an investor’s eyes, and the biotech sectors that face the hardest fight for funding — at least in the United States — happen to be the ones with most promise for the Pentagon. While tens of billions of dollars pour into biotech ever year in the US and Europe, it overwhelmingly goes to pharmaceutical products, everything from lifesaving medicines like mRNA COVID vaccines to mass-market cosmetic creams, because those investments have the shortest and most obvious path to high returns. By contrast, there’s much less commercial demand — and a more confusing regulatory process — for other promising biotech that might matter for the military. That includes new, biologically-derived materials like lighter-weight body armor, anti-corrosion coatings or even explosives. 'The private sector on its own is not going to fund that stuff,' said Vivek Chilukuri, director of the technology and national security program at the Center for a New American Security, in an interview with Breaking Defense. 'It’s going to fund skin creams and lotions and other mass-market pharmaceuticals.' 'It's easier to … either go after quick-turn products or to really focus, laser focus, on high return-products,' Jessica Dymond, vice president for technology at In-Q-Tel, the nonprofit venture-capital arm of the US intelligence community, said last week at a panel hosted by CNAS. 'There's a lot left on the sidelines, that is, you know, quite frankly, dying on the vine.' Private-sector investment just isn’t coming fast enough to sustain these biotech startups, Dymondvadded. That means, she said, 'a lot of thought is needed in terms of how to cultivate that early, very fragile stage.' Investors weren’t always so hyper focused on pharmaceuticals, lamented another panelist at CNAS, Jason Kelly, cofounder of Ginkgo Bioworks, which provides high-tech tools for other biotech firms. 'Fastest growing area for us now is biopharma,' he said. But if you go back to the first influx of venture capital about ten years ago, he said, 'all the rage at that point was … being able to make new materials,' such as humane alternatives to leather and meat. However, he noted that when interest rates rose in the last few years, the funding for everything outside of pharmaceuticals 'evaporated.' 'When private markets aren't there for the parts of biotech that are relevant in defense, how do you back-stop it?' he asked. One federal effort to fill the gap is BioMADE, a nonprofit, public-private partnership aimed specifically at bio-manufacturing. It was launched in the last months of the first Trump administration with $87 million in Pentagon funding spread over seven years, and $187 million in private-sector and university funds. The Biden administration followed up in 2023 by pledging another $1.5 billion for various biomanufacturing initiatives spread over five years, so it will be up to President Donald Trump to continue it or not. There’s also a congressionally chartered National Security Commission on Emerging Biotechnology just now wrapping up its work, though they’re not focused solely on DoD interests or biomanufacturing. 'In just a few weeks, the NSCEB will publish our major report, including a number of policy recommendations,' said the chairman, Sen. Todd Young, in an address to CNAS after the panel. 'Our government must take targeted action in ways only the federal government can.' Otherwise, the Indiana Republican warned, China will capitalize on its current dominance of the low end of the biotech supply chain — by some estimates, it exports 40 percent of all active pharmaceutical ingredients worldwide — and steal undervalued American IP to take the lead in biotech writ large. 'China, in short, plays to win,' he said. This really is a moment that Congress and Trump can seize, said Chilukuri, a former Hill staffer himself. 'I’m optimistic that the commission is going to put forward some very thoughtful, practical recommendations,' he told Breaking Defense. While finding more federal funding at a time of feverish DOGE cuts is far from easy, the money that’s gone to bio-materials and other non-pharmaceutical biotech so far is 'a rounding error' in the Pentagon budget, he argued. Even without new funding, he went on, there is an opportunity to streamline biotech regulation and improve coordination among federal agencies — 13 different offices have some degree of jurisdiction, with multiple funding sources in DoD alone. 'These programs could stand to scale up, but that should be paired with an actual strategic plan at DoD about how these different programs are going to be married together and what is the actual vision for the next five to 10 years of actual products,' Chilukuri told Breaking Defense. 'We don’t have that plan right now, and it’s a huge opportunity that I think is just waiting for this administration to seize.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/promising-biotech-startups-dying-on-the-vine-in-q-tel/	2025-02-10T08:43:48-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/GettyImages-1703790414-scaled-e1738964966546.jpg
On Lebanese border, Israel’s Plasan kept rolling out armored vehicles as war raged	Plasan's Sandcat 'Tigris' (Photo courtesy of Plasan) SASA, Israel — The Israeli defense company Plasan makes armored solutions for military platforms, such as producing complex armored plates for vehicles. But the company had to think about a different kind of protection in 2024 — how it keep its facilities and staff safe as the war expanded into Lebanon. The company is located in the northern Israeli community of Sasa, around a mile from the Lebanese border, right along the front line of Israel’s conflict with Hezbollah. The company continued to roll vehicles off the line and keep up production throughout the war. During a visit to Plasan, representatives discussed how they kept up with orders and dealt with the disruptions of war. The northern border of Israel is quiet these days. The rolling hills of the upper Galilee are preparing for spring, and some trees even have blossoms already. But for most of 2024 this area was a war zone. Israel evacuated more than 60,000 people from border communities in October 2023 when Hezbollah began rocket and drone attacks on northern Israel. Roads near the border were closed and concrete barriers were erected in many places where drivers or soldiers might be exposed to anti-tank guided missile (ATGM) fire. 'On October 7 [2023] the army came and took vehicles we had, those about to be delivered,' recalls Gilad Ariav, vice-president of marketing and business development at Plasan. And given the demand from the IDF, the company was charged with keeping production up at normal or higher rates, despite the potential dangers of being so close to the border. The IDF needed ceramic plates for soldiers, and Plasan reopened an old line to produce them, working 24/7 to produce 35,000 plates while also increasing production of armored vehicles. While the members of the Sasa Kibbutz that is adjacent to the company were evacuated to the south, the company’s employees stayed at work. Around 50 percent of the employees were called up to IDF reserve duty. 'It didn’t prevent us [from delivering]' says Ariav. As the company provided a tour of its site, the evidence of the threats from the last fifteen months of war was still visible: In one section of the factory there are several window sections that have been impacted by various projectiles. There is also one vehicle that is missing a rear wheel and was hit by some kind of IED, and concrete barriers remain in place to protect against missile fire from Lebanon. Members of the company described how one could often see and hear interceptions overhead during the war. Not only was Sasa targeted, but Mount Meron, which looms a mile away across a nearby valley, was often targeted because it has an IDF base near its peak. Many of the residents of the community around the company have not fully returned to their homes and schools. (Overall Plasan has around 450 employees in Israel and around 700 worldwide, with subsidiaries in the US, Australia and France.) But officials are proud of the fact that despite the frequent sirens, need to go into shelters, and the constant threats, the work went on. Today the company appears to be continuing to work at a fast pace to produce its armored solutions. In one area of a factory floor Ariav shows how armored plates for things such as doors of vehicles are produced. Small hexagonal ceramic pieces are placed as a layer and then they are sandwiched between metal, which the company says helps absorb blasts. During a presentation, Ariav stressed how the company uses live trials to test its armor and solutions against explosions and projectiles, as well as running complex computer simulations. The simulations examine how different projectiles might hit a plate, or how an improvised explosive device would impact armor. This saves the cost and effort of blowing up numerous vehicles, Ariav says the simulations have proven effective in terms of final design and predicting how threats will impact armor. In another area, the company showcased their FlexFence defense against RPGs, which looks like a kind of fence that can be draped around parts of the vehicle. The fence uses special technology to trigger the RPG and helps protect the vehicle from being penetrated, so that the damage of the blast is reduced. The firm is also in production on a number of vehicles. One is the Sandcat, which is called the 'Tigris' by the IDF. The company uses the chassis of F-550s and then adds an armored body on top of them. This is an armored solution the company calls Kitted Hull and it provides protection from all angles, including below for mines and above against small bomblets that drones can drop. In one hangar the company is producing the Sandcats for both the IDF and what they said was another, undisclosed customer. Each has a different configuration, and employees work on the vehicles by hand, producing around ten vehicles a week. Besides the Sandcats, a major focus for the firm are contracts for armoring JLTVs with Oshkosh as well as the Australian Redback infantry fighting vehicle, which is made by South Korea’s Hanwha. The company is also up-armoring a number of Piranhas, a family of fighting vehicles the originated in Switzerland in the 1970s and is now in its fifth generation and in use by a dozen countries. In addition, Plasan is also working on a new system called an All-Terrain Electric Mission Module (ATeMM), which is an electric-powered 'modular' system that can function as a kind of trailer for a vehicle, or be used as a four-wheeled robotic unmanned vehicle. ATeMM was first unveiled in 2021 but was tested by the IDF in the recent war in Lebanon. It was one of many vehicles in the Plasan factory that seemed to encapsulate how technology is transforming not only armored vehicles but also solutions for maneuvering forces — the kind of lesson that comes from 15 months of a multi-front war.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/on-lebanese-border-israels-plasan-kept-rolling-out-armored-vehicles-as-war-raged/	2025-02-10T07:14:49-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/PLASAN_SANDCAT_TIGRIS-004-690x388-1-e1738961341316.png
L3Harris unveils command, control software envisioned for 1,000s of drones	The 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment and the Threat Systems Management Office operate a swarm of 40 drones to test the rotational units capabilities during the battle of Razish, National Training Center on May 8th, 2019. This exercise was the first of many held at the National Training Center. (US Army Photo by Pv2 James Newsome) WASHINGTON — L3Harris today announced it is unveiling a new command and control software, dubbed 'AMORPHOUS,' designed to control thousands of unmanned systems in a 'swarm,' joining a number of other companies in recent years that have homed in on that technology as a gap in the Pentagon's arsenal. 'There have been concepts that have said maybe you need one particular asset that is referred to as the mothership, or the brains of the operation,' Jon Rambeau, president of integrated missions systems, told reporters last week. 'We believe that's not the best approach, because if something happens — that asset is degraded, it's attacked, it's no longer able to communicate, then what happens?' The answer, Rambeau said, is that AMORPHOUS is designed to pass control of the swarm from one asset to another on the fly. Toby Magsig, vice president of autonomy programs, added that the idea behind a 'leaderless swarm' is that the user sends out instructions — for example, conduct a search of the area — to every asset in the swarm, but the drones intelligently delegate tasks among themselves. AMORPHOUS — Autonomous Multi-domain Operations Resiliency Platform for Heterogeneous Unmanned Swarms — is currently being used on contracts for the Army and the Defense Innovation Unit. To date it has demonstrated the ability to control 'multiple separate assets across multiple vehicle types operating in different domains during government-managed tests.' Asked about how large of a swarm AMORPHOUS has controlled to date, Magsig said the top number has been in the 'double digits,' and he believes it will soon exceed 100. 'It becomes an economy of scale in terms of testing this live, when you talk sort of four digits &#8230; and so that's where we rely on a Live, Virtual, Constructive mix to get and test and validate this scalability to what DOD is really looking for,' he said. Rambeau and Magsig acknowledged their product is joining a crowded field of competitors. Indeed, companies such as HII and Swedish defense giant Saab, among others, have all recently been making plays into software development focused on unmanned systems command and control. L3Harris's pitch may be among the more ambitious in scale but it's unclear how the Pentagon — or more precisely, each of the individual services — will approach the question of controlling thousands of drones in concert on a joint battlefield.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/l3harris-unveils-command-control-software-envisioned-for-1000s-of-drones/	2025-02-10T06:00:40-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/241205_DVIDS_drone_swarm_5356116-scaled-e1733415596741.jpg
Senate Republicans release budget plan with $150B more for defense	Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina and chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, center, arrives with Senator Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, right, during a confirmation hearing in Washington, DC, US, on Wednesday, Jan. 22, 2025. (Photographer: Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — The Senate Budget Committee has released a budget blueprint that, if ultimately passed by Congress, could add $150 billion in new funds for defense. Details of exactly what that funding could pay for will be determined by the House and Senate Armed Services Committees if the budget resolution is passed. However, a summary of the bill lays out four main focus areas: maintaining military readiness; growing the Navy and strengthening the shipbuilding industrial base; building an integrated air and missile defense for the United States — a Trump administration priority it has termed the 'Iron Dome for America' — and investments in the nuclear enterprise. The new budget resolution, unveiled today by Budget Committee Chairman Sen. Lindsey Graham, tees up a separate process for the Senate and the House as the two legislative bodies grapple over how best to enact President Donald Trump’s policy agenda. The goal, as espoused by Trump and supported by House Speaker Mike Johnson, is for 'one beautiful bill' containing all the president’s priorities to move through Congress via the process of reconciliation, which allows bills to avoid filibuster and pass with a simple majority. However, the Senate is opting for a two-bill strategy, with a first that focuses on border security, defense and energy priorities and a second to follow that would extend tax cuts enacted in Trump’s first administration. The Senate Budget Committee will mark up its version of the budget resolution next Wednesday and Thursday. The House has not put forward its own budget blueprint. 'To those who voted for and support real border security and a stronger defense in a troubled world, help is on the way,' Graham said in a statement. 'This budget resolution jumpstarts a process that will give President Trump’s team the money they need to secure the border and deport criminals, and make America strong and more energy independent.' In a January interview with Breaking Defense, SASC chairman Roger Wicker, R-Miss., said he was advocating for '$100 billion a year [for defense] for the next two years' to be added during the reconciliation process, which could help pay for defense needs such as Iron Dome, shipbuilding and submarine production, and sixth-generation fighter aircraft. In addition to the defense funds, the Senate resolution would add $175 billion in homeland security spending and $175 billion in spending to be determined by the judiciary committees. It would obligate an additional $85.5 billion to the federal budget each year from FY25-FY28, but that spending would be offset by equivalent cuts, according to a summary of the budget. The text of the bill directs several committees, such as agriculture and education, to identify potential cuts, and all committees would have until March 7 to provide recommendations. The reconciliation process is just one mechanism that Republicans are looking at in order to obtain funding for a US Iron Dome. Elsewhere, Sens. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, and Kevin Cramer, R-ND, introduced legislation this week pushing for $19.5 billion for a US Iron Dome, with expenses including $12 billion to expand missile interceptors in Alaska with Next Generation Interceptors, and $1.4 billion for the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/senate-republicans-release-budget-plan-with-150b-more-for-defense/	2025-02-07T13:20:57-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/GettyImages-2194682859-scaled-e1738963129851.jpg
Days after showing off ‘Gaza’ drone, Iran unveils its first drone carrier	Iranian-made unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), the Shahed-136, are pictured during a military rally in downtown Tehran, Iran, on January 10, 2025. The IRGC spokesperson says on Monday, January 6, that the military rally named Rahian-e-Quds (Passengers of Al-Aqsa) includes 110,000 IRGC members. (Photo by Morteza Nikoubazl/NurPhoto via Getty Images) BEIRUT — Iran this week unveiled its first indigenous drone carrier, dubbed Shahid (Martyr) Baqeri according to Iran's state-run media Islamic Republic News Agency. The carrier joined the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps Navy (IRGC) fleet in a Thursday ceremony held in the city of Bandar Abbas on the shore of the strategic strait of Hurmuz in the Arabian Gulf. The vessel is expected to conduct drone and helicopter naval missions, according to the announcement. Iran is the second country in the Middle East to develop and launch a drone carrier after Turkey, which began operating its drone carrier, the TCG Anadolu, in April 2023. 'The Martyr Baqeri drone carrier is capable of carrying several squadrons of unmanned aerial vehicles, launching and landing unmanned fighter jets, deploying various reconnaissance and combat drones, launching and recovering various light and fast combat vessels, as well as carrying and deploying various combat and support helicopters,' IRCG Navy Commander Rear Admiral Alireza Tangsiri said, according to Iran's partially state-owned news agency Tasnim. He added that the carrier will enhance Tehran’s 'defensive capabilities and deterrence of the Islamic Republic of Iran in distant waters and in safeguarding the nation’s national interests.' The carrier’s operational range is 22,000 nautical miles, and its runway is 180 meters long, according to Tasnim. Ryan Bohl, senior Middle East and North Africa analyst at the RANE network, told Breaking Defense today that this carrier will add brown-water power projection capabilities for Tehran, 'particularly through the Gulf and around Yemen and the Red Sea. Having an independent drone platform based at sea will also improve Iran's surveillance and intelligence capabilities in theaters in which it has strategic interests like Yemen.' He added that the most immediate impact for Iran's strategic posture will be in 'surveillance capability where drones will help Iran provide proxies with better information for potential targeting missions of mutual rivals like intelligence cooperation with the Houthis to strike Israeli linked shipping or rivals in the Yemeni civil War.' However, Bohl doubted Shahid Baqeri’s long-range capabilities, noting that it cannot operate far from Iran's shores if not accompanied with support fleet or advanced anti-air defenses. The announcement comes days after Iran's operational long-range drone dubbed 'Gaza,' took part in a military exercise, and few months after Tehran and Jerusalem exchanged a barrage of missiles and drones. While Iran’s navy and the IRGC navy operate old and outdated vessels, Behnam Ben Taleblu, senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told Breaking Defense today that Tehran has a history in converting container vessels into warships. Ben Taleblu voiced concerns, saying 'The Islamic Republic would not be converting tankers into drone carriers if it did not intend on making its regional drone power a global one.' 'What makes the Shahid Baqeri unique is that it is billed by Iran as being exclusively used for drones making it the first drone carrier for the IRGC Navy,' he said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/days-after-showing-off-gaza-drone-iran-unveils-its-first-drone-carrier/	2025-02-07T10:45:28-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/GettyImages-2192728860-scaled-e1738946595181.jpg
EXCLUSIVE: DoD memo seeks review of Space Development Agency’s independent status, plans	Space Development Agency Tracking Layer satellites will keep eyes on both ballistic and hypersonic missiles. (Graphic: L3Harris) WASHINGTON — The Defense Department's acquisition office is calling for a review of whether the Space Development Agency's (SDA) 'organizational performance and acquisition approach' is meeting the needs of warfighters — and whether the agency should keep its independent status within the Space Force, Breaking Defense has learned. In a memo signed Jan. 31 and obtained by Breaking Defense, Steven Morani, who is performing the duties of the DoD undersecretary for acquisition and sustainment, requests the Department of the Air Force to set up an 'independent review team [IRT]' to assess 'the current state of health' of all programs comprising SDA's Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture (PWSA). The Department of the Air Force is responsible for civilian oversight of the Space Force. While SDA has been given freedom to make some acquisition decisions outside of the usual Air Force acquisition system, oversight is still provided by the office of the assistant secretary for space acquisition and integration. Maj. Gen. Stephen Purdy, the office's military deputy, is currently the acting head. Morani's memo — while stressing that the called-for review should not interfere with the ongoing investigation or current contracts — states that if the review team finds 'any significant risks or issues related to contracting strategy, funding, schedule, or performance/capability delivery, the IRT should provide a characterization of impacts from these risks, with recommendations for corrective action.' Importantly, it makes it clear that one such corrective action could be for DoD and the Air Force to strip SDA of its semi-independent status underneath the Space Force — with Morani tasking the review team to assess 'the efficacy of the SDA’s organizational staffing, structure, processes, and position as a direct reporting unit within the United States Space Force (USSF).' While signed, it is unclear whether the memo has been approved by Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, and if it has been officially circulated within the Department of the Air Force, the Space Force and SDA. An Air Force spokesperson referred a request for comment to the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD); neither SDA or OSD responded to a request for comment by press time. After initial congressional skepticism about its creation, SDA's recent performance has been widely lauded on Capitol Hill as the kind of innovative and rapid acquisition approach that should be serving as a model for the rest of the Space Force's acquisition programs managed by Space Systems Command (SSC). However, several government sources told Breaking Defense that Space Force and SSC officials have been concerned that SDA has made no plans for how it will transition its satellites and ground stations to active operations by Space Force personnel. For example, it long has been unclear how the PWSA missile Tracking Layer will be integrated with SSC's planned Resilient Missile Warning/Missile Tracking constellation in medium-Earth orbit, as well as the Next-Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared missile warning satellites now in development. Nor, these sources said, has there been any Space Force budget planning for future operations of the PWSA network. SDA's first operational satellites currently are expected to launch this spring. The PWSA envisions multiple constellations of small satellites in low Earth orbit for rapid data relay, ballistic and hypersonic missile tracking, and 'fire control' for missile interceptors, as well as their associated ground systems. SDA also is looking at the potential of equipping some of the PWSA-related birds with capabilities to back up the Global Positioning System satellites used for positioning, navigation and timing. Morani's memo also seems to explain the decision by the Air Force not to elevate the agency's deputy, Ryan Frigm, to serve as acting director in the wake of the department's Jan. 16 decision to place then-SDA director Derek Tournear on administrative leave for undisclosed reasons. Instead, the Air Force first assigned Lt. Gen. Philip Garrant, the head of SSC, to step in, and then just two days ago replaced him with William Blauser, deputy head of the Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office. The changeover came following concerns expressed by Sen. Kevin Cramer, R.-ND, that the choice of Garrant appeared to be a move to subordinate SDA to SSC in defiance of the 2021 National Defense Authorization Act that stipulated the agency remain a separate organization, with a direct line to Space Force chief Gen. Chance Saltzman. 'Removing Derek Tournear from his duties as SDA director sends a chilling message to all DoD innovators: bureaucrats will oppose you and win every time,' Cramer said in a Feb. 5 statement to Breaking Defense. 'By putting SDA under the control of SSC, it only compounded that warning. Congress specifically spelled out that SDA would be a direct reporting unit within Space Force, so we corrected the latter situation. We need to fix the former issue as soon as possible.' Ashley Roque and Valerie Insinna contributed to this report.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/exclusive-dod-memo-seeks-review-of-space-development-agencys-independent-status-plans/	2025-02-07T10:07:57-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/220718_l3harris_sat_missile_tracking.png
President Trump should base a new anti-terrorism team for the Pacific in American Samoa	Members of the Fleet Anti-terrorism Security Team Pacific, 2nd Company, 2nd Platoon, pictured in 2012. (U.S. Navy/James Norman) In the Pacific, the Trump Administration has inherited a set of US embassies and consulates that is different from the one that they managed during their prior term in office. Since then, the regional diplomatic footprint has expanded to include new embassies in Solomon Islands, Tonga, and Vanuatu. The administration therefore needs to think carefully about what US military posture changes are needed to be able to mitigate the diplomatic security risks for US embassies, consulates, and consular agencies in Fiji, French Polynesia, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Tonga, and Vanuatu — all areas of interest for the US as it seeks to counter China. One simple solution: The president and the Pentagon should consider the activation of a new Fleet Anti-Terrorism Security Team (FAST) Company South Pacific, an elite unit of Marines which can be rapidly deployed to immediately secure US diplomats, officials, embassies or other US personnel or property. The Marine Corps Security Force Regiment has a small number of FAST Companies that are forward deployed to overseas military bases, including in Bahrain, Spain and Japan. These OCONUS forces provide Geographic Combatant Commanders with a unique set of rapid response expeditionary anti-terrorism and security capabilities that can be used to protect national assets and conduct other limited duration contingency operations. Among other things, the FAST Companies provide Geographic Combatant Commanders with a unique set of capabilities for rapidly responding to non-traditional security threats against US diplomatic missions and their staff. A well-known example would be the 2012 attack on the US Consulate in Benghazi. Adding a second FAST unit in the Pacific would send a loud signal that the US government is committed to making investments necessary to protect the safety and security of US diplomatic personnel and military forces across this vast region. It would also be logistically sound, as the current Asia-Pacific FAST Company is located in Japan but has responsibilities in the entire Pacific region. A second FAST would provide a much-needed rapid response and forward-deployed expeditionary anti-terrorism security forces that could also respond to other non-traditional crises involving US diplomatic and military postures in the Pacific Islands. If the DoD determines that such an investment is warranted, then they should next consider where to station the unit. In our opinion, the best option would be to select the Pele US Army Reserve Center in American Samoa. American Samoa has the air and maritime port infrastructure that is required to be able to respond to the full range of possible crises and contingencies. It is also the US permanently inhabited territory in closest proximity to our new and planned diplomatic posts in Melanesia and Polynesia. That makes it an optimal location for projecting rapid response and forward-deployed expeditionary security forces for the purpose of ensuring diplomatic security across the region. President Donald Trump has openly criticized how the Obama administration responded to the attack on Benghazi that resulted in the deaths of United States Ambassador Christopher Stevens and American diplomat Sean Smith. He has criticized how the Biden Administration mitigated the known threats associated with the Kabul Airlift that resulted in the deaths of over a dozen American service members. FAST Companies can help on the front line of threats to Americans abroad under his new administration. And decisions can be made quickly about them — the National Security Council could order an assessment of FAST Companies within 60 days, and come out of that with posture recommendations. If such a review happens, it will become obvious that in the South Pacific, the United States government faces a number of challenges. The biggest is that there is a high level of risk for either natural or manmade crises in a number of countries that host US diplomatic missions. There is also the risk of major power competition destabilizing the region even further. A FAST Company South Pacific could help to mitigate both of those risks. From the CCP focus on the region to the possibility of the aftermath following any natural disaster at the location of a US embassy in the Pacific Islands, there are increasing reasons to have FAST capabilities in readiness in the South Pacific. Stationing a FAST unit in American Samoa would strengthen the hand of US diplomacy in the South Pacific and bolster the sense of US presence and attention among allied partnerships in the island nations. Rep. Aumua Amata Coleman Radewagen is the Member of Congress representing American Samoa in the United States House of Representatives. Michael Walsh is a subject matter expert on Pacific Affairs.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/president-trump-should-base-a-new-anti-terrorism-team-for-the-pacific-in-american-samoa/	2025-02-07T08:08:11-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/FLEET-security-scaled-e1738877919994.jpg
Israel completes next round of counter drone testing with guns, interceptors	Officials pose with some of the technology shown off at the counter drone demonstration in Israel. (Israeli MoD photo) JERUSALEM — The Israeli Ministry of Defense has completed a new round of trials testing various counter-drone solutions, the ministry said in a Feb. 5 statement, as the military here seeks an accelerated focus on the unmanned threat. The latest test run, focused on countering smaller drone threats, involved the nine Israeli companies and twenty 'advanced counter-drone technologies,' the ministry said. The trials took place in southern Israel’s Negev desert, where there is ample space for downing drones without any civilians around. 'The UAV threat is an evolving and multi-arena threat that has expanded to all our combat sectors, led by Iran and its proxies,' Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said in the statement in which he described the c-UAS effort as a 'national' priority. 'Against our enemies, we are committed to continue advancing and introducing new capabilities to the battlefield in the near term. We will act to ensure maximum protection for our citizens and forces on the ground against UAVs from Iran, Yemen, Lebanon, and any arena where we may be required to respond,' Katz said. During the recent multi-front war that Israel fought in the wake of the Hamas attack on October 7, 2023, the country faced numerous complex drone threats. Hundreds of drone attacks were carried out by Hezbollah. The Houthis in Yemen also were able to penetrate Israel’s airspace in July 2024 with a drone attack on Tel Aviv. Iranian-backed Iraqi militias also launched numerous drones at Israel. The drones come in various shapes and sizes, most of them several meters long and with a wingspan of approximately two meters with a warhead at the front of the fuselage. But smaller quadcopter and other drone threats also emerged as a problem for Israel; the Ukraine war has illustrated the exponential growth that drones have had on the modern battlefield. Hence, the new focus on c-UAS systems. The original trials back in October were initiated by Maj. Gen. (Res) Eyal Zamir, who has been tapped as the IDF’s next Chief of Staff — meaning a key figure in this push for finding new technology will soon have his hand on the helm of the IDF if it takes delivery of these new systems. The IDF is also partnering with the US Department of Defense Irregular Warfare Technical Support Directorate (IWTSD) in this effort, the ministry noted. The NDAA for fiscal year 2024 included authorization for US-Israel counter-UAS cooperation, and the Israeli military was keen to point out American participation in the most recent trials. 'With more than twenty U.S. C-UAS experts from across the DoD participating in the blind test, this event plays a critical role in fostering cooperation between the nations, rapidly enhancing joint defense capabilities, and improving the chances of success,' the MoD said. 'Following the analysis of current trial results, the IMOD plans to select several technologies for accelerated development and production processes, aiming to deploy new operational capabilities immediately,' the ministry added. The methods of interception appear to break down into two broad categories. One is the use of guns or projectiles to shoot down the drones. The second method is to use drones to take down drones, either having a drone run into a drone or having it drop a net onto a drone. Laser interceptors did not seem to be a main focus of the trials, even though Israel has focused on developing various laser technologies for intercepting threats over the last several years. As to who attended the trial, it was a mix of major firms and smaller companies. Elbit Systems and Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) both showcased various means of detecting drones and then shooting them down using a 30mm cannon. Rafael Advanced Defense Systems also brought its Mini Typhoon gun to the trial. All these companies have years of experience developing various systems for detecting and guarding against drone threats. Xtend, in cooperation with Axioma and Elbit Systems, demonstrated an advanced drone-based interception system, essentially using a drone to take down a drone. Airobotics, Tamar Group, General Robotics, Smartshooter, Robotican and Elisra also demonstrated other concepts. Most of these companies participated in the first round of trials back in October. 'In the coming months, we will select the most suitable capabilities and implement them extensively throughout the IDF,' the head of Planning and Force Build-Up Directorate, Maj. Gen. Eyal Harel, said in a statement.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/israel-completes-next-round-of-counter-drone-testing-with-guns-interceptors/	2025-02-07T06:14:39-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/MOD5February5-israeli-mod-drone-e1738936540301.jpg
India budget boosted 9.5%, but analysts say pensions hindering weapons spending	INS VIkrant with 4 MiG-29K fighters (Indian government) CANBERRA — India's defense budget is soaring by 9.53 percent, to a record high of 681, 210 crore ($78.8 billion) for 2025-2026, according to a new announcement from Delhi. And though more than a quarter of that record total will be put toward new equipment, analysts say the country must do more to restructure the military's pension-heavy spending to concentrate even further on building more and better weapons, in the face of challenges at its borders with Pakistan, China and beyond. 'With spending skewed towards pensions, the status quo must give way to a more ambitious restructuring,' says a report by Harsh Pant and Kartik Bommakanti of the Delhi-based Observer Research Foundation. They note that salaries, pensions, maintenance, repairs, and infrastructure constitute 72 percent of the total defense budget. 'The government cannot entirely overlook the need to evaluate and determine expenditure based on the military threats and capabilities of China and Pakistan, as well as their military expenditures relative to India’s,' their report says. Similarly, Ian Hall, a professor at Griffith University in Queensland, said in an email that salaries and pensions 'consume a very big slice of the budget,' noting that while the overall budget is almost 10% larger than last year's, the budget for weapons 'has only grown by a bit over 4.5%' despite inflation running at at least 5 percent in India. Hall also said that 'the overall budget remains low in terms of percentage of GDP — about 1.9%, in fact, which is unsustainably low, given the threats India faces from Pakistan and China, and indeed in the Northeast, due to spillovers from Myanmar and so on.' According to analyst Neelanjana Banerjee, the budget breaks down like this: India Defense Budget: Key Weapons Spending: The 'big strategic questions,' Hall said, are 'does India have what it needs to hold its own on the Line of Actual Control with China and can it sustain the deployments it has had to make since 2020, and what contribution can India make in maritime security in the Indian Ocean and perhaps beyond?' That's a reference to the conflict that broke out along India's border with China in 2020, where it suffered 20 dead in the Galwan Valley. The eerie combat was fought at high altitude by slow moving soldiers wielding sticks and clubs. At least four Chinese soldiers died. Hall says India can 'probably, but only just' control the line. 'India desperately needs drones, air defense systems, better tanks and fighting vehicles, fighter aircraft, and especially helicopters,' Hall said. Pant and Hall agreed that India's sluggish procurement system has not been good at delivering on major systems. 'We're still waiting for systems to be selected and contracts to be signed in a range of really important areas &#8211; especially a new batch of conventional submarines, but also fighter aircraft,' Hall said. That may have to change under US President Donald Trump, who has threatened India with tariffs while also urging the Indo-Pacific power to boost 'its procurement of American-made security equipment and moving toward a fair bilateral trading relationship.' (Politico reported today that Indian leader Narendra Modi will be visiting Washington on Feb. 13.) Many of the advanced systems that India needs will continue to come from foreign countries, Pant told Breaking Defense today in a phone interview. And Trump's pressure is likely to result in 'a lot of these sort of big, big ticket buy ins happening over the next few years, trying to satisfy Mr. Trump that India is engaged with the US on defense,' he said. But most of the weapons budget, known as the capital acquisitions budget has been allocated to locally-built systems. That program — the Atmanirbhar Bharat — has successfully boosted the amount of weapons and parts produced by Indian companies. 'India’s defense sector has undergone a remarkable transformation since 2014, evolving from a largely import-dependent military force to one increasingly focused on self-reliance and indigenous production,' a government statement released on Feb. 1 said. But India sees the Indian Ocean as a critical waterway in need of regular patrols to help monitor and counter Chinese submarines and surface ships. But the slow pace of defense procurement has not helped much. 'On a strategic basis, India does have 65-odd ships on order, but it needs more, faster, and it needs better and longer-range submarines, plus aircraft,' Hall said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/india-budget-boosted-9-5-but-analysts-say-pensions-hindering-weapons-spending/	2025-02-06T23:04:47-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/INS_VIkrant_R11_underway_in_the_Arabian_Sea_with_4_Mig-29K_Fighter_Jet_performing_flypast-e1738878037421.jpg
Navy awards several contracts aimed at advancing key mine countermeasures capabilities	The Mine Countermeasures Unmanned Surface Vehicle is recovered onboard the Manchester (LCS 14) during a testing activity. (Photo courtesy of US Navy) WASHINGTON — The US Navy says it has recently made a series of contract awards to advance the mine countermeasures mission package (MCM MP) slated to deploy on its Littoral Combat Ships. 'With the first deliveries of the MCM MP underway and deployments closely following, it is critical to ensure we have the contracts in place to procure and deliver the quantity of mission packages to the Fleet required in today’s changing world,' said Capt. Matthew Lehmann, LCS Mission Modules program manager. 'These contract awards ensure our Littoral Combat Ships will continue to receive the modernized MCM equipment needed to conduct their missions, allowing our sailors to operate safely and stay outside of the minefield.' The MCM mission package is comprised of a dozen capabilities that, when working in tandem, are designed to clear the water of buried and bottomed mines. Its development and deployment paves the way for the service’s legacy MH-53E Sea Dragon helicopters and Avenger-class MCM ships to be retired. The awarded contracts include a $7.7 million advanced material order to Bollinger Shipyards, which focuses on procuring items needed to address findings from the operational testing done on the MCM Unmanned Surface Vehicle. That USV is one of the mission package’s key capabilities, and is able to be deployed off an LCS or other vessel of opportunity. The drone is designed to be capable of minesweeping, hunting and neutralization. 'The Navy also awarded a production contract for the Minehunt Payload Delivery System (MH PDS) to Raytheon Technologies. This contract is valued at $18.3 million to produce five units with deliveries by the end of FY26,' according to the service’s statement. 'Additionally, the Navy awarded a production contract for the Minesweep Payload Delivery System (MS PDS) to Textron Systems. This contract is valued at $12.1 million to produce four units, for delivery early in FY27,' the statement continued. The Raytheon-made system is an 'acoustic and magnetic' minesweeping capability, while the Textron-made system uses an 'AN/AQS-20 sonar to perform mine hunting missions.' 'As we continue to face evolving threats in the littoral environment, these investments not only enhance our operational readiness but also demonstrate our commitment to safeguarding our Sailors and maintaining a competitive edge,' said Rear Adm. Kevin Smith, PEO USC program executive officer. 'By modernizing and expanding our MCM mission packages, we are providing our forces with the tools necessary to maintain access to key maritime regions and keep global shipping lanes safe.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/navy-awards-several-contracts-aimed-at-advancing-key-mine-countermeasures-capabilities/	2025-02-06T13:10:45-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/220810_navy_usv_mcm_larger.png
‘Defending the skies,’ France delivers first Mirage 2000 fighters to Ukraine	Members of Marine Aerial Refueler Squadron-234, (VMGR-234) provide aerial refueling to French Mirage 2000 Fighters from a K C-130J over Djibouti (US Air Force) BELFAST — France has delivered Mirage 2000 fourth-generation fighter jets to Ukraine in a much needed strike capability boost for Kyiv as it continues to combat Russian forces. 'The first of them arrived in Ukraine today,' Sébastien Lecornu, France’s Armed Forces Minister, said of the Dassault-made aircraft deliveries in a translated X post. The planes will be mainly deployed to carry out air-to-ground strikes. 'With Ukrainian pilots on board who have been trained for several months in France, they will now participate in defending the skies of Ukraine,' Lecornu added. He did not disclose the exact number of aircraft delivered, but various reports state France’s National Assembly has previously shared that six Mirage 2000-5 platforms would be sent. Western nations, which have also supplied Ukraine with US-made F-16 fourth-generation jets have typically not commented on aircraft quantities upon delivery due to operational security concerns. Sharing details of the plan to send the Mirage jets to Ukraine, Lecornu said last year that they would be equipped with air-to-ground weapons and new electronic warfare equipment. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy welcomed the new aircraft deliveries on X, calling them 'another significant step in strengthening Ukraine’s security.' He added, 'With the latest deliveries, we are also continuing to expand our F-16 fleet, with the Netherlands fulfilling its commitments to support this effort.' As of July 2024, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium and Norway had collectively agreed to supply around 80 F-16s to Kyiv under an air force capability coalition, which includes 16 nations in all. Additionally, Denmark, Romania, the UK and the US host Ukraine pilot training for the jet. In the early stages of the war, Ukraine was forced to rely predominately on Soviet-era MiG-29 and Su-27 combat jets to counter Russia’s invasion, though officials and experts have said the supply of F-16s won’t be a silver bullet. Zelensky has also pushed hard for supplies of Swedish Gripen fighter jets, but according to Swedish Minister of Defence Pal Jonson, other allies requested such a plan be put on hold to accommodate Kyiv first getting to grips with the F-16. Meanwhile, a key shift in leadership for the multinational Ukraine Defense Contact Group appears to be on the way after the Trump administration reportedly told the UK to take on the role of chair for a new meeting next week, in what would be a first for London. The Times newspaper said that UK Defence Secretary John Healey will become the new chair, which has been exclusively held by the US since 2022, though it remains unclear if the change is a one-off or if a rotational style involving different countries will be implemented going forward. The Office of the Secretary of Defense did not immediately respond to a request for comment. US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is expected to lead a US delegation when the group meets at the Ramstein Airbase in Germany. The supposed pivot by President Donald Trump would mark a significant departure from Ukraine military aid policy under the Biden administration, with former US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin imploring the 50-member-strong group not to 'flinch,' 'falter,' or 'fail,' during a farewell address last month.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/defending-the-skies-france-delivers-first-mirage-2000-fighters-to-ukraine/	2025-02-06T11:59:13-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/6661467-scaled-e1718200536958.jpg
Exclusive: Here’s who Hegseth may task to put together Trump’s Iron Dome plan	A ground-based interceptor is launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, toward a ballistic missile target launched from Alaska during a test Dec. 5, 2008. (Photo courtesy of the Missile Defense Agency) WASHINGTON — Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has been drafted an all-hands-on-deck memo for crafting an action plan to deploy a comprehensive missile shield over the United States, including readying a budget request for fiscal 2026, Breaking Defense has learned. The undated, unsigned 'strategic guidance,' obtained by Breaking Defense, lays out a two-phase process — led by the undersecretary for policy and supported by the assistant secretary for space policy — for meeting the 60-day deadline set by President Donald Trump in his Jan. 27 'Iron Dome for America' executive order. That deadline requires a DoD action plan to substantiate a 'next-generation missile shield &#8230; against ballistic, hypersonic, advanced cruise missiles, and other next-generation aerial attacks from peer, near-peer, and rogue adversaries.' Former Heritage Foundation adviser Alexander Velez-Green is currently 'performing the duties' of the USD-policy role while Elbridge Colby awaits confirmation. John Hill, who served in the space policy office both under the first Trump administration and the Biden administration, is now performing the duties of assistant secretary for space policy. The memo is a draft, and things can change quickly in the Pentagon. But even if details change before a final memo goes out, the draft provides a preview of who will likely be the drivers on what could be Trump's signature national defense project. When OSD was asked for comment on the memo and when Hegseth may sign it, a defense official said: 'We don’t have anything to announce at this time.' As a first step, by Feb. 28 the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, DoD components, military departments, combatant commands and the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) are to put together three 'scalable reference architectures' for 'small, medium and large options' for the shield using 'kinetic and non-kinetic' weapon systems. Estimated costs are to be provided for each option. Plans for specific elements to be included in each of those options are tasked to interagency working groups. Work on a plan to 'accelerate a Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor Layer' is tasked to Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman, 'in coordination' with the DoD policy shop, Cost Assessment and Program Office (CAPE), and Office of Acquisition &amp; Sustainment, as well as the MDA director. Saltzman also is to submit a plan for the custody layer of the Space Development Agency's Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture. The custody layer is being designed to maintain 'weapons quality tracks for time-critical targets, coupled with low-latency space data transport' to 'enable the creation of a targeting solution from the sensor to the warfighter in operationally relevant timelines,' according to the agency's website. The DoD undersecretary for Research &amp; Engineering is to coordinate with DoD Policy, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the Space Force and the DoD undersecretary for Intelligence and Security to craft a plan for a large constellation of kinetic and non-kinetic space-based interceptors, including for boost-phase intercept shortly after a missile launches. The Research &amp; Engineering office also is develop an 'assessment' of the potential for directed-energy weapons as part of the architecture and funding options for doing so. The MDA director — in coordination with the secretaries of the Army and Navy, the Joint Chiefs chairman, and the commanders of US Northern Command and US Strategic Command — is responsible for planning 'underlayer' and terminal-phases capabilities to 'defeat a countervalue attack.' Under the second phase of Hegseth's draft Iron Dome action plan, with results due in mid-March, tasking orders are laid out for: Lastly, DoD and the State Department are tasked to complete an allied and theater missile defense review by May 15.

Honeywell to divide business into three parts, separating aerospace unit	A Honeywell office in Atlanta, Georgia, US, on Wednesday, Oct. 25, 2023. Honeywell International Inc. released earnings figures on October 26. Photographer: Elijah Nouvelage/Bloomberg via Getty Images WASHINGTON — Honeywell will split itself into three separate companies, the company said today as it announced a plan to break up its automation and aerospace businesses in addition to a previously-announced spin off of its advanced materials unit. 'Unprecedented demand' in both commercial and defense aerospace sectors led to the company’s decision to break off that division as a standalone, public company, Honeywell CEO Vimal Kapur said in a statement. The company plans to complete the separation of its the automation and aerospace businesses in the back half of 2026, pending regulatory approvals. The spin off of its advanced materials business, announced in October, is slated to occur in late 2025 or 2026, the company said. 'The formation of three independent, industry-leading companies builds on the powerful foundation we have created, positioning each to pursue tailored growth strategies, and unlock significant value for shareholders and customers,' Kapur said. 'Our simplification of Honeywell has rapidly advanced over the past year, and we will continue to shape our portfolio to create further shareholder value,' he added. 'We have a rich pipeline of strategic bolt-on acquisition targets, and we plan to continue deploying capital to further enhance each business as we prepare them to become leading, independent public companies.' Honeywell’s defense activities are concentrated inside its aerospace unit, which will be spun off into the standalone Honeywell Aerospace. The business logged $15 billion in revenue in 2024 and produces a laundry list of aviation technologies such as engines, avionics, and cockpit and navigation systems. The separation plan, which was announced following the completion of a portfolio evaluation led by Honeywell’s board of directors, mirrors the recent breakup of industrial heavyweight General Electric. The legacy GE completed the three-way split of its aerospace, energy and health care businesses last April, with the company’s defense engine business now residing inside GE Aerospace. The Honeywell split also occurs amid pressure from an activist investor, Elliott Investment Management, which called for the breakup last year, reported The Wall Street Journal. Elliott Partner Marc Steinberg and Managing Partner Jesse Cohn praised the decision in Honeywell’s statement announcing the move, saying that 'the enhanced focus, alignment, and strategic agility enabled by this separation will allow Honeywell to realize the opportunity for operational improvement and valuation upside.' Defense and space sales in Honeywell’s aerospace unit grew by 14 percent in fourth-quarter 2024 due to 'ongoing global demand and further supply chain improvements,' the company said in earnings today. In 2023, Honeywell made about $4.9 billion in defense-related revenue, or about 14 percent of its overall revenue, according to Defense News 2024 ranking of the top 100 defense companies by revenue.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/honeywell-to-divide-business-into-three-parts-separating-aerospace-unit/	2025-02-06T10:00:51-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/240724_honeywell_building_GettyImages-1745952145-scaled-e1721840284972.jpg
The secret to delivering Trump’s Iron Dome program	Rockets fired by Palestinian militants from Gaza City are intercepted by the Israeli Iron Dome defence missile system in the early hours of October 8, 2023. (Photo by EYAD BABA / AFP) (Photo by EYAD BABA/AFP via Getty Images) There is no leadership principle more universally recognized and validated than this: 'You get what you reward.' Whether training service dogs at New Skete Monastery or deploying an 'Iron Dome' missile defense system in orbit, the key to success is the same: Incentivize the right behaviors and, just as crucially, refuse to reward the wrong ones. Yet, when it comes to urgent national security needs, Washington’s default response follows an all-too-familiar script. Bureaucrats dust off a sole-source, cost-plus contract, hand it to one of the usual defense primes, and rush out a press release touting their 'responsiveness.' The result? Decades-long, bloated 'space programs to nowhere' that consume billions without ever delivering an operational system. These no-bid, cost-reimbursed contracts primarily reward primes with well-connected lobbyists and overhead schemes designed to game the system — not those actually capable of solving the problem. Worse, they incentivize spending over results: As long as the program continues, so does the flow of money. That challenge is no longer hypothetical. Last month, President Donald Trump signed an executive order launching 'Iron Dome for America' — a bold initiative aimed at defending the US against ballistic, hypersonic, and cruise missile threats. On paper, it’s exactly the kind of forward-thinking defense program the nation needs; in practice, whether it delivers on its promise or becomes another expensive boondoggle depends entirely on the execution. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has made it clear that this project is a priority, aligning with the administration’s broader push to modernize US military capabilities. To jumpstart the effort, the DoD has been given just 60 days to produce a comprehensive implementation plan — a breakneck pace for a government program of this scale. But urgency alone isn’t enough. So how do we ensure that the Iron Dome for America doesn’t become another example of wasted billions and unmet promises? The answer lies in rewarding the right behaviors — those that drive results, not bureaucratic inertia that will turn it into a punchline at some future Space Symposium. That means structuring the program to incentivize speed, efficiency, accountability, and common-sense leadership from day one. RELATED: How Trump’s ‘Iron Dome for America’ upends four decades of nuclear doctrine For the engineers and technicians designing these capabilities to raise an Iron Dome, the challenge is immense. But for Washington bureaucrats who need only to structure the contracts properly, it’s not much harder than applying basic common sense. And that part is decidedly not rocket science. For America’s Iron Dome, that means sticking to these non-negotiable principles: Is there an urgent need for an initial capability? Then make schedule your highest priority: Set a firm two-year delivery date if that's what it takes, with additional incentives for early completion. Write performance specifications that encourage the use of proven, state-of-the-art, off-the-shelf systems and subsystems — no reinventing the wheel just to pad development contracts. Want to further minimize schedule risk to the government? Demand proven technology: Select only companies with demonstrated flight heritage — those that have already put their satellites, rockets, and networks in orbit. These companies have either delivered for the government before or risked private capital to prove their capabilities. Unless absolutely necessary, do not fund the development of bespoke, military-unique technology that will become obsolete before it’s even deployed. Want to prevent contractor buy-in without real commitment? Make payment contingent on delivery: If you pay for billable hours, you’ll get a lot of them. But if you want actual missile defense capability, pay only for delivery. Fixed-price contracts should be the rule, not the exception. The defense industry has been running on a law firm model for too long — where revenue is based on the hours billed, not the results produced. Need to ensure long-term sustainability? Forget bureaucratic paper trails — lock in future support: Instead of buying endless reams of costing data and bills of materials that no one will ever read, bake in fixed-price options for maintenance and autonomous operations of on-orbit capabilities. If the government wants these systems to remain viable in the decades ahead, it needs to plan for that now — not scramble to figure it out later. The sheer size and importance of the American Iron Dome effort means it will inevitably end as either a case study in success or one of failure. The difference comes down to common sense leadership — whether decision-makers have the discipline to reward what works and refuse to incentivize what doesn’t. Of course, critics are already asking how we can afford a new program like this. But the real question isn’t how much we spend — it’s how well we spend it. Washington doesn’t necessarily need a top-line budget increase to make this happen. It needs better priorities. Right now, this initiative is at a crossroads. Follow the familiar path of unchecked spending and bureaucratic inertia, and it will become just another cautionary tale. But if it stays fiscally disciplined, technologically adaptive, and relentlessly results-driven, it can set a new standard for national security programs. Anything less, and America’s Iron Dome won’t be a breakthrough. It will be just another over-promised, under-delivered venture — one we can’t afford to repeat.

When the stakes for space missions are at their highest, solid rocket motors meet the challenge	Northrop Grumman’s solid propulsion technology ensures durability, readiness and versatility for a wide range of applications — from supporting NASA’s human spaceflight missions and commercial launch applications to safeguarding U.S. and allied defense systems. (Northrop Grumman photo) From launching deep-space probes to intercepting threats, the need for robust propulsion systems is greater than ever. High-stakes missions like national defense and space exploration demand solid rocket motors (SRMs) that are not only powerful but also reliable and ready at a moment’s notice. Northrop Grumman has met that demand, and over the past six decades has produced more than 1.3 million SRMs that have made a critical difference in powering the world’s most challenging and vital missions. 'The innovation and scale at Northrop Grumman is remarkable, especially if you understand the complexity of these systems and the technology required to build them' said Jim Kalberer, the company’s vice president of propulsion systems. Advancing space exploration and defense Northrop Grumman’s SRMs are designed to meet the toughest demands in space exploration and defense. Launch vehicles rely on these SRMs to provide the power needed to break free from Earth’s gravity and carry essential payloads into orbit. SRMs enable deep-space probes and landers to push the boundaries of space travel. In defense applications, rapid response is crucial. The instant thrust provided by SRMs gives armed forces a tactical advantage, allowing missiles to intercept threats and maintain security. Northrop Grumman’s solid propulsion technology ensures durability, readiness and versatility for a wide range of applications — from supporting NASA’s human spaceflight missions and commercial launch applications to safeguarding U.S. and allied defense systems. Investments in facilities, digital transformation and automation have enabled the company to nearly double SRM production capacity in its Utah operations and triple tactical defense output at sites on the East Coast. (Northrop Grumman photo) Scaling production for future missions To meet the growing demand for advanced propulsion, Northrop Grumman has significantly expanded its manufacturing capabilities. Investments in facilities, digital transformation and automation have enabled the company to nearly double SRM production capacity in its Utah operations and triple tactical defense output at sites on the East Coast. This scaling ensures the ability to deliver propulsion solutions quickly and efficiently, supporting human spaceflight, missile defense and other Department of Defense missions, and commercial space operations. 'Our investment in future capacity reflects the changing needs of our customers, and it will continue to grow,' said Kalberer. Building a future-proof supply chain Strong partnerships with suppliers are key to a resilient supply chain, ensuring stability and reliable production to meet mission-critical requirements. Over the last 10 years, Northrop Grumman has leveraged its supply chain to deliver: more than 900 solid propulsion stages and thrust augmentation boosters across a variety of programs; and over the past six and a half years more than 110,000 tactical SRMs for defense, leveraging digital manufacturing techniques to keep pace with industry advancements. From powering NASA’s Artemis missions to enhancing advanced defense systems designed to protect against emerging threats, Northrop Grumman’s SRMs are pivotal in shaping the future of space and defense.

Applied Intuition takes flight, sets sail in acquiring EpiSci	EpiSci contributed to DARPA's AI dogfighting algorithms, Air Combat Evolution (ACE), aboard the X-62A VISTA (shown here inverted). (Air Force photo by Kyle Brasier) WASHINGTON — Silicon Valley startups buy each other out all the time, but rarely with implications for the Pentagon. That’s not true for the latest news from Mountain View, Calif., home of autonomy developer Applied Intuition, which is acquiring a smaller California drone firm called EpiSci. It’s a marriage of two military contractors on the cutting-edge of unmanned vehicles, meant to combine Applied’s experience in ground systems, like autonomous freight trucks and the Army’s Robotic Combat Vehicle, with EpiSci’s expertise in the sea and air, executives told Breaking Defense. This merger is all about adding capabilities, not cutting costs, Applied co-founders Qasar Younis and Peter Ludwig said in an interview. 'We’re not letting anybody go, we’re not doing any redundancies, we’re not doing any lay-offs, or anything like that,' Younis said. 'We’re keeping EpiSci intact, [because] they do the things we don’t do and we do the things they don’t do.' 'They’re actually famous within their domain,' Ludwig added. That domain gets pretty broad: EpiSci works for DARPA on unmanned air-to-air-combat, for the Navy on unmanned surface vessels and drones, for the Space Development Agency on missile-tracking satellites, and for NASA on bringing 5G connectivity to the moon, among other federal contracts. At Applied, by contrast, 'historically, all our of autonomy work has been really focused on ground, so it’s cars, trucks, it’s construction, mining,' Younis said. 'We’ve done some things in the air but nothing like EpiSci. We’ve always thought, the last few years, it’d be great to get into autonomy in the air or maritime or space, [and] EpiSci actually plays in all those domains.' To understand 'the complementary nature of the companies,' Ludwig went on, it’s crucial to understand that not all robots are created equal. Teaching a computer to navigate a complex, cluttered, but essentially two-dimensional surface — like an Army RCV maneuvering around obstacles off-road — is very different from mastering movement in three dimensions with far fewer obstacles, as through the air, sea or outer space. Roughly speaking, Ludwig told Breaking Defense, about 75 percent of the software modules required to operate autonomous vehicles can be shared across environments. These are general-purpose algorithms that ingest, interpret, and output data (such as sensor feeds) in ways that apply equally to driving, sailing and flying. But, he said, 25 percent of the code absolutely does need to be customized to the challenges of the specific 'domain,' or else you get a very clever robot that can’t actually go anywhere. Applied’s general-purpose modules are 'a very mature solution for that common base layer,' he said, and it’s solid in the off-road domain. But EpiSci brings the 'domain-specific algorithms … that actually work in that three-dimensional space,' Ludwig said. The two companies are different in other ways as well. Applied, though several years younger than EpiSci, has grown faster and bigger (its latest valuation is $6 billion), has sponsored DC-area conferences, made highly public pitches to the Pentagon, and it’s delivered commercial vehicles and software in use by 'thousands of engineers globally,' Younis said. By contrast, he continued, 'EpiSci’s historically been a research organization, and that’s where their real strengths are. The trick for Applied will be to bring their ambition, scale, and ground-system expertise to EpiSci’s deep technical knowledge of its domains, without diluting either partner’s core competencies in the process.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/applied-intuition-takes-flight-sets-sail-in-acquiring-episci/	2025-02-06T02:30:09-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/inverted-x-plane-220826-F-DB956-1974-scaled-e1738792060822.jpeg
One deployment, three ships and a whole lot of challenges	The USS Somerset (LPD-25) last year was tasked with the unusual assignment of deploying ahead of the two other ships in its assigned amphibious ready group (US Navy Photo by Seaman Kelsey Hockenberger/Released) WASHINGTON — When the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) was preparing for a deployment to the western pacific in the back half of 2023, they received news that the commanding officer later described as 'unprecedented.' The Somerset (LPD-25), one of the three key ships slated to deploy, would get underway two months ahead of the rest of the amphibious ready group (ARG). That Somerset would leave earlier than the other two ships — Boxer (LHD-4) and Harpers Ferry (LSD-49) — was unprecedented because an ARG, the complement of Navy vessels that transports Marines and their gear, is designed to work in conjunction with one another. 'The challenge for us was the employment model changed, but our requirements did not,' said Marine Corps Col. Sean Dynan, who was the 15th MEU’s commanding officer during the deployment. 'We were still a crisis response force forward, and we ended up eventually responding to crisis' when called upon. (Dynan relinquished command of the MEU last month.) It was a rocky start to what ended up being an exceedingly challenging deployment for Dynan and Capt. James Robinson, the commodore of the amphibious squadron deploying alongside the MEU. Starting in January and spanning through most of 2024, the 15th MEU and Amphibious Squadron-5 completed nine major exercises; visited 11 foreign countries; responded to a typhoon that hit the Philippines; and completed 80 operations over the course of 10 months. Similar to any large formation of military units, every ship in the ARG has its part to play and capabilities that work in tandem with one another. Asking the Somerset to deploy ahead of the rest of the ARG-MEU was challenging because it fundamentally changed how the Navy and Marine Corps had prepared to employ their forces. 'What that required us to do was to build out self-contained staffs aboard each of the ships that could operate independently for an extended period of time,' Dynan explained. Just days after it initially deployed in April, the Boxer (LHD-4) was forced back to San Diego to fix a variety of maintenance issues. The derailed deployment made headlines due to the ship’s history with maintenance problems. Robinson said that for most exercises and operations, the ARG was able to substitute in other ships or capabilities to compensate for Boxer’s absence. But he did concede there was at least one 'OAI' — an acronym short for 'operations, activities and investments' — that was missed due to the ship’s maintenance problems. The 15th MEU was also the first unit to employ the ACV in real operations. In recent years, the Marine Corps has had a number of mishaps involving their amphibious vehicles, and one of those mishaps occurred during the 15th MEU’s training cycles at Camp Pendleton in California. That mishap, a rollover, killed one Marine and injured more than a dozen others. Dynan’s MEU deployed with 12 ACVs in tow, and, he said, 'it’s almost underwhelming to say that we learned a lot.' There were challenges in understanding how to maintain the vehicles while deployed and concerns about corrosion prevention. The MEU also had to coordinate sending beach survey teams ahead of the ACVs to check that conditions were safe. At one point, even the water temperatures were cause for a concern. Dynan recalled that the waters in the Philippines were particularly hot, and there were questions about whether the vehicle’s cooling systems would cope. 'That was somewhat of a surprise,' he added. The MEU’s training and deployment also coincided with the Pentagon’s three-month-long grounding of the V-22 Osprey fleet, including the Marine Corps’ MV-22 variant. RELATED: ‘Considerable’ effects: How the Osprey groundings hit one Navy wing 'We were the first unit to re-integrate, train and re-certify Ospreys with the [Marine Air Ground Task Force] just before the Boxer got underway again in June because they missed the two pre-deployment exercises,' Dynan said. Due to where the MEU was operating, Dynan said the restrictions the Pentagon left in place after the Osprey fleets returned to flight didn’t affect operations. But the missed training time did mean that his flight crews had to work fast to regain qualifications and proficiency once the grounding was lifted in April. Despite the bumps, the colonel ultimately praised the performance of the thousands of sailors and Marines who took part in the deployment. 'Through resilience and extraordinary efforts by leaders and individual Marines and Sailors and their families, we still executed a very successful non-standard deployment,' Dynan said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/one-deployment-three-ships-and-a-whole-lot-of-challenges/	2025-02-05T14:00:41-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/USS-Somerset-scaled-e1738782682703.jpg
Officials call for unified cyber standards for space systems	Crews at US Space Command's National Space Defense Center provide threat-focused space domain awareness. (US Space Force photo by Kathryn Damon) WASHINGTON — As information sharing between allies and partners becomes increasingly important in the space domain, the US needs to create a uniform set of cybersecurity standards for its space systems, government officials said Tuesday. Right now there are several entities and agencies who have or are working on their own set of cybersecurity standards for space systems. These include the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, OASIS and commercial providers. Additionally, a Biden-era executive order mandated practices that would protect commercial satellite systems against cyber attacks. But if all of these standards are siloed, it will be more difficult to share them with international allies and they won’t be useful in protecting space systems against adversarial threats, Lauryn Williams, former chief of staff in the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Industrial Base Policy, said during a Washington Business Space Roundtable discussion Tuesday. Williams said that a meeting with Japanese officials during her stint in the Office of the National Cyber Director prior to her most recent post was her catalyst for wanting to develop a clear set of cyber standards for space systems. 'The Japanese government turned to me as the kind of cyber person sitting at the table, and they said, very straightforwardly, &#8216;What is your cybersecurity policy? What is your cybersecurity standard?' We could not answer that question. I cannot answer that question,' she said. 'We need to be able to answer that question, so that we can lead because that was the indication that I got, was that the Japanese were looking to us to be able to say, ‘Here it is.’ So that they and many of our other international partners could take and build on it,' she added. 'I hope that we've got a piece of that answer now, not the entirety of it, but the world really is looking to us on this.' Erin Miller, executive director of the Space Information Sharing and Analysis Center (Space ISAC), echoed Williams’ need for a cohesive set of cyber standards. She noted that ideally one agency would be in charge of setting these standards; for example, the Department of Homeland Security. This, however, could be tricky since the federal government tends to fall behind commercial industry in terms of understanding cyber threats to space systems. 'There's a lot of [standards] that are available that we can look at. We actually formed a task force in Space ISAC to look at all of these different standards and see if we can get a comprehensive view of how to address risks for space systems,' Miller told Breaking Defense on the sidelines of the event. 'But the challenge is that the commercial sector can do that, and organically we can come to a conclusion on how we're all going to manage sector risk, but it's still a commercial sector that's driving it. We need a complement from the federal government side to drive overall sector risk.' Both Williams and Miller made clear that such a set of uniformed cybersecurity standards would benefit international cooperation. Miller also used the opportunity to make her argument that space systems should be considered critical infrastructure. With this, she explained that another benefit to having the DHS in particular take on the responsibility of creating space cyber standards would be allowing space systems to be considered critical infrastructure, something the space community has been advocating for for several years. But the federal government maintains these systems do not qualify as critical infrastructure. 'Human lives depend on the security of space systems, and it's not just humans in the US. That's another challenge, is that DHS has primarily been responsible for critical infrastructure that humans in the US rely on, and so risk management is based on US lives, but this is a global conversation,' Miller told Breaking Defense. 'People across the whole world are dependent upon the space systems, and we have a lot of international sales and trade and commerce that's associated with our space systems and the use of them in countries around the world. So it's dynamic.' Though Miller said the DHS could be responsible for making the uniformed set of standards, she acknowledged that there is more than one agency capable of tracking critical infrastructure, so the DHS wouldn’t necessarily have to be the agency responsible for creating the standards. 'Space ISAC has heavily advocated that we have a designation of space systems as a critical infrastructure sector, and that's where DHS’s role is that they have a responsibility for critical infrastructure sectors, and they also share that responsibility with other agencies. So that's why this conversation of which agency is responsible is so challenging,' she said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/officials-call-for-unified-cyber-standards-for-space-systems/	2025-02-05T12:42:06-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/SPACECOM-NSDC-SDA-ops-scaled-e1721331563372.jpeg
Air Force taps Rapid Capabilities Office deputy as acting SDA chief	The Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office is charged with speeding new capabilities to the field, such as the X-37B reusable space plane (Courtesy graphic by Boeing Space) WASHINGTON — The Air Force today announced that William Blauser, deputy head of the department's Rapid Capabilities Office (RCO), has been appointed acting director of the Space Development Agency. The move comes in the wake of the Jan. 16 decision by the Air Force to place permanent director Derek Tournear on administrative leave. Blauser is taking over the acting role from Lt. Gen. Philip Garrant, commander of the Space Force's primary acquisition command Space Systems Command. 'Given the importance of space acquisition programs, both the Space Development Agency and Space Systems Command require full-time leadership, and the Department of the Air Force has named Mr. Blauser as SDA’s new acting director,' the Air Force statement explained. Blauser, who came to Air Force RCO last July from Systems Technology and Research LLC in Arlington, Va., has had a long career in Defense Department acquisition, including of space systems at the National Reconnaissance Office. RCO is responsible for rapidly acquiring and fielding critical new weapon systems based on cutting-edge technologies, such as the X37B reusable spaceplane, according to an Air Force fact sheet. SDA directors are appointed by the DoD secretary, but do not require Senate confirmation. Tournear was appointed as the first permanent director in October 2019, when the agency was still under the purview of the Pentagon's Office of the Director of Research and Engineering. On Oct. 1, 2022 as mandated by Congress, the agency was transferred to the Department of the Air Force under the first-ever Senior Acquisition Executive for Space Acquisition and Integration Frank Calvelli. The Air Force continues to refuse comment on the reason Tournear was placed on administrative leave — a decision made by Calvelli and approved by then-Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall. However, as Breaking Defense was first to report, the issue being investigated by the department's Office of the Inspector General is related to Tournear's actions in the run up to an SDA grant award now under protest by Viasat. According to a Jan. 4, 2024 Department of the Air Force guidance document (DAF Instruction 90-301, PDF), such investigations have a deadline of 150 days for completion, pending any 'extraordinary circumstances' or the need for higher-level DoD IG review. An Air force spokesperson today declined to comment on the rules regarding the investigation or the timeline for its likely conclusion. Meanwhile, Viasat's September protest against two SDA prototypes awards worth approximately $424 million for 20 total (10 each) Tranche 2 Transport Layer (T2TL) – Gamma variant prototype space vehicles to York Space Systems and Tyvak Nano-Satellite Systems in the US Court of Federal Claims has yet to be resolved, according to court documents. Under the case, DoD and SDA admitted to a need for 'corrective action' and initially offered to remediate Viasat's complaints by halting work on both rewards pending a review. Updates to that initial offer have been placed under seal, but several industry sources have told Breaking Defense that while Tyvak's work has been halted, York's has not and instead the company is continuing toward preliminary design review of its 10 prototypes. Interestingly, Tyvak's corporate parent Lockheed Martin on Jan. 30 filed a request to be given access to the court documents under seal. Lockheed Martin bought Tyvak's former parent Terran Orbital in October 2024. Lockheed Martin did not respond by press time to a request for comment.

Boosting ties with the Gulf, Turkish Aselsan opens new office in Oman	ASELSAN a defense electronics company display air defense, radar, electronic warfare, electro-optics, avionics, guidance, land and weapon systems, communication, satellite and space, command and control systems during the Farnborough International Airshow 2024 at Farnborough International Exhibition and Conference Centre on July 23, 2024 in Farnborough, England. (Photo by John Keeble/Getty Images) BEIRUT — Turkish electronics giant Aselsan will inaugurate its first office in the Sultanate of Oman, on the Southern border of the Arabian peninsula, 'as part of its global expansion strategy,' the firm said in a statement today. 'This new office is aimed at enhancing the company’s ability to provide better services to its partners in Oman,' the company announcement said, highlighting its endeavor to foster 'its existence in the Middle East and Gulf region with its office in Oman.' Aselsan has already established offices and branches in other Arab states states, including the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Jordan. Hence, this new office aims to boost its presence in the region rather than initiating it. Aselsan develops defense electronics platforms including electronic warfare software, radar systems, electro optics, and communication capabilities. It is also a member of the consortium of Turkish firms developing the Steel Dome air defense system. 'It is a great honor to be here for the opening of ASELSAN's Muscat office in Oman. In recent years, the Turkish defense industry has achieved remarkable global success through the technologies it has developed and its growing exports. This new office is a testament to that success, reflecting our commitment to deepening our ties with the Gulf Region,' Turkish Secretary of Defense Industries Haluk Görgün said in the statement. He expressed his confidence that the office will deepen ties between Turkey and Oman. Aselsan CEO Ahmet Akyol said that the new office will focus on 'marketing, business development, customer satisfaction, and providing comprehensive post-sales support for end users of Aselsan technologies.' The inauguration of the office follows Aselsan's announcement that it set a defense export record of $1 billion in 2024. During 2024,Turkish defense exports surged to $7.15 Billion. Speaking about the broader reproachment of Turkey and the Gulf states, Serhat Süha Çubukçuoğlu, an expert at Trends Research &amp; Advisory in Abu Dhabi, told Breaking Defense that 'there is a clear synergy between Turkey’s know-how and the Gulf’s tremendous resource endowments.' 'Gulf countries aim to diversify their economies to prepare for the post-oil era and make an impact on emerging fields such as AI and robotics. They want to leap ahead to catch the AI revolution and become high-tech manufacturing hubs in West Asia,' he said. Çubukçuoğlu added that 'Turkey sits as an alternative supplier with less or no strings attached, no political conditionalities in arms exports — unlike the EU and the US, which puts it at an advantage. Its suits the Gulf countries’ goal is to boost their defense economies and be able to act in a more autonomous fashion, to reduce their reliance on Western security guarantees.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/boosting-ties-with-the-gulf-turkish-aselsan-opens-new-office-in-oman/	2025-02-05T10:13:28-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/GettyImages-2164323220-scaled-e1723138468790.jpg
Saab doubles up on Giraffe 1X radar capacity with grand opening of UK production base	Saab's Giraffe 1X Compact Radar Module has been designed for fast paced, short range air surveillance missions (Saab) FAREHAM, UK — Swedish manufacturer Saab celebrated the addition of a second Giraffe 1X short range air surveillance radar production line after formally opening a state-of the art manufacturing facility in Fareham, Southeast England. The new site, which will also support in-service UK military radars supplied by Saab and play host to the company’s Seaeye underwater robotics family of vehicles, was opened on Tuesday by Jonathan Reynolds, UK business secretary. The manufacturer has taken the unconventional step of pre-empting Giraffe 1X demand by starting production of the 3D Active Electronically Scanned Array (EASA) radar on the new line without securing additional UK or export orders. In 2023, London ordered 11 of the systems under two contracts valued at 264 SEK ($25.6 million). That batch has been produced out of Gothenburg, Sweden. When exactly a new British order will arrive is unclear. Reynolds told reporters that due to the ongoing Strategic Defense Review (SDR), it is 'not an easy question' for UK Defence Secretary John Healey to respond to, given 'pressures' his department faces over equipment planning. (Breaking Defense accepted travel and accommodations from Saab for this trip.) 'I do think there are tremendous export opportunities for the UK defense sector,' added Reynolds. The UK MoD plans on publishing the SDR in the spring amid pressure from NATO and local lawmakers to urgently address air defense vulnerabilities and capability gaps in the face of Russia’s war against Ukraine. 'We are actually manufacturing [Giraffe 1X at the Fareham production line] on speculation, rather than … contract by contract,' to support market needs, said Saab CEO Michael Johansson. He explained that there is 'huge demand' for the sensor, which has already been deployed in Ukraine, noting the second production line was needed to increase capacity and deliver a 'regionalized supply chain.' Designed to be used as either a mobile or fixed asset, the Giraffe 1X radar can track fixed wing aircraft, helicopters, drones, rockets and mortar rounds, out to a range of 120 km. A British Army representative told media that the sensor can detect up to 800 targets. It can serve as the primary sensor within a Very Short Range Radar (VSHORAD) system, or as a standalone Counter-UAS (C-UAS) solution, according to Saab. Company literature also outlines that the combination of the radar’s weight, below 150kg, and its 'very low power consumption' means that it can be equipped on 'any type of mobile platform or fixed structure.' The sensor can also be integrated on a pick up sized truck as a Compact Radar Module (CRM), first unveiled by the manufacturer last year at the Eurosatory trade show. Enabling faster deployment times, the solution offers a range of 75 km but will increase over time through software based machine learning applications, said Andy Taylor, head of UK business development and sales in the surveillance division at Saab. At a wider level, the UK already has a base of Saab radars including next generation Taipan artillery locating systems, delivered last year, and land-based Giraffe Agile Multi Beam (AMB) radars, in service since 2010.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/saab-doubles-up-on-giraffe-1x-radar-capacity-with-grand-opening-of-uk-production-base/	2025-02-05T07:54:27-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/Saab-Fareham2.png
Navy’s 4th Fleet to start operation focused on unmanned systems countering illicit trafficking	Saildrone will deploy 20 of its Voyager USVs in support of 4th Fleet's Operation Southern Spear. (Photo courtesy of Saildrone.) WASHINGTON — The US Navy’s 4th Fleet will begin a new operation, dubbed Southern Spear, in the coming weeks focused on using robotic and autonomous systems to aid in the detection of illicit trafficking, the service recently announced. 'Southern Spear will operationalize a heterogeneous mix of robotic and autonomous systems (RAS) to support the detection and monitoring of illicit trafficking while learning lessons for other theaters,' Cmdr. Foster Edwards, 4th Fleet’s hybrid fleet director, said in a statement last week. 'Southern Spear will continue our (4th Fleet’s) move away from short-duration experimentation into long-duration operations that will help develop critical techniques and procedures in integrating RAS into the maritime environment.' The operation will take place in the Southern Command area of responsibility, which spans the coasts of Central and South America. While Southern Spear's goals do align with the new administration's priorities for tighter security at the United States's southern border, the timing is likely a coincidence because the Navy usually spends months planning these kinds of operations in advance. The operation is an evolution of the Navy’s previous operation dubbed Windward Stack. Windward Stack was one of the initial operations that began under Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro and Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Michael Gilday in 2023 during their efforts to scale unmanned technologies from experimental task forces to useful operations. One of the companies involved in Windward Stack was Saildrone, which deployed 10 of its unmanned surface vessels in support of 4th Fleet following the service brass's announcement. Saildrone said on Monday it would deploy 20 USVs 'equipped with a newly upgraded sensor suite' as part of Southern Spear. 'You can do all the exercises you want with kind of staged targets, but when you're deployed in the field, trying to track adversaries who are trying really hard not to be found, like narcotics smugglers, people smugglers, that's a much, much harder task,' Saildrone CEO Richard Jenkins told Breaking Defense in an interview. 'Operating the real world with real weather, real conditions and real adversaries, is where we really start to learn the lessons very quickly.' RELATED: Saildrone CEO says Iranian interference was valuable experience, not a surprise Jenkins said those lessons are focused on how to upkeep a fleet of USVs so that they can maintain a persistent presence for the Navy, as well as efficiently sifting through the terabytes of data the USVs pick up and delivering only relevant information back to the service. 'The Navy literally doesn’t have the eyeballs to absorb all the data we collect, so we have to down sample that for the highest priority information,' said Jenkins. 'So, the real lessons begin when you have 10s of vehicles out there permanently to really understand how to get the operational cadence and uptime to where it needs to be.' Rather than trying to sell the Navy unmanned systems or autonomy software, Saildrone uses what is called a 'contractor owned, contractor operated' model of business. This means the company is responsible for operating, deploying and maintaining its USV fleet. Its customers, in this case the US Navy, are paying only for the data those drones collect. A company spokesperson told Breaking Defense the contract with 4th Fleet was facilitated by the Defense Innovation Unit and includes 180 days of operations per USV, but did not provide an associated dollar amount for that work.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/navys-4th-fleet-to-start-operation-focused-on-unmanned-systems-countering-illicit-trafficking/	2025-02-05T06:22:47-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/20250109-St-Thomas-200W-Radar-Voyagers-6741-scaled-e1738750883331.jpg
Army says DUCES to cyber hackers: New RFI looks for tactical edge zero trust solutions	Sgt. Victor Sanchez, a fire direction coordinator assigned to Alpha Battery, 1st Battalion, 258th Artillery Regiment, 27th Infantry Brigade Combat Team of the New York Army National Guard, operates an advanced field artillery tactical data system. (U.S. Army National Guard photo by Sgt. Alexander Rector) WASHINGTON — The Army is on the hunt for zero trust capabilities to ensure its data is secure in tactical network architectures, according to a request for information published Monday. The service’s C5ISR Center is soliciting information from interested businesses to help find zero trust solutions that can 'integrate seamlessly' into the Army’s existing infrastructure while operating in denied, degraded, intermittent or limited (DDIL) environments. The service is calling such capabilities Tactical Data in Use Security (DUCES) solutions. 'This constrained, highly dynamic, and adversarial-susceptible tactical environment will be a challenge to implement ZT solutions that meet mission needs,' the RFI reads. The Army is turning to zero trust to protect its data as it has found that 'traditional' security models aren’t making the cut anymore given the ever increasing complexity of cyber threats, according to the RFI. The solicitation is specifically looking for solutions that offer advanced capabilities in encryption and anomaly detection in addition to 'secure communication protocols' that protect against current and future threats. The concept of zero trust has gained considerable momentum in recent years as data leaks and the proliferation of adversarial attacks on critical infrastructure have surmounted. At its core, zero trust follows the philosophy 'never trust, always verify' and assumes that the network is always compromised. This means that instead of allowing users to have free reign over a network, there are constant checks to make sure that users are allowed to access what they are trying to access. This verification happens through identity, credential, and access management, or ICAM. Related: Army picks Akamai for prototype battlefield zero trust project: T-ICAM Monday’s RFI is not the first time the Army has searched for zero trust solutions at the tactical edge. Last spring the service chose cloud and edge-computing company Akamai to develop prototype Tactical ICAM capabilities for its combat units. However, the service didn’t go through the typical procurement process or fire out an RFI for Akamai’s prototypes. Instead it used the streamlined Software Acquisition Pathway and a flexible Other Transaction Authority contract to get Akamai’s products in the hands of the warfighters much quicker. But this time around, the Army seems to be acquiring zero trust solutions the old-fashioned way. Responses are due before noon on March 5.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/army-says-duces-to-cyber-hackers-new-rfi-looks-for-tactical-edge-zero-trust-solutions/	2025-02-04T13:06:37-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/10/3472038-1-scaled-e1696963690988.jpg
Eyeing a new autonomous launcher prototyping initiative, Army checking out industry options	The US Army Combat Capabilities Development Command Aviation &amp; Missile Center and Ground Vehicle Systems Center's combined Autonomous Multi-domain Launcher team conducted a live fire of a Reduced Range Practice Rocket fired from the AML at Yuma Proving Ground in April 2024. (US Army photo) WASHINGTON — US Army leaders are looking at different autonomous launchers as they eye a possible prototyping competition and grapple with the right mix of crewed and uncrewed systems for the future force, according to a one-star general helping to lead the charge. After a series of studies and projections into surface-to-surface fires threats through 2035, the service believes it is facing 'deficits' in three categories — range, capacity and survivability — if it doesn’t 'rectify our course,' said Long-Range Precision Fires Cross Functional Team leader Brig. Gen. Rory Crooks. 'Achieving local fire superiority starts with surface-to-surface parity,' he explained during a Jan. 29 interview with Breaking Defense. 'Once we achieve that local fire superiority with surface-to-surface [and] surface-to air, then we can set the right conditions to bring in our air component,' Crooks later added. But to achieve that vision and address those perceived deficits, the service has devised a three-pronged approach: ammunition innovation; scaling launched effects plans; and introducing 'mature or existing platforms' and augmenting them with autonomous systems. Work on all three lines of effort are underway, and for that third bucket, it includes penning new requirements for autonomous launchers that could lead to an eventual prototyping competition. That potential move comes as the Army’s Combat Capabilities Development Command (DEVCOM) has spent years developing its own Autonomous Multi-domain Launcher (AML), an uncrewed M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System. But as an internal development effort, the command is not in a position to produce enough AMLs for soldiers to test out and feed the requirements and acquisition decision cycle. 'I don't see DEVCOM as being the way to introduce larger numbers into formations in the near future: That will be how we leverage industry,' Crooks said. 'But it starts with refining that requirement, which we're in the process of [doing].' The next step, he explained, is inking an abbreviated capability development document (A-CDD) that essentially validates the need for a capability and could lead to a competitive rapid prototyping competition. While work on AML will be factored into that requirements process, so will observations from demos with alternative autonomous launchers being pitched by industry and set to be demoed at events like the upcoming Project Convergence Capstone 5 event. 'This is not all about not replacing humans with robots but how do you make existing formations more lethal with autonomous systems,' he said. While service priorities could change with new Army civilian leadership, such a future launcher may mean the service is not constrained by a 13-foot pod and could instead fire a new 'Affordable High-Speed Strike' missile slated for science and technology development in fiscal 2026. (The service previously referred to that weapon as the Precision Strike Missile Increment 5.) 'We're interested to see what we can achieve in terms of range, lethality on a surface fired missile that might be larger than 13 feet,' Crooks said. 'We don't know yet what a crewed system can accomplish in terms of its own tasks that we expect of it today … receive the mission, fire, resupply, all those associated tasks, and how much of that can they do and also control an autonomous system simultaneously,' Crooks said. 'It could be one-to-one. It could be one-to-N. We don't know what that is yet,' he added. While he didn’t dive into the specific unmanned launchers at the event to help answer those questions, the AML is expected to be on hand, potentially alongside two launchers under development by different industry teams. Lockheed Martin has been touting one such new launcher, and Raytheon confirmed it is working another one that will be at the Army event. 'Integration of autonomous vehicles into the military can lead to a future where operations are faster, safer and more adaptable,' Brian Burton, vice president of Precision Fires and Maneuver at Raytheon, wrote in a statement to Breaking Defense. 'Our innovative approach with multiple partners helps bring a next-gen solution that increases operational efficiency, crosses difficult terrain, enhances mission survivability and reduces risk to soldiers.' Crooks’s requirements team has also been closely following US Marine Corps progress on the smaller Remotely Operated Ground Unit for Expeditionary Fires (ROGUE Fires), a program ripe for 'collaboration,' he said. ROGUE Fires integrates the Navy Marine Expeditionary Ship Interdiction System (NMESIS) — a mountable, ground-based anti-ship missile launcher with two Naval Strike Missiles — onto the 2.5-ton class Joint Light Tactical Vehicle chassis instead of the five-ton Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles (FMTV) platform used for the AML. The USMC is also ramping up the weapon’s level of autonomy, announcing last month a new $30 million investment in autonomous navigation in the form of tech firm Forterra’s AutoDrive system. 'We think [AML] could be complimentary in some ways to what the Marine Corps is doing,' Crooks said, noting that some of the autonomous launchers share the same autonomy stack.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/eyeing-a-new-autonomous-launcher-prototyping-initiative-army-checking-out-industry-options/	2025-02-04T12:03:22-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/AML1-e1738692850160.jpg
Turkish defense exports surge to $7.15B, up 29 percent from 2023	Kaplan MT tanks produced for Indonesia are ready for delivery as the first package of the project will be completed this year in Ankara, Turkiye on March 13, 2022. (Photo by Dogukan Keskinkilic/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images) BEIRUT — The Turkish defense sector saw a 29 percent growth in defense exports in 2024, amounting to $7.15 billion, according to President of Turkey's Defence Industry Agency Haluk Görgün. 'These figures reflect not only an economic success but also the vision of independence in the defense industry that Turkey has written on its own,' Gorgun said in post on X. He further stated that Turkey is 'building a strong defense industry for our friends and allies, and a groundbreaking ecosystem in technology exports for our future. We are working tirelessly for a Turkey that not only produces, but also designs, exports, and builds the future.' Turkey's biggest defense exporters include dronemaker Baykar, Turkish Aerospace Industries, ASFAT, armored vehicle producer MKE and ARCA, according to another post on X by Gorgun. Aselsan said in a statement that it signed export contracts with seven new countries worth $1 billion in 2024, 'a record high figure in its history.' Meanwhile, Baykar made $1.8 billion in revenue from exports, amounting to 90 percent of the firm’s total revenue, according to a statement from the company. 'In 2023, the company ranked among Türkiye’s top 10 exporters, achieving $1.8 billion in exports — a milestone it successfully repeated in 2024, further cementing its resounding success,' Baykar said. Turkey has been pushing to boost its defense production to decrease dependence on Western nations and firms that might be subjected to embargoes. 'Turkey saw the need for localization of defense innovation/production for strategic reasons and accelerated a campaign to invest in developing critical high-tech equipment encompassing a whole array of highly sophisticated platforms with homegrown weapon systems,' Serhat Süha Çubukçuoğlu, an expert at Trends Research &amp; Advisory in Abu Dhabi, told Breaking Defense today. The upsurge in defense exports could be due to 'Turkey’s localization of strategic industries including defense and Turkey’s economic instability and relatively small market size that prompts defense firms to aim entry into foreign markets,' he said. 'It helps Turkey to earn much needed foreign-currency denominated revenues to plug budget deficits, service foreign debt, and re-invest in R&amp;D. With a wider portfolio of clients the defense sector receives more demand and becomes financially more sustainable.' Çubukçuoğlu highlighted that while Turkey sources most of the standard, mid-grade equipment locally, 'critical dependencies on key components like jet engines, semiconductors, and naval propulsion technologies persist.'

How Trump’s ‘Iron Dome for America’ upends four decades of nuclear doctrine	Rockets launched towards Israel from the northern Gaza Strip and response from the Israeli missile defense system known as the Iron Dome leave streaks through the sky on May 14, 2021 in Gaza City, Gaza. (Photo by Fatima Shbair/Getty Images) WASHINGTON — For 40 years America's missile defense framework has been based on two parallel concepts: First, that kinetic missile defense systems would be designed to physically stop missiles fired by a rogue nation like North Korea or Iran. And second, that those same systems would not be scaled to the level that the US could credibly defend the homeland against a barrage from Russia and China. It may seem counterintuitive, but the policy case is simple, if somewhat apocalyptic: only the threat of a world-ending nuclear response would keep those powers from launching, and if Moscow and Beijing felt the US could credibly hold them at threat while defending itself, it would cause those competitors to invest even more in nuclear weapons. And with the stroke of a pen, President Donald Trump upended that balance, with the call for a vastly expanded missile defense system he's dubbed 'Iron Dome for America.' Trump's Jan. 27 executive order maintains that the US should 'deter' or 'defend' against 'any foreign aerial attack,' but goes a step further in calling on the Secretary of Defense to submit plans for 'Defense ... against ballistic, hypersonic, advanced cruise missiles, and other next-generation aerial attacks from peer, near-peer, and rogue adversaries[.]' The shift in US policy would be, in the words of a former US official involved in nuclear operations, a 'big change,' one that a bevy of experts interviewed by Breaking Defense say raises questions about the stability of nuclear arms control, the basic feasibility of such a plan and, particularly, how it will change the balance of power in space. Trump’s vision is 'even more bold' than former President Ronald Reagan’s 1983 Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) program, the former official stressed. 'SDI was an R&amp;D program. This is: ‘come back to me in under 120 days with a plan for how you're going to deploy something.’ So, in that sense, it's very ambitious,' the former official said. Already, it has led to swift threats from Moscow. Discussion of a comprehensive missile defense shield for the US, especially one that includes space-based interceptors (SBIs) — long a nightmare scenario for Russian leaders worried about their nuclear deterrent — was enough for Russian Foreign Ministry official Grigory Mashkov to say any such move 'puts an end to the prospects of strategic offensive arms reduction and preservation of strategic stability on the previous terms.' 'It is not ruled out that in the current conditions of confrontation with the West, with its policy of inflicting strategic damage on Russia, we may face the need for moving away from restrictions on nuclear and missile arsenals in favor of their quantitative and qualitative increase,' he wrote in a Russian publication, according to a Jan. 30 report by the state media service TASS. Mashkov’s comments were tantamount to a threat that Moscow, in an effort to counter Trump’s plan, will bust through the caps placed on both US and Russian nuclear arsenals under the 2011 New START treaty. Asked to respond to Mashkov’s suggestion that Moscow may increase its nuclear arsenal, a White House official told Breaking Defense that 'President Trump is focused on ensuring Americans stay safe. Russia’s threats suggest this focus is well founded.' The State Department referred to a statement by Secretary Marco Rubio detailing the priorities and mission of the administration. Citing 'longstanding SOP [standard operating procedure],' a Pentagon spokesperson said 'we don’t discuss hypothetical situations' when asked the same. But with Trump’s executive order, that situation is much less hypothetical than at any point since the 1980s, seven experts told Breaking Defense. And while split on whether the risks of Trump's plan outweigh the benefits with regard to US nuclear security — and in particular whether a space-based capability is a good idea, or even feasible — all agreed on one thing: An American Iron Dome system would mean the global nuclear calculus will change dramatically. The fundamental policy argument with regard to homeland missile defense vice peer nuclear powers reflects long-standing differences within the US nuclear literati: does it improve the US ability to deter nuclear attack, or instead increase the likelihood of atomic armageddon? Ankit Panda, Stanton Senior Fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told Breaking Defense that Moscow’s signature on New START was contingent on there being no fundamental change in Washington’s missile defense policy. 'The most essential principle of nuclear deterrence is the principle of an assured second strike, and Russia and China are going to ensure that as the United States seeks new types of missile defense modes, including space-based interceptors, they will have the means to retaliate and to penetrate,' Panda explained. Further, he said, both Russia and China might not simply move to increase their ICBM arsenals, but also find 'alternative' ways of delivering nuclear weapons, such as Russia’s Poseidon underwater autonomous torpedo. 'This [Iron Dome] doesn't solve the problem of vulnerability,' he argued. 'It simply gives America's adversaries incentives to adapt their own forces to ensure that they're able to assure their ability to retaliate.' Already, some of the longstanding arms control threads have frayed between the US and Russia. (China, while a signatory along with the other major nuclear powers of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty that pledges them to reducing their arsenals over an unspecified time, has never signed up to bilateral arms control with the United States.) While Russia in February 2023 suspended its compliance with the treaty citing US and NATO support for Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin at the time still pledged to uphold New START’s weapons caps, refraining from a formal withdrawal. The treaty sets the following limits, according to the State Department website: Russia moving away from New Start, and its investments in alternative types of nuclear delivery mechanisms, means America is adhering to the old paradigm while ignoring reality, said Rebeccah Heinrichs, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute and member of the bipartisan Strategic Posture Commission. 'The solution cannot be only offensive investments on the part of the US,' she said. 'It has to be defensive investments as well.' Todd Harrison, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), argued: 'I think [the Trump order] is largely irrelevant in terms of arms control implications. Arms control is effectively dead already with China building out its arsenal at a rapid pace under no treaty constraints.' However, Tom Karako, head of the Missile Defense Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, argued that some narratives are missing the larger strategic context. Efforts to preserve nuclear stability are 'old think' based on a paradigm that has disappeared, he said. On the other hand, he cautioned against those who are championing a 'faith-based' idea of an invulnerable shield against all missile threats against the US homeland, saying 'missile defense is hard. … They're not taking the threat seriously enough, is what I would say.' And nothing fits the description of a hard missile defense technology than the most controversial part of Trump’s executive order: space-based interceptors.

(Credit: Los Alamos National Laboratory) Experts said it was no surprise that what caught Mashkov’s attention was the executive order’s call for space-based interceptors (SBIs), a technology that has long been a point of contention in the arms control community. The concept of space-based interceptors for hitting missiles in their boost phase seconds after launch was a central focus of Reagan’s SDI effort — hence its infamous 'Star Wars' nickname — and has been controversial ever since. Scientists then and now are at odds about not only the effects on nuclear stability, but also whether SBIs are affordable, technologically possible, and operationally sound. Further, in more recent years, the debate has broadened to include what impact SBIs might have on the risks of war in space. 'The pursuit of space-based interceptors is a blueprint for instability. History shows that chasing invulnerability only fuels arms races,' Jessica West of Canada’s Project Ploughshares said. 'The hard truth? SBI won’t shield us; it will spark a wave of new threats while offering limited real protection in return.' With regard to space war, the key issue is that Russia and China not only worry that SBIs will negate their nuclear deterrent, but that they also could be used to kill their satellites, opponents assert. Victoria Samson, a long-time missile defense analyst at the Secure World Foundation, said that the new order’s resurrection of SBIs will throw a monkey wrench into ongoing talks at the United Nations aimed at creating norms of responsible behavior in space — talks that the State Department and Pentagon helped lead under the Biden administration. 'These discussions are crucial for the future of space stability,' she told Breaking Defense. Other analysts point out that America’s adversaries are already deploying weapons on orbit. China, for example, has demonstrated a fractional orbital bombardment system, and American officials have accused Russia of plans to equip a satellite with a nuclear weapon. 'Our adversaries have not restrained themselves the way we would have liked over the last 40 years,' Heinrichs said. While emphasizing the US should not violate the principles of the Outer Space Treaty, which bans weapons of mass destruction in space, Heinrichs said that US space assets have to be protected, and not only by defensive measures. 'We have to … make sure that they know that the United States also has a kill capability in space,' Heinrichs stressed. But does it work? After all, Star Wars is famous not just for its nickname, but as a wildly expensive program that ultimately was a failure. Harrison, in a commentary on AEI’s website, said that while the technology wasn’t ready and the costs were way too high during the Reagan era, that is not the case today. Working SBIs can be deployed, and for a price that is not undoable, he maintained. What hasn’t changed, however, is that the laws of physics make the concept of operations for SBIs somewhat dubious, because of the large number of interceptors required even to defeat a small number of incoming enemy missiles, Harrison cautioned. 'The total cost to develop, build, and launch an initial constellation of 1,900 space-based interceptors would likely be on the order of $11 to $27 billion' — with the 'catch' that such a constellation could only take on 'a maximum of two missiles launched in a salvo,' he wrote. That means that if three missiles were launched simultaneously, at least one would get through, a problem that is known as 'absenteeism.' If China and Russia were to launch missiles at the US, one can safely assume it would be more than three. 'Do we really want to be investing in yet another type of weapon system that does not scale well with the threats we face?' Harrison told Breaking Defense. The Glide Phase Interceptor is the first system specifically designed to defeat hypersonic threats. (Raytheon graphic) While there is an argument to be made that a 'thin' layer of SBIs could be deployed specifically to cover Pacific latitudes to address the Chinese regional threat, Karako stressed that SBIs are not the end-all, be-all for missile defense. Missile defense and space warfare concepts have to be integrated into a larger defense strategy that includes protecting against modern technologies like hypersonic delivery systems and cruise missiles, he said. 'It’s about raising the threshold for the other guys to be able to cause damage and to inflict all manner of bad effects short of the perceived nuclear threshold,' he said. Doing so means using not just missile defenses but also weapons for 'missile defeat' — that is, taking out launch systems before any missiles actually take off. 'There's no one panacea. There's no one silver bullet. You have to do all the things,' Karako said. And therein lies the biggest question of all: what things can actually be achieved within the next four years — especially given that Trump’s plan goes way beyond SBIs to include 'an underlayer and terminal-phase intercept' systems, space-based sensors, long-range radars, and ‘non-kinetic’ capabilities to augment the kinetic defeat of ballistic, hypersonic, advanced cruise missiles, and other next-generation aerial attacks.' The former government official said that, given weapon development timelines, the only weapon systems that will be able to actually 'shoot down anything' during Trump’s current term are the ship-launched SM-3 Block 2A, being co-developed by the US and Japan, and US Army’s THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Area Defense), which would form the Trump plan’s missile defense 'underlayer.' 'In the last year of the Trump administration, they had proposed a five-year spending plan for SM-3 and THAAD to integrate them into the GMD program. So this is something that the last Trump administration had in the works when they left,' the official said. Thus, the former official said, the wisest thing for the Defense Department is to put forward a research, development and testing plan to determine what pieces of the Trump executive order can be deployed by when. A key issue, of course, will be funding. And while the Pentagon and the US Space Force are expecting an increased budget, there still will need to be tradeoffs among many competing priorities. The question then becomes what priority the Iron Dome effort will be accorded in those budgetary food fights. 'Right now, we spend about one third of one percent of the defense budget on homeland missile defense, and I'm referring just to the GMD system,' for a total of about '$3 billion' a year, the former official said. 'If you believe that this is an important mission, why don't we raise this to say, one percent, of the DoD budget for homeland defense,' which would raise it to around $8 billion in total. At this level of spending, the Trump administration 'could do just about everything' in the Iron Dome plan, the former official said, but stressed that it is 'a lot of money. … I think they're in for a rude awakening, if you will, with the numbers.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/how-trumps-iron-dome-for-america-upends-four-decades-of-nuclear-doctrine/	2025-02-04T09:59:10-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/220113_israel_iron_dome_GettyImages-1232873450-1-scaled-e1642095709377.jpg

Marine Corps cutting F-35B buy for more F-35Cs: New aviation plan	An F-35B lands aboard Japan's Izumo-class multi-functional destroyer JS Kaga (DDH-184) for the first time on Oct. 20, 2024. (Photo by Cmdr. Darin Russell.) WASHINGTON — The Marine Corps is shifting the balance of F-35 Joint Strike Fighters it intends to buy, opting to purchase dozens more carrier-based variants in lieu of the short-take-off and vertical landing variant, according to the service’s new 2025 aviation plan. Moving forward, the Marines plan to buy a total of 280 F-35Bs rather than their previous objective of 353 aircraft. In turn, the service will purchase 140 F-35Cs rather than the previous objective of 67 F-35Cs. The total procurement objective of 420 F-35s remains the same. 'Per the TACAIR Transition plan, Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 232 (VMFA) and VMFA-323, VMFA-112, and VMFA-134 will now transition as F-35C squadrons. The program of record now includes 280 F-35Bs and 140 F-35Cs to support 12 F-35B squadrons and 8 F-35C squadrons,' according to the document, published Monday and signed out by Lt. Gen. Bradford Gering, the deputy commandant for aviation. The new aviation plan states 183 F-35Bs and 52 F-35Cs have been delivered to the service thus far. The aviation plan acts as a high-level roadmap detailing the Marine Corps’ plans for its various platforms. Central to this new plan is the inclusion of 'Project Eagle,' a multi-phase initiative spanning through 2040 that focuses on projects such as new warfighting concepts as well as the implementation of artificial intelligence. 'What Project Eagle does for us, as we look across three [future years defense programs] is it shows us where the trade space is,' Gering said last year. The US Air Force has for years set its sights on buying 1,763 F-35As, a number that former Secretary Frank Kendall suggested before leaving office should be revisited down the road. The US Navy intends to buy 273 F-35Cs. After publication of this report, F-35 manufacturer Lockheed Martin said in a statement that 'We support the U.S. Marine Corps’ decision to adjust to an F-35 fleet configuration that best allows them to fulfill their critical missions with the world’s most advanced aircraft.' Meanwhile, the F-35 program is still plagued by a series of issues, from lagging readiness to sluggish software development, the Pentagon’s top weapons tester found in a recent report. A leading issue for the tri-variant stealth fighter is its disappointing availability — measured by mission capable rates, meaning a jet could perform one of its assigned missions, or fully mission capable rates, meaning it can execute all of them — a critical issue for officials and a focus of a 'War on Readiness' launched by the program in 2023. Despite concerted effort spanning several years, results have been mixed, according to a chart included in the report. The conventional takeoff and landing F-35A has seen declines in its mission capable and fully mission capable rates in recent years, which are well below targets. The short takeoff and vertical landing F-35B saw its mission capable rate decline and its fully mission capable rate plateau, where both metrics are still below objectives. Only the carrier-launched F-35C has seen measurable improvement, as its mission capable rate remained largely flat and its fully mission capable rate inched up, but both key measurements are also beneath program goals. Another central problem for the program is software development, a key reason why officials previously took the unprecedented step of halting deliveries for a full year amid difficulties with a new upgrade known as Technology Refresh 3 (TR-3). According to the report, in some cases the program 'has shown no improvement in meeting schedule and performance timelines for developing and testing software designed to address deficiencies and add new capabilities.' Jets currently flying with the TR-3 upgrade are restricted to training, and officials are striving to ensure full combat capability can be delivered this year. Still, the program likely will not begin 'dedicated operational testing' of the full TR-3 enhancement until 'mid to late FY26, approximately two years after the configuration began delivery to the field,' the report says. And even after years of production, military customers are still discovering quality escapes with aircraft, which the report notes should have been identified during the acceptance process. But there have been improvements in the manufacturing process as well: According to the report, the program has achieved a 47 percent reduction in scrap, rework, and repair time as well as a 63 percent reduction in quality escapes discovered from the aircraft’s production line between 2016 and 2023. The program has also generally improved upon some reliability metrics in recent years, indicating advances like more sturdy parts that don’t need to be removed as frequently. A spokesperson for Lockheed said in a statement that 'Delivering the highest quality to the warfighter is foundational to our Lockheed Martin culture, and we remain focused on achieving 100% quality each and every day.' Regarding mission capable rates, the spokesperson said the aircraft 'has demonstrated high combat and deployed readiness since data was collected for this report, in some cases more than five years ago.' They added that information in the DOT&amp;E report is 'dated,' and that quality escapes could entail 'minor items such as an incorrect serial number on paperwork.' The spokesperson also pointed to a previously announced internal investment of over $350 million to boost the program. 'These investments will enhance fidelity and capacity across our development, integration, and test labs, ultimately enabling us to shift defect discovery to the left,' they said. In a statement, the head of the F-35 program, Air Force Lt. Gen. Mike Schmidt, said the report 'highlights shortcomings without adequately addressing the corrective actions the JPO has taken to address the challenges. Every observation requires — and has received — a response from the JPO, and we have made tangible progress in remediating the issues in the report.' Readiness is weighed down by what the program calls 'degraders,' which can be factors like supply chain issues. Over the past year, according to Schmidt, the program has eliminated 20 of these degraders, though a 'small number' of remaining degraders 'mask tremendous progress that’s been made.' Additionally, Schmidt noted that deployed and operational aircraft achieve higher mission capable rates than the fleet when measured as a whole, though he acknowledged that 'overall readiness rates remain unacceptable.' Regarding TR-3, Schmidt said, 'We are aggressively implementing comprehensive test plans to ensure this critical upgrade delivers cutting-edge capabilities to the warfighter.' 'While there is always room for improvement, the steps we have taken reinforce our dedication to providing the capabilities our warfighters need,' Schmidt said. 'The F-35 program remains the cornerstone of our nation’s air superiority, and this report underscores both our accomplishments and areas for continued growth.'

(Michael Marrow/Breaking Defense) Elsewhere in the aviation plan, the Marines detailed several planned upgrades and modifications to its MV-22 fleet in the years ahead to better position the fleet to foresee material failures before they disrupt operations. Those changes include the VeCToR upgrade, which deals with a number of obsolescence issues inside the cockpit; a new modernization plan, dubbed ReVAMP, to 'ensure platform relevance' until the end of the aircraft’s service life; and redesigning the flight control computer. With respect to the proprotor gearbox, which has been the focus of numerous mishaps in recent years involving the Osprey, the aviation plan states the Marines will 'install sensors in critical areas of the PRGB and drive train to provide vibration signature data that will allow maintenance to forecast the failure of parts and plan to remove those parts prior to failure.' 'A more refined Triple-Melt steel will be the source material for the internal components of the PRGB which will drastically reduce the likelihood of material defects in critical gears and bearings,' according to the document. 'A redesigned Input Quill Assembly (IQA) will reduce the incidence of the wearout mode observed in previous IQA failures that led to aircraft Hard Clutch Engagement (HCE) occurrences.'

Baltic Sentry mission could provide proving ground for NATO’s underwater drones	Standing NATO Maritime Group One trains with Finnish FNS Hanko during a 2017 passing exercise in the Baltic Sea. (FRAN CPO Christian Valverde) This is the latest in a series of semi-regular columns by Robbin Laird, where he will tackle current defense issues through the lens of more than 45 years of defense expertise in both the US and abroad. The goal of these columns: to look back at how questions and perspectives of the past should inform decisions being made today. NATO has formed a new Baltic Sentry effort to deal with threats to the NATO nations surrounding the Baltic Sea from the Russians. And while the challenge is real, there is significant opportunity for innovation in shaping a new paradigm in maritime operations. Currently, I am in Europe and had a chance to discuss this opportunity with Torben Mikkelsen, former head of the Danish navy and a well-respected innovator in maritime affairs. His key point: 'Baltic Sentry' could serve as a forcing function to get these nations focused on integrating uncrewed systems, notably automated ones, to deliver the basic ISR needed for a mission which encompasses both underwater and above water surveillance. 'These systems could be launched from shore, air dropped or launched from manned vessels. In fact, learning how to work multiple platforms and locational launch points in a mesh consisting of manned and unmanned platforms and systems would be an important part of preparing for any future crisis in the Baltic Sea region. 'NATO needs to start from the ground up with a new approach built on how a combination of manned ship platforms with payloads of uncrewed systems could deliver the desired results in the entire spectrum of conflict, and the Baltic Sea is a very good ‘naval laboratory’ to use for exactly that,' Mikkelsen said. 'It is important to ensure that we can deliver the needed effects both now, when operating without a direct threat, and in a wartime scenario which is congested with hostile unmanned effects in all domains. In the latter situation the interest in operating with manned assets will be very low. 'It is about being able to transform the needed effects between manned and unmanned assets and to be able to use such in the right combination in line with the current threat and that signal you want to send to the opponent,' he added. We also discussed the fact that NATO has a shortage of manned ships and personnel, which will not end any time soon, and that using autonomous systems provided a significant innovation path to get the desired effects one wanted with much less operational personnel. And with maritime autonomous systems, the personnel would not even have to be in the military but could be private contractors as well. With the European states surrounding the Baltic Sea all now part of NATO there was the important opportunity to learn how to operate these new systems together and to share the data generated from them. As Mikkelsen put it: 'If we do this right, then we will be able to share military payloads amongst those nations.' It is a question of both technological and organizational change which is entailed in a new approach to managing Baltic security. The time to learn to do so is now, and not when in the midst of a crisis. (I will be publishing a book later this year addressing the question of the nature of the paradigm shift in maritime operations.) Mikkelsen’s last job was as Denmark’s executive director for Navy programs at Defence Command, where he was laser focused on building a new generation of modular ships which were designed with the engagement of autonomous systems in mind. The Danes, like others, are focused on building capital ships which function as 'motherships' that are tied inherently into unmanned operations. The question then, he asked: 'How much autonomous military payload can the mothership carry? And [can] that mothership platform [also be] remotely controlled in case of full-scale war?' He underscored the similarities between the Black Sea with the Baltic and felt that the experiences of the Ukrainians and Russians there would clearly be deeply imprinted on the Russian mind. The irony could be that the Russians learned faster from the Ukraine war about maritime operations than NATO, and now NATO needs to adjust its own thinking. The Ukrainian example of using remotely piloted USVs to significantly impact maritime operations has led to Ukrainian interest in such a concept as well. If the Russians have learned the value of these new systems taught to them by the Ukrainians, why would NATO drag its feet on learning to use them as part of its combat force? The Baltic Sentry effort is a perfect place to start.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/baltic-sentry-mission-could-provide-proving-ground-for-natos-underwater-drones/	2025-02-04T07:15:42-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/04/finland_navy-scaled-e1680813959198.jpg
North Korea welcomes Trump back with ‘strategic’ cruise missile test: What’s next?	A Yonhap news TV broadcast shows test-firing of a sea-based (underwater) ground-to-ground strategic cruise guided missile in North Korea. (Photo by Kim Jae-Hwan/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) SYDNEY — North Korea's test launch of a 'strategic' underwater-launched cruise missile within a week of President Donald Trump's inauguration brought back into the spotlight a key geopolitical relationship from Trump's first term: How he will approach North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The American president's relationship with Kim was a source of soundbites and drama between 2017 and 2021. It was the origin of 'fury and fire' as a nuclear crisis between the two countries escalated in 2017. It was also the core of Trump's 2019 meeting at the DMZ, when Trump became the first US leader to step foot into North Korean territory. And this last week, Trump said he would reach back out to Kim, saying of the dictator, 'He liked me.' But while that relationship warmed over Trump's term, North Korea has a tendency to want to make sure it's seen on the world stage with proverbial fireworks — or as close to proverbial as one can get when it involves missile launches. Which means the Jan. 25 launch, which was 'succesfu' according to the Korean Central News Agency, could very well have been timed to catch the attention of the newly-sworn-in American leader. Experts seem to agree that Kim is in a much stronger position than he was when Trump was first elected in 2016, a reality that will impact how Washington and Pyongyang interact in the coming years. Meanwhile, they say, the American president is much more likely to press ahead on ending the war in Ukraine, pursuing Chinese tariffs and domestic priorities before pressing ahead with efforts to reshape relations with Kim. Start with the situation in North Korea itself. Kim has repositioned his country over the least year, scrapping all cooperation with the South and declaring his country was on a war footing. 'Kim has already signaled a change in state policy vis a vis South Korea, to turn away from any sort of reunification and instead to prepare the DPRK military for war. So his military build up will continue, including investing in advanced missile capabilities,' Malcolm Davis, an expert on the Indo-Pacific at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) in Canberra said in an email, 'These include a range of delivery systems for tactical and strategic nuclear forces, including hypersonic weapons, submarine-launched ballistic missiles and cruise missiles.' What has long been the unachieved goal of the West — North Korea abandoning nuclear weapons and allowing inspections of its facilities to prove it — is unlikely to happen, both Davis and Leonid Petrov, a North Korea expert at the Australian National University in Canberra, told Breaking Defense. 'From Donald Trump's point of view, he's not going to gain anything by denuclearizing North Korea. North Korea is not posing any plausible threat to US territory,' Petrov said. 'Yes, it can create trouble to South Korea, to Japan, to US bases in the Pacific, but that's probably it. I don't think North Korea is actually a threat, any threat to the US homeland.' The CIA's former deputy division chief for Korea, Bruce Klingner, said last week that there are conflicting signals coming from the Trump administration towards Pyongyang in its early days. 'Everyone has to be prepared for a wide variety of course changes and high speed changes. And we'll just have to wait and see on some of these,' the Heritage Foundation expert said during an event sponsored by the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Michael Allen, a former National Security aide to George W. Bush and managing director of Beacon Global Strategies, noted on the CSIS panel that Trump's comment about talking to Kim was in reaction to a question. 'I don't hear him proactively raising this issue,' he said. Allen added that Trump 'may have made the assessment that a deal is just not possible.' He said he didn't know if talks with North Korea are 'going to be a big thrust of what President Trump wants to be able to do, because I think a lot of people look at this and they say, this is a huge problem.' Part of that problem is how to manage US and allied relations with the isolated leader. 'As for how Trump and US allies &#8216;manage Kim' — I don't think they do. Trump may be tempted to do a summit, but he'll get nothing out of it, and probably come under pressure to make concessions,' Davis said. He noted that South Korea, under disgraced leader Yoon Suk Yeol had discussed the need for nuclear weapons. Now that he appears likely be removed from office and the opposition opposes nuclear weapons and favors engagements with Pyongyang, Davis says the situation grows even more complicated for Trump. But perhaps the biggest change in Kim's posture is not an internal shift, but a new powerful friend: Russian strongman Vladimir Putin. Petrov pointed to the fact that 'things have changed dramatically,' since Trump stepped briefly into Kim's country, thanks to Putin serving as Kim's new 'benefactor &#8230; Putin gives them money and technology and protection.' Of course, it's not been free. Kim has sent at least 11,000 North Korean troops to help Russia in its war against Ukraine. In return, Kim is getting billions of dollars in advanced weapons, food and oil from Russia. 'He already has secured his regime through Russia's commitment to secure it, and North Korea will get enough technology and recognition and sanctions can be diverted through Russian border and the Chinese border,' Petrov said. For his part, Kim followed the missile test up with a Jan. 29 visit to a nuclear weapons facility, which he praised for 'epochal successes' in producing material for nuclear weapons and 'strengthening the nuclear shield of the country,' the state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said. Kim said 2025 will be 'a watershed year' for improving his nuclear forces. So, about that missile&#8230; Perhaps the most important question is whether this cruise missile can carry a nuclear warhead. North Korea has claimed it has a warhead that is small enough to fit onto the weapon, but like so many things about North Korea, no one is really sure. 'The DPRK has shown several purported nuclear weapons. In 2016 and 2017 they showed two designs in relation to ballistic missiles. It is unclear whether these were real, but in any case they were too large to fit inside a cruise missile. However, more recently, in March 2023, they unveiled the much smaller &#8216;Hwasan-31' nuclear warhead. This would fit inside a cruise missile,' Ralph Savelsberg, a missile expert with the Netherlands Defence Academy said, adding that he 'cannot assess whether these are real, though.' The KCNA announcement of the launch, published in English late on Jan. 26, included alleged details of the test, which it says Kim watched. 'Based on the press statement, the missile flew 1,500 km,' Savelsberg said. 'If that is its range, when launched from the DPRK, that would put all of Japan, including Okinawa, in range. If it can indeed be launched from a submarine, depending on the range of the submarine, it could threaten Guam. They claim to have launched a nuclear submarine in September 2023 and that could theoretically even threaten Hawaii or the US West Coast.' In some ways a smaller missile like this poses a more difficult threat to the US, South Korea, Japan and other countries in range because cruise missiles are 'difficult to defend against. They don't fly as fast as a ballistic missile, but they are small and fly at low altitudes, which makes them difficult to detect. Furthermore, they can fly an unpredictable path and thus attack from a direction which you might not anticipate,' Savelsberg said. One of the interesting tidbits in Pyongyang's news story is that 'the test-fire had no negative impact on the security of the neighboring countries.' According to Savelsberg, the North Koreans 'seem to fly them in circles or figure-8 patterns, in order not to overfly any of their neighbors.' That may be a clear indicator of how much North Korea wants to remind the world of its weapons without sparking serious reactions to its actions. Yonhap, South Korea's semi-official news agency, said the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff sent a text message to reporters saying that, 'Detailed specifications are currently being closely analyzed by the intelligence authorities of South Korea and the United States.' No statements or comments have been made by US Indo-Pacific Command since the launch.

Pentagon weapons tester highlights delays for B-52, 3DELRR radars	A US Air Force B-52H Stratofortress and a Royal Australian Air Force F/A-18F Super Hornet fly over the Northern Territory during Exercise Talisman Sabre 23. Credit: Australian MoD WASHINGTON — The Air Force is pushing back its schedule for modernizing the Eisenhower-era B-52 Stratofortress with a new radar by a year amid integration challenges, according to a new report by the US military’s top weapons tester. A two-stage Milestone C decision — the beginning of a program’s production phase that in this case signifies when the first bombers will get new radars — for the B-52 Radar Modernization Program is now planned for fiscal 2026, in the second and fourth quarters, according to the Jan. 31 report [PDF] from the Pentagon’s Director of Operational Test &amp; Evaluation (DOT&amp;E). The dates are somewhat notional, as the report states that '[e]xact dates are uncertain due to technical and schedule risks.' However, last year’s DOT&amp;E report [PDF] found the decision points were previously planned for the same quarters in FY25, pointing to a full-year delay. The two-part milestone C decision calls for modifying a total of 28 aircraft, roughly a third of the B-52 fleet, with the new radar, the DOT&amp;E report says. A full-rate production decision for the remaining 48 aircraft set to be outfitted with the new radar will then follow initial operational test and evaluation (IOT&amp;E), now slated to kick off in FY28. Delays for the radar effort largely stem from 'integration issues,' the DOT&amp;E report says, leading the Air Force to 'refine' the design of the aircraft’s radome, or the housing for the radar. The radar program is part of a larger overall effort to modernize the B-52, which includes fielding new engines for the decades-old Stratofortress. Boeing is the prime contractor for both efforts, and did not immediately respond to a request for comment. RTX, which supplies the updated radar, and the Air Force similarly did not immediately reply. Air Force officials in August warned that costs are rising and schedules slipping for the overall modernization effort of the B-52 a platform that will continue to play an integral role in the service’s bomber force structure and likely continue to fly into the 2060s. Service leaders revealed then that the price tag for the bomber’s new radar in particular was projected to jump from $2.3 billion to $3.3 billion. The report found similar delays for a project to deploy a new radar that can detect and track airborne targets like aircraft and ballistic missiles, known as the Three-Dimensional Expeditionary Long-Range Radar (3DELRR). The radar plugs into a mobile command and control center the Air Force can use in theater. Fielding the 3DELRR system has been a long-running saga for the service, which booted previous contractor RTX from the program and offered a new deal to Lockheed Martin in 2022. Lockheed’s AN/TPY-4(V)1 radar is now planned to replace the legacy TPS-75. But the program is still experiencing schedule hiccups owing to testing and production delays, the report says. Last year’s DOT&amp;E report found that developmental testing was slated to begin in 2Q FY24, but this year’s report now projects it will begin in 2Q FY25. The report found similar delays for IOT&amp;E, previously set to begin in 3Q FY25 but now is set for 1Q FY26. The Air Force and Lockheed Martin did not immediately respond when asked about the schedule slips.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/pentagon-weapons-tester-highlights-delays-for-b-52-3delrr-radars/	2025-02-03T13:19:06-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/08/B-52-and-RAAF-F-18-Talisman-Sabre-2023-scaled-e1691500489687.jpg
Missile Defense Agency asks industry for American ‘Iron Dome’ concepts	Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor (HBTSS). (Northrop Grumman image) WASHINGTON — The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) has issued a call for industry ideas on how it can implement President Donald Trump's Jan. 27 'Iron Dome for America' Executive Order — a surprisingly fast turn around on a Pentagon program. The Request for Information (RF) comes just four days after Trump's order mandated Pentagon development of a comprehensive 'shield' to repel any aerial attack on the US homeland. The RFI asks interested vendors to show and tell relevant capabilities by Feb. 28. The request to industry is structured to be open to a wide range of ideas, as it seeks details on what capabilities can be 'delivered or demonstrated' in two-year 'epochs': not later than Dec. 31, 2026; Dec. 31, 2028; Dec. 31, 2030 and 'beyond' Dec. 31, 2030. MDA is 'conducting market research to assist in the identification of innovative missile defense technologies (system-level, component level, and upgrades) architectures, concepts, and Concept of Operations (CONOPS) to detect and defeat the threat of attack by ballistic, hypersonic, and cruise missiles, and other advanced aerial attacks,' the RFI elaborates. 'MDA desires to collaborate with Industry on potential concepts to deploy and maintain a next-generation missile defense shield that will deter and defend its citizens and critical infrastructure against any foreign aerial attack on the Homeland and guarantee its secure second-strike capability,' it adds. The list of technologies of interest reads as a cut-and-paste of the Trump executive order: Interestingly, the RFI indicates MDA would take charge of deploying the Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor (HBTSS), rather than the Space Development Agency (SDA). The fate of the HBTSS — which uses a medium-field-of-view camera optimized to provide high-fidelity missile tracking capable of providing targeting coordinates to anti-missile interceptors — has been the subject of a years-long tug-of-war between the two agencies. MDA originally developed the sensor to help target its new Glide Phase Interceptor for knocking hypersonic missiles out of the sky. But SDA effectively killed the HBTSS program after the first two test satellites were launched last February, absorbing some of the technology into its own designs for new 'fire-control capable' infrared sensors. Thus, the Trump executive order breathes life back into the HBTSS program, and MDA has re-claimed control of it in the RFI. As things stand today, however, SDA has no plans to integrate the two HBTSS sensors into its Tracking Layer of the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture — which begs the question of once HBTSS is developed how will it be deployed and operated so as to work with SDA's Tracking Layer satellites and ground systems? Another unanswered question is which Defense Department organization will operate the future space-based and directed-energy interceptors to be developed by MDA as part of the Iron Dome plan. The Ground-Based Interceptors that make up the sharp end of the Defense Department's Ground-based Midcourse Defense System are 'administered' by MDA (to include funding for upgrades) but the Army has operational control in support of US Northern Command. Further, both the Air Force and now the Space Force provide support functions to the overarching system. That long-standing arrangement also will apply to the Next-Generation Interceptor replacement program. However, US Space Command is now responsible under the Unified Command Plan for operations in space, with its 'area of responsibility' defined as extending from 100 kilometers above the Earth to, in theory, infinity. The command also serves as the Joint Force Global Sensor Manager, and operates the current Space-Based Infrared System constellation of missile warning satellites. And while the Space Force supplies the bulk of personnel to SPACECOM to conduct operations, the other services also all provide space specialists and capabilities. The defense community may not have to wait for answers. Under the executive order, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has until March 28 to submit 'a reference architecture, capabilities-based requirements, and an implementation plan for the next-generation missile defense shield' — a task that is being spearheaded by John Hill in his role performing the duties of the assistant secretary of defense for space policy.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/missile-defense-agency-asks-industry-for-american-iron-dome-concepts/	2025-02-03T11:44:06-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/Hypersonic-and-Ballistic-Tracking-Space-Sensor-Northrop-Grumman-image-.jpeg
Saudi Arabia increases defense spending to $78B in 2025	The GAMI stand seen at World Defense Show 2024. (Agnes Helou/Breaking Defense) BEIRUT — The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has allocated $78 billion for defense spending in 2025, up from $75.8 billion spent in 2024, Governor of the General Authority for Military Industries (GAMI) Ahmad Al-Ohali said in a statement Saturday. 'The Kingdom allocated approximately $78 billion to the military sector in the 2025 budget, which constitutes 21% of total government spending and 7.1% of Saudi Arabia’s gross product,' he said, according to the statement. The statement further noted that the Kingdom has witnessed a 4.5 percent annual defense growth since 1960, adding that it has become the fifth largest defense spender worldwide and the largest in the Arab world. Saudi Arabia, historically one of the largest defense importers worldwide, is concentrating heavily on the Kingdom’s Vision 2030, which was launched in 2016. It aims to decrease the Kingdom’s dependence of the oil sector and boost other sectors based on national production. Vision 2030 has a set goal of localizing 50 percent of all defense spending by 2030, and has been pushing defense firms to open regional headquarters in the Kingdom. 'I am really confident that by 2030 we will reach 50 percent [localization], [even] more than 50 percent,'Al-Ohali told Breaking Defense in February 2024. The localization rate of military industries reached 19.35 percent at the end of 2023, according to the statement. 'The Authority's vision is to develop a sustainable military industries sector that enhances the readiness of military equipment and contributes significantly to the national economy,' Al-Ohali said on Saturday, according to a translated post on X. GAMI, which is the contracting authority for the Saudi MOD, launched in October 2023 'Invest in Saudi Arabia' section on its official website with the goal of pointing international firms to areas of opportunity to invest in the Kingdom. During his speech on Saturday, Al-Ohali highlighted that there are 74 opportunities within Saudi supply chains for military industries, 'identifying 30 opportunities as a priority, representing about 80% of the total future expenditures on supply chains,' per the post on X.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/saudi-arabia-increases-defense-spending-to-78b-in-2025/	2025-02-03T11:27:56-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/02/426321683_2247560928782093_3567854556366620292_n-e1707316197608.jpg
Rep. Bacon: Enough talking about defense innovation. It’s time to make choices and move out.	Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., makes his way a House Republican Conference meeting in the U.S. Capitol on Thursday, October 19, 2023. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) As we begin the 119th Congress and a new presidential administration, a narrow window of opportunity exists to accelerate Department of Defense technology development and deliver a decisive advantage to the United States as it confronts mounting security challenges in the twenty-first century. As chairman of the House Armed Services Committee Subcommittee on Cyber, IT, and Innovation, I believe we must take this opportunity to act with urgency to prepare our military to win the future. But first: We in Congress, the executive branch, and industry must stop hiding behind the word 'innovation.' We must move beyond innovation theater and recycled talking points about technology transition. We need real warfighting capabilities, clear-cut ways and means to achieve them, and streamlined resourcing to make it happen on a timeline relevant to the speed of battle and pace of technological change. The time to admire the problem has passed. Now is the time to procure and produce. As I learned in my 30-year military career, success in any complex task depends on starting with a well-defined desired end state. It may sound simple, but without explicit objectives, we cannot achieve useful results. I implore the new DoD leadership to state quickly and plainly the biggest operational challenges the armed forces must solve. Flowing from these objectives, the department must clearly define the priority capabilities and supporting technologies our warfighters require to deter and — if necessary — defeat adversaries like China, Russia, and Iran. To deliver results, Congress must have a clear, unambiguous, and prioritized demand signal in areas like biotechnology, quantum, directed energy, nuclear command and control, missile defense, and more. Armed with these prioritized operational needs, capabilities and technologies, Congress will be able to work collaboratively to authorize and resource the actions necessary to deliver. If ongoing research and development is duplicative, or if it does not aim to solve an operational challenge posed by great power competition, DoD must reassess whether these taxpayer research dollars can be better spent. Ruthless prioritization and focus must be the order of the day. Once our direction of travel is set, DoD must effectively partner with industry and academia to develop and field critical technologies at increased speed and reduced cost to the US taxpayer. If industry is already committing private capital towards critical technologies, the department must focus resources elsewhere and avoid duplication of effort to maximize the power of government and commercial research investments working in tandem. There is absolutely a role for bespoke DoD research and development, particularly for specialized military problems for which there is no commercial market. This is where the military service research labs and national laboratories excel. But, unlike the recent past where DoD was the leading investor in science and technology, the paradigm has shifted. US commercial investment now vastly exceeds the US government in dollars spent on research and development. DoD must harness this and leverage it as the strategic national asset that it is. And Congress can help ensure taxpayer dollars are being invested in essential military R&amp;D, while leveraging the billions of dollars invested by industry for internal R&amp;D that can also help solve military problems. Time and time again, DoD and Congress reinvent the wheel with strategies and roadmaps for critical technology areas, and what do we really have to show for it? America can no longer afford the time and expense of producing pages and pages of strategies, pilot programs, and technology demonstration and experimentation efforts, with no meaningful follow-on production contracts or capabilities delivered to warfighters at scale. This cycle must end. In this moment we need clearly defined operational problems to solve, explicit capabilities developed to meet those challenges, clear-cut funding and contracting mechanisms, and a culture that is willing to move fast, take risks, and deliver solutions. Fortune favors the bold and it’s time to get to work. Don Bacon is a US representative for the 2nd District of Nebraska and Chairman of the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Cyber, Information Technologies and Innovation. He retired as a brigadier general in the United States Air Force after serving nearly 30 years on active duty.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/rep-bacon-enough-talking-about-defense-innovation-its-time-to-make-choices-and-move-out/	2025-02-03T07:18:40-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/don-bacon-scaled-e1738329234382.jpg
Eyal Zamir, well known to industry, named Israeli Defense Forces Chief of Staff	The Director General of the Israel Ministry of Defense, Maj. Gen. (Res.) Eyal Zamir (Center), in mid-January signing the first contract under the U.S. aid package given during the recent war. (Israel Ministry of Defense.) JERUSALEM — Israel’s Minister of Defense Israel Katz has tapped Maj. Gen. (Res.) Eyal Zamir to be the new Israel Defense Forces Chief of Staff, the government here announced Feb. 1. Zamir will take up his post after serving for two years as Director General at Israel’s Ministry of Defense, a role in which he interfaced regularly with the Israeli defense industry. He will replace Herzi Halevi as Israel’s top officer. Halevi, who assumed his role in January 2023, announced on Jan. 21 that he stepping down; as the commanding general during the Oct. 7, 2023 attacks by Hamas, Halevi had come under increasing pressure over the military’s failures to protect Israel from the attack. 'I congratulate Major General (Res.) Eyal Zamir on his appointment as the 24th Chief of the General Staff of the Israel Defense Forces. I have known Eyal for many years, and I am confident that he will lead the IDF forward in the face of the challenges ahead,' Halevi said in a statement. 'In the coming weeks, we will complete a professional and high-quality transfer of command over the IDF.' It was not clear from the statement if Halevi’s desire to leave in March may be moved up now that a successor has been appointed. Zamir was born in 1966 and joined the IDF in 1984, serving in the Armored Corps during the First and Second Intifadas. We was eventually named the commander of the 36th Division, which includes the IDF’s 7th Armored and 188th Armored as well as Golani Infantry, making it one of the most powerful, and tank heavy, of the IDF’s regular divisions. In the last decade and a half Zamir served as Military Secretary to the Prime Minister, and later as head of IDF Southern Command. During his time at Southern Command, he faced off against increasing threats from Gaza in 2018 when there were increased protests along the Gaza border fence. Given those high profile roles, he was seen as a candidate for Chief of Staff twice before: he lost out to Aviv Kochavi in 2018 and then Halevi in 2023. As a consolation prize, he was appointed Deputy Chief of Staff under Kochavi and then moved to the Defense Ministry in 2023. In that role, he played a key role in the IDF’s formulation of the Momentum multi-year plan. This plan was supposed to streamline the IDF’s ability to confront Hamas and Hezbollah in case of a ground war, making the IDF more effective and lethal in multiple domains using the latest technology — though the nature of the conflict since Oct. 7 has raised questions about whether that approach was the correct one. Zamir’s background in the armored corps is unique for a chief of staff. Halevi, Kochavi, Benny Gantz, Moshe Yaalon and Shaul Mofaz were paratroopers, while Gadi Eizenkot and Gabi Ashkenazi came from Golani infantry backgrounds. Industry may find someone who is very open to their new ideas. Zamir played a key role in many of the defense industry deals since the beginning of the war, such as procuring more munitions and interceptors for Israel’s air defenses, and investing in 'Blue and White' Israeli local industries to produce material. One of the most recent deals Zamir played a role in was the first contract signed under the new US aid package, which includes, which a dedicated $5.2 billion allocation to strengthen Israel’s air and missile defense systems. The CEO of Israel Aerospace Industries, Boaz Levy, put out a statement in the wake of Zamir’s appointment, saying 'We would like to thank Maj. Gen. (Res.) Zamir for the fruitful cooperation during his tenure as Director General of the Ministry of Defense, which helped lay additional foundations for ensuring the security of the State of Israel.' Zamir is believed to have beaten out two other top officers for the role, both of whom quickly issued statements of support. IDF Deputy Chief of the General Staff, Maj. Gen. Amir Baram, said 'I have no doubt that he will excel in this role, demonstrating the necessary combat leadership and strategic vision given the current challenges. I will assist my commanders in the preparation and transition process as needed, and I wish Eyal a smooth and successful entry into this important position.' Maj. Gen. Tamir Yadai, the IDF’s head of the ground forces, also congratulated Zamir. 'From my many years of acquaintance with Eyal, I can attest that he is an experienced and excellent officer, and I am confident that he will lead the IDF successfully through the many challenges of this time,' Yadai said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/eyal-zamir-well-known-to-industry-named-israeli-defense-forces-chief-of-staff/	2025-02-03T00:22:19-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/Zamir_center.png
With Foreign Military Financing paused, Lebanese forces wait on promised funds	The Lebanese Army is deployed on the ground as search operations continue at the site of the israeli strike in Basta, Central Beirut. According to the rescue teams on the ground, this bombing killed at least 15 people and around 35 are still missing. November 23 2024. (Photo by Nael Chahine / Middle East Images / Middle East Images via AFP) (Photo by NAEL CHAHINE/Middle East Images/AFP via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — As the Lebanese Armed Forces try to keep up their end of the ceasefire deal, a large pot of funds meant to enhance their equipment is tied up in Washington. At the end of the Biden administration, there were public reports the State Department planned to shift $95 million in Foreign Military Funding (FMF) from Egypt to Lebanon. The office of Rep. Mario Díaz-Balart, R-Fla., who chairs the House appropriations subcommittee in charge of foreign aid, confirmed to Breaking Defense that the Biden team successfully shifted that money. But the funds are now held up as part of a broader State Department freeze on foreign aid ordered by Trump administration Secretary of State Marco Rubio. FMF is money the US government gives to other nations in order to build up their national security capabilities. FMF is required to be spent only on US-made goods, meaning the money from Washington flows out to foreign capitals and then back into the US defense industry. While FMF totals for many countries are relatively small, 'a little can go a long way,' according to Tressa Guenov of the Atlantic Council. 'It is one tool as a bulwark against influence from adversaries and competitors who may be looking to also sell their wares to key partners that may be under pressure from lots of different power sources from around the world,' Guenov, who served principal deputy assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs from 2022 to 2024, told Breaking Defense. At a tactical level, she also noted that getting countries onto American kit helps with interoperability, especially with counter-terrorism and border security issues many of these countries are facing. In the case of Lebanon, the Biden team wanted to show support for the new government formed just weeks ago, and to provide military aid to the Lebanese Armed Forces as they try to secure territory formerly held by Hezbollah and, later, by invading Israeli forces. Transferring that money from Egypt’s standing FMF pot to Lebanon was seen as the easiest way to get that aid underway. 'Additional FMF will further enable the LAF to secure the South Litani area, implement UNSCR 1701, and signal strong U.S. commitment to advancing the U.S.-brokered agreement to partners who may be considering increasing assistance to the LAF,' a State Department official told Breaking Defense in early January, speaking on background before the Biden administration left office. 'Supporting the LAF to exert sovereignty across all of Lebanon will constrain the malign activities of Hizballah and their Iranian backers both in Lebanon and their destabilizing activities across the globe.' However, one of Rubio's first moves after arriving in Foggy Bottom was 'initiating a review of all foreign assistance programs to ensure they are efficient and consistent with U.S. foreign policy under the America First agenda,' according to department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce. While the scale of the global assistance pause is different from previous administrations, it’s not unheard of for a new administration to pause and review foreign security assistance programs when coming into office. The first Trump administration did so under then-secretary Rex Tillerson, and when the Biden administration came into office, it froze sales to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates as part of a review. It's also unclear exactly how much FMF is actually available to be frozen. According to Diaz-Balart’s office, the total FMF appropriated for FY24 was $6.1 billion. But with the confusion about the budget — the government is operating under a continuing resolution, essentially stretching FY24 out six months — it is possible that a significant portion of that $6.1 billion has already been spent. And because FMF is essentially a loan, it’s possible that countries that received FMF dollars already aren’t able to spend them under the freeze. Asked for clarification on the status of FMF deals, a state department spokesperson said, 'We are reviewing all foreign assistance funds to ensure they are aligned with American interests. During this review period, all foreign assistance funding mechanisms with the exception of programs with waivers, are paused. National security is and will remain a top priority.' Ironically, that $95 million for Lebanon actually would still be flowing if it was tagged for Egypt. That’s because Rubio carved out an exception for 'foreign military financing for Israel and Egypt and administrative expenses, including salaries, necessary to administer foreign military financing,' according to the BBC. Guenov noted that a 'loss of such support can really be a sore spot in relationships,' and raises the risk that if a freeze lasts a long time or FMF broadly is cut, other countries, such as China or Russia, could move to fill the void. 'There are other competitors who offer, sometimes, cheaper, more quickly available equipment, which come in with deals for countries that provide an alternative to the US,' she said. 'And certainly that’s something we want to avoid.' As to FY25, the Biden administration requested $9.04 billion in security assistance funds through State, with roughly $6.08 billion of FMF included; should Congress finally pass an FY25 budget those totals will likely change, even if the freeze is lifted by then. Meanwhile, Foreign Military Sales cases, where the US government acts as a seller of US-made weapons to a foreign partner, are moving forward. The first FMS case approved under the Trump administration was announced Friday, a deal with Japan for Standard Missile 6 weapons, with an estimated price tag of $900 million.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/with-foreign-military-financing-paused-lebanese-forces-wait-on-promised-funds/	2025-01-31T12:45:04-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/250108_LAF_beirut_GettyImages-2185633357-e1736362566933.jpg

A tiltrotor aircraft, FLRAA will have the hybrid capabilities of planes and helicopters. (Photo by Spc. Charles Clark, 25th Infantry Div.) Risk is a program killer, most recently leading to the demise of the Army’s Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft that planned for a new platform in addition to a greenfield engine. In contrast, its program-mate under the Future Vertical Lift (FVL) program – the Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) – is taking an iterative path that places a reliance on mature and high-TRL systems already flying on the the Apache, Black Hawk, and Chinook, including an upgraded but established powerplant, to augment development of new, advanced capabilities such as launched effects. There’s something else noteworthy about the FLRAA program – it will introduce a tiltrotor to the Army’s aviation fleet for the first time. That in of itself will open new paths to risk throughout the defense industrial base as suppliers design, build, and support systems for FVL, while also creating new opportunities for technology insertion into an aging fleet. 'The last developmental rotorcraft [in the Army was] about 40 or so years ago,' said FLRAA Project Manager Col. Jeffrey Poquette. 'So, yes, there are challenges and at the forefront are the industrial base and supply chain risk. This was highlighted during COVID, how fragile the supply chains are – everything from cars to electronics. On the defense side, we’ve seen it with ammunition and now with aircraft, which is a very complex weapon system with a lot of components. 'I wouldn’t say that there are unique challenges particular to a tiltrotor. A tiltrotor is a kind of rotorcraft, a helicopter is a kind of rotorcraft, and both of them have complex supply chains that we have to manage carefully. Ensuring a resilient supply chain has been at the forefront of this program for many years now. We’ve stood up a supply chain risk management team that looks at everything from the raw materials to finished products and subcomponents [at] the lowest level in the supply chain.' In addition, a relatively recent DoD-wide acquisition capability called 'consent to subcontract' gives project managers and contractor officers greater control over subcontracts that their prime contractors award to their lower-tier subs. In the case of FLRAA, Bell is the prime. The FLRAA tiltrotor is now in the Engineering and Manufacturing Development phase where the critical design of the aircraft will be finalized, leading to development of aircraft prototypes for testing. (Bell photo) 'When Bell wants to subcontract with a supplier, they have to prove out a number of things, and one is supply chain resilience and risk level,' said Poquette, noting areas of particular concern that include whether suppliers rely on raw materials that can only be sourced from outside the U.S., and if they’ve developed multiple sources of supply within their own lower-tier suppliers. 'My team then assesses it and before I sign off on that consent, we take a look at supply chain risk management.' FLRAA’s Milestone B decision attained in mid-2024 was, in part, due to the program’s risk posture at that point. The tiltrotor is now in the Engineering and Manufacturing Development phase where the critical design of the aircraft will be finalized, leading to development of aircraft prototypes for testing, ultimately informing a Milestone C decision in 2028 about production of fieldable aircraft. 'Supply chain risk management is key to a healthy production line,' said Ryan Ehinger, senior vice president and program director, FLRAA Future Long Range Assault Aircraft/V-280 Valor at Bell. 'Aviation component lead times are long and requalification/switching costs for making changes mid-production are high. The government and industry collectively have done a tremendous amount of work over the last decade to reduce risk and inform the requirements, and the current EMD phase is all about further maturation of the digital models, finalizing engineering hardware and software designs, maturing the sustainment artifacts, and driving toward a successful weapon system critical design review as the next major program milestone. 'Bell takes pride in the internal vertical integration of many key components and final assembly, but it is a team of industry leaders spanning many layers of the supply chain that complete the weapon system. All parts are important, and each supplier should feel the weight of program success on their shoulders and an accountability to the warfighters who need this affordable and sustainable capability. We are all working together in EMD, developing myriad systems and components in parallel for integration into our models and assembly and test against the requirements set.' In addition to risk reduction, the disposition of Intellectual property rights for FLRAA systems is another supply chain issue – who owns what and for how long, and the Army’s desire to prevent vendor lock on systems so new capabilities to address evolving threats can be more quickly spiraled in via the application of the Modular Open Systems Approach (MOSA). The Army says it doesn’t want to own or control all the IP, only where it fits with the Army aviation mission, especially as it relates to sustainment. 'IP for the Army is focused around logistics functions like training, maintaining, sustaining,' said Poquette. 'We have the heritage of wanting to be able to do that without reliance on contractor support, especially where the Army operates deep in areas that are considered hazardous. So how did we do that? 'Rather than ask for specific IP, we presented to the contractors what it is we wanted to do. We did that in hundreds of use cases. We need to be able to develop training materials and manuals, we need to be able to change them when it’s time to change them. We need to be able to instruct and train on how to do maintenance. What we did was incentivize the contractors during competition to provide the most that they could in order to meet those use cases. Once we had a winner in the competition, we signed Bell up to provide all that intellectual property,' he said, adding that this has been an effective way to get access to the appropriate amount of IP that the Army needs while still protecting the creators of that IP. Such strategies around MOSA, intellectual property, and data rights for FLRAA’s long-term sustainment are a significant shift that will impact how suppliers have traditionally operated their businesses. Said Ehinger, 'With some of these new initiatives, suppliers that are able to provide the best value in a competitive environment will do well and suppliers that fail to adapt will see fewer opportunities. A key element of this requires collaboration between industry and government to understand associated intellectual property and data rights, what is needed for long-term organic sustainment, and how industry can help facilitate that. Customers are rightfully passionate about their ability to sustain their platforms over the long term. MOSA is going to be a game changer in terms of enabling affordable upgrades to mission systems. 'As an industry we are at a unique time where we can create a truly new weapon system leveraging the latest in manufacturing technology to yield improvements in affordability and quality. Part of this is due to the advancement in machinery, as well as how the digital thread and software has matured to allow fewer steps in the transition from engineering to manufacturing to assembly and inspection, all leveraging the same source data and reducing the opportunity for defective data. The industrial base is advancing to embrace this and, from a supply chain perspective, those that are able to thrive in this environment of model-based definition and maintain the integrity of the digital thread are at a clear advantage.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/addressing-risk-and-intellectual-property-rights-in-the-flraa-supply-chain/	2025-01-31T12:42:09-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/DVIDS-FLRAA-photo-for-Bell-Poquette-scaled-e1738355079836.jpg
The sky is not falling: Why Trump may not need the space council anyway	US President Donald Trump watches the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket carrying the SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule, with astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley, lifts off from Kennedy Space Center in Florida on May 30, 2020. (Photo by MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images) Since the inauguration of President Donald Trump to his second term, close observers of American endeavors in space seem to be wringing their hands over the potential dis-establishment of the National Space Council. The council, established in the late 1980s but dormant for many years before its 2017 revival by an executive order by Trump and continued through the Biden years, was designed to '[synchronize] the nation’s civil, commercial, and national security space activities to advance the broader priorities' of the United States in space, according to a Biden-era fact sheet. But media rumors suggest Trump could ax the council, egged on by lobbying from Elon Musk’s SpaceX, according to Reuters. That, in turn, has prompted concerns related to how 'we need a National Space Council to chart our future in outer space.' There are several layers to this argument, but the long and short of it is that it’s overblown. It may be the case that Trump simply does not need a space council to pursue his administration’s strategy for American space leadership for the next four years. Here’s why: The President already has the policy framework and strategy for American spacepower from his first term. The second Trump administration does not need another year long space posture review to decide where we are going when we have the National Strategy for Space and all the SPDs developed during the 2017-2021 first term. It can be argued that the National Space Council has already met its objectives for the administration, and now its up to the President and his new team to execute these directives and strategy across civil, commercial, and national security space as soon as possible. RELATED: Space Force zeroed out funding for in-space mobility in FY26 budget request, sources say The National Strategy for Space was never fully implemented, neither were the Space Policy Directives (SPDs). These should provide the framework for American excellence in space and all departments and agencies tasked within these should be held accountable with timelines and budgetary support from OMB and Congress. That will be hard enough dealing with Congressional opinions and ideas despite having majorities in both Houses. No need to bury the president in excess policy discussions when that homework has been done. The existence of a National Space Council will not prevent 'rogue agencies doing what they want.' I know this from experience. In the last Trump administration, there were many departments and agencies that would use the implementation guidance coordination process as means of 'resistance' to the president’s strategy and policy directives. While many people complain about how the president is looking for senior appointments to run the departments and agencies who are 'loyal', the fact is that each of these people serve at the pleasure of the president, and their jobs is to execute his policies, once the discussion period is complete. To avoid providing additional means for resistance to policy directives from continuing, recruiting those who are of the same mind is key. It might be that some at the highest levels think that the time for discussion is over and the time to move out is now. I for one believe this to be the case. The relationship between Trump and Elon Musk has not 'politicized space.' I have written on this topic of 'politicizing space' before. The reality is space policy has always been a political undertaking, both nationally and internationally. Apollo was a geopolitical decision by John F. Kennedy. Not everyone in the US government was on board and did what they could to kill the effort. The Space Shuttle and space station were both political decisions. Many have argued that if the Russians weren’t engaged for the International Space Station, NASA might not have had a vote to continue the project. Cancelling the Constellation project to send astronauts back to the moon and to Mars, started by President George W. Bush, was a political decision that even President Barack Obama’s own party members in Congress were not totally happy with. RELATED: &#8216;Changes' expected in ISR satellite operations to sort NGA, Space Force roles, official says Decisions in the future regarding civil and national security space will continue to generate political mobilization. It is an area of great emotion, passion, and strategic need. Space is only politics free in science fiction. Musk is a very outspoken proponent of going to Mars. This is not a new thing. Musk was a huge advocate of this when Obama was in office as well as during the Biden administration. The difference between Trump and Obama with the Biden administration is while Obama and Trump sought to enable commercial space technology such as SpaceX for commercial crew, cargo, and other capabilities, the Biden administration was perceived as overly restrictive. While some regulation is vital to safety of property and the environment, too much is hindering to American leadership in space. It only makes sense that Musk would ally with Trump given his stated position to extend American 'manifest destiny among the stars.' Given that is Musk’s dream as well, this is a not an unusual business and personal relationship between an industry figure and the president. There are other voices included in the space policy world, Newt Gingrich, Bob Walker, Jared Issacman, and many more are also part of this discussion and will be joining the Trump administration’s space policy team, in the case of Issacman. Keeping all these realities in mind, might help people understand that while a national Space Council is something that should be supported, there is some sound logic behind why, at least in the Trump administration, such an institution is not necessary for the second term. The objective now is to get moving. Get the Space Force armed and ready to defend the nation’s critical space infrastructure out into cis-lunar space, and to see the 'stars and stripes planted on the planet Mars.' Let’s get going!

‘More work to be done’ to lower barriers to tech-sharing for AUKUS Pillar II, Australian official says	The crew of the USS Asheville assemble on the casing of the submarine during a visit to HMAS Stirling in Rockingham, Western Australia. (Australian government) WEST 2025 — The AUKUS nations have made progress in loosening regulatory barriers when it comes to the exchange of defense technology for the alliance's Pillar II initiative, but an Australian official said much more red tape still needs to be cut. 'If we're going to step into this endeavor, we've got to be committed to creating opportunities to accelerate and getting technology into the hands of our warfighters,' Commodore David Frost, naval attache in the Royal Australian Navy, told an audience here at the West conference on Thursday. 'That can only be achieved if we knock down many of the barriers to that, one of which is the licenses that are required for us to share.' Frost was referencing licenses still withheld under the Excluded Technology List (ELT), a list that, as its name suggests, identifies tech that's still controlled by onerous export rules like the US government's International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). In August the US approved new ITAR rules to speed along AUKUS-related tech sharing, but experts and lawmakers have called for the alliance to go further. Frost suggested that's been in the works. 'So Australia, and particularly in Washington, with the State Department, with the Pentagon, with the Navy, we've been very focused on that excluded technology list to make sure it's as minimal as possible so we can get at sharing that technology. Now are we there yet? No, we're not,' he said. 'We need to focus on that so there's more work to be done.' Related: AUKUS ITAR changes not much help for Pillar 2 tech: US Studies Centre experts Frost said that narrowing down the excluded tech list will help strengthen not only Pillar II efforts — which include capabilities such as hypersonics, autonomy, AI and other advanced weapons — but also would give small businesses the opportunity to showcase their capabilities. 'We are committed to creating an environment where not just the clients who have the ability to operate in an ITAR environment, because they have resources and people that just do that as part of their business, but small backyard people, the SMEs [small and medium size enterprises] that have really good technology that can be shared and get into the hands of the warfighter,' Frost told Breaking Defense on the sidelines of the event.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/more-work-to-be-done-to-lower-barriers-to-tech-sharing-for-aukus-pillar-ii-australian-official-says/	2025-01-31T07:15:31-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/20230314ran8562933_0001-scaled-e1678829734251.jpg
Army launching self-propelled howitzer competition in mid-February, after globetrotting evalution tour	A photo of the Extended Range Cannon Artillery (US Army) The service plans to host a competition that will kick off with the release of a Phase I request for proposal in mid-February, the service’s Program Executive Officer for Ground Combat Systems Maj. Gen. Glenn Dean said in a Wednesday email. 'Phase I is the ‘get to test’ phase which includes further testing of mature platforms, and it will not be a vendor downselect — competition in this phase remains critical,' Dean added. Instead, the Army is planning to pick an unspecified number of companies to proceed and award Phase I contracts around the July to September timeframe. Those vendors will then participate in additional 'competitive evaluation testing' that will run through fiscal 2026. RELATED: Army anticipates return of repaired logistics vessel prototype by month's end 'To support current and future operations, next generation artillery must deliver precise and effective fires at range and be able to mass fires to support operations,' the two-star general wrote in response to questions. 'It is not an either/or, but both.' 'The ability to mass fire is not just the ability to fire rapidly (rate of fire), but also the ability to load, move, emplace, fire, displace, reload, and re-emplace/refire at a pace that supports the needs of the supported force,' he added. While the Army continued work on associated munitions under the ERCA banner, it was torn over whether to relaunch development of a new platform or pull an existing one from industry. To help find that answer, the service went on an international roadshow in recent months, visiting a handful of companies from Europe to Asia to the Middle East — Rheinmetall, BAE Systems, Hanwha, General Dynamics and Elbit Systems. In early December, Long-Range Precision Fires Cross Functional Team leader Brig. Gen. Rory Crooks said those evaluations were going well with early findings indicating that the vendors are 'absolutely ready for competitive evaluation.' 'We’re very pleased with what we’re seeing so far, and even some on the autonomy side,' the one-star general told an audience at an Association of the US Army event on Dec. 3.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/army-launching-self-propelled-howitzer-competition-in-mid-february-after-globetrotting-evalution-tour/	2025-01-31T05:23:02-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Extended-Range-Artillery-Cannon-ERCA-Army.jpeg
Don’t force Pacific Island nations to choose between us or China, says UK Royal Navy admiral	China's Premier Li Qiang shows the way to Solomon Islands' Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare after they observed their national anthems during a welcome ceremony at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on July 10, 2023. (Photo by ANDY WONG/POOL/AFP via Getty Images) WEST 2025 — Western countries should avoid pressuring Pacific Island nations from making a binary choice between working with China or the United States and its allies, an admiral from the United Kingdom’s Royal Navy warned, citing the massive maritime might the Chinese could bring on smaller countries. 'The way in which global trade is interconnected at the moment means that China has a trump card of maritime trade that no other nation on the planet’s got,' Rear Adm. James Parkin, who is responsible for overseeing the development of the Royal Navy’s technologies, told attendees at West in San Diego on Wednesday. Parkin specifically cited China’s shipbuilding infrastructure, which is consistently rated as the best in the world when measured in number of ships built per year. The Chinese government 'passed a law that every merchant ship can be changed to be a state-owned vessel in era of combat,' Parkin said. 'So, as well as the silhouettes of warships versus warships … there’s another 10,000 state-owned Chinese vessels which could be brought to bear in an era of conflict.' More specifically, he said China could use its fleet to create an 'almost universal maritime trade embargo' which would have immediate consequences for smaller, secluded Pacific Island countries. US Coast Guard and Navy leadership often talk publicly about the assistance they strive to provide to smaller island nations in the Indo-Pacific as a means of military diplomacy. They also warn those same nations about the coercive tactics the Chinese have used: offering money and aide up front, but then later calling in a debt to gain access to useful ports and other resources. 'The [People’s Republic of China] has resorted to corruption, bribery, and personal threats to advance its influence in the [Pacific Island countries],' according to the Pentagon’s 2024 report on China’s power. 'In March 2023, outgoing Federated States of Micronesia President David Panuelo criticized the PRC for its widespread bribes of Micronesian officials and reported PRC officials made direct threats to his personal safety.' Although US military officials don't directly ask these countries to pick sides in the way Parkin stated, they do stress the importance that these nations and others view the United States as its partner of choice over China. Asked about this, Parkin said, 'I think if you look at the different levers of power, the diplomatic, the industrial, the military and the economic, in times of peace, people don't connect to those elements.' 'What my points are reflecting is that in time of conflict, clearly, the military element of those four levers of powers is much more important,' he said, 'but if the other three levers have already been locked down, then we may not get the answer we want when it comes to the way in which other independent nations may choose to go.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/dont-force-pacific-island-nations-to-choose-between-us-or-china-says-uk-royal-navy-admiral/	2025-01-30T14:07:59-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/07/230721_china_solomon_GettyImages-1517817161-scaled-e1689946587637.jpg
Sweden’s new $1.2B donation to Ukraine includes drones, missiles and boats	Swedish and Ukrainian flags on a balcony in Kiev, Ukraine. (Getty Images) STOCKHOLM — Sweden today announced a 13.5 billion SEK ($1.23 billion) military aid package to Ukraine and Moldova, the 18th support package Stockholm has announced for Kyiv’s aid. Among the key components of this package is approximately $90 million for the production of long-range missiles and drones, which aims to bolster Ukraine’s offensive capabilities, according to the announcement by the Swedish government and its coalition party on Thursday. The package also includes donations of 16 CB90-class fast assault boats, 1,500 anti-tank TOW missiles and 200 anti-armor AT4 weapons. The aid package also includes 23 naval weapons stations and one million rounds of ammunition for the combat boats, to support Ukraine's naval capabilities. 'This is also a signal to our other allies that we need to prepare for the fact that Europe will have to take greater responsibility for the support to Ukraine,' Defence Minister Pål Jonson said. Approximately 45 percent of the military aid package for Ukraine, amounting to $544 million, is money being set aside for the Swedish Defense Material Administration to buy more equipment for Ukraine’s needs from European defense industries. Decisions on where to spend that money has been made in consultation with Ukraine, and deliveries will happen within the next 24 months, Jonson's spokesperson told Breaking Defense. In addition, $181.5 million will be sent through the 'Danish model' to Ukraine's defense industry, and another $72.6 million will be sent to funds such as the Comprehensive Assistance Package (CAP) and the British International Fund for Ukraine (IPU), which finance the purchase of military equipment. The decision to include AT4s for Moldova is notable, as it reflects Stockholm’s broader strategy of supporting regional stability beyond Ukraine’s borders. Moldova, a non-NATO member state, is viewed by regional experts as the next potential target for Russian aggression should Moscow win out in Ukraine. 'Increasing our engagement with countries within the EU’s Eastern Partnership, such as Moldova, is a key part of Sweden’s policy to constrain Russia. This policy aims to constrain Russia’s influence, freedom of action and ability to do harm,' Jonson said on X. 'Moldova is a target of repeated Russian influence campaigns, and it is in Europe’s security interest to help Moldova get stronger and safer.' Ukraine dictates the needs and short delivery times are crucial, according to the government press brief on Thursday. In 2025, Sweden will be allocating $58 million towards the education and training of Ukrainian soldiers, demonstrating a long-term commitment to enhancing Ukraine’s military capabilities through education. As of today’s announcement, Sweden has contributed a total of approximately $5.62 billion in military support to Ukraine since Russia's full-scale invasion began nearly three years ago, according to a government summary.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/swedens-new-1-2b-donation-to-ukraine-includes-drones-missiles-and-boats/	2025-01-30T12:05:27-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/sweden-ukraine-flags-scaled-e1738261497904.jpg
Germany’s Diehl Defence receives 4-nation IRIS-T Block II development contract	Concept art of the future IRIS-T Block II short range, air-to-air missile (Diehl Defence) BELFAST — German weapons manufacturer Diehl Defence announced today that it has been contracted to lead development and production of IRIS-T (InfraRed Imaging System – Tail/Thrust Vector Controlled) Block II air-to-air missiles on behalf of program partner nations Germany, Italy, Spain and Sweden. The company said in a statement that the Block II contract was originally signed by Germany’s federal office for armed forces equipment, information technology and in-service support (BAAINBw) at the 'end of December' 2024 and was 'realized in the shortest possible time.' It added, 'The IRIS-T Block II contract marks an important milestone for the future of IRIS-T,' but did not disclose a contract value, quantities of Block II weapons on order or delivery dates. Neither Diehl nor the BAAINBw responded to requests for comment by press time. The Diehl statement did not explain the defining features of the Block II upgrade, sharing only that the missile will be 'improved continuously and will continue to set benchmarks with new capabilities in its original air-to-air role.' As noted by the manufacturer, IRIS-T is a European short range, air-to-air missile, with the in-production Block I developed in collaboration at an industrial level by Germany, Greece, Italy, Norway, Spain and Sweden. 'The seeker assisted radar proximity fuze and the large warhead give the missile a remarkable anti-missile capability,' states achieved Diehl company literature. Capable of striking enemy fighter jets and intercepting air-to-air or surface-to-air missiles, the weapon was designed as a successor to the US Air Intercept Missile (AIM)-9X Sidewinder air-to-air missile and has been in production since 2005. To date, over 5,000 units have been delivered. The weapon is integrated on a range of fighters jets including the Swedish Gripen, Eurofighter Typhoon, US platforms like the F-5E, F-16, EF-18, and South Korea’s KF-21. More broadly, the IRIS-T family also features the IRIS-T SL (surface-launched) missile equipped for Ground Based Air Defense (GBAD) systems. It is a core part of Ukraine's air defense. A total of 11 IRIS-T platforms, split between SLS (short) and SLM (medium) types, have so far been delivered by Germany, according to a military aid factsheet. As Breaking Defense previously reported, Germany plans on taking deliveries later this year under a six IRIS T-SLM fire unit acquisition. Diehl also unveiled the newest addition to the IRIS-T collection at the Berlin Airshow last year. The in-development system will be capable of 'covering ranges of up to 80 km,' it said at the time.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/germanys-diehl-defence-receives-4-nation-iris-t-block-ii-development-contract/	2025-01-30T11:01:22-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/2024_12_Pressemitteilung_IRIS_T-scaled-e1738251614684.jpg
Northrop to sell training services unit to Serco in $327M deal	In this photo illustration, the American multinational aerospace and defense technology company Northrop Grumman logo is seen displayed on a smartphone with an economic stock exchange index graph in the background. (Photo Illustration by Budrul Chukrut/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — Northrop Grumman is selling off its training services business to Serco for $327 million, as the prime contractor restructures its defense systems division and focuses its business on innovation. The transaction is expected to close mid-year 2025, the companies said in a statement announcing the deal. 'We continuously evaluate the portfolio to ensure that we are investing in the businesses that are core to achieving our strategic vision. This includes accessing any gaps that may emerge over time or businesses that may make sense to exit. With this in mind, we've decided to exit our training services business that is part of defense systems segment,' Northrop CEO Kathy Warden said during an earnings call this morning. 'This is an important capability for our customers, and we expect the team to continue to deliver world class training services under new leadership, allowing us to focus on our core business.' The sale will grow Serco’s revenue in North America to beyond $2 billion and its workforce by about 1,000 employees, adding mission training services and software for satellite ground stations to the company’s portfolio, Serco said in a news release. Alongside the sale of training services, Northrop has transferred its strike and surveillance aircraft services business from its defense systems division to its aeronautics unit, a move that puts aircraft sustainment in the same portfolio as aircraft development and production. The realignment will allow for a 'more seamless development and sustainment of next generation aircraft' in aeronautics while focusing the defense systems portfolio on strategic deterrence systems like the Sentinel, advanced weapons and missile defense, said Northrop Chief Financial Officer Ken Crews. Northrop’s fourth quarter earnings provided few surprises, with Robert Stallard of Vertical Research Partners calling it a 'clean, event free quarter from Northrop.' Warden, however, did provide some new details on usually-quite-secretive programs like the Sentinel intercontinental ballistic missile system and the services’ next-generation fighter jets. Northrop is continuing to meet milestones on the Sentinel contract, even as the Air Force 'paused work on some small infrastructure efforts in the command and launch' as it considers how to restructure the program in the wake of massive cost overruns, Warden said. Last year, the Pentagon determined that it would continue the program despite an 81 percent increase in cost, and the Air Force is considering reopening pieces of the troubled ground infrastructure portion of the contract up for competition. Asked about the Air Force and Navy’s next-generation fighter programs, Warden specified that Northrop is 'not a prime, but we are a contributor to the program through mission systems' on the Air Force’s Next Generation Air Dominance program. For the Navy’s F/A-XX program, where Northrop is competing as a prime contractor, the company continues to monitor the effort and 'would be excited to be selected,' she added. The company has not built either program into its financial guidance. Last year, Gen. Thomas Bussiere, head of Air Force Global Strike Command, said that the service may need to accelerate or increase its planned buy of B-21 bombers. Asked today whether an accelerated buy would affect pricing of the aircraft, Warden was noncommittal. 'We would work with the Air Force to look at when those units would come into the contract, and obviously we are accumulating more and more actual performance to help inform discussions with them about the right pricing,' she said. 'It would be premature for me to comment on where we expect that to land.' Warden praised the Trump administration for its attention to missile defense issues through its support of an Iron Dome system for the United States, saying that Northrop is 'well-positioned to support that architecture.' She also said the company looks forward to engaging with the Department of Government Efficiency headed by Elon Musk. 'I believe we all see that there is room for cost efficiency in the way that we work together between industry and government, and so we've embraced the opportunity to share some of our observations and ideas, and are starting to do that,' she said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/northrop-to-sell-training-services-unit-to-serco-in-327m-deal/	2025-01-30T10:07:41-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/11/northrop-logo-phone-scaled-e1699982995194.jpg
Elbit to supply Israel with $80 million in EW and protection suites for F-16s	The F-16I has been in service for 20 years with the IDF, and several squadrons fly the warplane. (IDF) JERUSALEM — The Israel Ministry of Defense is acquiring $80 million in 'advanced self-protection suites' for Israel's F-16I aircraft, the latest in a procurement blitz in the wake of the conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon. The Ministry of Defense made the aquisition announcement on Monday, saying the F-16s will 'be equipped with cutting-edge technologies to ensure maximum protection in complex combat scenarios.' The ministry did not specify how many F-16Is will be equipped, nor did it say which squadrons flying the F-16I will get the upgrade. However, photographs distributed by the ministry showed planes from the 107th squadron, with an orange crescent emblazoned on its tail and the 201st squadron, known at The One, which has a '1' on the tail. The IAF has two other F-16I squadrons: the 253rd, which first integrated the warplane, and the 119th 'Bat' squadron. The Israeli Air Force has flown F-16s since the 1980s, including the F-16I since it entered service in 2004. The new protection suite includes an 'Electonic Warfare (EW) system providing advanced threat disruption capabilities, ⁠Infra-Red (IR) Missile Warning and Launch Detection System for early identification of airborne and ground threats and Advanced chaff and flare dispensing system for protection against guided missile,' the ministry said. The procurement of the new systems for the F-16s is part of a much larger process the Ministry of Defense has embarked upon since the Oct. 7 attack on Israel by Hamas. Israel was already acquiring new heavy lifter helicopters and refuelers. It had also just taken delivery of four new corvette warships and was upgrading its air defenses. However, the war has highlighted the need for Israel to acquire a large number of new systems for a much larger number of forces and platforms. One part of this process was underlined by the Nagel Commission, empaneled in the summer of 2024 to look at force building needs. 'This process joins a series of strategic deals promoted by the Israel Ministry of Defense under Director General Maj. Gen. (Res.) Eyal Zamir to strengthen production independence in Israeli defense industries and reduce dependency on external factors. This is to ensure the IDF’s qualitative military edge and support its current and future operational needs under all conditions,' the ministry said in its statement. Zamir is reported to be on the short list for the new Chief of Staff as Israel’s Minister of Defense Israel Katz looks for a replacement for Herzi Halevi, who recently said he is resigning. Elbit Systems has secured several EW and self-protection suite deals in recent years. In 2024 it was awarded $175 million to supply them for Embraer C-390s and Airbus H225M helicopters for an unnamed NATO country. It has also been contracted to provide EW to the German air force for CH-53 helicopters, and also for the Netherlands Gulfstream G650 aircraft, in deals in 2023 and 2022 respectively.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/elbit-to-supply-israel-with-80-million-in-ew-and-protection-suites-for-f-16s/	2025-01-30T09:46:21-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/250130_f16i_inflight_IDF-e1738257717105.png

(Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) WASHINGTON — In the wake of last night’s tragic accident involving a civilian aircraft and US Army helicopter that has left dozens dead, service secretary nominee Daniel Driscoll kicked off his confirmation hearing vowing to focus on aviation. 'Our thoughts and prayers go out to all involved in last night's tragedy, which occurred a few miles away from this hearing room. If confirmed [I’ll work to ensure] this never happens again,' Driscoll told members of the Senate Armed Services Committee during his opening statement. The committee met hours after American Airlines Flight 5342 and an Army UH-60 Black Hawk collided in the air near Washington National Airport, on the outskirts of the nation’s capital. The commercial aircraft — inbound from Wichita, Kan. — was carrying 64 people, while the helicopter was flying a training mission with three soldiers from the 12th Aviation Battalion at Fort Belvoir, Va. There are no presumed survivors and the National Transportation Safety Board is slated to lead the investigation. 'It's an accident that seems to be preventable, for what we can tell [right now], that should not happen. I think of focus from the top down, on a culture of safety, there are appropriate times to take risk and there are inappropriate times to take risk,' Driscoll said in response to questions from Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-NH. 'I don't know the details around this one, but [if] confirmed, and working with this committee to figure out the facts, I think we might need to look at where is an appropriate time to take training risk, and it may not be near an airport like Reagan.' Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth addressed the accident this morning in a pre-taped video release, noting that the soldiers were conducting an annual proficiency training flight. 'It was a fairly experienced crew, and that was doing a required annual night evaluation. They did have night vision goggles,' Hegseth said. 'The 12th aviation battalion, as of now, is granted a 48 hour operational pause on contingency missions as what happened is reviewed and a senior level Aviation team, an investigative team from our aviation safety center was deployed last night.' While last night’s accident didn’t take center stage at the start of today’s confirmation hearing, Chairman Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., kicked it off with a moment of silence. Last night's deadly crash comes in the wake of several years of intense scrutiny over Army aviation. In April 2023, the Army leaders announced a service-wide aviation stand down following a pair of deadly helicopter accidents that claimed the lives of a dozen soldiers. That stand down grounded all Army aviators, except those participating in 'critical missions.' 'The safety of our aviators is our top priority, and this stand down is an important step to make certain we are doing everything possible to prevent accidents and protect our personnel,' then-Army Chief of Staff Gen. James McConville said in a release. 'During this stand down, we will focus on safety and training protocols to ensure our pilots and crews have the knowledge, training and awareness to safely complete their assigned mission.' But the accidents kept coming, as did the scrutiny. According to an online Army newsletter [PDF] about aviation mishaps that was released this month, things got worse in fiscal 2024. 'FY24 will be a year that Army aviation looks back on in hopes of never repeating,' the newsletter begins. 'After years of a steady decline in mishap rates per 100,000 hours beginning in 2006, FY23 saw a twofold increase in mishap rates from FY22’s record low 0.50 Class A mishaps per 100,000 hours. Then FY24 produced a Class A flight mishap rate almost four times greater than FY22, with a rate of 1.90.' More specifically, it notes that last year was the 'most' Class A flight mishaps since FY14 and the 'worst' Class A flight mishap rate per 100,000 hours since FY07. 'The most obvious trend in the FY24 mishaps was the AH-64 [Apache] fleet being overrepresented with nine of the 15 Class A flight mishaps,' the Army newsletter continues. 'Eight of the AH-64 mishaps were attributed to human error, with two of those being attributed to maintenance errors. The final AH-64 mishap was a bird strike.' In FY24, there were also three UH-72 Lakota Class A mishaps, and one-off mishaps with the fleet of UH-60 Black Hawks, the CH-47 Chinooks and the Beechcraft C-12 Huron. There was also a Class A environmental event that damaged over 40 aircraft and a C-12 Class A aircraft ground mishap during maintenance operations. In April 2024, before the fiscal year ended, the Army announced an Aviation Safety Stand-Up with no pause in operations. 'During this stand up, aviation units will execute targeted training that we've really been deliberate about crafting while continuing to fly missions,' said Brig Gen Walter Rugen, then the director of Army aviation. 'Again, for our overarching goal to build enduring readiness and proficiency in our force. 'We assess that the recent accident increase would be better mitigated by focusing more on specific training topics to better get at targeted areas that are contributing to many of our safety issues,' he later added. 'So, more training, more focused training.' While President Donald Trump’s pick to be 26th Army secretary is relatively unknown, with a limited social media presence, he seemingly has support from both sides of the aisle. Driscoll, who previously served as an advisor to now-Vice President JD Vance, is a graduate of Yale Law School, former Army soldier, and has spent time working in the private equity arena. In a rarity for Washington, he arrived at the committee with a bipartisan show of support: Sens Markwayne Mullen, R- Okla., and Richard Blumenthal, D-Ct., introduced Driscoll at the start of the hearing. 'I spoke to Dan a number of times in the course of his preparing for his appearance here today, and those conversations convinced me that he is willing to work on the basis of collegiality, to be transparent and open with this panel with the Congress and our colleagues,' Blumenthal said during his introduction. The top Democrat on the committee, Sen. Jack Reed, D-RI., also seemingly threw his support behind the nominee to lead the Army saying he brings 'integrity, intelligence and the experience of the young officer leading soldiers.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/washington-dc-aviation-airport-crash-black-hawk-army-secretary-safety/	2025-01-30T08:16:23-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/dca-crash-scaled-e1738253107889.jpg
Saudi defense giant SAMI appoints new CEO	Visitors check out the booth for Saudi Arabian Military Industries (SAMI) at the Dubai Airshow in 2023. (Agnes Helou / Breaking Defense) BEIRUT — Saudi Arabia’s government-owned defense giant has appointed Thamer AlMuhid as its new Chief Executive Officer, five months after previous CEO Walid Abukhaled stepped down, the company's board of directors announced today. 'In his role as CEO, Eng. AlMuhid will lead SAMI's mission to develop cutting-edge technologies, manufacture world-class products, and forge strategic partnerships,' according to a statement from Saudi Arabian Military Industries. The company said AlMuhid served earlier in several executive positions from CEO of Saudi Chemical Company to the vice chairman of the board of directors of the National Academy of Military Industries. As CEO of SAMI, one of AlMuhid's primary responsibilities will be to push SAMI to realize Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 goal of localizing 50 percent of defense production in the country. RELATED: Saudi Arabia reveals strides in local defense production as it races towards ambitious 2030 goal AlMuhid will be the third SAMI CEO since the organization's founding in 2017, after German national and former Rheinmetall executive Andreas Schwer, and Saudi national and former Northrop Grumman executive Walid Abukhaled. 'I’m extremely proud to say since the inception of SAMI, we became one of the top 100 defense companies in the world,' then-CEO Abukhaled told Breaking Defense in an interview at the World Defense Show in Riyadhi in February 2024. 'Whether it's a vehicle land vehicle, a futuristic UAV that is a concept, some C4I systems, C2 systems, smaller versions of UAVs, converting a manned boat to unmanned boat — we've done it, it's us. The shift is already happening.' SAMI recently highlighted a number of its achievements over the last year, including launching the first locally developed combat management system in Saudi Arabia and expanding the size of its workforce of 71 percent nationals.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/saudi-defense-giant-sami-appoints-new-ceo/	2025-01-30T08:10:04-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/11/231113_SAMI_dubai_airshow_HELOU-scaled-e1699907382425.jpg
Breaking down how the Pentagon could spend $200 billion extra	On March 11, 2024 the Pentagon and military services presented their fiscal year 2025 budget requests. (Graphic by Breaking Defense, original images courtesy DVIDS, Getty) The president has recently reiterated his commitment to 'peace through strength,' and the Congress is hard at work to make that happen. Initial press reports indicate that Congress could increase defense spending through the reconciliation process by as much as $200 billion, or $100B per year for fiscal 2025 and 2026, above the Biden-proposed defense topline request of $849.8B. With the FY25 NDAA already passed, normally, any additional funds would be added by the appropriators. However, if these funds are added through reconciliation, then it may be that the authorizers, led by Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., and Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Ala., as opposed to the appropriators, who will have greater control in deciding where these funds will be allocated. More money for the Pentagon is an inherently good thing: The department needs not just the money it has asked for, but whatever extra Congress can churn up. But given that DoD has only one confirmed Trump appointee, the Congress will need a guide to determine where this money should go. Fortunately, a written guide already exists in the form of Wicker’s May 2024 plan, appropriately called 'Peace through Strength.' Of course, that plan was written with a different potential topline increase in mind, so a 'new math' will be needed when considering how to spell the potential increase. This 'new math' will have three factors to consider: Wicker’s core plan, fixes for inflation, and what we can call the DOGE transformation. First, let’s start with Wicker’s original plan, which was for a $110 billion increase over two years, or $55 billion of additional funding per year. To start with nearly 85 percent of this $55 billion (Table 1) would go towards Defense/COCOM agencies, the Air Force and the Navy. What is striking is how little funding is allocated to the Army, Marines and the Space Force. While Wicker’s plan is not broken out by appropriation, some careful guesses based upon the descriptions of the individual items shows that this plan allocates over 91 percent of the funding for the three investment accounts (Table 2) and only about 8 percent for operating the force. With over $14 billion allocated in the continuing resolution for nuclear submarines, money that was set after Wicker’s plan was released, the $3.2 billion allocated in the Wicker plan for the Virginia-Class submarines could be reallocated and the ground forces should be running over to the Congress to get a piece of it. With $110 billion of the $200 billion now accounted for, let’s look at inflation. Right now, the military is limping along under a six-month long continuing resolution that my colleague at AEI Elaine McCusker calculates wastes billions of dollars per month. Additionally, inflation has eaten away at least 3 percent of the Pentagon’s buying power, which seems small unless you actually do the math and realize that this is almost $25 billion, or $2 billion per month in decreased readiness and capabilities. In FY24, due to the Fiscal Responsibility Act, the Pentagon’s topline was about $847 billion, so the Biden administration FY25 request of $850 billion is a 'cut' when inflation is taken into account. Assuming a 3 percent inflation rate, the defense budget in FY25 would need to be about $25 billion higher just to have the same buying power as in FY24. Looking forward into FY26, the Pentagon’s topline would need to add another $30 billion to maintain its buying power. Therefore, roughly $55 billion in spending authorized ($25 billion in FY25 and $30 billion in FY26) under reconciliation will be eaten up by simply keeping up with inflation. It’s not ideal, but it is what is realistic. The third bucket of funding is what remains of the $200 billion, which is $35 billion. And if the Trump administration is serious about DOGE and transforming the Department of Defense, then the Congress should allocate these funds to the Deputy Secretary of Defense nominee, Stephen Feinberg. These funds will enable the administration to immediately change the arc of defense procurement. The funds should be used to execute a 180-degree pivot away from exquisite, large, and costly platforms towards a future of mass production and mass customization. This would manifest itself as a full embrace of autonomy in the air, a massive embrace of autonomy at sea, and a new information technology backbone. If Ukraine can produce four million drones per year, certainly, with $35 billion per year, every year starting in FY26, the United States can change the arc of its defense industrial base and boost the efforts of the non-traditional defense firms. There seems to be bipartisan agreement that more money is needed for defense. This is a once in a generation opportunity. With Wicker clearly in the driver’s seat, this $200 billion added through reconciliation will enable the nation to truly achieve 'peace through strength.' It simply needs to follow the path set before it. Retired US Army Maj. Gen. John G. Ferrari is a senior nonresident fellow at AEI. Ferrari previously served as a director of program analysis and evaluation for the service.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/breaking-down-how-the-pentagon-could-spend-200-billion-extra/	2025-01-30T05:59:54-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/03/240311_budget_day_gfx.png
