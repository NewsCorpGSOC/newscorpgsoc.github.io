5 questions with the 3-star general leading Army Materiel Command	Lt. Gen. Christopher Mohan, then the deputy commanding general for Army Materiel Command, addresses the audience during the AUSA 2023 in Washington, DC (US Army/Leroy Council) AUSA 2024 — From repositioning US Army equipment in Europe to eyeing new autonomous capabilities in the air, in the water and on the ground, acting commanding general Army Materiel Command, Lt. Gen. Christopher Mohan is pursuing a host of initiatives aimed at the better distribution of weapons and equipment. Ahead of this week’s Association of the US Army conference in Washington, DC, Breaking Defense spoke with the three-star general about how conflicts around the globe and emerging tech are shaping AMC planning. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. BREAKING DEFENSE: Starting with the broader picture, can you provide an update of AMC’s role in supporting Ukraine and setting the theater? MOHAN: We continue our operations for support to our Ukrainian partners, and that has been a heavy lift all across the organic industrial base. And so at Red River Army Depot, it’s seven days a week, two shifts a day, working on equipment. At the Iowa Army Ammunition Plant, that plant is shut down for a total of four hours per week, and that is so maintenance crews can do preventive maintenance… but other than that, it's running 24/7, as well as up at Scranton [where the team] is working seven days a week on multiple shifts. So we are continuing our surge operations… It is an absolute battle drill at this point, as presidential drawdown directives get released, we identify the sourcing and then we start flowing the material. But at the same time, we are working with our partners in US Army Europe and Africa and 21st Theater Sustainment Command (TSC), in particular, and we have depot teams forward from the expeditionary organic industrial base to rebuild track maintenance capability so that we have more options forward. We have depot maintainers who are working to reset some of the APS [Army Prepositioned Stock] equipment that's seen a high utilization, as well as we have depot teams working with our partners…who are training Polish mechanics on the operation of US equipment. You are also in the process of moving one APS brigade combat team set of equipment to Powidz, Poland. Where does that stand today? So that started with a NATO project several years ago. &#8230; Powidz, Poland is home to one of the largest airfields in Europe. &#8230; It is a massive airfield that is a central hub for not only Poland, but also NATO. Part of the US facilities there is a state-of-the art APS storage facility with dedicated maintenance bays. Our Polish allies upgraded the rail infrastructure to increase the mobility coming in; they upgraded power and the road infrastructure, as well, to build out a world-class facility. We signed for the keys to it in late spring, early summer [2024]&#8230; [and] within the last 45 days, in conjunction with our partners in the 21st TSC, we have been moving in that heavy brigade combat team [-worth of equipment] that was being stored at Coleman [in Germany] &#8230; and it's almost 100 percent moved in now. Because a lot of the new equipment has not been documented yet, the changes have not rolled down to APS. But [Army Chief of Staff Gen. Randy George] is full speed ahead on the transformation experimentation, the rollout of new kit, [and] he's also being very deliberate about making sure that when we actually get to the documentation phase, that we make the right decisions. We've just started to really integrate ourselves [with plans for transformation in contact]. And so right now, from the sustainment community, the contested logistics cross-functional team has been intimately involved with all things transforming [in] contact and all things modernization. From our standpoint, the direction I am taking with this — the broader sustainment enterprise — is to really focus on those processes that we believe will better enable soldiers. We're going to focus on the transformation in contact units, to streamline their operations … [to] think about helping them be more mobile by sweeping all their excess equipment &#8230; to put [those items] back in the supply system or dispose of, so we've lightened their load as well. On top of that, we've got some property accountability pilots that we've executed at Fort Liberty, which is basically streamlining how long it takes to inventory equipment using modern tools that are loaded on an iPhone. Another layer is advanced manufacturing. So, when the 2nd Brigade, 101st Airborne Division was down at the JRTC [Joint Readiness Training Center], we actually had a team from TACOM [the Tank-automotive and Armaments Command] down there, and we pushed a digital file from our digital repository of available parts to print. &#8230; We haven't pushed that type of capability down that low, and so in the future we're working with them to try to integrate that type of reality into [combat training center] CTC rotations. What is the AMC’s tentative approach for 3D printing? Printing at the tactical level is designed to specifically impact combat power for specific missions. It's not the panacea that's going to solve all our Class IX [supply system] problems, but it is a way to rapidly affect readiness for specific things so that units can continue their mission. Our Ukrainian partners, because of necessity, are pushing the boundaries on how they do this — both at the tactical level and all the way back at their depot system as well. The world has a lot to learn from how our Ukrainian partners are working. Are you eyeing any new requirements or capabilities to help on the logistics front such as autonomous trucks or heavy lift helicopters, or additional ships? In conjunction with the contested logistics cross-functional team and CASCOM [Combined Arms Support Command], we are really interested in autonomous distribution — both air and ground. We’ve spoken before about telemaintenance and how we're doing diagnosis over the horizon. &#8230; Think about if we had a fleet of autonomous delivery vehicles that we could place under in the belly of a [unmanned aerial system] UAS, and then that UAS could bypass other choke points in the distribution system and go right to the point of need, and then return to base. That technology is out there. I'm hoping at Project Convergence 5 that we will see some of that demonstrated but we know, for example, that there's a company that will test fly a UAS that will carry 20,000 pounds. The other piece is, and it's not just the air, it's not just the ground, it's also the sea. We have seen demonstrated autonomous watercraft that are either semi-submersible or traditional looking watercraft. &#8230; That capability is out there. We have to change the way that we look at the requirement and be willing to go after these autonomous capabilities, and we're driving that at our level.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/5-questions-with-the-3-star-general-leading-army-materiel-command/	2024-10-14T09:07:45-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/mohan-scaled-e1728568333203.jpg
Airbus keeps H175M ‘industrial footprint’ options open after NMH withdrawal	The H175M super medium class aircraft on display at Airbus Helicopters production facility in Marignane, France (Breaking Defense) BELFAST — The head of Airbus Helicopters says it is not closing any doors to industrial agreements, including the offer of in-country production, as the company bids to secure a launch customer order for the H175M helicopter in the wake of withdrawing from the UK’s New Medium Helicopter (NMH) acquisition. Talks with a number of 'other customers' besides London are underway, but an 'industry footprint' for the super medium-class aircraft has still to be decided, said Airbus Helicopters CEO Bruno Even. 'We know that we are ready to propose this whole partnership with some of our customers, in order to produce this capability locally for them, but also to be able to export this new program to address the export opportunity,' he told reporters during an Airbus Helicopters press day held on Oct. 8 at the company’s production facility in Marignane, France. (Breaking Defense accepted travel and accommodation for the trip.) He suggested the UK should 'reflect' on the next steps for NMH, a competition for which Airbus had floated the H175M, but was thrown into disarray when both Airbus and Lockheed Martin pulled out of the competition on the day bids were due. Pitching the AW149 multirole helicopter, Leonardo was the only manufacturer to table a bid, aligned to a request for 23 to 32 new rotorcraft to replace Airbus Puma HC2 aircraft. Doubts continue to hang over the future of NMH, not only because the viability of a competition with a single manufacturer remains dubious, while the UK has put big ticket acquisition decisions on hold, until it completes a new strategic defense review. Airbus had committed to standing up a H175M production facility in Broughton, Wales, but said at the time of walking away from NMH that its decision to do so was based on a review of requirements that left it 'unable to formulate a responsible bid that would in parallel satisfy the customer’s requirements and provide adequate long-term returns to the business, while implying a reasonable prospect of winning.' Even was more specific, remarking that the withdrawal directly related to Airbus judging that it could not put forward an offer that could meet performance, local content and budget requirements, while receiving 'the right return for industry.' He added, 'It's perhaps also a good opportunity [for the UK] to take time and to reflect on this requirement.' He did not rule out running again if, for example, the competition was to be recompeted. 'We will listen to the customers [UK] and what they have in mind for the next step and of course will come with the best proposal, depending on the evolution' of NMH, said Even. Regarding development, the H175M is still at an 'early stage' with decisions pending over which 'configurations' and equipment to settle on, Olivier Pastore, head of the H175M programme, told Breaking Defense. 'The program itself is already de-risked in terms of [definition as] a pure military transport platform, because we already know the platform, but there are still open discussions and architecture [decisions] to be drawn' up for sensor integration, he explained. The H175M will be initially designed to carry out troop transport and Search and Rescue (SAR) missions, before Airbus looks at adding more 'complicated missions' such as Special Forces and medical evacuation, according to Pastore.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/airbus-keeps-h175m-industrial-footprint-options-open-after-nmh-withdrawal/	2024-10-14T08:05:28-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/IMG_1992-e1728672505974.jpg
France, Germany join US space warfighting plan ‘Olympic Defender’	US Space Force Lt. Col. Jordan O.E. Mugg, commander, 18th Space Defense Squadron, welcomes members from the German Space Situational Awareness Centre and Operational Center for Military Surveillance of Space Objects during a German-French operator exchange at Vandenberg SFB, Calif., July 10, 2023. (US Space Force photo by Julian Labit) WASHINGTON — US Space Command today welcomed France and Germany as the newest participants in Operation Olympic Defender, the US military's operational planning process for warfighting in space. SPACECOM Commander Gen. Stephen Whiting traveled to Paris and Berlin on Oct. 11 to attend the two induction ceremonies with Maj. Gen. Phillipe Adam, French Space Command commander, and Lt. Gen. Gunter Schneider, director-general for military strategy and operations at the German Ministry of Defence, respectively, according to twin SPACECOM press releases. Representatives of Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and newest member New Zealand, which accepted the US invitation on Sept. 5, also participated, SPACECOM said. Created in 2013 by US Strategic Command, which at the time had responsibility for US military space operations, Operation Olympic Defender was updated in 2018 to open up allied participation. Australia, Britain and Canada joined in 2020. Whiting extended the invite to France and Germany, along with New Zealand, on April 9 at the Space Symposium in Colorado Springs. Details about the warplan, of course, are scant. SPACECOM's releases today characterize Operation Olympic Defender as 'a multinational effort that focuses to optimize space operations, improve mission assurance, enhance resilience of space-based systems, synchronize efforts to strengthen deterrence against hostile actors and reduce the spread of debris orbiting the Earth.' Schneider's statement stressed the deterrent value of allied cooperation to keep eyes on the heavens and watch out for potentially dangerous activities by adversaries. 'Our common efforts as allies to increase our Space Domain Awareness will not only lead to a better understanding of the space domain, but it will also dissuade possible adversaries from dangerous and escalatory behavior in space as they will have to take into account that we can closely observe and evaluate each of their actions,' he said. Adam struck a more martial tone in his statement — unsurprising in that France has been one of the few countries to admit to its pursuit of weapons on orbit, albeit characterizing its plans for 'patrol' satellites that can shoot back with lasers at threats as strictly defensive. 'For France, joining the Multi-National Force-Operation OLYMPIC DEFENDER is a return to the spirit of LaFayette, in order to defend together freedom in space against growing threats,' said Adam. 'It marks a new stage in the conduct of military space operations in coalition and sends out a clear message of strategic solidarity with our Allies. 'For those who missed their American history classes, Marie-Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette, was a French nobleman and military officer who voluntarily joined the Continental Army under Gen. George Washington in the American Revolutionary War. He was in command of the last major battle in the war of independence against Britain, the Siege of Yorktown in 1781. Paris and Berlin have been moving closer to the US with regard to space operations for several years. France and Germany in 2020 joined SPACECOM's Combined Space Operations Initiative, following along behind US partners in the Five Eyes intelligence alliance Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the UK. Since then, Italy, Japan and Norway have joined. The Combined Space Operation Initiative issued its first public statement of intent in February 2022, calling for future collaboration in defending their interests in outer space — to include potential development efforts to fill gaps in their collective capabilities as well as norm-building efforts.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/france-germany-join-us-space-warfighting-plan-olympic-defender/	2024-10-14T07:12:14-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/18th-SDS-welcomes-FrenchGerman-space-operators-2023-scaled-e1728667270125.jpeg
Bell to manufacture FLRAA fuselage after dumping Spirit AeroSystems ahead of Boeing acquisition	Bell's V-280 Valor tiltrotor won the US Army's Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) competition. (Bell) AUSA 2024 — Bell Textron will produce fuselages for the Army’s Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft in house, having made the decision to take the work away from Spirit AeroSystems following the announcement of its proposed acquisition by Boeing, Bell and Spirit confirmed to Breaking Defense. Army acquisition executive Doug Bush said the service does not anticipate any risk to the FLRAA program resulting from Bell’s pivot away from Spirit as the fuselage maker. 'We're ahead of that problem. It's already been worked out,' he told Breaking Defense in an interview ahead of the Association of the US Army conference in Washington this week. The transfer of work on the Army’s highest priority aviation program is the direct result of Bell’s concerns that financial and operational instability at Boeing, which is set to acquire Spirit in mid-2025, could have an adverse impact on the FLRAA program. 'Bell has full responsibility for the fuselage scope of work, as we do with many of our product lines,' a company spokesperson said in a statement to Breaking Defense. 'Bell’s Amarillo facility remains the final assembly site for the FLRAA aircraft.' Bell declined to provide further details on the move, including on timing of the transition. 'Spirit and Bell coordinated on an agreement to transition full responsibility for the Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft fuselage to Bell,' Spirit AeroSystems spokesman Joe Buccino said. Boeing declined to comment. A source with knowledge of the program said that Spirit’s participation on the program is set to wrap up by the end of 2024, with the company poised to complete its final shipment of government property back to Bell by the end of the month. Industry sources have told Breaking Defense that several defense primes currently working with Spirit had levied concerns about the proposed acquisition by Boeing, which is currently embroiled in a production and safety crisis and taking cost cutting measures due to an ongoing strike at its Seattle-area aircraft plants. In July, sources told Breaking Defense that Bell had decided to oust Spirit AeroSystems as the provider of FLRAA’s composite-skinned aluminum fuselage after Boeing completes its $8.3 billion acquisition of Spirit, a major fuselage supplier on all Boeing commercial jetliners that was originally part of the company until being spun off in 2005. The Army announced in August that the FLRAA program had entered into its engineering and manufacturing development (EMD) phase after receiving Milestone B approval. The decision — made after a successful preliminary design review in April and a June meeting of the Army Systems Acquisition Review Council — allows the Army to exercise its first contract option for six FLRAA prototypes and moves Bell forward into the detailed design of the aircraft. The service currently plans for the first FLRAA aircraft to fly in 2026, the Army said in an August release. Low rate initial production is scheduled to start in 2028, followed by the fielding of the first batch of aircraft in 2030. Bell beat out a team of Boeing and Lockheed Martin’s Sikorsky subsidiary to win the FLRAA contract in 2022. At the time, Army officials said the contract was worth $1.3 billion but could end up being in the range of $70 billion if contract options and export opportunities emerge. Boeing’s acquisition of Spirit would have put Bell back in the position of working with its partner on the V-22 Osprey tiltrotor program. Boeing makes the fuselages for the Osprey under a 50-50 joint venture with Bell, which is responsible for wings, tail structure and rotors.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/bell-to-manufacture-flraa-fuselage-after-dumping-spirit-aerosystems-ahead-of-boeing-acquisition/	2024-10-14T05:25:16-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/Valor-pic1.jpg
Bombardier Defense – Trusted partner for deep-sensing airborne missions	A generic rendering of missionized Bombardier Challenger and Global aircraft courtesy of Bombardier Defense. The United States Army has repeatedly cited its top modernization operational priority is deep sensing in order to gain and maintain early situational awareness for decision advantage. Such capability relies upon aerial intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) technologies that enable the Army to maintain an asymmetric information advantage and more effectively adapt to the fast-changing nature of the operational environment. Deep sensing is also critical in providing ranged strike options with medium and long-range precision munitions – to overmatch adversaries, shape the battlespace, or neutralize high priority targets in increasingly complex environments at speed and scale. To achieve these objectives, the U.S. Army has contracted Bombardier Defense as the platform of choice for its High Accuracy Detection and Exploitation System (HADES) project. Working in tandem with other partners to integrate the required systems on the platform, Bombardier will be delivering a prototype airframe using the Global 6500 aircraft for this modernized ISR program. A generic rendering of a missionized Bombardier Global 6500, used by the U.S. Army in its latest program for Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) courtesy of Bombardier Defense. HADES will enhance deep sensing capabilities by deploying airborne ISR platforms. These capabilities provide increased collection capabilities to Theater Army Service Component Commanders (ASCCs), Joint partners, and allies – ultimately aligning with the 2022 National Defense Strategy (NDS) by aiding in 'building a resilient Joint Force. Previous initiatives leading into the HADES program of record include: Clients from civilian, military and government backgrounds all appreciate the customer-centric approach to Bombardier’s offerings. Both the Challenger and Global families of aircraft can be used for multi-mission, allowing for governments to make a singular acquisition to meet their diverse needs. This kind of flexibility makes Bombardier’s solutions valuable around the world. Defense procurement needs around the world have evolved significantly in the last decade, with more military agencies incorporating modern jets into their operations to maintain information advantage and more effectively adapt to the fast-changing nature of the intelligence gathering and analysis environment. Bombardier also offers maintenance support through a comprehensive aftermarket network, which offers a strategic operational advantage to governments and military agencies. The availability and versatility of skilled workers, and the accessibility of spare parts through a combination of strategically placed service centers, line maintenance stations and mobile response team trucks, play a significant role when choosing the platform that will create the fleet of tomorrow for aerial ISR missions. Flexible, Experienced and Proven Bombardier platforms are agile and rapidly reconfigurable. Bombardier leverages a team of world-class engineers in Wichita, KS, and across North America, that prides itself on being solution-oriented to tailor a platform to meet customer requirements. These capabilities are matched with continuous investment in product upgrades to ensure the reliability, availability and capability of its aircraft. The attributes that set Bombardier aircraft apart are applicable to various geographic theaters and tactical demands, including: From securing national airspace, borders and infrastructure to providing urgent humanitarian assistance or supporting mobility and sustainment needs of governments, Bombardier aircraft are built for the most demanding missions. For decades, Bombardier has provided industry-leading, curated solutions for the most demanding missions of governments and military contractors worldwide – and it will continue to do so by innovating and expanding capabilities that solidify Bombardier’s position as a global aviation leader.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/bombardier-defense-trusted-partner-for-deep-sensing-airborne-missions/	2024-10-14T05:10:52-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/Global-Challenger-Rendering.jpg
Clearing the books: Army kickstarts initiative to strip away legacy requirements	The Under Secretary of the Army, Gabe Camarillo, visits soldiers assigned to 2nd Cavalry Regiment during exercise Dragoon Ready 23 in Hohenfels, Germany on Feb. 1, 2023.(US Army/Staff Sgt. Ashley Low) AUSA 2024 — When members of the Army Requirement Oversight Council (AROC) get together, it’s typically to greenlight new weapon requirements and pave the acquisition path ahead. However, now the advisory council has a new, emerging task: stripping away old, outdated plans. 'Nothing should ever be 100 percent [set] in stone, and we should be able to pivot,' Army Under Secretary Gabe Camarillo told Breaking Defense ahead of the annual Association of the US Army conference in Washington, DC this week. 'We know how to start new programs very, very well, but we have to also learn how to pivot,' he later added. 'That will have implications over how many quantities we buy in the outyears, but I also think it will open up new opportunities for competition and tech insertion as we go through this.' That new effort — dubbed CORA, or AROC in reverse — is set up differently than the Trump era process when senior Army leaders met behind closed doors, often after hours, to rack and stack programs to free up dollars for a comprehensive, weapon modernization overhaul. That process, named after a 1980s sitcom, became known as Night Court and saw program officials defend their pots of money. Instead, the emerging AROC process is homing in on legacy system requirements across different portfolios to see where tweaks need to be made or requirements erased entirely. That could be because the requirements have been in the pipeline for long enough that they've become obsolete or new tech has emerged that could answer a requirement if it's revised or 'significantly changed,' Camarillo explained. As a broad example, he cited tactical unmanned aerial systems (UAS) requirements that were inked nearly a decade ago. 'It was when there was a very, very small market for these systems, probably not too many vendors, and probably systems that were only at one specific size,' he explained. 'Now you see just a proliferation of vendors in this space. And so, did we get that requirement right?' Since the drone market has ballooned in the intervening years, the Army went back and 'recognized that we probably needed a new, directed requirement for company level UAS' and include 'higher-end' drones for different scenarios. As a result, the service 'fundamentally changed and shifted' the requirements within that portfolio, and is on the hunt for a Future Tactical Unmanned System (FTUAS) to replace the RQ-7B Shadow. 'You can see other areas where technology has shifted pretty significantly [too] or where the threat has evolved. We would probably take a similar approach,' Camarillo said, and that could lead to a AROC change. Changing the requirements on the books isn’t just for service leaders, Army acquisition head Doug Bush told Breaking Defense during a separate interview. The process, he added, will provide the service with cover and additional information to present to lawmakers who ultimately ink the checks. 'It's healthy to go back and look at relook assumptions we made many, several years ago… and [ask] ‘Do the requirements work’ before we just arbitrarily make a program decision,' Bush said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/clearing-the-books-army-kickstarts-initiative-to-strip-away-legacy-requirements/	2024-10-14T04:00:54-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/Gabe1-scaled-e1728320871758.jpg
Boeing’s defense unit logs massive $2 billion in losses for third quarter	A Boeing KC-46A Pegasus takes off at Yokota Air Base, Japan, Oct. 25, 2018, during a system evaluation. (U.S. Air Force photo by Yasuo Osakabe) WASHINGTON — Boeing’s defense unit will take $2 billion in losses on fixed-price contracts when it reports its third quarter results later this month, the company disclosed today, bringing total defense-related charges for the company up to $3.2 billion this year. The wider company also announced plans to slash 10 percent of its total workforce. The charges to its defense arm come as the US planemaker hemorrhages money amid an ongoing strike by its Seattle-area machinists union and as it announced the conclusion of its 767 freighter production — both factors the company states contributed to losses on the T-7A trainer, MQ-25 tanker drone, KC-46 tanker and NASA’s Starliner in the most recent financial quarter. The T-7 trainer logged the largest charge, worth $900 million, due to what the company said were higher estimated costs for production in 2026 and beyond. Behind it, the KC-46 logged a $700 million loss due to Boeing’s decision to end production of the 767 freighter, the commercial aircraft on which the militarized tanker is based. The company also pointed the finger at the ongoing machinists union strike, which has paused production of commercial airplanes, such as the 767 made in the company's Seattle facilities. The company did not lay out a breakdown for the losses incurred by the MQ-25 and Starliner programs. Boeing’s defense unit expects to report $5.5 billion in revenue and declare an operating margin of negative 43 percent. The financial bleeding on in Boeing's defense unit was replicated in its commercial business, which will declare $3 billion in losses for the quarter. The company noted that these figures were 'preliminary' and could change. As a result of financial turmoil across the company, Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg said in a letter to employees that the company would lay off 10 percent of its workforce, 'including executives, managers and employees.' While Ortberg did not say how much of the layoffs would come from Boeing's defense unit, he added that he would provide 'additional oversight' of the defense business and fixed price-development programs going forward. 'In BDS [Boeing Defense Space and Security], our performance on fixed-price development programs is simply not where it needs to be,' Ortberg said in the letter, which was made public. 'We expect substantial new losses in BDS this quarter, driven by the work stoppage on commercial derivatives, continued program challenges and our decision to complete production on the 767 freighter.' Last month, Boeing announced the departure of Ted Colbert, who has led its defense unit since 2022. The planemaker has not announced a full-time successor.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/boeings-defense-unit-logs-massive-2-billion-in-losses-for-third-quarter/	2024-10-11T14:46:13-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/240913_DVIDS_kc46_japan_4866234-scaled-e1726259068659.jpg
EXCLUSIVE: L3Harris, Embraer no longer working together to pitch C-390 to US	L3Harris previously partnered with Embraer on a US version of KC-390 tanker that would have added a refueling boom to the aircraft. (L3Harris) WASHINGTON — A partnership between American defense contractor L3Harris and Brazil’s Embraer to bring the latter’s C-390 Millenium to the US market has fallen apart, the CEO of Embraer’s defense business told Breaking Defense. 'I think it’s fair to say that the L3 partnership is not there anymore for the agile tanker,' Bosco da Costa Jr. said in an interview. 'They decided not to move on [it] because of other priorities.' Unveiled in 2022 in a joint press briefing with Embraer CEO Francisco Gomes Neto and L3Harris CEO Chris Kubasik, the C-390 partnership envisioned L3Harris serving as the prime contractor for the program and providing US mission systems for the plane, including a purpose-built refueling boom that would recast the Millennium as an American KC-390. Yet in the two years since, interest from L3Harris apparently waned, and the partnership has now expired. 'I think they [L3Harris] are very in favor of the [business] case, and they would like to play [as] a major supplier in this potential business, but I think considering other priorities that they have, they decided not to move and not to invest in this partnership,' da Costa said. L3Harris declined to comment. Nevertheless, Embraer 'is completely serious' about its ambitions to become a major player in the US, whether that be as a 'prime [contractor], to be together with other companies, and even [through] M&amp;A [mergers and acquisitions],' according to da Costa. That includes potentially going it alone as a prime for an accelerated tanker program, labeled the Next Generation Air Refueling System (NGAS). Embraer responded to a recent request for information on NGAS as a potential prime for the program, but the company is exploring 'several other types of business structures' and is having conversations with several major US defense companies on partnership opportunities, da Costa said. 'We are looking for someone that could add value on our case, bring some capabilities that Embraer doesn't have,' he said. When the L3Harris partnership was announced, the Air Force was still pursuing a three-pronged refueling strategy known as KC-X, KC-Y and KC-Z. The service has now ditched that plan in favor of a potential limited buy of off-the-shelf tankers to replace aging KC-135s, which would then be followed by the NGAS tanker. RELATED: Air Force's interim tanker buy in limbo as service mulls next-gen refueler timeline The limited buy, dubbed the KC-135 Tanker Recapitalization program, has largely been viewed as a dogfight between Boeing and Airbus. But the Air Force’s shifting tanker plans have opened up an opportunity for Embraer as well in the near-term, according to Frederico Lemos, the company’s defense chief commercial officer. 'We are looking at the recap program,' Lemos said. 'And we believe that there might be a space also in the recap.' The C-390 'is a highly capable multi-role aircraft,' Tim Walton, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, said in an interview with Breaking Defense. Still, Walton noted that the aircraft would have to overcome some challenges to win over the US Air Force. On the airlift side, Walton said the Millennium would have to contend with the incumbency of the C-130J built by Lockheed Martin, which enjoys advantages like existing infrastructure and training pipelines. And on the refueling side, the C-390 has a 'relatively low fuel capacity compared to a KC-46 or many other NGAS options,' while also having a larger radar signature compared to other potential NGAS candidates, he said. 'For the Air Force to consider the C-390 or KC-390 for the KC-135 Tanker Recapitalization Program, it would likely need to revise the performance parameters it is pursuing,' Walton observed. Despite the aircraft's considerable multi-role capabilities, 'I do not think it would offload enough fuel at relevant radii to meet desired performance parameters. Still, Walton sees options for Embraer as it markets the C-390 in the US: 'That said, the C-390 could address niche mobility missions and complement the Air Force’s C-130s and C-17s,' he added. Embraer already has a significant US presence, with da Costa noting the C-390 is already compliant with the Buy America Act. But the company is looking to expand its US footprint, including by looking to establish a stateside final assembly line for the airlifter, according to da Costa. For the KC-135 recap and NGAS, da Costa emphasized that Embraer is positioning the C-390 to be ready as soon as the US would need it. That includes drawing up plans to outfit the Millennium with a boom, which he said has shown to be 'feasible' based on Embraer’s studies, though he said no production on a boom system has begun. 'What we are trying to fill is a gap that the US Air Force has now with a plane that it's ready,' da Costa said. 'So that's what we are trying to pitch, in a sense, to fill the gap now. To add capabilities now.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/exclusive-l3harris-embraer-no-longer-working-together-to-pitch-c-390-to-us/	2024-10-11T14:16:04-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/L3Harris-Embraer-Agile-Tanker-for-USAF-1-scaled-e1728679603377.jpg
‘A lot … at once’: Army cyber and network officials take stock 1 year after organizational shuffle	Gen. Ed Barker (PEO IEW&amp;S) and Mark Kitz (PEO C3N) speak on an AUSA Global Force panel in March 2024. (Photo by US Army &#8211; PEO IEW&amp;S/ Facebook) WASHINGTON — It’s been a little over a year since the Army took its three network and cyber Program Executive Offices, rearranged their teams, and emerged with two new offices, ideally set to meet the requirements of modern warfighting. In Pentagon bureaucracy terms, a year isn’t actually that long. But speaking to Breaking Defense in recent weeks, the leaders of the two offices say the reorganization has helped the service create a more holistic environment where warfighters can better communicate with each other — though not without a few bumps in the road. 'It really kind of tested a lot of our theories and a lot of our premises on our organizational agility and our talent management. It probably stressed them to the point where we realized that we're doing the right thing,' Gen. Ed Barker, program executive officer of the Program Executive Office for Intelligence, Electronic Warfare and Sensors told Breaking Defense. (As a sign of how things are still fluid, PEO C3T this week rebranded as the Program Executive Office for Command, Control and Communications-Networks, PEO C3N, which is how the office will be referred to in this story.) PEO C3N absorbed the Integrated Enterprise Networks program from PEO Enterprise and its four product management offices: base emergency communications system, global enterprise network modernization-Americas, global enterprise network modernization-OCONUS and wideband enterprise satellite systems. The office also took charge of the enterprise service’s enterprise identity, credential and access management (ICAM) and allied information technology, the latter being part of the EIS’s defensive cyber operations (DCO) portfolio. RELATED: Here’s how the Army is reorganizing its network, cyberops offices Meanwhile, the PEO IEW&amp;S took over the rest of the DCO portfolio: the technology application office, the cyber analytics and detection program and the cyber platforms and systems program. Basically, IEW&amp;S now houses all of the Army’s cyber efforts from a PEO standpoint, while C3N houses all of the Army’s network efforts. It’s a streamlining that, both men say, better reflects how the service actually operates. A year in, Mark Kitz, program executive officer of C3N, said that his office has seen real movements towards the Army’s goal of creating a unified network — breaking down the dozens of siloed legacy networks, mostly separated by tactical and enterprise portions, to create a more cohesive singular network. Or, as Kitz describes it, 'having the enterprise network and the tactical network integrated into one organization so we can gain efficiencies and deliver a better product to our army customer.' Kitz is open, however, that the direction from here is not always clear, especially when identifying and creating new opportunities to uphold this unified network. 'This vision of a unified network is very ambitious. For a very long time, the Army has been building tactical and enterprise infrastructure in two very different ways,' he said. 'And so how do we identify those opportunities? How do we identify the challenges, and how do we identify the roadblocks?' Another challenge in creating this unified network is the geographic distance between soldiers. Kitz said he is working on 'improving how my organization is geospatially dispersed, how we build a culture that incentivizes getting after one Army network,' which includes both enterprise and tactical elements. While the unified network is his major overarching focus, Kitz pointed to a number of efforts his office has helped guide over the last year that he sees as wins. Those include pushing forward on software-defined networking, where networks are put together digitally instead of relying on hardware, like switches and routers, to manage the system. 'This software-defined network capability could really be a potential game changer for not just how the enterprise solution interfaces with DISA (Defense Information Systems Agency) and the DODIN (DoD Information Network) and our network, but how tactical users can now really diversify the way they enter into the network,' Kitz said. 'As we deliver this capability, over the next year, we'll be able to integrate not just the enterprise users, but also our tactical systems, our tactical users,' he added. This should allow users to access their usual network regardless of their geographic location, he said. One other area of improvement Kitz has seen since the reorganization is with the C3N’s ICAM project, which is a capability designed to help build the Army’s unified network by creating a secure environment for authorized users to access the data they need when they need it. 'This is one of those programs where we have a separate material solution for tactical and enterprise. And so by consolidating under one organization, now we have an integrated approach on how we plan to deliver access management,' Kitz said. 'Whether that's a tactical user who may or may not have a persistent network, or an enterprise user leveraging the enterprise capabilities delivered by PEO EIS. That is one sort of example where the enterprise and tactical network are converging on a single architecture.' As the IEW&amp;S has become the PEO responsible for the Army’s entire cyber portfolio, the office has developed stronger communications with Army Cyber Command (ARCYBER) and the joint force’s Cyber Command. The IEW&amp;S was responsible for the offensive cyber operations in the service, and is now also responsible for defensive cyber operations after the reorganization. Barker added that he’s 'really realized efficiencies of having [the] offensive and defensive cyber operations under one PEO, and how that relates to our relationship with Cyber Command [and] ARCYBER as well.' The 'integration of [defensive cyber operations] is going, going really, really smooth, and they're just really part of the family now. The offense, you know, informs the defense, and defense informs offense,' he said. There was no 'terrible surprise' during the transition process, Barker said, but he acknowledged one wrinkle that was more work than expected: learning to work defensive operations with ARCYBER while CYBERCOM was also undergoing its own major effort in standing up the Joint Cyber Warfare Architecture. 'When you're juggling that level of change internally to us, that level of change — when it comes to Cyber Command and bracing their new authorities, and, oh, by the way, operating in the cyberspace, both from an offensive and defensive standpoint, and the pace associated with the threat in those spaces — it is dynamic,' Barker said. Still, aside from the stress it put on the system, Barker sees positives from the relationship between his PEO shop and CYBERCOM, and the fact they went through a transition together. 'We've been able to help Cyber Command as they've kind of navigated this new mission and growth and what they want things to look like when it comes to the different joint capabilities that they have to provide,' Barker said. 'Then the other part of that is that continued relationship with Army Cyber because while Cyber Command is standing up, there's going to be, think of it in terms of putting a ‘j’ for ‘joint’ in front of, you know, a lot of programs, like the joint development environment and things like that.' Barker said as the Army moves forward in adopting its unified network plan and its Next Generation Command and Control initiative — the service’s plan to create an integrated C2 structure focusing on data centricity 'at every echelon,' which will serve as the data transport portion of the unified network — his office and the C3N must stay in constant communication with each other. 'Anything we do on this, on the cyber, on the defensive cyber front, specifically, is tightly linked with PEO C3N,' Barker said. He said that IEW&amp;S and C3N are 'joined at the hip when it comes to making sure that anything we're doing in, kind of, the day-to-day space matches to where they need to go from a future standpoint.' Kitz echoed the importance of this relationship between the two offices, but also made the bigger point of being in close contact with other forces as well, especially when it comes to standing up the DoD’s sprawling Combined Joint All-Domain Command and Control (CJADC2) program, which works to create an all-seeing, all-connected battle network. 'I have very close relationships with the Navy and the Air Force, and specifically on how we interoperate data. How are we sharing data? How are we defining how we're going to share data? Because in the end, that network is going to provide a pathway, but if I get a pathway to a data that I can't use or consume, that's meaningless, right?' Kitz said. 'So really trying to foster these joint relationships between the PEOs and CDAO (Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office) has become a big part of this conversation. How do I meaningfully understand the situation between the joint forces? So the PEOs are really trying to define and ensure that we can interoperate,' he added.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/a-lot-at-once-army-cyber-and-network-officials-take-stock-1-year-after-organizational-shuffle/	2024-10-11T13:06:35-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/Kitz_Barker_Army_Facebook-e1728670855434.jpg
Canada, UK collaborate on nanosat for South Pole space monitoring	The Little Innovator in Space Situational Awareness (LISSA), will incorporate as its primary payload a UK experimental short wave infrared (SWIR) camera. It will be deployed from Canada's Redwing demonstration satellite designed to keep tabs on space objects over the South Pole. (Image: UK Defence Science and Technology Laboratory) WASHINGTON — The UK and Canadian defense ministries are planning a joint on-orbit demonstration to keep eyes on satellites and space junk whizzing over the South Pole as part of an ongoing Canadian pilot project to improve space domain awareness. 'Space objects over the Earth’s South Pole is less monitored than the North Pole and the mission will inform future space surveillance considerations based on findings from the mission,' according to a UK government press release Thursday. The UK's Defence Science and Technology Laboratory, on behalf of the Ministry of Defence (MoD) and UK Space Command, will contribute an experimental sensor package to the 'Redwing' project, managed by Canada's defense research organization, Defence Research and Development Canada (DRDC), the release said. 'This international research cooperation between the countries provides the opportunity for joint collaboration and for developing prototype infrastructure and data processing architecture,' the UK release said. Redwing was initiated in March 2023 with a $15.8 million CAD ($11.7 million USD) contract to a consortium led by Magellan Aerospace, headquartered in Winnipeg. The project expects to launch a small satellite in 2027 to an orbit around the North and South poles of about 575 kilometers above the Earth’s surface. The project now has exercised a 'contract option to add a $900,000 subsatellite to the Redwing project &#8230; known as Little Innovator in Space Situational Awareness (LISSA),' the DRDC's Thursday press release explained. LISSA, a nanosat about the size of a cereal box, will be deployed after Redwing is in orbit to fly 'in tandem' with it at about 200 kilometers apart carrying the UK's sensor payload, the UK government release said. The payload is a short-wave infrared (SWIR) camera, Canada's press release explained, that 'records outside the visible light spectrum and will address the technical challenge of reflected light from clouds and ice in the South Pole region during the Antarctic summer. 'Together they will test how to provide better space domain awareness with a focus on mega-constellations, which orbit at less than 2,000 km altitude. However, Redwing will also be capable of monitoring objects in altitudes approaching the Earth’s moon, known as cis-lunar orbits, at roughly 380,000 km,' it added. US Space Command long has been interested in improving space monitoring of the Southern Hemisphere, where the US military has few radars or telescopes. It also has been increasingly interested in keeping eyes on space activities in the vast region of space between the Earth and the Moon, in large part due to concern about China's lunar ambitions.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/canada-uk-collaborate-on-nanosat-for-south-pole-space-monitoring/	2024-10-11T12:49:28-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-11-at-3.07.00 PM-e1728674161860.png
Tiltrotor: The need for speed & range in response to global threats	V280-Valor (photo courtesy of Bell) The United States (U.S.) Army recently decided to modernize its medium vertical lift fleet with the selection of Bell’s V-280 Valor, a next generation tiltrotor incorporating over 70 years of experience and nearly 800,000 operating hours with tiltrotor. The U.S. Army was part of early tiltrotor developmental programs but decided it was not the right solution at the time. The time is now for the U.S. Army, as witnessed by its approval of the FLRAA Milestone B Acquisition Decision Memorandum. This next generation weapon system is a leap in technology, flying at twice the range and twice the speed of current U.S. Army assets and includes a modular open system approach (MOSA) giving it unmatched flexibility for future mission scenarios. It will lead to a significant revolution in how the U.S. Army conducts missions, enhance its global responsiveness, and reduce deployment timelines and complexity. It will also outpace any vertical lift capabilities of the U.S. Army’s allies and partners. The tiltrotor provides the combination of range, speed, and payload of an airplane, while combining the runway independent characteristics of a helicopter. It can deploy by, and operate from, naval vessels, and is fully capable of self-deployment. It also gives the commander a wide range of flexibility since there is reduced reliance on infrastructure and can be deployed to the point of need in a short period of time, as well as to austere and remote locations from which forces would not normally operate. Such a capability is well placed for operations in locations such as the Indo-Pacific, the Arctic, Europe, and the Mediterranean with reach into the Sahel and the Middle East. With its range and speed, the tiltrotor enables operations from a point of relative sanctuary in dispersed locations, safe from most long-range fires and threats that make current assets vulnerable. This is critical in today’s operational environment where ISR is pervasive, and surprise is elusive. Dispersion enables the commander to think differently and to employ forces from multiple locations and converge on the objective – operational flexibility. This is revolutionary maneuver. It’s about surprise and initiative, and the ability to move people and material flexibly around the battlefield. The U.S. Army has begun the process to redefine its doctrine, tactics, techniques, and procedures as it prepares to field its own tiltrotor capability. The result will enable commanders to do things much differently than in the past, enabling them to think and operate differently, to get inside of adversaries’ decision cycle. It will lead to expanded strategic choices and enhanced competitive advantages. It is also going to have an impact on when, how, and if the U.S. Army operates with its allies and partners unless they jump on the leap-in-capability bandwagon. Why It Matters In the Pacific, the United States and its allies and partners may need to compete with increasingly capable peer and near-peer competitors, leading to changes in operational approaches. This includes potentially operating from dispersed locations over vast distances. In Europe, NATO’s eastern flank includes battle groups from Estonia down to Bulgaria and crosses multiple borders; reinforcing them in a crisis will be challenging. NATO’s border with Russia has doubled since Finland joined the Alliance. The Mediterranean also creates distance challenges that expand into the Sahel and the Middle East. The tiltrotor changes the geometry of the battlefield. It provides the operational reach, responsiveness, and flexibility to the commander to employ forces at distance, speed, and minimize risk. It increases the depth from which maritime and marine forces can conduct littoral operations. It creates strategic unpredictability, offers operational flexibility, and creates decision dilemmas for the adversary, enhancing the overall deterrence value. Its leap-ahead capability is well-suited for the increased complexity in today and tomorrow’s global operating environment. V280-Valor (photo courtesy of Bell) There is, however, an opportunity to mitigate this imminent capability gap. Many Allies and partners are approaching a window to modernize medium vertical lift fleets. At the same time, there is an increased focus on defense and associated budgets. This confluence of aging fleets and rising budgets creates an opportunity for allies and partners to keep pace with the U.S. Army as it makes the capability leap with a tiltrotor. Given increasing competition in the Pacific and the pace of capability development among peer and near-peer competitors, expanding the pool of tiltrotor operators enables interoperability among the joint force. It also enhances the prospects for interchangeability – a growing buzzword in NATO and like-minded allied circles related to interoperability that highlights, inter alia, the ability to apply common sustainment practices and pooling and sharing of supply chains and logistics. It additionally could create savings over the long term in acquisition and sustainment costs. The United States and its allies and partners have acknowledged that no single nation can win the next major conflict alone. The coalitions of the willing must be supplanted by the coalitions of necessity to confront adversaries’ vast and growing capabilities. Tiltrotors have already revolutionized the way the U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Air Force Special Operations operate, and the U.S. Navy has revolutionized the way it operates with the recent introduction of tiltrotor and continues to expand its application. As the U.S. Army begins fielding a tiltrotor, air assault missions as we have known them, and other applications yet to be discovered, will change significantly. If the U.S. Army wants to maintain the competitive edge over its adversaries, it needs its allies and partners. The Honorable Doug Bush, Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics and Technology, noted in 2022, 'Technological cooperation. . .improves our ability to collectively modernize and increase interoperability ensuring we can train and fight alongside our allies and partners more effectively and efficiently.' The U.S. Army’s allies and partners need to take note and ensure that they are not left behind as it fields an advanced tiltrotor, and work with the U.S. Army as it creates the conditions to make that possible.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/tiltrotor-the-need-for-speed-range-in-response-to-global-threats/	2024-10-11T11:30:23-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/cruise-low-water-scaled.jpg
Army eyeing commercial drones as Shadow ‘gap’ filler	Textron's Shadow RQ-7B V2 Block III (Photo courtesy of Textron) AUSA 2024 — The US Army’s decision to shelve its entire RQ-7B Shadow fleet has created a capability gap for soldiers that previously relied on those drones for reconnaissance and surveillance operations. And although the service is eyeing a developmental new platform to get into soldiers’ hands starting in late 2027, that’s simply too long to wait so it's turning to commercially available options, according to Col. Nick Ryan, the director of the Army Capability Manager for Unmanned Aircraft Systems. 'There's a gap where our units have no assets and no capability to train with right now, to learn with, to build TTPs [tactics, techniques, and procedures] with,' Ryan told Breaking Defense ahead of this year’s Association of the US Army conference. 'We started thinking outside the box about what we can do to help with this.' Army leaders announced their Shadow divestiture plan in early February as part of a larger aviation shakeup. By the end of September, all of those drones had been removed from units, according to Ryan. The longer-term plan is to field a new Future Tactical Uncrewed Aircraft System (FTUAS) at the brigade level and two companies — Griffon Aerospace and Textron Systems — are currently competing for that coveted contract. If that competition stays on track, the Army is expected to crown a winner later this fiscal year and begin receiving the new drones towards the end of fiscal 2027. According to Ryan, that plan is a problem for soldiers who need an interim capability now, and emergent operational need statements have been coming in from an array of units including Multi-Domain Task Forces in both the Indo-Pacific and Europe. Part of the plan forward, at least in part, is to utilize the Defense Innovation Unit’s (DIU’s) Blue UAS List — an initiative designed to help the services more quickly select commercial systems that are fully free of Chinese parts. In theory, if a drone is on the approved list, a unit can buy it. But when the Army turned to that list earlier this year, none of the drones on it would meet the capability gap created by Shadow’s divestiture, so Ryan and others worked with DIU on plans for the Blue UAS List refresh. 'We probably can't put something as large as a Shadow on the DIU Blue List, like a Group 3 that weighs a couple thousand pounds, because that would probably be … over $350,000,' Ryan said. Instead, potential options may be in the Group 2 range, weighing in at less than 55 pounds, with the ability to fly for more than four hours at ranges greater than six miles out, see in both day and night conditions, and possibly the ability to laser designate. 'That’s just enough to fill the gap for the time being, to allow units to at least have something to train with, which is better than the nothing they have right now,' Ryan explained. The service is also eagerly eyeing the addition of first-person view drones for the squad and platoon level, he added. After DIU put out the Blue List refresh call earlier this year, 360 proposals came in from 220 companies for both platform and supporting tech options, Trent Emeneker, the DIU Blue UAS program manager and contractor, told Breaking Defense during a recent interview. That list has now been whittled down to 36 flying platforms from approximately 15 vendors, and those capabilities are bound for an early November testing at the Marine Corps’s 29 Palms in Southern California. After the drones take to the air, they will be physically torn apart to inspect all the components, Emeneker explained. And if parts need to be swapped out, the companies will be given that option. By early December, Emeneker predicts that drones making the final cut will begin appearing on that Blue List and will be continually added on a rolling basis. By the end of February, he added, drones not being picked up by the services will be removed from the list. 'We will list things as soon as we can, we're not going to have end users wait, we don't want to also make the companies wait,' Emeneker said. In the meantime, officials from Army Aviation and Missile Command and Army Combat Capabilities Development Command will be working on securing airworthiness releases so that as soon as suitable drones are officially added to the list, be it a fill in for the Shadow mission or a first-person view drone, the service can make recommendations to units. 'If we can get more systems available that are NDAA-compliant, that the army is actually interested in buying … and Congress provides the funds for the units, then the units will absolutely go there and start buying these things,' Ryan said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/army-eyeing-commercial-drones-as-shadow-gap-filler/	2024-10-11T11:18:10-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/Textron_ShadowIII_Utah-4404-2-e1663608557790.jpg
GPS shows some Lebanese citizens in Jordan, likely result of combat-related ‘spoofing’: Experts	A phone belonging to a Lebanese citizen shows the person in Jordan, rather than Beirut. (Breaking Defense) BEIRUT — When she got in her car to go to run an errand earlier this week, a Beirut mother of two pulled up her phone as she always did to use GPS, only to find out to her surprise that, at least according to her phone, she was actually in Jordan, 130 miles to the south. On another incident earlier this month, a group of mothers taking their daughters to a birthday in Bqenneya, just outside Beirut, saw that their route to party would take them not the few minutes they expected, but five hours. They realized their phones, too, thought they were in Jordan. The incidents have been reported in and around Beirut, as well as elsewhere in the country like Mount Lebanon, Keserwan and Matn. It has apparently affected phones but also tablets and AirPods. The Lebanese telecom authority did not respond to a request for comment for this report. Freddy Khoueiry, global security analyst for the Middle East and North Africa at the RANE Network, suspects Israel is behind the technological assault. 'In this case, the Israelis are likely broadcasting these fake signals with higher strength than genuine GPS signals, causing the map application to place you in a completely incorrect location,' he told Breaking Defense. Khoueiry said that the real target is likely weapons systems and navigational tools used by combatants, as the spoofing could mislead navigation systems in missiles and drones resulting 'in diverted or misdirected operations, causing units to navigate incorrectly, and compromising mission success by making assets appear in the wrong places or sending them into hostile or restricted areas.' Clayton Swope of the Center for Strategic and International Studies agreed that it is 'almost certainly at attempt to confuse GPS-guided weapons, like drones and missiles,' but he suggested there's no certainty it's the Israelis. 'Since neither Israel, Hezbollah, nor Iran likely wants their munitions hitting anything in Jordan, spoofing GPS so that weapons think they are near [Jordanian capital] Amman undermines their effectiveness,' said Swope, deputy director of aerospace security project at CSIS. 'Israel, Hezbollah, and Iran have reasons to confuse GPS-guided weapons used by their adversaries in the region, and any of them could be behind these incidents.' RELATED: After shooting down Iranian munitions, Jordan defiant in uncomfortable spotlight Swope said there's evidence Iran has previously spoofed GPS signals near the Iran-Iraq border and said he 'would not be surprised if Iran shared that technology with Hezbollah.' 'Using GPS spoofing does not seem to have an escalatory effect, so it is a tool Iran could share and Hezbollah could use without risk of escalation,' he said. The GPS spoofing, and jamming in which the signal is disrupted altogether, is not new in Lebanon. The electronic attacks have affected commercial flights in the country since October 2023, which pushed the Lebanese government to file a complaint against Israel to UN.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/gps-shows-some-lebanese-citizens-in-jordan-likely-result-of-combat-related-spoofing-experts/	2024-10-11T10:22:18-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/241011_gps_jamming_lebanon.png
Army shifting S-MET work over to new acquisition shop	US Army soldiers with the 101st Airborne Division use SMETs during a recent training exercise. (Ashely Roque/Breaking Defense) AUSA 2024 — As one US Army Program Executive Office prepares to pare down the number of commercial vendors vying for a ground autonomy contract, it is also shedding a separate robotic program — the Squad Maneuver Equipment Transport, or S-MET. The service currently has a host of robotic programs in various stages of development spread across different offices. Inside the the Program Executive Office for Combat Support and Combat Service Support (PEO CS&amp;CSS), for example, the team is managing the acquisition of the S-MET robotic mule, while also running the Ground Expeditionary Autonomy Retrofit Systems (GEARS) competition — an initiative to field self-driving trucks. But starting next month, PEO Ground Combat Systems will take over the S-MET reins when the program is handed over to the Robotic Combat Vehicle product manager. 'This transition combines the two [Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology] ground maneuver robotic programs under a single program management office to gain efficiencies in acquisition planning that will soon include modular mission payload integration onto both the RCV and S-MET platforms,' Army spokeswoman Rae Higgins wrote in an email to Breaking Defense. According to Higgins, shifting who is in charge of S-MET is envisioned as a way to better streamline efforts with a host of other offices, including the Army’s Combat Capabilities Development Command’s (DEVCOM’s) Ground Vehicle Systems Center. DEVCOM, for example, is currently internally developing an autonomy package previously known as the Robotic Technology Kernel (RTK) but recently rebranded as Army Robotic Common Software (ARCS). That autonomy work is currently billed as a centerpiece for RCV autonomy plans, and moving S-MET over to the same team could build off that work. But while S-MET Inc I acquisition and the ongoing S-MET Inc II competition are moving out, Higgens said the PEO CS&amp;CSS shop is holding on to GEARS development and in the process of evaluating three vendors’ prototypes — Carnegie Robotics, Forterra and Neya Systems. By the end of the year, she said, the trio will be pared back to two vendors for phase II testing and evaluation, running through the end of September 2025. Then in fiscal 2026, the Army will kickstart phase III by crowning an ultimate victor and potentially awarding a contract for autonomy platform integration on up to 41 Palletized Load System trucks.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/army-shifting-s-met-work-over-to-new-acquisition-shop/	2024-10-11T09:04:48-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/IMG_6862-scaled-e1725888049132.jpg
Rafael rolls out Lite Beam laser, Trophy updates to protect vehicles from drone threats	Rafael's Lite Beam system is shown on top of a ground vehicle. (Rafael) Jerusalem — Israel’s Rafael Advanced Defense Systems this week is introducing its new Lite Beam laser air defense system to counter drone threats, as well as updated capabilities for its Trophy active protection system to counter aerial threats, such as those posed by UAVs whose munitions threaten vehicles from above. The more eye-catching of the two systems is Lite Beam, which may be best thought of as a miniature version of the Iron Beam anti-rocket system Rafael has been developing for years. The system has been reported to have a range of around 2,000 meters, and is made up of a 10 kW laser. Many smaller commercially available quadcopters or similar types of drones fly at altitudes in ranges of a few hundred meters to 5,000 meters, but of course if a loitering munition or kamikaze drone is incoming, the distance would close quickly. Laser defensive systems have some natural challenges, including the need to stay on target long enough for the beam to penetrate the outside of the incoming system. As a result, the company says it has combined Lite Beam with its Samson 30mm Remote Weapon Station (RWS), mounted on a four-wheeled platform. (The 30mm Samson has previously been featured on a Boxer by Rafael’s Pearson subsidiary in 2023. This could illustrate the possible use of the Lite Beam and Samson combination on platforms such as the Boxer.) That combo would provide flexible and mobile force protection for infantry or vehicle-borne forces, providing multiple options to hard-kill against drones. Or, as the company put it, 'These solutions provide maneuvering forces with robust force protection and flexibility against a wide range of airborne threats, including UAVs.' However, Rafael has not said if this system is already operational. For its part, Trophy has been operational and combat proven on Israel Defense Forces Merkava tanks since 2011. The system is also used on the Abrams tanks in the US and was recently chosen for use on Leopard 2 tanks in Germany and Norway. In the past, Trophy has focused on threats from ATGMs and RPGs, which largely attack the vehicle from the sides. The new updates will allow the system to counter more aerial threats from above, which is increasingly the way drones and loitering munitions attack ground vehicles. The updated capabilities of the system come out of real-world application from a year of war in Gaza, where the system has been deployed on hundreds of platforms and has seen its most intense combat historically. The threat of drones and UAVs using munitions that strike from above has been a staple of Hamas attacks, to the point that some Israeli tanks were equipped with temporary ad-hoc 'pergola' cages above them during the Gaza conflict to keep operators safe. While those temporary solutions were largely effective, a more systematic solution is required. The company says that the Trophy system 'has successfully neutralized airborne targets such as anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs), rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs), and UAVs, thus enhancing the survivability of armored vehicles.' In addition, the company adds that it will showcase its 'unique modular Counter-Unmanned Aerial Systems (C-UAS) capabilities, combining advanced detection and interception technologies.' Rafael noted in its statement that its 'cutting-edge technology is operational on over a dozen platforms worldwide, including Armored Personnel Carriers (APCs), Armored Fighting Vehicles (AFVs), and Main Battle Tanks (MBTs). It has consistently demonstrated its adaptability and reliability in complex combat scenarios, providing comprehensive protection for vehicles and crews.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/rafael-rolls-out-lite-beam-laser-trophy-updates-to-protect-vehicles-from-drone-threats/	2024-10-11T08:02:45-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/LITE-BEAM-.jpg
Heading into AUSA 2024: What to know [VIDEO]	WASHIGNTON — The nation's capital is going through its first cold snap of the year, but inside the Walter E. Washington Convention Center next week things will be plenty hot — if you're interested in the US Army, at least. That's right, it's time once again for the annual Association of the US Army (AUSA) conference, the largest gathering of industry and leaders from the defense community in the United States. And to let you know what to keep an eye out for this year, Breaking Defense Editor-in-Chief Aaron Mehta and Senior Reporter Ashley Roque are here to help. In the video above, the two talk about the trends they'll be keeping an eye on and what news they expect to hear. The Breaking Defense team will be at AUSA in force and has already started out coverage, which you can find by clicking here. Make sure to check back early and often as AUSA gets underway.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/what-to-know-ahead-of-this-years-ausa-conference-video/	2024-10-11T07:02:21-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/10/231009_soldier_mascot_MEHTA.jpg
CMMC 2.0 final rule released: New compliance standards set to begin next year	Seal of the Pentagon on display at the Pentagon visitor center. (Photo by Trevor RaneyDigital Media Division) WASHINGTON — The final rule for the long-awaited Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) 2.0, which sets new standards for contractors who handle controlled unclassified information (CIU), was released today for public inspection and will hit the federal register on Oct. 15. Starting in 2025, the Department of Defense will begin to implement its requirement that all defense contractors be CMMC compliant at the time a contract is awarded. However, in order to avoid a scramble to meet the new regulations with little notice, those requirements will become mandatory after a three-year phase-in period. 'The DoD’s follow-on Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) rule change to contractually implement the CMMC Program will be published in early to mid-2025,' a DoD press release said. The main change from CMMC 1.0 to 2.0 is that CMMC 1.0 had a five-level scale for compliance, while CMMC 2.0 has a three-level scale. Additionally, a third-party assessment is being introduced depending on the level of CUI a contractor handles. Contractors at Level 1, who handle 'basic' protection of CUI and some contractors at Level 2 who handle 'general' CUI protection can undergo self-assessments to ensure they are CMMC compliant. The remaining contractors who classify as Level 2 and all Level 3 contractors have to undergo a third-party assessment. Additionally, the new rule also 'clearly identifies' all 24 security controls from NIST SP 800-172 requirements mandated for CMMC Level 3 certification. A recent study reported by Breaking Defense showed that there was a notable discrepancy between companies who completed self-assessments and those who obtained third-party assessments: only 4 percent of respondents were actually CMMC compliant based on third-party assessments, but 75 percent thought they were based on self-assessments. Furthermore, today's release confirmed that contractors have to adhere to controls set by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-171. 'CMMC provides the tools to hold accountable entities or individuals that put U.S. information or systems at risk by knowingly misrepresenting their cybersecurity practices or protocols, or knowingly violating obligations to monitor and report cybersecurity incidents and breaches,' the press release stated. The CMMC program 'implements an annual affirmation requirement that is a key element for monitoring and enforcing accountability of a company’s cybersecurity status.' Officials have been teasing CMMC 2.0 since November 2019 as an updated version of CMMC 1.0. The new model was designed to reduce complexity by eliminating unique processes and security practices that industry sees as redundant and costly, David McKeown, Deputy Chief Information Officer for Cybersecurity and Senior Information Security Officer at the Department of Defense. said back in June.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/cmmc-2-0-final-rule-released-new-compliance-standards-set-to-begin-next-year/	2024-10-11T05:45:50-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/8605018-scaled.jpg
There’s a solution to the Army’s enduring gap in its extended-range artillery fire	It’s not often that anyone would think of the U.S. as being outgunned in this day and age, but in the realm of artillery it’s likely true. While most NATO countries, much of Europe, and near-peer adversaries like Russia and China went to longer L52 cannon barrels years ago that provide greater range, the U.S. Army still uses and only manufactures the smaller L39 barrel that provides what can only be called 'last-generation' capability for 155mm field guns. Download this Game Changer article to read how the DoD's artillery gap can be addressed with a system in production today that can also be manufactured in the U.S.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/theres-a-solution-to-the-armys-enduring-gap-in-its-extended-range-artillery-fire/	2024-10-11T05:28:31-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/Rheinmetall-gamechanger-Artillery-Featured-Image-1.png
Eyeing Australia’s missile money pot, Anduril aims to join solid rocket motor market Down Under	Mulwala site in 2013. This is the only plant in Australia where explosives and propellants are made today. (Australian National Audit Office) SYDNEY — The Australian arm of American defense startup Anduril is hoping Canberra's push for sovereign defense production capability and plans to buy large amounts of long-range precision munitions may help it win a contract to build a brand new solid rocket motor facility using advanced technology. There's a large pile of money to be tapped since Australia has committed up to $21 billion AUD ($14.1 billion USD) for what it's calling the Guided Weapons and Explosive Ordnance Enterprise (GWEO) over the next decade, and rocket motors are a key part of that enterprise. There's a wide array of platforms that Australia either owns or plans to buy, including Evolved Seasparrow (ESSM), the SM-2 (already in the inventory) and the SM-6 for the Navy, the Sidewinder (AIM-9X) and AAMRAM for the Air Force, and Norwegian Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System (NASAMS), and two missiles that can be fired from HIMARS mobile launchers, Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) and PRSM (Precision Strike Missiles) for the Army. 'Having a manufacturing complex in Australia will enable production of solid rocket motors for ourselves, firstly and then ultimately, from an export perspective, to our allies and partners around the world. And there is, at the moment, an inability to meet that demand,' David Goodrich, Anduril Australia's CEO, told Breaking Defense. Australia has a request for information out to industry for solid rocket motor production, so this competition is in the early stages. The person behind Anduril's solid rocket motor enterprise, Brielle Terry, has been here for a week-and-a-half, immersing herself in Australia's unique military and procurement culture. She said the work the company has done in Mississippi setting up their first solid rocket motor plant should be replicable here. 'So we have shovels in the ground. We've got equipment that we've had several years on order, and designs, form, fit and function bespoke for our full-rate production capabilities. All that's coming together,' she told Breaking Defense in an interview, referring to the Mississippi facility, an expansion of which was announced in June. Anduril's foray into solid rocket motor production in the Lucky Country joins Lockheed Martin Australia and Thales Australia, who signed a teaming agreement on Sept. 11 to pursue 'development and production of solid rocket motors for the Australian market,' a joint statement said. The two companies plan to use the existing facilities for production of propellants and munitions at Mulwala in New South Wales and Benalla in Victoria. Thales manages the sites. In an interesting tidbit in that joint statement, the companies say they want to build a plant here 'that is globally competitive and may include the domestic manufacture of SRMs [solid rocket motors] ranging from simple rockets to large, complex strategic motors.' Lockheed already has related business here, as its GMLRS will be built in Australia from 2025, which the Australian Defense Ministry says will be 'an important first step towards establishing domestic missile manufacturing on a larger scale. It will facilitate the transfer of technical data from the United States, establish processes for engineering certification, and begin to build the technical skills of an Australian workforce.' In addition to the team of Lockheed and Thales, NIOA, the Australian privately owned munitions company, is interested in moving into the SRM market, as is Northrop Grumman, the world's largest maker of such motors. Northrop told Defense News recently they have been working for three years to get ready for entry into the market here. Terry said Anduril hopes to lean on tech to push their facility ahead, pointing to the company's Mississippi Solid Rocket Motor Complex as an example. 'So right now, if you look at what is being done in the industry, it's a blast from the past of the 1950s and 1960s technology, which was state-of-the-art at that time. But as you know, with qualification of weapon systems, once you have a qualified system, it's very hard to change the manufacturing line,' Terry said. 'And unfortunately, that means that many of the practices that are found in the United States, as well as here in Mulwala and Benalla, are, you know, still baselined in those 1950s and 1960s technologies. But we've been really looking at automation, increases in quality and safety and keeping humans out of the loop in in very critical quality and and hazardous operations, and using robotics and automation in order to do those.' The combination of building and expanding the new American plant and investing in long-lead items for a possible Australian factory means that 'we feel like we're in a very good place to basically copy and paste everything here that we've been doing in coastal Mississippi,' Terry added. Terry and Goodrich said that the company's tech should allow them to quickly scale up production for either the domestic or export markets when needed without having to expand the size of the facility because of improved efficiency. The smaller footprint of the more efficient plant means they could build in new locations, if the Australian federal and state governments approve. And the company has been scouting other sites than the existing pair, they said. The final cherry on top of the Anduril pitch is a new solid rocket fuel in development, called ALITEC, which Terry claims will 'bring the largest change in performance to the solid rocket motor industry that we've seen in our lifetimes since 1954 when the existing propellant was manufactured.' The new fuel uses lessons learned from the automobile battery industry, uses an aluminum lithium alloy and could boost GMLRS' range by more than 40 percent, she said. The fuel is not ready for use yet, but Terry said 'we're looking for a fieldable solution next calendar year.' The Australian plant could produce both existing fuel and ALITEC.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/eyeing-australias-missile-money-pot-anduril-aims-to-join-solid-rocket-motor-market-down-under/	2024-10-10T23:33:15-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/Mulwala-Site-in-2013-e1664978071869.jpeg
Secretive space plane X-37B to test ‘first of a kind’ maneuvers for shifting orbits	Artist rendering of the X-37B conducting an aerobraking maneuver using the drag of Earth’s atmosphere. (Courtesy graphic by Boeing Space) WASHINGTON — The Space Force's X-37B experimental spacecraft is about to begin taking a series of 'novel maneuvers' to safely dispose of its service module that carries extra payloads, the service announced today in a rare public statement about the activities of the mysterious spaceplane. 'The X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle (OTV-7) will begin executing a series of novel maneuvers, called aerobraking, to change its orbit around Earth and safely dispose of its service module components in accordance with recognized standards for space debris mitigation,' the Space Force said. Aerobraking uses the drag of Earth's atmosphere to slow a spacecraft and allow it to move into a lower orbit without relying solely on firing its propulsion engines, in essence making a series of orbits that look like a spiral to achieve a lower orbit. (Think about those spiral wishing wells that used to populate shopping mall corridors, where a coin put on the top surface spirals its way down into a small hole and plonks into a collection box.) The maneuver 'enables the spacecraft to change orbits while expending minimal fuel,' the Space Force release said. The X-37B OTV-7 was launched into highly elliptical orbit (HEO) on Dec. 28, 2023 to conduct a number of tests, described by the Space Force at the time as including 'operating the reusable spaceplane in new orbital regimes, experimenting with future space domain awareness technologies, and investigating the radiation effects on materials provided by NASA.' Earlier missions took place in low Earth orbit (LEO). 'Once the aerobrake maneuver is complete, the X-37B will resume its test and experimentation objectives until they are accomplished,' the Space Force said. Asked about the specific trajectory of the maneuvers, a Space Force spokesperson declined to give details. To safely deorbit, however, the service module would need to be placed in LEO at a low enough altitude to allow it to eventually fall into the Earth's atmosphere due to drag. Current US debris mitigation standards call for defunct spacecraft in lower orbits to be stationed where they will deorbit within 25 years, although the Federal Communications Commission is requiring companies to reduce that time to five years. And aerobraking would allow the spaceplane to efficiently move from HEO to a stable LEO position to eject the service module, which is attached to the back of the X-37B to provide more cargo space. The module would then burn up in the atmosphere. In its previous mission, the reusable space plane simply jettisoned the module as itself began its de-orbit maneuvers to land safely. Thus, it is the maneuvering that is the new element of the spaceplane's recent activities. 'This first of a kind maneuver from the X-37B is an incredibly important milestone for the United States Space Force as we seek to expand our aptitude and ability to perform in this challenging domain,' said Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman in the service press release. US Space Command has been clamoring for new technology to enable 'dynamic space operations,' which include 'sustained' maneuvering that doesn't eat up fuel to allow US military spacecraft and satellites to outrun suspect adversary satellites — or potentially be able to chase those suspect birds down both to assess any threats they pose and possibly take action to neutralize them. The Defense Department has been coy about X-37B's missions, capabilities and whereabouts when on orbit since taking the space plane program over from NASA in 2006 — and the robotic craft long has been the subject of speculation, including by Russia and China, that it in reality is an on-orbit weapons platform. According to Secure World Foundation's latest 'Global Counterspace Capabilities' report [PDF], that speculation was fueled in recent years by the October 2023 release of the Space Force's first official painting, which showed a military space plane described only as a 'futuristic intercept vehicle' getting ready to engage with an enemy satellite. At the time, the service said the painting was strictly a result of the artist's imagination. Low-cost maneuvers such as aerobraking could be one method of doing the job of approaching adversary sats — although rather slowly. While the X-37B program has been managed since 2010 by the Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office, Space Force's Delta 9 now responsible for oversight of X-37B's on-orbit operations. Delta 9, according to the service's website, conducts 'protect and defend operations and providing national decision authorities with response options to deter and, when necessary, defeat orbital threats' and preparing Guardians for 'orbital warfare.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/secretive-space-plane-x-37b-to-test-first-of-a-kind-maneuvers-for-shifting-orbits/	2024-10-10T14:02:55-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/X-37B-aerobrakes-scaled.jpeg
Driverless systems are ready for the next gear	Remotely Operated Ground Unit for Expeditionary (ROGUE) &#8211; Fires vehicle with Forterra’s self-driving system called AutoDrive navigates off-road terrain. (Photo courtesy of Forterra) Marines and Soldiers operating manned missile batteries are vulnerable to counter-battery fire once they fire their systems, which are highly visible to enemy sensors. Autonomous, driverless systems can counter this threat, which is multidimensional. For example, an enemy warship with advanced sensors can quickly identify the threat track of an anti-ship ballistic missile and return fire. Or it can be as simple as a first-person-view quadcopter transmitting the position of a missile battery back to an adversary for counter fire. 'Counter-battery fire is a real problem,' said Scott Sanders, former Marine Special Operations Officer and chief growth officer for Forterra. 'I would not want to be next to anything that fires a weapon system in modern combat like a HIMARS battery or anti-ship missile. 'If you don’t move fast enough and end up taking counter-battery fire from a ship, you’ve lost not only millions of dollars in hardware but the Marines who are in it and who will be much harder to replace than hardware. It would be huge to get humans away from those vehicles and platforms.' In those very real scenarios, what’s needed are mobile launch systems that can fire and actually be on-the-move even before a Navy/Marine Corps Expeditionary Ship Interdiction System (NMESIS) missile, for example, strikes its target. Field-based artillery teams operating those systems are already trained like NASCAR pit crews. However, our adversaries’ advanced capabilities in the electromagnetic spectrum still make them vulnerable and targets before they can get away. The solution is bringing autonomy to those platforms so they can maneuver and fire faster than any crewed system could, while keeping operators safe at standoff distances. Sanders said it simply: 'Robots can displace faster and there is less risk to force if they are hit by enemy fire.' In addition to the life-saving impact of standoff capability, autonomous systems address multiple use cases related to: counterterrorism and counterinsurgency; search and rescue; route clearance; logistics and supply; explosives ordnance disposal; surveillance and reconnaissance; urban warfare; critical infrastructure and base protection; chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear (CBRN) threats; anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) environments; and border security. The use cases for autonomy also extend to all systems that emit electronic signatures like radar and other sensors that can be detected. There’s a reason the AGM-88 HARM (High-speed Anti-Radiation Missile) is stockpiled by the U.S. Marines, Navy, and Air Force, as well as more than a dozen countries around the world. Any active radar system is easy to find on the battlefield because they stand out in the electromagnetic spectrum, so you’re inducing a lot of risk every time one lights up. Driverless, robotic ground systems counter counter-fires by letting the USMC and others project more firepower and sensing capability forward without risking Marines or Soldiers. Presently, Forterra is executing the first successful deployment of self-driving systems for the Marine Corps’ Remotely Operated Ground Unit for Expeditionary (ROGUE) Fires under the Navy Marine Expeditionary Ship Interdiction System program (NMESIS). Built on an unmanned ground vehicle platform, ROGUE Fires abets ground-based anti-ship missile operations. Palletized Load System (PLS) trucks conducting autonomous convoy operations at Forterra’s testing range. (Photo courtesy of Forterra) Autonomy for USMC and Army platforms The Marine Corps and Army have recognized the value of developing robotic programs and injecting autonomy into legacy platforms for the reasons discussed. 'The potential benefits of autonomous/robotic platforms to the Army may prove to be advantageous to all warfighting functions’ mission sets,' states the Army Futures Command Concept for Fires 2028. 'These technologies may decrease cost, improve effectiveness, allow the Army to operate dispersed over larger areas, and importantly help keep Soldiers out of harm’s way. They may prove useful for providing logistical support (such as, fuel delivery, and missile or artillery resupply capabilities) enhanced common man-machine interfaces, improved targeting, and ability to process mega-data.' There’s a large community out there that says they can solve some of those challenges in ground autonomy, but few other than Forterra can say they’ve brought reliability, predictability, trustworthiness, and a proven ability to scale autonomy solutions over two decades. Forterra is a leading provider of autonomous systems for ground-based movement and it was among the earliest innovators in the field of driverless technology that focused on building systems that protect front-line troops and enable civilian workers in the industrial base. Today the company is one of the main providers of autonomy systems to all of the DoD’s ground autonomy programs. In September Forterra announced its $75 million Series B fundraising that will enable the company to accelerate and scale the deployment of their autonomous driving system (ADS) called AutoDrive with defense and industrial customers. Forterra’s two decades of experience in the industry, combined with recent venture-capital, positions the company to more rapidly conduct research and development, iteration, and testing needed to quickly field autonomous systems. 'I’m confident to say that we have integrated on more defense vehicles than any other company on the planet over the last 20 years,' said Zach LaCelle, head of product for Forterra. 'As a result, we are intimately familiar with the pitfalls and challenges of everything from base vehicle to sensor integration and mounting, what radios to use, the power-conditioning requirements, the brake systems needed – every capability a vehicle needs to enable autonomy.' A Small Multipurpose Equipment Transport (SMET) is capable of a wide range of CONOPS from casualty evacuation to surveillance and reconnaissance. (Photo courtesy of Forterra) Commonality across program offices The robotic programs discussed enable the DoD to grow logistics capabilities, surveillance and reconnaissance, and firepower without adding personnel to combat units or putting them in harm’s way. There are differences between the programs, however, in so far as each has their own requirements, acquisition strategy, and pathways. Due to the fact that these initiatives also report up to different program offices such as Army PEO Soldier, PEO Combat Support &amp; Combat Service Support, Marine Corps Systems Command, and others, there’s overlap in the capability sets, whether that’s on a robotic combat vehicle or a PLS truck. That raises the question: what synergies, acquisition efficiencies, cost savings, requirements definition, technology sharing, and overall effectiveness can be wrought by coordinating autonomy programs between offices and services – especially when the programs often employ the same autonomy technologies, have many of the same goals and outcomes, and have mutual interests in seeing autonomous ground vehicles programs become successful. 'We’re in a unique position to work across all of those programs and know the answers to those questions after decades of doing autonomy, so we could certainly shed light on this,' said LaCelle. 'We use that knowledge to communicate with both our defense and OEM partners.' Autonomy that works Autonomous systems in the ground domain are ready to be fielded today and will have an immediate impact on the lives of Marines and Soldiers. Autonomy is complex and unique with dual-use applications that the military can leverage to save development costs and get capabilities fielded faster. Forterra is on the forefront of thinking about not just how autonomy is going to protect troops, but how it’s going to be applicable across multiple different warfighting domains. 'The most important part about this is that it’s not a science project,' said Sanders. 'This technology works well and reliably, and we’ve spent 20 years making it functional and scalable.' Forterra has developed mission-relevant ways to demonstrate robotic systems by developing the tactics, techniques, and procedures, as well as the Concepts of Operation, around how they can be most effective in accomplishing tasks without risking the lives of servicemembers. Forterra’s autonomy platform is part of military operations today safely conducting reconnaissance, troop supply missions, and related tasks during ground warfare to keep Marines and Soldiers safe. Forterra has shipped more than 100 vehicles that have operated a cumulative 400,000 miles. Its technology is currently operating in U.S. military programs and have operated in over 10 countries in both defense and commercial applications.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/driverless-systems-are-ready-for-the-next-gear/	2024-10-10T12:50:54-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/Header.png
New Hanwha Defense USA exec sets sights on Navy contracts for Philly Shipyard	A petroleum tanker stands while being built at the Aker Philadelphia Shipyard in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S., on Tuesday, June 19, 2012. Photographer: Bradley C. Bower/Bloomberg via Getty Images WASHINGTON — The new chief executive of the US unit of South Korean industrial conglomerate Hanwha Group wants to restore naval shipbuilding at Philly Shipyard, once the acquisition of that business is finalized this fall. Mike Smith, who took the top job at Hanwha Defense USA in August, acknowledged that winning US Navy shipbuilding contracts is 'going to be challenging' for the shipyard, which currently builds ships for the Department of Transportation’s Maritime Administration as well as commercial customers. 'I don't see us building destroyers in Philadelphia,' he said during a briefing with reporters today. 'I do see us building the fleet the Navy needs next.' That could include constructing large or medium-sized unmanned surface vessels, as well as 'specialty ships' like icebreakers, replenishment oilers, naval training vessels and other auxiliary ships, Smith said. Beyond the construction of new ships, the company could also pursue opportunities to build modules — essentially a smaller section of a ship — that would be incorporated into a Navy vessel during final assembly at a prime contractor’s shipyard, he said. Smith said the company isn’t focused on one specific shipbuilding program, noting that many programs need 'relief valves.' 'I think the smartest thing for us would be to be flexible and support where the need is greatest,' he said. 'So it could be Columbia [class ballistic missile submarines], it could be Virginia [class attack submarines], it could be Ford [class aircraft carriers], could be the [Arleigh Burke-class] destroyer program. 'I don't know about the [Constellation-class] frigate. I know they're still looking for a second source, or second production yard. You want to be positioned to give the Navy as many options as possible,' he said. The bigger issue, Smith said, is ensuring Philly Shipyard has the necessary facilities and infrastructure to take on work as it becomes available. 'We have a couple consultants who are saying the opportunities are a lot closer than we might be ready for,' he added. Another near-term opportunity is the maintenance, overhaul and repair of existing ships, which Smith said could help 'relieve some of the under-capacity that you have throughout the East Coast.' Hanwha Systems and its shipbuilding arm Hanwha Ocean announced plans to buy Norwegian-owned Philly Shipyard in June in a $100 million deal, which is set to close by the end of 2024, pending regulatory approvals. At the time, Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro called the agreement a 'game-changing milestone in our new Maritime Statecraft' that could shake up the competitive landscape among US shipbuilders. Bryan Clark, a fellow at the Hudson Institute, told Breaking Defense in July that Philly Shipyard belongs to a group of commercial shipbuilders that constructs what he called the 'Jones Act fleet,' named for the US law stating that goods shipped between American ports must be transported on US-built vessels and operated by American crews. Because work on these ships comes in waves, Clark predicted that Hanwha would position Philly Shipyard to take on work building Navy ships during an upcoming dearth of contracts for Jones Act ships. Specifically, he pointed to the Ready Reserve Fleet, a group of auxiliary ships the Navy and other government agencies rely upon for non-combat tasks, as a ripe opportunity for the shipbuilder.

NATO to define national space contributions to allied warfighting	NATO Allies from 23 Nations and two Partner Nations, Australia and Japan, participate in the second ever NATO Space Operations Commanders’ Conference at Allied Air Command, June 12-13, 2024. Participants discussed space capability and capacity through collaboration and cooperation with a focus on Space Security and Space Warfare. (NATO AIRCOM photo by OR-9 Arnaud Chamberlin) WASHINGTON — NATO's planning directorate is working to identify what space capabilities each allied nation can bring to the collective fight with the goal of assigning national contributions of kit and people power, according to a senior NATO officer. 'There's an effort right now from the headquarters to survey all 32 nations to tell us exactly what space capability you have. That way, we can assign targets to you, and we can direct you to provide that capability to NATO,' said Maj. Gen. Devin Pepper, deputy chief of staff for strategic plans and policy at NATO's Allied Command Transformation (ACT). ACT, based in Norfolk, Va., is the only NATO headquarters based in the United States. It serves as NATO's 'Strategic Warfare Development Command' responsible for the development of military structures, forces, capabilities and doctrine, according to a NATO fact sheet. NATO's other strategic command, Allied Command Operations (ACO) headquartered in Mons, Belgium, is the alliance's warfighting command. Pepper, who is the first US Space Force general officer to be assigned to NATO headquarters, told the Mitchell Institute today that, at the moment, the US provides the bulk of space capabilities 'that NATO can leverage today in an exercise or in a potential conflict.' This includes, he said, everything from GPS to ballistic missile warning to satellite communications (SATCOM) to intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR). 'But there's other nations out there that that have space capabilities that can contribute as well, in addition to commercial capabilities,' he said. Pepper explained that while NATO in 2019 agreed to its first space policy, and in June 2024 created a Space Branch under ACT, the alliance up to now has only laid out what space missions are important and the general types of capabilities it needs to face up to threats from Russia and China. 'My director is responsible for what's called the NATO Defense Planning Process [NDPP]. That is a &#8230; four-year process that we go through to look at what capability targets that we assign to the nation,' he said. First, ACT takes stock of national capabilities and assets — 'such as carriers or fighters or medical groups or battalions.' Based on that assessment, the command determines 'these are the things that are required in order to prosecute the deterrence and defense plan from ACO and from [the Supreme Allied Commander Europe]' from each member state. 'Right now in the NDPP, we only have qualitative requirements that we assign it to the nation,' Pepper said. 'So: &#8216;Please deliver us [electromagnetic spectrum] capability or SATCOM or ISR.' We have not gotten to the point where we have assigned quantitative targets to the nations. So, in other words, until we know exactly what a nation has that they can offer, we can't task them to provide it yet. We're working through that right now.' ACT is 'at the beginning' of the process, Pepper noted. 'Where do we go from here? What space capabilities to each of the nations have that NATO can leverage?' he asked. 'How do we leverage all of the nations' capability, and then where do we direct them to provide investments to?' To help the allies work out exactly what will be required by the collective force, Pepper said ACT is creating a tabletop exercise going through 'thought scenarios' and 'vignettes' on 'where space is relevant and appropriate' to allied operations for NATO's Military Committee. 'I'll give you an example. In the NDPP, we have asked nations to provide offensive space capability,' he said. 'But in order to leverage that capability, you have to get consensus from all 32 nations. Well, we have a war game on how you get to consensus.'

AI ASAP: Army wants OSD’s help to speed algorithm acquisition	Mr. Young Bang, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics and Technology,) addresses the moderator and members of the panel during the Under Secretary of the Army’s Digital Transformation Panel at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center in Washington, D.C., Sept. 10, 2023. (US Army photo by Henry Villarama) WASHINGTON — Army acquisition officials are working with their counterparts in the Office of the Secretary of Defense on how to speed up AI programs. The service has even suggested developing a special AI variant of the existing Software Acquisition Pathway (SWP), although OSD seems less than enthused about that proposal, according to statements by both Army and OSD officials Tuesday at the annual Professional Services Council conference on defense. Software development in general moves fast, but AI specifically can evolve even faster, said Young Bang, the principal civilian deputy to Army acquisition chief Doug Bush. 'Once you make the algorithm, really, you can extend and retrain them at the edge, [and] you can do that quickly,' Bang told the PSC conference. In some cases, 'I can train algorithms literally overnight,' he said. 'Some of these take actually take a little bit longer … [maybe] a week.' The ability to update AI in days is an even tighter cycle than envisioned by the standard Software Acquisition Pathway, which was created in 2020 to accelerate development of software in general by adopting best practices from the private sector. (SWP was part of a larger package of reforms first proposed in fall 2019 by then-Under Secretary for Acquisition Ellen Lord). 'There’s great utility in the Software Pathway,' Bang said. '[But] the requirement in there is that you do an MVCR [Minimum Viable Capability Release] in a year. … We’re endeavoring to get capabilities out faster. 'We’re actually working with OSD A&amp;S [Acquisition and Sustainment] to … see how we can actually create a sub-path in the Software Pathway for AI,' Bang said. 'We don’t know all the details, we’re still working it out.' 'It is something that I’m sure that we’re continuing to sort through,' said Deborah Rosenblum, the acting deputy to DoD acquisition chief Bill LaPlante, when asked about the topic later during the same conference. '[We’re] definitely not looking at a new pathway. … I do believe it’s likely to be through the Software Pathway, if only because we’re trying to expedite and move quickly, and we feel the way in which the pathway is designed has enough flexibility and agility to be able to accommodate for that.' But Rosenblum didn’t explicitly rule out Bang’s suggestion of carving out a 'sub-pathway' within SWP. Neither did one of her senior aides, contracting expert John Tenaglia, in a sidebar conversation with Breaking Defense. The system is intended to be flexible, Tenaglia emphasized: 'In reality, there’s mixing and matching' of different accelerated procurement authorities, he said, for example by hybridizing a SWP procurement with other contract types. Bang, too, touted the ability to mix-and-match: The service’s high-profile XM-30 program to replace the Reagan-era M2 Bradley troop carrier, he noted, involves both a Software Pathway acquisition for the code and a Mid-Tier Acquisition (MTA) for the physical vehicle, allowing software updates to race ahead independent of the slower development cycles for hardware. (The even more ambitious Robotic Combat Vehicle program has a similar software-hardware split). But he still wanted more agility than he believed the current system could provide. 'I’m about disrupting the status quo,' Bang told the PSC conference. 'Let’s figure it out, let’s be creative, let’s put things together, let’s put an MTA with the Software Pathway and work with OSD to get to something faster for AI.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/ai-asap-army-wants-osds-help-to-speed-algorithm-acquisition/	2024-10-10T11:35:51-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/240523_young_bang_8063486-scaled-e1716469935189.jpg
Strengthened government-industry collaboration will keep capable adversaries off balance	Scott Alexander, Missile Solutions President, L3Harris, participates in a discussion on the 'The future of weapons development' at the 2024 AFA conference. The threats facing the U.S. and its allies continue to proliferate. With peer and near-peer adversaries deploying increasingly advanced weapon systems across all domains the diversity, sophistication and quantity of challenges continue to increase. Even those with limited industrial capacity and technological prowess have access to relatively low-cost, modern weaponry capable of inflicting significant damage. To stay ahead of this complex and dynamic threat environment, the U.S. military requires a robust and agile industrial base capable of rapid prototyping and development, high-volume manufacturing and the ability to surge or redirect production based on shifting demand. This was one of many important topics discussed at the Air and Space Forces Association’s conference held in the nation’s capital recently. In an ever-complex geopolitical environment, what does the future of weapon development look like? And how can industry and government best work together to push these critical systems into the hands of our military faster? Here are four key pillars that can offer the U.S. this decisive advantage in an age of growing threats. Collaboration at the core To accomplish our shared goal of enabling our warfighters to stay ahead of the rapidly evolving threat environment, our government customers are smartly embracing new acquisition philosophies that encourage collaboration amongst industry. Initiatives like the Weapon Open System Architecture (WOSA), being used by the U.S. Air Force and now the Navy, are encouraging modularity and interoperability between component vendors. For example, the inclusion of these WOSA standards within Eglin Air Force Base’s Weapons Government Reference Architecture will support high-volume production and rapid technology iteration as future threats evolve. The government can take additional steps to encourage open standards and plug-and-play modularity, especially at the subcomponent level. They might consider, for example, providing solicitation information directly to major subsystem providers through contracting vehicles such as Eglin’s Wide Agile Acquisition Contract. This would ensure major contributors within the weapons ecosystem have the same information &#8211; regardless of prime-subcontractor relationship. It also opens the door for the government to deal directly with major subsystem vendors. Regardless of the mechanisms, continued robust government-industry dialogue is essential. This dialogue helps align expectations with industry capabilities, while keeping industry responsive to the government’s objectives. Communicating requirements early and often on acquisition programs will lead to better outcomes for all. At L3Harris, we’re also focused on seeking collaborative opportunities not just with the government but also with our industry peers and emerging new entrants. From incorporating new technologies into our manufacturing processes to partnering with academic institutions and strategically aligned start-ups, we are working with other disruptive innovators to cultivate teaming opportunities that bring robust, discriminating capabilities to the fight – and ultimately continue to give the U.S. an outsized advantage over those who would do us harm. Investment in sub-tier suppliers Russia’s war in Ukraine and emerging global issues have made it clear that the United States must reinvigorate defense production supply chains that went dormant or slowed over the past several decades. Solid rocket motors (SRMs), in particular, power the vast majority of U.S. weapon systems and are rightly a key focus as it relates to strengthening the industrial supply base. One easy action we can take to quickly strengthen the industrial supply chain as it relates to SRM components is directly investing in suppliers of cases, igniters and nozzles. In some cases, we’re down to a single provider of these critical SRM subcomponents, which makes production scalability a challenge – especially when multiple primes are vying for the same resource. After all, no matter how many SRM providers come into the market, we will all still rely on the same sub-tier suppliers. We’ve taken this action seriously at L3Harris by directly investing our own capital into critical SRM component suppliers. Over the last 18 months, we have provided more than $25 million to our sub-tier SRM suppliers to expand their capacity and modernize their manufacturing processes. More investment in these critical suppliers is necessary by government and industry alike. Direct and multi-year contracts When we know what’s coming, we can be ready. Multi-year contracts encourage private sector investment at the subcontractor level, boosting industrial-base stability and capacity while fostering innovation and reducing costs. Accurate and consistent demand signals support investment in infrastructure and facilities needed to provide capacity and drive affordability. In fact, where it makes sense, direct-to-supplier contracts with the government can also be an effective tool to increase affordability and get these systems in the hands of our government customer more swiftly. Leveraging additive manufacturing for rapid prototyping While not always the answer, additive manufacturing (AM), along with 3D modeling and digital engineering, is well suited for rapid prototyping of critical components – especially on complex hardware like hypersonic propulsion systems. On L3Harris scramjet engines, for example, AM has led to a more than 75 percent reduction in manufacturing time and costs, and a 95 percent reduction in parts count. Targeted application of AM is just one example of how industry can quickly collaborate with our government partners to design, model, prototype and test at the speed of relevance. America and its allies are facing a world where increasingly capable adversaries are probing for weaknesses across multiple domains. Government and industry must continue to work together to make informed and timely acquisition decisions to get critical weapon systems into the hands of our warfighters. By embracing modularity and interoperability initiatives like WOSA, and through robust dialogue where government requirements are communicated clearly, early and often, industry can rise to meet the challenges posed by rapidly evolving threats. Our ability to deploy weapons in large numbers quickly and affordably, and to rapidly innovate against evolving threats, will keep our adversaries guessing and ultimately create a safer world.

Breaking Defense launches Defense Business Report, a new channel and newsletter	Breaking Defense today is launching the Defense Business Report, a new channel and weekly newsletter on the most important news about the business aspects of defense, including innovation, mergers and acquisitions, finance and the industrial base. Our Defense Business Report will provide a focus within Breaking Defense for those interested in the rapidly evolving business dynamics of defense, at a time of immense change in technology, global threats and the business milieu. Defense Business Report will be a channel on Breaking Defense and, starting the week of October 14, its own bespoke newsletter. Breaking Defense made an investment earlier this year to double-down on our coverage of the business of defense because of a simple fact: This is arguably the most transformational moment for the defense industrial base since the end of the Cold War. At a policy level, leaders across the western world are talking about production and investment in the industrial base in a way they never have before. Technologically, capabilities like AI, cyber, directed energy, hypersonics, drones and 3D printing are likely game changers. And a new wave of small entrepreneurial firms are hoping to upend the hold legacy defense companies have on the global military budget. All of this reporting — guided by Valerie Insinna, a highly respected veteran journalist with deep experience covering the industry — will now have a home and channel on Breaking Defense. This isn’t 'tick-tock' coverage of stock prices or mundane details, but news that matters, analysis, interviews with key business leaders — the view towards what is driving the defense business today. Val, along with the rest of the Breaking Defense team, will make sure that everything you need to know about where the industry is going is laid out cleanly on a regular basis on the new channel, and then weekly, in an easy-to-digest newsletter. Sign up for the Defense Business Report today. You can’t afford to miss it.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/breaking-defense-launches-defense-business-report-a-new-channel-and-newsletter/	2024-10-10T09:57:11-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/05/Breaking-Defense-Atlas-3-1.png
After purported IDF strikes on UN peacekeepers, what comes next?	Spanish peacekeepers of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) coordinate their patrol with the Lebanese army, in Marjayoun in south Lebanon on October 8, 2024. (Photo by AFP) (Photo by -/AFP via Getty Images) BEIRUT — United Nations peacekeepers are sounding the alarm today as its forces and facilities have been struck by Israeli forces, including at least two incidents the UN organization says were conducted 'deliberately.' 'This morning, two peacekeepers were injured after an IDF Merkava tank fired its weapon toward an observation tower at UNIFIL’s headquarters in Naqoura, directly hitting it and causing them to fall,' the United Nations Interim Forces in Lebanon (UNIFIL) said in a statement. 'The injuries are fortunately, this time, not serious, but they remain in hospital.' The statement added that on Wednesday 'IDF soldiers deliberately fired at and disabled the position’s perimeter-monitoring cameras. They also deliberately fired on UNP 1-32A in Ras Naqoura, where regular Tripartite meetings were held before the conflict began, damaging lighting and a relay station.' In its statement UNIFIL reminded IDF and all other actors of their 'obligations' and that 'any deliberate attack on peacekeepers is a grave violation of international humanitarian law and of Security Council resolution 1701' that all sides involved agreed to in 2006. The statement said UNIFIL was following up with Israeli forces on this issue, who do not appear to have responded publicly to UNIFIL's statement. The incidents threaten to throw more gasoline on the fire that is the conflict between Israel and the Iran-backed Lebanese armed group Hezbollah, and puts UNIFIL's already controversial and contentious peacekeeping mission in an even tighter spot. The UNIFIL force is made up of international troops from 49 UN nations, including an Irish contingent that was involved in a tense standoff with Israeli forces over the weekend. At the end of September Israeli forces called on UNIFIL to withdraw from some positions in southern Lebanon, but UNIFIL declined to move. Senior Middle East and North Africa analyst at the RANE Network Ryan Bohl told Breaking Defense that there are two likely possibilities to explain IDF's purported actions. Despite UNIFIL's declaration that two of the incidents were deliberate, he said it's possible 'IDF troops on the ground mistook a UNIFIL post for Hezbollah and opened fire. Less likely, but still possible is that the IDF or at least some of its commanders on the ground want to pressure UNIFIL to withdraw in order to increase the IDF’s operational space in the Southern Lebanon.' Retired Lebanese Brig. Gen. Andre Bou Maachar agreed with Bohl’s second proposal, suggesting that today’s attack might have been conducted by IDF as a leverage to pressure UNIFIL countries to withdraw their troops and imposing a different security system in the region. He added that it also 'indicates that UNIFIL and LAF [Lebanese Armed Forces] can’t be distanced from the conflict, as these incidents will probably take place.' After today’s attack, Bohl expected UNIFIL to 'likely reassess where it can position forces in the south, though without a full mandate to pull out I suspect some will remain in the area. Israel will likely face intense pressure to coordinate military action with UNIFIL to prevent more of these incidents.' Bou Maachar said UNIFIL could respond by withdrawing a few kilometers north. After about two decades of deployment in the south, the two experts said they believe that the UNIFIL is unlikely to stop military actions between Israel and Hezbollah, despite the peacekeeping moniker. 'UNIFIL is also just as unlikely to stop Israeli military action, though it could slow or shape it as Israel has little interest in the diplomatic blowback that would come from striking UN troops,' Bohl agreed, Bou Maachar said the recent attacks indicated 'that nothing stops Israel from achieving its military and political goal, and it doesn’t respect any international or humanitarian law.' Israel has pushed back on international condemnation regarding civilian deaths caused by its offensive in Gaza and Lebanon, saying it is targeting terrorists who endanger civilians by hiding among them. Resolution 1701 referenced in the UNIFIL statement refers to the agreement that ended the one-month long Israeli war with Lebanon in July 2006, and greatly increased the number of UNIFIL troops in Lebanon deployed along the border to a maximum of 15,000. Earlier in August this year, UNIFIL’s mandate was renewed for the first time, while the country saw virtual daily clashes in the south — the kind of violence the peacekeeping mission has struggled to dampen. As of August, about 10,000 troops are operating there, UNIFIL deputy spokesperson Kandice Ardiel told Breaking Defense previously. 'From 2006 until October 2023, under the framework of resolution 1701, we did not see major conflict in the south. We saw occasional incidents, but those were de-escalated relatively quickly. The situation now is far worse than anything we saw since 2006,' Ardiel said in an August interview. According to their mandate, UNIFIL have the right of self-defense that they haven't exercised yet. 'In addition to the use of force beyond self-defence, and without prejudice of the primary responsibility of the Government of Lebanon, UNIFIL may under certain circumstances and conditions resort to the proportionate and gradual use of force to ensure that its area of operations is not utilized for hostile activities,' Chapter 6 of UN charter states.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/un-peacekeepers-struck-by-israeli-fire-in-lebanon-warn-of-grave-violation-of-international-law/	2024-10-10T09:47:08-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/241010_unifil_lebanon_GettyImages-2176702453-scaled-e1728577082547.jpg
The ‘Cost Plus’ boondoggle that hobbles US defense	Capitol Hill seen on a cloudy day. (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) As traditional defense contractors and outsiders alike gather for the Association of the US Army mega-conference this month, the latest Army acquisition policy just reinforces old dysfunctions that keep the most innovative firms away. Above all, the Army’s March directive on 'Enabling Modern Software Development &amp; Acquisition Practices' [PDF] encourages the service to buy custom-built software, developed under arcane cost-plus accounting rules, 'to the maximum extent possible,' instead of following best private-sector practices. Even the official Senate Armed Services Committee report [PDF] warns that the Army directive 'appears to deviate from the current law' and requires the service report back by Jan. 15 on how it 'will implement the Directive in a manner that supports the participation of small businesses and nontraditional defense contractors.' The Army’s fumbling is just the latest and most blatant manifestation of the antiquated business model in place across the Department of Defense. It’s an approach that consistently fails to seek out, absorb, and deploy innovative new technologies as fast as the commercial world or our adversaries. There are pockets of excellence — like DIU, AFWERX, SOFWERX, and SDA — that have entrepreneurial culture baked into their DNA. They are funded by a disorganized hodgepodge of well-meaning, if uncoordinated pots of money — including Hedge Portfolio, APFIT, RDER, RCCTO, and RIF — and deliver cutting-edge products, including software, to the warfighter at the speed of relevance using commercial purchasing methods. But the Army directive appears to be doubling down on the legacy system that everyone else is trying to move away from as quickly as possible. That current system, resembling the Soviet centralized economy model, notoriously ignores currently available technology and products made by commercial companies, and instead fantasizes impossible-to-make exquisite weapons through the 'requirements' process, runs a fiction-writing contest to select from one of the five remaining large prime contractors that can write such proposals, then awards the winner a monopoly for decades for an item they have never made. Because the DoD locks themselves into purchasing that product only from that contractor, no private company would invest out of their own pocket in a superior product, as there is no way for the DoD to switch. The prime contractor is free to burn billions of taxpayer dollars for years, unmolested by competitive pressures from other vendors or adversaries whizzing by us. The worst part, however, is the way these prime contractors get paid, specifically the so-called 'Cost Plus' model — which particularly drew ire in the SASC report. Media reports often liken the Cost-Plus model to an hourly time and materials arrangement. It is not. It is much, much worse. Imagine you need to replace the heating system in your house. You prefer the plumber bid for the job using a firm fixed price with everything included so there are no nasty surprises at the end. Many plumbers work this way: pad the estimate a little for safety, then perform the work while aggressively keeping expenses in check to maximize the profit left over at the end. Thousands of years of economic evolution have made this the most popular business model as it rewards efficient work by the vendor with higher profits and rewards the customer with certainty of cost. If the job is too complex for firm fixed price — say, there are unknowns inside the walls — the plumber might say, 'It will be $85 per hour for my labor, plus the cost of materials'. This is still a normal commercial practice. The plumber will be rewarded for driving the underlying cost of that hour as far below $85 as possible to maximize the profit on each hour. This is where the DoD goes off the rails. Imagine then telling your plumber: 'OK, inside that $85 per hour, I need to see exactly how much you are paying yourself and your workers in salary, benefits, and all your internal business costs, so I can make sure you’re not making too much profit'. After some very colorful language, the plumber will tell you it’s none of your business. But a defense contractor can’t tell the US military to go to hell. There’s no commercial market for tanks and submarines. So the hardcore defense industry has had no choice but to implement laborious, bespoke accounting systems — and, in fact, has used them not only as a barrier to entry, keeping competitors from entering the defense business, but as a tool to extract more profit from the Pentagon. In the Cost-Plus world companies are rewarded for increasing their business expenses. Instead of $85, you get $125, then add all the unnecessary auditing and accounting expenses just to keep track of all this nonsense and you’re up to $150. Then, because you have a locked-in monopoly, the hours spent performing each task magically inflate once the work starts. The customer can’t cut the contractor off and switch to someone else. The excellent article The Law the Department of Defense Loves to Break accurately describes the misguided philosophy that drove DoD to create this dystopian model in the first place. (The article was written by an employee of non-traditional tech contractor Palantir, but is not an official company statement). But needless to say, it is perhaps the worst way to buy anything that one could possibly imagine. The net result of the Cost Plus incentive structure is to skew the 'make or buy?' decision towards 'make' wherever possible. Buying a finished off-the-shelf item that could shave years off of deployment to the warfighter, and save billions in the process is anathema to a Cost Plus contractor. It would cost them a boatload of profit they could make reinventing wheels. Lawmakers are no dummies. In 1994 they passed the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act, which amongst other things, mandates that before a Cost-Plus custom development contract can be solicited, the DoD must first search the commercial market for something that already exists, and is 'close enough' to what is needed, and if it exists, buy it with whatever commercial business model that vendor uses (which is invariably some kind of fixed price arrangement). This is codified in 10 U.S.C 3453. As the Senate report language spells out, it’s very hard to see how the Army’s March directive does not 'deviate' from that law — and even if the service can somehow satisfy the letter of FASA, it very much violates the spirit. And while FASA is far from consistently enforced, it’s not a dead letter, as shown by the Army’s loss to Palantir in a 2017 lawsuit over this very matter. In the future, a new suit over the new policy could cost the Army hundreds of millions and years of delay. Yet the Army seems to be heading, undaunted, towards the cliff, as shown by this declaration by the service’s acquisition chief, Doug Bush: 'If some companies don't want to bid on a contract, it's a free country. Don't bid. Others will. My goal is simply to get the capability for the Army, not to make everybody happy.' But the very best software companies in the world all work on firm fixed price: By pre-ordaining Cost Plus, the Army effectively excludes the very best in the business right from the get-go. What possible reason could one have to do this? The only beneficiaries of this policy are the incumbent defense contractors, who are rejoicing at the affirmation of business-as-usual, and our adversaries around the world, who will take aid and comfort in this opportunity to surpass the United States’ competitive advantage. It's incumbent on Congress to step in, conduct rigorous oversight, and if necessary pass new legislation to hold the Army to both the letter and the spirit of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act. It's clear the Pentagon won't do it themselves.

Eyeing export orders, Northrop unveils counter-UAS Bushmaster M230LF dual-feed gun	Northrop Grumman's new M230LF Bushmaster dual feed chain gun can switch between ammo and target types (Northrop Grumman) BELFAST — Northrop Grumman has launched a new Bushmaster M230LF (Link Fed) dual-feed chain gun, designed to neutralize UAS and ground threats, with the manufacturer targeting export customers for future orders. Integrated on a remote weapon system, the new 30x113mm medium caliber cannon can be equipped on 4&#215;4, 6&#215;6 or 8&#215;8 land vehicles and allows operators to shift between ammunition types and target types, according to John McCollum, director of business development, guns operating unit, at Northrop Grumman. He also shared that Northrop has developed a prototype of the new gun, completed a phase of 'internal live firing' and plans on new live fire trials based off a 4&#215;4 sized vehicle, 'similar to a JLTV [Joint Light Tactical Vehicle]' type, in the 'next six months.' RELATED: To counter drones, US Army seeks layers rather than &#8216;silver bullets' The new gun, evolved from the US Army's AH-64 Apache attack helicopter chain gun, has reached Technology Readiness Level 6 (TRL) maturity. 'What this canon allows us to do is to add the functionality to be able to address Group 1 and Group 2 UAVs, as well as seamlessly, still address the ground targets and have the anti-armor capability that we have in our current M230LF cannon,' McCollum told Breaking Defense. He noted the firing rate of the cannon is adjustable — a new feature compared to the single feed configuration, with an output of 50 to 200 shots per minute. Group 1 and Group 2 unmanned aerial vehicles are at the lighter end of a five-level aircraft weight classification, with a maximum take off weight of up to 55 pounds, per DoD documents [PDF]. Despite Northrop debuting the product in advance of the AUSA trade show in Washington, DC, the US Army does not have a requirement for a dual feed gun, said McCollum. The US Army operates a 30mm single feed cannon under the Counter-UAS, Mobile, Low, Slow, Unmanned Aircraft Integrated Defeat System (M-LIDS) effort, led by prime contractor Leonardo DRS. 'But we're seeing some current requirements come from Europe and other regions for' the capability. No live demonstrations have been planned yet for international customers as development continues. In September, Northrop Grumman and Lithuania signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) committing the manufacturer to support local suppliers in the production of medium-caliber ammunition for Infantry Fighting Vehicles (IFVs). Motivation for bringing the dual feed gun to market is linked to Northrop assessing the 'UAV problem' for 'several years' and determining that there's 'always going to be a place for a kinetic solution' to counter the aircraft, said McCollum. 'Layered defense is absolutely key, and there are other technologies that can be used &#8230; and really as that last line of defense from 1,000 meters and in. There are really no other solutions in the marketplace that can be as effective as a kinetic solution, such as this' M230LF dual-feed gun,' he said. Customers interested in acquiring the gun, would need to first make sure they have a 'heavy enough remote weapon station' to support it, said McCollum, 'because it brings so much more capability than a 50 [caliber] remote weapon station.'

IAI, Aerotor planning APUS family of quadcopter drones	IAI's APUS-25 drone takes flight. The Israeli firm hopes that this will be the start of a new family of drones. (IAI) JERUSALEM — Israel Aerospace Industries has a new quadcopter vertical-take-off-and-landing family of drones that it says has a longer flight time and payload-to-weight ratio than other similar designs. The new platform, dubbed the 'APUS' family, was developed in partnership with Aerotor, a company which IAI has acquired a stake in. The first version of the system, the APUS 25, will make its American debyt at next week’s AUSA conference, but the plan is for IAI to roll out a large family of variants, with different weights and payloads, over the coming years. 'Our perspective is that in small tactical UAVs [being used today] will trend more toward VTOL,' Moshe Levy, manager of the Military Aircraft Group at IAI, told Breaking Defense in an interview. The biggest advantage of such a VTOL design, he said, is that the systems can take off and land on pretty much any surface, including ships, without use of runway or parachute. What separates APUS from the kind of quadcopter systems widely available in the commercial market, Levy said, is payload and distance. A company brochure claims the APUS-25, which is just under five and a half feet long, is a 25 kilogram platform that can carry around 10 kilograms in payload and fly for up to eight hours; depending on payload, Levy said, the system could go further than 100 km. The drones can also fly up to 11,000 feet in height, according to the brochure, which means any noise they emit would be reduced to near zero after 1,000 feet. At the core of the design is a decision on power. IAI has been building remotely piloted vehicles for decades and was one of the world’s first companies to pioneer these platforms. Larger UAVs use engines, such as the Rotax that was used on the Predator, basically an aircraft engine. By contrast, when quadcopters became more common at the tactical level, most of these drones were electric, which requires batteries — and the longer you want to go, the larger the battery needs to be, meaning less space for payload. 'What we did is take a different approach to go to use a heavy fuel engine,' Levy said. This can accommodate fuel such as JP-5, Jet A1 or gasoline, according to company literature. Levy added that since militaries are familiar with combustion engine, the systems should be simple to maintain and be able to slide easily into existing supply lines. 'These drones are very capable. The advantage is they can carry substantial weight. It can be E/O or Radar,' Levy said, predicting that this size drone will become a large portion of the market share. Speaking alongside Levy was Raz Geva, the co-founder and CEO of Aerotor, who noted that when the smaller company was founded in 2017 they 'tried to map the drone market and look at what is the next demand. What they found is that the market 'asks about endurance and heavy payload and range, and also the variant capacity for logistics. To solve these barriers, we understood if you [use an] electrical drone, it can’t match this task.' Through a series of demonstrations, 'We showed that we can take around 8kg payload for two hours, but the main advantage is 3.5 kg payload for six hours endurance and four kg for five hours, etc. And this didn’t exist before in a small drone.' Levy and Raz point to several types of missions these drones, and the larger ones they expect to develop, can accomplish. This can include carrying supplies that soldiers may need, or landing on ships for naval missions.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/iai-aerotor-planning-apus-family-of-quadcopter-drones/	2024-10-10T07:24:52-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/IAI-APUS-25-2-e1728420953640.jpg
Display screens are the eyes for maneuver forces needing to command and control	US. Army Strykers from 1st Stryker Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division roll toward the Brigade Tactical Operations Center (TOC) at the National Training Center, Ft. Irwin, CA., Jan. 17, 2017. The National Training Center conducts tough, realistic, Unified Land Operations with our United Action Partners to prepare Brigade Combat Teams and other units for combat while taking care of Soldiers, Civilians, and Family members. (U.S. Army Sgt. Michael Spandau/Released) Army formations face threats that extend from kinetics to unmanned ISR drones to electronic warfare, which means much of their situational awareness comes from displays and visualization systems inside vehicles like Bradley infantry fighting vehicles. We discussed these challenges and how advanced capabilities in visual displays present data for decision making with Neal Toso, director of technical business development for ScioTeq. Breaking Defense: What are the lessons learned from Ukraine as they relate to rugged visualization solutions for mission and/or safety critical applications? Toso: Lessons from Ukraine show that if you're stationary you’re an easy target. Instead of having a fixed shelter for a command post – they're too easily detected because of electronics and their digital signatures – the military needs to find modern ways to keep command posts mobile. That's our focus, giving the Army larger-size, qualified display options for mobile command and control. Neal Toso, director of technical business development for ScioTeq. What is the value of visualization from the standpoint of force protection so that the soldiers and marines inside vehicles have situational awareness around them? It’s essential that they have access to a real-time common operating picture sourced by multi-domain and joint service C5ISR data streams in large-scale combat operations. Visualization technology is the mechanism for such information conveyance. The screen is the system that must give warfighters the data that's necessary for mission success, and what they want more than anything else is for the display to do what it's supposed to do by providing them with situational awareness. The display is the ultimate endpoint where the warfighter's eyeballs meet mission data. Beyond clarity or pixels or sunlight readability, ruggedization and reliability are of critical importance – otherwise the warfighter is flying blind. The display simply must work. It’s got to be accurate, it’s got to be available, and it’s got to be timely and readily understood. Describe the integration challenges of installing visualization onto a vehicle for command and control. A maneuver battalion has about 20 Bradley fighting vehicles, and they pick three or four to convert into complete command posts. In the back of those vehicles are operators that need to control a UAV, for example. To do so, the Army is upfitting the interior of these vehicles with big 24 or 32-inch displays so that soldiers can have a visualization system that displays multiple sources of data for a full operational picture. They'll also have smaller displays to operate the actual sensors. Regardless of whether that unmanned system is a drone or a robotic combat vehicle that the Army's developing now, their ability to control them is through the visualization systems. To assist the Army in that endeavor, ScioTeq is stepping away a bit from the traditional small-size-form-factor displays that you find in a typical vehicle. We’re developing new visualization solutions that strike a balance between providing soldiers the ability to process the streams of data coming in and the advanced video processing capabilities they need to view the data in the most suitable manner. ScioTeq provides hardware systems to vehicle manufacturer OEMs. What are the demand signals you are hearing from them and from the DoD about what’s needed in visualization and display technologies? We see a shift toward standardization and the introduction of open formats both from an integrator's perspective and from the end-user community. The first initiatives were launched in the UK with the DEF-STN 00-23 GVA (generic vehicle architecture) introduction, and this has become a baseline in many NATO countries with the NGVA standard. In the U.S., the introduction of MOSA (Modular Open Systems Approach) and GCIA (Ground Combat Systems Common Infrastructure Architecture) show a clear shift toward a more open standard platform, avoiding vendor lock-in. For displays and computing, this change has required us to design and qualify our products, supporting multiple standards and offering low-risk integration for vehicle OEMs. End users expect common strategic views for situational awareness. They want to understand the technical risks, and be able to manage a lifecycle from concept to design to manufacturing and lifetime support because they want to reduce technical risk and lower the system cost for the end users. They want to decrease operator stress and distraction because that has an impact on the mission, and they want to provide real-time situational awareness prior to the engagement. The key here that I've heard all the way up to Army Futures Command Commanding Gen. James Rainey is that he wants data, he wants knowledge, and he wants decision-making. From another angle, we hear repeatedly about the requirement for obsolescence management. Deploying new systems is tremendously expensive, and retrofitting existing systems to remain operational, sometimes for decades, is a continuous struggle. Partnering with a company like ScioTeq that has the knowhow and processes in place to maintain equipment for extended periods of time, coupled with exacting quality standards that yield minimal field failures, greatly reduces the total cost of ownership and provides a tremendous value to the government. A key element of force protection is the speed at which data from on-vehicle sensors like thermal imagers is disseminated across the vehicle. How does ScioTeq’s visualization and display technologies reduce latency? Presenting timely information is critical to the warfighter decision loop. The information stack is often a synthesis of data from multiple sources combined and presented to soldiers in such a way that they can rapidly identify alternatives. ScioTeq displays allow the warfighter to switch views at the press of a button depending on the tactical situation. Low-latency video from a camera can be prioritized and projected directly on the screen without processing for applications such as driving or fire control. The ability to support both this lowest video to glass latency (80-100 ms glass to glass) together with the advanced and rapid video processing on the order of 20 ms, as well as overlays combining data packages, provide the users with the best options during operations. Breaking Defense: Final thoughts? ScioTeq considers itself the leader in rugged visualization, computing, and networking hardware solutions. We take pride in collaborating with the OEM’s and end users to define architectures that provide a common strategic view for situational awareness. By working upfront with the OEM’s we provide a better understanding of the technical risks, how lifecycles are managed, and the logistical support demands of warfighters. That translates into visualization systems for mission-specific implementation, all within a defined budget and timeline that meets the demand for decreased size, weight, power and cooling required for today’s maneuver forces.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/display-screens-are-the-eyes-for-maneuver-forces-needing-to-command-and-control/	2024-10-10T05:25:31-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/Stryker-with-TL-824-scaled.jpg
Anduril debuts new ‘Bolt’ quadcopter for sensing, strike missions	Anduril's new Bolt quadcopter. (Anduril photo) AUSA 2024 — Defense tech startup Anduril Industries today continued its streak of new product launches, unveiling a vertical takeoff and landing quadcopter dubbed 'Bolt' that’s already on order with the Marine Corps. Weighing roughly 12 to 15 pounds depending on configuration, the small, portable drone can be launched by hand and fly roughly 20 kilometers, with an endurance of over 40 minutes, according to Anduril. The base Bolt configuration can conduct intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions or search and rescue, while the armed Bolt-M can deliver an explosive payload of up to three pounds. The Bolt is specifically on contract for the Marine Corps's Organic Precision Fires-Light (OPF-L) program, being one of a 'handful' of systems under evaluation by the service, Brose said. He added that the Bolt will be tested over the next six months to inform a potential acquisition and fielding in fiscal year 2025. Regardless of the outcome for OPF-L, Anduril believes that '[t]here are multiple global military organizations and programs where Bolt-M is aligned to existing requirements, and we expect the number of relevant programs and opportunities to increase significantly in the coming years,' the company told Breaking Defense. 'In round numbers,' Anduril says that 'typical Bolt configurations are in the low tens of thousands of dollars,' though that largely depends on payloads and configurations. Additionally, pointing to the proliferation of relatively cheap, commercially-derived first-person drones in modern conflicts, Anduril argues that Bolt helps fill the US’s need for similar weapons with the help of the company’s Lattice software. The Bolt quadcopter can fly autonomously and be operated manually in GPS-denied environments, Anduril says, with features like customizable engagements. When in data collection mode, the platform can share information across Anduril’s other platforms and those belonging to third-party vendors to enhance awareness of the battlespace, according to the company. And if an operator using the Bolt-M configuration decides to strike, the weapon can guide itself to the target even if it loses connection with the operator. The Bolt-M can also fly back if an operator decides against attacking a target. 'What we are doing with Lattice is deliver[ing] as much autonomy across that entire kill chain to put that human being on the loop so that they can make better decisions faster,' Brose said. 'It's the processing and fusing of sensor data that's coming off of those sensors or those vehicles, whether Anduril will build them or others do. It's the actual orchestration of those systems.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/anduril-debuts-new-bolt-quadcopter-for-sensing-strike-missions/	2024-10-09T21:02:09-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/2024-Bolt-Hero-2-scaled-e1728497965874.jpg
‘The homeland is no longer a sanctuary’ warns new TRANSCOM boss	Gen. Randall Reed, the new U.S. Transportation Command commander, salutes the colors during his change of command ceremony at Scott Air Force Base, IL. (Photo by Brien Vorhees/USTRANSCOM) WASHINGTON — The rise of great power competition means that American soil is at risk, the newly-minted head of US Transportation Command (TRANSCOM) warned today — requiring an updated mindset as well as better defenses against 'non-kinetic' threats and operations in the 'gray zone.' Speaking before a meeting of the National Defense Transportation Association in St. Louis, Air Force Gen. Randall Reed harkened back to the time of nuclear drills during the Cold War to evoke a collective sense of urgency he argued has gone by the wayside. 'There was a national consciousness that somebody could do something to us,' he said. 'We’ve lost that.' While not calling out Russia and China by name — only referring to them using Pentagon parlance as respective 'acute' and 'pacing' threats — Reed said viewing the two countries as able to properly threaten the continental US should motivate new thinking to 'shore up' domestic operations. 'The homeland is no longer a sanctuary,' he continued. 'We have great, great power to deter in the kinetic realm. The question will be, how do we continue to get stronger in the non-kinetic and the gray zone realm? And there's a lot of work to be done there.' (Gray zone refers to the space between peace and war, where adversaries can engage in activities like cyber attacks.) Reed, who took over command of TRANSCOM from outgoing chief Gen. Jacqueline Van Ovost in an Oct. 4 ceremony, inherits a series of conflicts ruled by daily logistics operations. TRANSCOM has been instrumental in shipping aid to Ukraine, for example, as well as providing weapons to Israel and aid to civilians in Gaza. The specter of conflict in the Indo-Pacific promises to further stress TRANSCOM’s operations, particularly as increasingly sophisticated Chinese defenses pose threats to bases and relatively vulnerable key assets like shipping vessels, refueling aircraft and cargo planes — a concept often called 'contested logistics.' Reed said a critical need for the command is to enjoy a 'decision advantage,' or essentially the ability to quickly make the right choices in any circumstance and at all levels. Still, even in relatively more peaceful settings like operations today, the general disputed the notion that logistics operations aren’t currently contested. 'Logistics is always contested. If nothing else, it is the perfect home for Murphy's Law,' he said. 'The mechanical nature of things has a vote. The level of training of our people has a vote. Things are going to go wrong.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/the-homeland-is-no-longer-a-sanctuary-warns-new-transcom-boss/	2024-10-09T13:36:46-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/gen-reed-scaled.jpg
Army PEO C3T changes name to PEO C3N, as unified network plans advance	Mr. Michael C. Monteleone III, Director, Assured Positioning, Navigation and Timing/Space Cross-Functional Team, Army Futures Command, MG Jeth B. Rey, Director, Network Cross-Functional Team, Army Futures Command and Mr. Mark C. Kitz, Program Executive Officer, Intelligence, Electronic Warfare and Sensors, US Army, discuss how the Army of 2030 will fight in a GPS denied and degraded environment at AUSA Global Force Symposium &amp; Exposition 2023 on May 28, 2023 in Huntsville, Alabama. (US Army Photo by Patrick Hunter) WASHINGTON — The Army’s Program Executive Office for Command, Control and Communications- Tactical (PEO C3T), the office responsible for developing and supporting the Army’s network, is officially rebranding to better reflect its mission set. Goodbye, PEO C3T, and hello PEO C3N: Command, Control and Communications &#8211; Network. 'This is deeper than just a simple rebranding. This event signifies and recognizes the changing environment and how we must evolve, and the importance of our network and command and control capabilities.' Lt. Gen. Rob Collins, principal military deputy to the Assistant Secretary of the Army, Army Acquisition Corps and former PEO for C3N, said in a press release. The change comes nearly a year after the office underwent a revamp in which it absorbed several organizations from the PEO Enterprise Information Systems (PEO EIS), combining a number of the Army’s enterprise and tactical network capabilities under one roof. 'Last year, the Army decided to merge the enterprise and tactical network efforts under a single portfolio, resulting in a streamlined effort to develop the unified network as part of the Army’s network modernization strategy,' a PEO C3N spokesperson told Breaking Defense in an email ahead of today’s announcement. Hence, today's decision to drop the 'tactical' portion of the name serves as a signifier of its mission to create a single network. 'Recent real-world operations in the Middle East continue to validate the need for a unified network,' the press release said. 'Events are changing at the velocity of which we have never seen before,' Collins said in the press release. 'We have to be agile, mobile and lethal. We still have to be able to shoot, move, communicate, but now you have the land, sea, air and cyberspace domains that have to be interconnected and transparent to the warfighters.' The Army’s unified network, which was announced nearly three years ago, is the service’s goal of breaking down the dozens of siloed legacy networks, mostly separated by tactical and enterprise portions, to create a more cohesive singular network. 'We can't afford separate and disparate tools for a tactical and enterprise network if there's opportunities for us to streamline and deliver the same purpose, right?' Mark Kitz, program executive officer of C3N, told Breaking Defense in a recent interview. 'I feel like it's something we have to do. We have to build a more secure, integrated network,' he later added. When the Army first announced this initiative three years ago, the service had 69 networks, with the goal of getting down to one by 2027. Last month Lt. Gen. John Morrison told an audience at a Defense News conference that the Army is down to nine networks. However, PEO C3N noted in the release that creating the unified network will never be 'finished' due to the ongoing advancements in technology and the 'shifting nature' of military conflicts.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/army-peo-c3t-changes-name-to-peo-c3n-as-unified-network-plans-advance/	2024-10-09T12:31:55-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/07/7733634-scaled-e1689010284959.jpg
To attack enemy space capabilities, Army eyes doubling expert cadre	Two British Army Special Operations Brigade soldiers, left, and a Soldier with the US Army 18th Space Company, 1st Space Brigade, right, guard a small tactical vehicle equipped with a miniaturized tactical space system during Project Convergence Capstone 4 experimentation at White Sands Missile Range, Feb. 28, 2024. (US Army photo by Brooke Nevins) WASHINGTON — The Army could more than double the number of soldiers with expertise in space operations if top brass approves a proposal by Army Space and Missile Defense Command (SMDC) to implement the service's new(ish) space vision, according to SMDC officials. The idea is to create a new space-centered military occupational specialty, called '40D Space MOS,' that for the first time would include non-commissioned officers, Col. Mark Cobos, head of SMDC's 1st Space Brigade, told Breaking Defense on the cusp of the annual Association of the US Army (AUSA) conference. Right now, he explained, only about 500 commissioned officers have space specialities, with another 874 enlisted soldiers essentially being 'borrowed' from other specialty units such as intelligence or air defense for short periods of three to four years. The new MOS is envisioned to initially include 'upwards of 1,800 billets' for enlisted personnel by fiscal 2030. The plan also would bolster the officer corps up to some 800 by FY32. SMDC is hoping for a decision from Army leadership by the end of October, Cobos added, although obviously the command hasn't any authority on the timeline. The Army long has had officers specializing in space under its F40 designation given that, as officials are always keen to point out, the service is the biggest military user of space capabilities. The new plan to pump up space personnel has two goals, SMDC officials explained. First, more operators are needed to help the land service ensure that crucial satellite communications (SATCOM) and positioning, timing and navigation (PNT) capabilities are available during conflict. This includes, for example, acquiring commercial SATCOM services to augment limited military satellite access. Second, and perhaps more importantly, trained soldiers are needed to run offensive operations against enemy satellite capabilities deep inside hostile territory. For example, this could include deploying small numbers of soldiers far forward with mobile jamming equipment. Cobos noted that 1st Space Brigade soldiers already are starting to train in realistic environments where space operations are taking place 'within hand grenade range' of enemy forces. In a recent exercise, he said, a 1st Space Brigade soldier 'conducted a high altitude, low opening (HALO) tandem parachute jump with the 10th Special Forces Group at the National Training Center' to practice penetrating deep into enemy territory to conduct counterspace activities — though he did not provide details related to the secret squirrel-style exercise. OP ED: The Army doth protest too much: In Space, jointness must come first The two 'principle bullets' in the 'Army Space Vision Supporting Multidomain Operations [PDF]' published in January stipulate that the service needs to both 'integrate' US space capabilities into its operations and 'interdict' adversary space operations 'simultaneously,' said Col. Donald Brooks, commandant of the Space and Missile Defense Center of Excellence in Colorado Springs, Colo. 'One of the Army's core competencies is Joint Forcible Entry Operations, where an Army Task Force projects combat power deep in order to be able to establish the conditions so that follow-on Army forces can can move through that seized airfield or [other territory],' he told Breaking Defense. 'And all of those Army core competencies, from a purely geometry standpoint, are what what you refer to as &#8216;behind those lines.' We use terms like to be able to &#8216;penetrate,' to be able to &#8216;isolate and disintegrate' an adversary.' Army Multi-Domain Operations includes space control activities, especially deep inside enemy territory. (Image: Army 4th Infantry Division) 'Disintegration' is a term of art defined in the Army's Field Manual 3.0 [PDF] that establishes the service's overarching doctrine; although it is not a term included in the capstone space doctrine governing joint force operations, Joint Publication 3-14. (Individual service doctrine feeds into joint doctrine, but joint doctrine in the end takes primacy over collective US military operations.) 'Disintegrate means to disrupt the enemy’s command and control, degrading the synchronization and cohesion of its operations. Disintegration prevents enemy unity of effort and leads to a degradation of the enemy’s capabilities or will to fight. It attacks the cohesion of enemy formations and their ability to employ combined arms approaches and work effectively together,' the Army manual explains. EXCLUSIVE: New Joint Force space doctrine clarifies Space Command's &#8216;offensive,' &#8216;defensive' ops The stress on the concept's application to space operations, according to Brooks and Cobos, is something relatively new in the Army Space Vision. 'The new part of it really is the requirement at tactical echelons for tactical organizations to be able to interdict an adversary's use of space,' Cobos said. The personnel with the new 40 MOS designation would be integrated with a number of different Army units. First, they would serve in the seven 'space control planning teams' under the 1st Space Brigade, that work with the various regional combatant commands, Cobos said. Those planning teams already are embedded in 'multiple theaters,' he said, and coordinate with Space Force components to provide the combatant commander with planning and 'targeting' solutions — based on what capabilities are required for a specific task. 'That is exactly how we do fires across a whole bunch of things, from cruise missiles that come off of submarines or destroyers to the fires that the Army can bring and the fires that the Air Force can be able to service,' Cobos explained. 'Fires' is a military term signifying using weapons to create lethal and/or nonlethal effects on targets. Army officials have previously said that they only intend to take 'non-kinetic' actions to disrupt, degrade or destroy adversary space systems, such as electromagnetic warfare and cyber operations. OP ED: The Army has a vital role in space, and it continues to grow So for space 'fires,' Cobos said the Army can provide tactical capabilities for discreet, close-up-and-personal operations against enemy facilities or systems that perhaps the other services can't. A commander thus could decide that 'instead of this really large system over right here that's tethered — and it requires a lot of power and bandwidth and has a huge footprint and signal,' it was better to choose a 'surgical tool' such as a 'small force' that could get into the 'extended deep' region of the battlefield 'to be able to do this very small thing,' he said. Space specialists also will make up a 'space control company' under the new Theater Strike Effects Group (TSEG) pilot at Indo-Pacific Command. That TSEG, which is designed to undertake those interdiction operations, was approved along with the Army Space Vision. That pilot will achieve initial operating capability on Oct. 1, 2027, Cobos said. 'It will initially stand up with space control electronic warfare capabilities,' Brooks said. Over time, the TSEG will move on to 'fielding and building the counter-surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities, high-altitude and [navigation war] formations as well.' SMDC also hopes to soon be able to add a TSEG for European Command, following a month-long 'experiment-slash-exercise' that he said has helped prove the unit's value. 'I'm a little biased; I was the commander of the TSEG for that exercise, but I really do believe that we won over a lot of the leaders in EUCOM,' Brooks said. Finally, the specialists also will support the Army's Multi-Domain Task Forces, which each will have a space control company. The service has three such task forces and is 'soon going to grow the fourth and fifth,' Brooks said. 'We're very much complimentary to the Space Force and to the other services, but we truly do see space as that critical component to set the theater well in advance of phase one operations &#8230; when the first round is shot, the missile is shot, space needs to be there months, if not years, in advance to help set those conditions,' he said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/to-attack-enemy-space-capabilities-army-eyes-doubling-expert-cadre/	2024-10-09T11:44:40-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/Army-1st-Space-brigade-exercise-with-UK-soldiers-Feb.-2024-e1728492154389.jpg
Trump wants NATO to hit 3 percent GDP on defense. The US could fall short	On March 11, 2024 the Pentagon and military services presented their fiscal year 2025 budget requests. (Graphic by Breaking Defense, original images courtesy DVIDS, Getty) Donald Trump wants to raise the bar for NATO, with the former president pledging that if he wins in November he will push NATO allies to raise the target for their defense budgets from two to three percent of gross domestic product (GDP). US allies and partners can and should spend more on defense. A NATO in which allies spent 3 percent of GDP would undoubtedly mean a stronger alliance and a safer Europe. But to meet that standard — and more importantly meet the military challenge posed by China — the United States will have to spend more on defense too. It is simple mathematics that the United States cannot meet a '3 percent of GDP' standard in the coming years without a significantly higher defense budget. Pushing that standard abroad while advocating flat defense spending at home verges on strategic hypocrisy — an assertion of '3 percent for thee but not for me.' The United States barely meets the 3 percent of GDP standard today. But according to budget projections from the Congressional Budget Office, meeting that goal four years from now, at the end of a potential second Trump administration, would require a US defense budget of $1.03 trillion, roughly $109 billion more than today. To hit that target, defense spending would need to grow by 2.9 percent each year until 2029, and even faster in future years. But over the last decade, the average annual increase to the military’s budget was just 0.9 percent. Even with its budget growing at 3.4 percent per year, the Department of Defense could still lose the buying power it needs to achieve and sustain an advantage against China in the Indo-Pacific. That’s because inflation and other sources of cost growth for the military regularly exceed inflation in the rest of the economy. Put simply, defense budgets that rise at inflation result in a shrinking, aging and less advanced military. Making matters worse, DoD appears to be underestimating the cost of its own plans. According to the CBO, if cost growth follows long-term trends, defense costs from 2024 to 2038 would be nearly $600 billion higher than Pentagon leaders assume. 'Accommodating those higher costs,' warns the CBO, 'would require DoD to scale back its plans or request larger budgets than it anticipated.' The US defense budget isn’t set to meet arbitrary spending targets but to defend the nation against its adversaries. And with China first among them, a historically-low 3 percent of GDP simply will not do. President Ronald Reagan spent roughly 6 percent of GDP to defeat the Soviet Union. The United States spent almost 5 percent at the peak of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Bipartisan civilian and military experts have recognized the need for increased defense spending for years. Back in 2017, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Joe Dunford recommended that defense spending increase by 3 to 5 percent above inflation annually. That target was endorsed by the bipartisan 2018 Commission on the National Defense Strategy (NDS). The US has not met that goal over the last 6 years, leading the most recent 2024 NDS Commission to say 3 to 5 percent annual growth above inflation is the 'bare minimum' required. But many self-described 'realists' in Trump’s camp say higher defense budgets are politically unrealistic or would take too long to yield results. For instance, his former national security advisor predicts, 'Spending smarter will have to substitute for spending more.' More dramatically, Chris Miller, Trump’s former acting defense secretary who helped craft the Project 2025 document seen by many as a blueprint for a second Trump term, has called for cutting the defense budget in half. Ironically, many of those 'realists' are cheering on Trump’s demand that European nations provide 3 percent, arguing that that refusal to spend more on defense reveals naivete in allied capitals about the dangers that confront us. Perhaps, but much the same could be said here at home. The idea that the United States can prevail in a long-term competition with China with flat or declining budgets is fundamentally unserious. Higher defense spending will not be easy in Washington or in any NATO capital, but the perceived politics of the moment must not prevent us from answering the real demands of the future. It is far cheaper to deter a war than to fight one. That’s why a greater commitment to defense is needed on both sides of the Atlantic.

After troubles, a future upgrade, better availability should put NH90 in clearer skies: NHI CEO	A Swedish NH90 maritime helicopter on display at the Uppsala Air Show (Breaking Defense) BELFAST — After a series of high-profile toubles, the NH90 multirole helicopter program is set up for long-term success, built off plans for a future Block 2 upgrade, new commercial sales opportunities, better fleet availability rates, supply chain improvements and reduction in maintenance processes, according to the aircraft manufacturer’s top official. Cancelled orders, delivery delays, poor availability rates and high operational costs have long damaged the reputation of the platform, but Alex Aloccio, NHIndustries (NHI) CEO, told reporters on Tuesday that he expects it to be 'around for at least another 50 to 60 years' and that the program has entered 'a very exciting time.' He referred to the timeframe target as 'a fact' not an 'ambition' because it correlates to the level of investment customers have placed in the rotorcraft. 'There is plenty of potential left in the platform,' Aloccio added, during an Airbus Helicopters press day held at the company’s production facility in Marignane, France. NHI is a joint collaboration between Airbus, Leonardo and GKN Aerospace/Fokker Technologies. (Breaking Defense accepted travel and accommodation for the trip.) Aloccio shared that the manufacturer has been in conversation with current NH90 customers for 'close to one year' about the new Block 2 upgrade, though 'main technologies' have not been agreed. 'We talk about [potentially] increasing the payload of the aircraft, because there's still some juice left in the airframe, in the engine, dynamic components &#8230; and how do we connect the drone,' he noted, referring to the option of introducing manned-unmanned teaming capabilities. Separately, Belgium, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands signed up for development of the NH90’s Software Release 3 upgrade in June, which includes integration of the new Link 22 datalink, Leonardo's LEOSS-T Electro-Optical gimbal, sonar equipment and 'additional weapons integration,' according to an NHI statement. Additionally, Aloccio said 'lots of commercial opportunities' are available and noted The Netherlands commitment in September to acquire additional NH90s. He not disclose any potential new customers by name. Opening up on past supply chain problems, Aloccio admitted that 'there was a lack of understanding from everyone, including ourselves, on the speed at which we need to deliver and to resupply &#8230; parts into the system,' and that 'we were a bit undersized against what was expected from our customer.' As part of a company-wide improvement push, with availability rates as the 'main topic' to resolve, individual action plans for suppliers have been established, in addition to an effort to simplify aircraft maintenance plans. NHI also increased speed of deliveries for Priority Item List (PIL) — critical supply chain items — by 15 percent last year and is on track to hit a target of another '15-20 percent' again by the end of this year, said Aloccio. A number of the PIL items are manufactured by companies belonging to NHI, effectively meaning supply chain issues are, in part, the manufacturers' own fault. He noted 'limiting factor' parts cover items like main gear boxes, blades, mission equipment and cargo hooks. The industrial mistakes of the past have cost NHI dearly in recent years. Australia, Norway and Sweden have all decided to walk away from NH90 acquisitions even after they had received aircraft. In a stinging assessment upon axing the program in June 2022, Norway’s Defense Minister Bjørn Arild Gram, said, 'Regrettably, we have reached the conclusion that no matter how many hours our technicians work, and how many parts we order, it will never make the NH90 capable of meeting the requirements of the Norwegian Armed Forces.' Oslo vowed at the time to fight for compensation worth nearly 5 billion kroner ($525 million); NHI said then it refuted Norway's allegations and said the termination of the agreement was 'legally groundless.' During the recent trip Aloccio revealed that mediation between NHI and Norway has since 'failed,' resulting in the initiation of legal proceedings. 'They took us to court and we are taking them to court,' he said, suggesting NHI has put forward a counter claim to Norway's compensation demand. 'There are two claims which are merged into one claim,' added Aloccio. 'So in the end, it's just one big dispute and and it's just one judge.' An Oslo court will begin hearing the case 'next year,' he added. Norway's NH90 fleet, 14 aircraft in total, have not flown since the decision was made to cancel the acquisition, according to Aloccio, and they remain in storage. Elsewhere, a buy back plan with Australia to return 4,000 MRH-90 Taipan (NH90 TTH) parts, valued at €250 million ($273 million) has commenced. Around 300 parts have so far been sent back to NHI, said Aloccio. The move was prompted by Canberra's decision to prematurely retire its MRH-90 Taipan (NH90 TTH) fleet, after initially grounding it when an aircraft involved in the Exercise Talisman Sabre crashed off the Whitsunday Islands in July 2023. RELATED: Australia reveals why it isn't sending grounded Taipan helicopters to Ukraine In the case of Sweden, NH90 availability rates have significantly improved, Aloccio said. He specifically stated that flight hours of the Nordic nation's fleet jumped by '60 percent' between January and August 2022 and the same period this year. Even so, there is no sign at the moment that Stockholm will go back on plans to cancel the program, driving forward instead with the acquisition of an additional 12 Lockheed Martin UH-60M Black Hawk helicopters.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/after-troubles-a-future-upgrade-and-better-availability-should-put-nh90-in-clearer-skies-nhi-ceo/	2024-10-09T09:35:19-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/11/NH90-Sweden-e1728486001307.jpg
AUKUS, Red Sea ops, unmanned systems: A chat with former Under SECNAV Erik Raven	Undersecretary of the Navy Erik Raven testifies before the Senate Armed Services Committee on military recruiting challenges, Washington, D.C., March 22, 2023. (US Air Force photo by Eric Dietrich) WASHINGTON — Erik Raven stepped down from his job at the Pentagon this past August, but he still has a lot to say about the US Navy. And just this week, his new employer, the Washington, DC-based strategic advisory firm Beacon Global Strategies, reached out to Breaking Defense to sit down with the former under secretary for a wide-ranging discussion about everything from AUKUS to unmanned systems. With two decades as a staffer in the Senate and just over two years as the Navy’s second most senior civilian, his arrival in the private sector is a significant change of pace. Sitting at a quaint café in northeast DC, just a few blocks from the White House, he was dressed comfortably in a suit with no tie, and lacking the usual entourage of aides, staffers and security guards that routinely shadow the Pentagon’s top leadership. He said since leaving his post as the under, he’s been thinking about the Navy’s operations in the Red Sea and the Mediterranean. While Raven appreciates the laudatory coverage given to the sailors who have conducted those operations, he said, in his view, there is something missing in the conversation. 'What we’re seeing today in the Red Sea could be replicated in many other regions and key critical straits and nodes across the world,' he explained. 'And so, I think taking apart what naval capabilities are bringing to that region today can be very instructive in how future conflicts may play out.' The following is a continuation of Breaking Defense’s conversation with Erik Raven. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. BREAKING DEFENSE: I’m sure you’ve seen the public discussions around the issue of the Navy using $1 million missiles to defeat drones that are worth a fraction of that cost. Is there a nuance the public doesn’t understand in this cost equation, or does the Navy just not have a better solution yet? ERIK RAVEN: There are probably a couple dimensions of this. One is the cost exchange. Everybody is right to be concerned about how much a missile costs that is defeating a drone that might cost $50 or $100,000 that’s being used to threaten commercial shipping. I would say the cost calculation that needs to be added to that $2 million missile against a $100,000 drone, [is that we’re] defending a ship or some other asset that may be worth hundreds of millions or perhaps even a billion dollars, depending what cargo it’s carrying. So, that has to enter the equation somehow. There are many promising technologies that could alter the balancing power on this exchange question, but I think a little peek into the operational context is also important here. The main reason we’re using long-range interceptors to defeat these threats is because we don’t want them to be within several kilometers [of] either a Navy ship carrying several hundred sailors or a commercial ship carrying hundreds of millions of dollars worth of cargo. Directed energy has a lot of promise, but right now it’s a short-range solution. Do you really want to have that threat be so close to the target before you can prosecute it? The USV Mariner, a US Navy research and development vessel, docked at the United States Naval Academy where it will be christened on Aug. 23, 2022. (Justin Katz/Breaking Defense) Let’s talk about another emerging technology. The Navy for several years now has been pitching Congress on the use of unmanned and autonomous systems to varying degrees of success. Do you think the Navy’s pitch is landing with Congress or are things getting lost in translation? I would say that this is broader than Navy and congressional discussion. I think it’s really about the Joint Force and where unmanned and autonomous technologies fit into present operations and future operations. I recall very well being in Congress, perhaps it was 10 years ago, when there was a lot of discussion about future aircraft. Do they really need to be manned? That autonomy is right around the corner. And if we look back to how far autonomy has advanced in the last 10 years, I think most people would say that’s a good conversation to have, but maybe at the time, it was a little premature. Autonomy is advancing. But do we have autonomy to the point where it can replace not only human capabilities to fuse information, often aided by AI and other exquisite technologies, but also make life or death decisions? I think we’re still at the cusp of a really robust debate about not only what the technology can do, but what policy makers and the American public is comfortable with in terms of autonomous systems making very important decisions. You announced during the budget rollout the Navy is aiming to hit its two-submarines-per-year delivery cadence by 2028. It’s an ambitious goal given the service’s history on this subject and will be crucial to make AUKUS’s first pillar a success. What’s the biggest hurdle to making it happen? I think that what we’re seeing now is challenges in the supply chain and challenges in workforce as the two top items that the Navy is really tracking [and] trying to trying to tackle. All credit to Congress that several years ago, even before it was built into Navy budgets, leaders in Congress were aware of the strain that was facing the submarine industrial base and started putting in hundreds of millions of dollars annually to get the suppliers up and running. I think that there has been really good progress made so far in terms of expanding the number of suppliers [and] attracting new entrants. On workforce, I think the underlying challenge here is that many Americans have a changing relationship with work, that they have different expectations of a career. They may have more interest in not staying with one company for their whole career, but moving around, maybe even between different industries. There’s going to be a continuing dialog [between Navy and industry] on not only how to attract workers and train them, but how to keep them interested in the submarine industrial base for the long term. The reason why that's so important is because if you’re training a welder or an electrician or a pipe fitter every couple of years, they don’t get that rich experience and productive capability that a journeyman or master welder has. That saves time, that saves money. That sort of experience is what puts the whole program on a better cadence to deliver for the national security goals. (Left to right) Australia Defense minister Richard Marles, UK Secretary of State for Defence John Healey and US Defense Secretary Llyod Austin kick off the third in-person AUKUS defense ministerial meeting at the Old Royal Naval College on Sept. 26. (Breaking Defense/ Ashley Roque) What has struck me about AUKUS’s second pillar is that it seems as though a lot of people are talking about inviting new countries to join the agreement. But most of the people extending invitations are not actually the power brokers with the authority to do it. What’s your sense of things inside the government? Is there an enthusiasm for other nations to join Pillar II? Let me separate the two issues. First is AUKUS, especially in regard to Pillar II. The objectives of that, as announced, are really to join with our two closest allies and create a defense innovation ecosystem that’s going to tackle some of the hardest but most promising technologies that we see that make a difference for military capabilities. That is kind of a prelude to a much larger discussion that I think is kicking off right now, and that is, how do we join with our allies and partners in creating defense ecosystems that serve all our national security needs? How do our allies and partners contribute to the needs of not only our national security, but their national security? I think what we’re seeing is a greater exploration of what it means to have an integrated and robust defense innovation ecosystem that includes our allies and partners, and it’s going to be an interesting policy discussion moving forward about how to reconcile the interest to make sure that we have a strong American industrial base with the fact that we have allies and partners who also need their own armaments and systems.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/aukus-red-sea-ops-unmanned-systems-a-chat-with-former-under-secnav-erik-raven/	2024-10-09T07:48:36-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/04/7696295-scaled-e1713379680313.jpg
Experts see Hezbollah ‘escalation’ in use of new missiles, as group weathers Israeli bombardment	A scaled model of Iran's first ultrasonic missile (Fattah) is carried by a truck during a protest gathering in Tehran, Iran, on September 28, 2024. (Photo by Morteza Nikoubazl/NurPhoto via Getty Images) 'Hundreds of rockets and dozens of aircraft, a great number of settlements and cities have come under rocket fire,' Naim Qassem, deputy leader of Hezbollah, said today in a televised speech in Arabic, with his use of 'aircraft' likely referring to drones. 'I would like to reassure you that our capabilities are fine.' Hezbollah's capacity to fight is a key question as the conflict in Lebanon intensifies, after the Israeli military said it has managed to take out several of the groups top leaders, in addition to striking hundreds of its members. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a video posted online today that Hezbollah is 'weaker than it has been for many, many years.' But as Israel has been striking Hezbollah, the group has been firing back — over 3,000 rockets and missiles in the last two weeks, according to the Israel Defense Forces. Experts specifically pointed to Hezbollah's use of several new projectiles, including the Qadr 1 ballistic missile, Noor cruise missiles and Fadi 4 and Falaq 2 rockets. Hezbollah claimed to have used the Qadr 1 last month and the others more recently, according to public statements. 'The use of new, more sophisticated missiles by Hezbollah signals an escalation as well as a political message to show off strength for deterrence, especially amid the step up by Netanyahu,' defense analyst Sine Özkaraşahin told Breaking Defense. She added that level and sophistication of the systems seen in the recent strikes show that 'Hezbollah is taking the fight deeper, most likely with Iran's support.' Ozkarsahin specified that the newly introduced missiles 'come with a greater payload, longer-range. For example, Qadr-1 is a guided ballistic missile with deep-strike capabilities, [a] significant shift from the unguided short-range rockets that used to dominate Hezbollah strikes.' Likewise, Stockholm International Peace Research Institute senior researcher Pieter Wezeman said that after Israel escalated its fight with Hezbollah in Lebanon, the use of the new missiles like likely the group's attempt to 'counter-escalate.' Wezeman also said that Hezbollah, likely spooked by Israel's ability to locate and kill senior members, may have opted a 'use-over-lose' approach to the missiles, firing them before they can be struck by Israel. IDF has been bombing what it considered Hezbollah missile and rocket warehouses in South Lebanon, the Beqaa Valley and the southern suburb of Beirut. In several instances, open sources and televised video footage show secondary explosions after a number of Israeli raids, suggesting explosives or armaments of some kind were stored in the facilities. Behnam Ben Taleblu, an analyst at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies think tank, said, however, that Hezbollah's current missiles and rocket barrages still aren't what the use of the Qadr 1 may have signaled at the time. '⁠With the exception of the Qadr, which is Hezbollah’s first ballistic missile fired ever at Israel — and is a variant of Iran’s older Fateh family of short-range ballistic missiles — most of the projectiles Hezbollah has fired at Israel have been unguided and spin-stabilized rockets, larger artillery, drones, and anti-tank weapons. This includes the Falaq and Fadi systems,' he said. He stressed that Hezbollah 'used this cocktail to incrementally widen the war of attrition imposed on Israel starting on October 8 last year. The use of the Qadr several weeks back however as a guided projectile had the potential to be a game changer if part of a larger campaign to move towards more missile use than rockets. But Israel’s rapid and bold string of military successes against Hezbollah prevented this trial ballon from being floated.' Ben Taleblu also said Hezbollah isn't the only enemy of Israel apparently escalating its use of missiles 'Iran’s employment of more solid-propellant systems in its October barrage against Israel, and in general employing nearly double the amount of ballistic missiles marks a clear shift,' Ben Taleblu said, adding that the use of a new Fattah missile was a 'historic first and a sign that Tehran indeed wanted to strike at Israeli targets and was willing to up the ante compares to the April attack.' 'Iran chose to escalate after absorbing a series of setbacks to its regional terror network that did away in days what the Islamic Republic took years to build and cultivate,' Ben Taleblu said. As for whether the new missiles have actually been more effective, Israel reported no deaths outside a man killed in the West Bank in the more recent barrage by Iran. Still, Wezeman said reports indicate some projectiles launched then appear to have gotten through, suggesting they 'have a higher chance of penetrating the missile defenses that Israel and its allies have available.' Hezbollah's Qadr-1 missile, the Israelis say, was intercepted before it could strike its target.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/experts-see-hezbollah-escalation-in-use-of-new-missiles-as-group-weathers-israeli-bombardment/	2024-10-08T12:41:36-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/241008_iran_fattah_missile_model_GettyImages-2174646049-scaled-e1728415175396.jpg
An Army helicopter takes on new roles, including as a FLRAA testbed	UH-60M Black Hawk in flight. (Lockheed Martin photo). It’s fair to say that with 4,000 UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters flying worldwide, the next important role for the utility helicopter is going to be interoperability with the U.S. Army’s newest aircraft type coming into the fleet – the Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA). To prepare UH-60s for that eventuality and to serve as a present-day Future Vertical Lift testbed for new capabilities such as launched effects, the Army’s modernization efforts are largely focused on re-engining under the Improved Turbine Engine Program (ITEP), plus Modular Open Systems Approach (MOSA) and the digital backbone. 'The Army has made a significant capital investment in rotary wing platforms up and to this point,' said Army Col. Ryan Nesrsta, program manager for Utility Helicopters at U.S. Army PEO Aviation. 'In light of that decision and investment, there’s going to be an extant requirement for interoperability [and] pacing the threat with respect to survivability. 'There’s going to be continued relevance for the rotary wing fleet to interoperate with tiltrotor aircraft in any theater of operations. It requires judicious and continued investment in the portfolio to ensure that the Future Vertical Lift family of systems is enabled.' A key piece of that strategy was the delivery earlier this year of two GE Aerospace T901 ITEP flight-test engines for the UH-60M Black Hawk, replacing the GE T700 powerplants. 'We [recently] had a meeting with the enterprise – our partners from GE and Lockheed Martin – on how we address the nuanced challenges of engine airframe compatibility,' said Nesrsta, noting that the last time such an integration was done was in the 2007 timeframe, when GE’s YT706 turboshaft engine was fitted to an Army special operations MH-60M helicopter. A key piece of the Army's strategy for rotary wing modernization is the Improved Turbine Engine Program, under which two GE Aerospace T901 ITEP flight-test engines for the UH-60M Black Hawk were delivered earlier this year to replace GE T700 powerplants. (Lockheed Martin photo). 'There’s lessons learned from previous experience, but knowing that there’s a significant learning curve with respect to the integration of an engine on even a mature platform,' he said. 'Design for integration has been ongoing on the UH-60M with the delivery of the engines; physical integration has begun in earnest.' Sikorsky notes that the ITEP engine offers 50 percent more power than the T700 and an increase in fuel efficiency, giving the aircraft more range and payload. 'The new ITEP will give division commanders more options for planning and executing assault missions,' said Hamid Salim, vice president for Army &amp; Air Force Systems, Lockheed Martin Sikorsky. 'This will be a game changer for the Army, and also for the National Guard units. The ITEP also enhances safety, reduces operating costs and provides growth for the future needs of the warfighter.' For the next steps, the Army Utility Helicopters Project Office (UHPO) and the Aviation Turbine Engines Project Office are working toward a first flight of the ITEP-powered Black Hawk in late FY25, early FY26. MOSA and interoperability for multi-domain operations The ongoing transformation in the role of rotary wing aircraft, in particular the UH-60M Black Hawk, in a 21st century security environment will allow it to play a critical role in multi-domain operations and Joint All Domain Command and Control. 'In multi-domain operations, Army Aviation will be able to ‘extend’ to distances at 500 km with ITEP,' an Army Aviation Center of Excellence spokesperson noted. 'Combined with launched effects, Army aircraft will be able to ‘reach’ and prosecute targets at double the current range. Combined with support of layered air defense, electronic attack and preparatory fire missions creating multi-domain effects, Army Aviation [can] reach beyond the FLOT (forward line of own troops) in support of the ground commander. 'Rotary wing aircraft will still move people and equipment faster than ground vehicles or watercraft. In JADC2, Army rotary wing aircraft will link into mesh networks to pass data to commanders across the battlefield to foster a joint common operating picture, either as a deliberate airborne node or while executing their other mission tasks. A common joint air picture enhances survivability, improves engagement times, and provides situational understanding reducing the fog of war.' Lockheed Martin Sikorsky's modernization efforts for the Black Hawk are largely focused on the ITEP engine, MOSA with the digital backbone, and launched effects. (Lockheed Martin graphic). MOSA is the lens through which much of that will occur, with the UHPO focused on delivering a Black Hawk that supports the Army of 2040 plan, is capable of operating within the air-ground littoral, and maintains fleet reliability and relevance through 2070. 'We intend to do this through Modular Open Systems Architecture, general obsolescence management, IT integration, and survivability and air vehicle modernization opportunities,' said Nesrsta. 'UHPO continues to work closely with industry partners to provide demand signals around these initiatives. We’re receptive to industry input for providing more adaptable, affordable systems that are capable of incorporating rapid technologies and upgrades to counter evolving threats.' For its part, Sikorsky is leveraging significant MOSA investments from the discontinued Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA) program and applying that to Black Hawk to demonstrate rapid integration of new capability such as crewed-uncrewed teaming. 'We’re demonstrating the benefit of digital infrastructures that allow our customer to make organic changes to the aircraft while enabling distributed situational awareness,' said Salim. 'Black Hawk could carry and manage a squadron of launched effects drones to be the forward-deployed eyes and ears for the division commander. We’ve been doing this both in Future Vertical Lift and Black Hawk simulators and aircraft, showing how these assets can seamlessly work together to give our ground commanders a tactical edge.' Autonomous Black Hawk In late 2022 at that year’s Army Project Convergence demonstration, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and Lockheed Martin successfully demonstrated an uncrewed Black Hawk performing a battlefield resupply of blood, a simulated casualty evacuation, and an external sling load cargo resupply mission at high speed at 200 feet of altitude to simulate the battle environment. DARPA and Lockheed Martin Sikorsky fly the optionally piloted Black Hawk, which includes the MATRIX autonomy solution. (Lockheed Martin photo). 'We’ve continued to explore that capability, and have worked with DARPA on what is a planned technology transition agreement to further mature those technologies that lend to tech maturation and risk reduction of what are FLRAA’s requirements for an optionally piloted vehicle capability,' said Nesrsta. 'We’re actively pursuing multiple efforts to further mature sensor fusion, autonomous algorithms, and full authority fly-by-wire flight controls as part of our general modernization strategy within the utility office. These three distinct but interrelated lines of effort will evolve from a spectrum of cognitive offloading, to minimally crewed, to ultimately an optimally or optionally crewed system.' It is this approach that the Army expects will reduce technical risk for the acceleration and integration of autonomy, not just in Black Hawk, but also for FLRAA’s subsequent Increment 2, which in addition to autonomy is also expected to include advanced avionics and an expansion of launched effects. Lockheed Martin has also continued to expand the autonomy system it calls MATRIX, which forms the core of DARPA's ALIAS (Aircrew Labor In-cockpit Automation System) project that enabled the autonomous Black Hawk demonstrations. In addition to the PC22 demo, Sikorsky has demonstrated how the autonomous Black Hawk demonstrator can quickly launch and navigate itself to drop water on a wildfire soon after detection, and how an uncrewed Black Hawk controlled by MATRIX can resupply troops in contested airspace. Continuing relevance Black Hawk operators in Europe are focused on Ukraine, while in the Indo-Pacific it’s security and deterrence. U.S. priorities for the UH-60, other rotary wing platforms, and the next-generation of Army aircraft include those requirements in addition to modernization for greater range and payload, interoperability, contested logistics, and leveraging crewed-uncrewed capabilities. 'The FLRAA platform provides a great capability to air assault soldiers from relative sanctuary in friendly and secure areas to deep into adversary territory, far beyond what we can do today,' noted the Army Aviation Center of Excellence. 'Black Hawks will still be needed for shorter distances, while the Chinook remains the only heavy lift vertical aircraft and the Apache the only attack aircraft in the Army Inventory. Army Aviation exists to support the soldier on the ground, regardless of the aviation platform – manned or unmanned.' As such, it’s likely that the modernizations across those platforms – including the newest version of the AH-64E Apache with V6.5 software and the CH-47F Block II program – means that Black Hawk, Apache, and Chinook will likely remain a part of military operations for the next half century. 'In lower-tier air domain, nothing performs better than a helicopter,' said Salim. 'Black Hawk offers versatility, reach and access across varying terrain for a wide array of missions from air assault to frontline resupply and humanitarian relief. 'But we’ve got to evolve that capability for tomorrow’s missions, like installing new engines for improved turbine power to ultimately provide lift and fuel efficiency, giving commanders more flexibility. MOSA will make upgrading the enduring platform faster and easier. Crewed and uncrewed teaming will deliver critical network capabilities and intelligence in contested environments while keeping pilots and soldiers out of harm’s way.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/an-army-helicopter-takes-on-new-roles-including-as-a-flraa-testbed/	2024-10-08T11:34:51-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/Black-Hawk-Photo.jpg

AFRL moves toward flight testing satellite internet radios under Global Lightning	Air Force Research Laboratory is developing antennas and radios that can link with multiple satellite internet constellations from aircraft, ships and ground vehicles. (Photo: AFRL) WASHINGTON — The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) is planning flight tests in late 2025 and early 2026 of prototype antennas and radio receivers capable switching between multiple commercial satellite internet constellations — a capability that would both make them more difficult to jam and serve as an enabler of the Pentagon's planned Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) network. Under the program nicknamed Global Lightning, AFRL researchers hope to see this kit eventually make its way not only into airborne systems used by the Air Force, but also to platforms used by the other services, said Brian Beal, principal aerospace engineer at AFRL's Strategic Development Planning and Experimentation Office. 'I've talked the most about aircraft, because in a lot of ways, that's the most technically challenging, and also, as an Air Force employee it's my primary focus. But we do also work with Navy, Coast Guard and Army for tests on ground vehicles and ships, as well as stationary [ground systems]. Although you don't need anything as complex as what we're doing for stationary applications; you kind of get that as a bonus,' he told Breaking Defense. 'The end game is, if we're wildly successful &#8230; I would expect different program offices to start adopting this and and fielding it,' he added. This could include having the Space Force's Commercial Satellite Communications Office serve as a middleman for contracting out services from commercial providers, as Beal explained already has happened with two of the vendors AFRL worked with under its initial Global Lightning contracts. Beal noted that AFRL further is working closely with the Space Development Agency (SDA), which is developing its own version of a space-based internet in low Earth orbit (LEO) under its Transport Layer program. 'One of the guiding principles of what we're trying to do is that these radios should be able to talk to many different constellations, and they should be able to add waveforms and control for new constellations as they become available. So, one of the constellations that that the radios will be able to talk to is the SDA Transport Layer.' AFRL launched the Global Lightning program with contracts in 2018, somewhat confusingly under the formal title 'Defense Experimentation Using Commercial Space Internet (DEUCSI).' Up to now, the lab has spent almost $500 million in experimental contracts to 11 different vendors. 'There's about seven key contracts between the antenna vendors and the multiband radio vendors,' Beal said. 'So the the multiband radios are L3Harris, Northrop Grumman SES Space and Defense, and Intelsat General. Whereas the antennas are Northrop Grumman, RTX and Viasat. Those are the primes. And then there are also relevant subcontracts to additional antenna providers.' AFRL currently has an annual budget of about $160 million for Global Lightning, he said, but that the sum varies somewhat year-to-year as new contracts are signed and others are phased out. The most recent contracts were issued under what is known as DEUSCI Call 4, aimed at prototyping multiband antennas that can link to Ku-band and Ka-band satellites in LEO, medium Earth orbit (MEO) and geosynchronous Earth orbit (GEO). RTX in August was awarded $51.7 million; Viasat in September was awarded $33 million. Air Force Research Laboratory is experimenting with antennas and receivers capable of linking to multiple satellite internet constellations. (Image: AFRL) The goal is for these antennas to be able to interface with modems and transceivers developed in the previous contract stage, called DEUCSI Call 3. Under that solicitation, AFRL in 2023 contracted with Intelsat General, SES Space and Defense (the American arm of Luxembourg-based SES), Northrop Grumman, L3Harris and RTX for a total of some $250 million according to government contracting documents. Beal explained that 'at the highest level, there's sort of been two stages of Global Lightning.' The earliest awards were experimenting with linkages to individual satellite constellations, such as SpaceX's Starlink. AFRL has moved on from 'single vendor testing' to 'multi-vendor, multi-constellation SATCOM,' he said. 'What I mean by that is we are developing with our commercial partners, and then flight testing and tech transitioning, systems that can communicate with multiple constellations using the same hardware,' Beal said. 'In particular, we care a lot about being able to be multi-orbit. So, we're in the process of making systems that will communicate with LEO, GEO and MEO orbits, both commercial and military, and across multiple frequency bands.' In other words, the idea is to create what sometimes is known in Pentagon circles as a 'hybrid SATCOM' network. The 'real impetus' of the Global Lightning program is that 'one of the biggest barriers to entry on using a new SATCOM system is actually getting the hardware, in particular the antenna, installed and integrated into an aircraft,' Beal explained. 'So, the thought process here is put on very capable hardware that can communicate with multiple systems, and then we can move from constellation to constellation as business needs dictate. ' Beal said the goals for the upcoming flight tests will gradually increase in complexity, starting with ensuring the antennas and radio receivers can keep 'reliable, stable connections to any particular constellation.' Then tests will be run that stress those connections with aircraft maneuvers to find out, for example, how far a plane can bank before dropping connectivity. 'We'll measure some basic technical parameters like that, and then we move into the real heart of it, which is the multi-constellation piece. So, we'll measure things like when we switch from Spacecraft A to Spacecraft B, how long does that transition take? What are any wrinkles that we run into when making that switch?' Beal said. 'The expectation is that we will bounce between those constellations in the same flight, so we'll move between them. Now, I don't think anybody should be guaranteeing that on flight one,' he stressed. 'We're going to improve as we go and get to that, but that is the goal of the program.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/afrl-moves-toward-flight-testing-satellite-internet-radios-under-global-lightning/	2024-10-08T11:06:10-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/global-lightning0124_SS2_feature.png
DIA ‘almost done’ with JWICS tech refresh goal to enhance network resiliency	Doug Cossa, Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) Chief Information Officer (CIO), speaks on the Intelligence Community CIO Panel at the 2021 Department of Defense Intelligence Information System (DoDIIS) worldwide conference on December 7, 2021. (Myles Scrinopskie / Defense Intelligence Agency WASHINGTON — The Defense Intelligence Agency is on the verge of completing a much-needed update to the Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communication System (JWICS) to make the system more resilient to outages, DIA Chief Information Officer Doug Cossa said this morning. Over the past two years, the DIA set the goal of performing a 'tech refresh' on the JWICS, the Pentagon’s secure network that hosts top secret and sensitive compartmented information. The JWICS was created during the Gulf War as the DIA had to figure out how to transmit secure voice and video to the Pentagon. 'We are almost done with tech refresh. We're essentially there,' Cossa said during an Intelligence and National Security Alliance webinar this morning. 'That has been the focus over the past two years, since we started the program, really replacing the antiquated infrastructure, especially where we have critical nodes.' He added that this 'tech refresh' doesn’t necessarily mean just updating the JWICS at the device level, meaning routers, switches and encryption, but includes 'everything that goes along with providing connectivity' and making the JWICS more resilient. The goal is to catch outages before they occur, Cossa said. 'It's a mesh network to where, if one point goes down, you've got alternate routes, just like a highway system, right?' he said. 'You don't want to just have one exit. You want multiple on ramps and off ramps. That’s where we are on the tail end of completing.' 'So how do we move into software-defined networking, to where we can identify error issues or errors early? You know, in the past, as we've experienced networking problems, it's always an after-the-fact of, ‘Okay, what happened?’' he said. 'How do we move that question up front before an outage occurs?' The tech refresh is only one part of modernizing the JWICS, which has been in the works since 2021. Cossa said the DIA is also focused on enhancing the cybersecurity and automation capabilities of the system. Related: Top secret info-sharing: DIA info chief sees modernizing JWICS as top priority in 2024 This automation process, which will harness artificial intelligence, will eventually help in catching errors before they cause serious consequences like outages or the theft of information — whether by foreign hackers or insider bad actors. 'Really the aim over three years, it's enhancing the monitoring of network traffic and connectivity, and then, of course, automating the management of that as we start to see anomalies. And then especially from the cybersecurity side, is how do we isolate parts of the network that aren't operating towards their norm? And that's where a lot of that AI as I mentioned comes in,' Cossa said today. At the upcoming Department of Defense Intelligence Information System, or DoDIIS, conference later this month, the DIA will continue looking for industry solutions to transforming the JWICS from a manual system to an automated system. 'That's really what the next generation of the JWICS architecture looks like. It's taking the person out of the loop, and the management of that, and then looking at ways to automate that in a smart kind of way. That's definitely a big priority [and] will remain a big priority for the next several years,' Cossa said today when asked about this year's DoDIIS themes. 'So you'll see a lot of discussion on that, but you will also see a lot of breakout sessions on the automation of networks and the security of networks,' he added.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/dia-almost-done-with-jwics-tech-refresh-goal-to-enhance-network-resiliency/	2024-10-08T10:11:02-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/6969382-scaled-e1728406222375.jpg
America’s greatest adversary? Kamala Harris says Iran is ‘an obvious’ answer	Vice President Kamala Harris waves after arriving at Ellington Field JRB and being greeted by Chief Master Sergeant Bennie Bellvin, 147th Attack Wing Command Chief and Colonel Bif French, 147th Attack Wing Commander, July 24, 2024. (U.S. Air National Guard photo by Tech. Sgt. Stacy Cooper) WASHINGTON — Though the Defense Department and the Intelligence Community have long identified China as America's number one geopolitical challenge, when Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris was asked who America's top 'adversary' is, she said one 'obvious' answer, right now, sits 5,600 miles west of Beijing. 'I think there's an obvious one in mind, which is Iran,' Harris said during an excerpt of a '60 Minutes' interview. 'Iran has American blood on their hands, okay? This attack on Israel, 200 ballistic missiles, what we need to do to ensure that Iran never achieves the ability to be a nuclear power, that is one of my highest priorities.' After the vice president declined to answer a 'hypothetical' about how the US would respond to evidence Iran was pursuing a nuclear weapon, '60 Minutes' interviewer Bill Whitaker asked a follow-up question: 'What about China?' In her response, Harris framed America's relationship with the Pacific power in economic terms, saying the US 'must win the competition for the 21st century with China.' 'We must be able to compete and win. We should not seek conflict, but we have to understand that there are parameters in which we much operate that include ensuring, for example, that we protect American business interests,' she said. Asked if the US would intervene should China invade Taiwan, Harris declined to get into that hypothetical as well and reiterated the Biden administration's adherence to the one China policy, 'but that includes supporting Taiwan's ability to defend itself, including what we need to do to ensure freedom of the Taiwan Strait.' Harris's assesment of Iran as the number one adversary doesn't quite match official statements from the Pentagon and IC, which put China as far and away the most pressing geopolitical challenge — impetus for the DoD's years-long, stop-and-start 'pivot to the Pacific' effort. For instance, in the Biden administration's official National Defense Strategy, Bejing is described as America's 'pacing challenge,' compared to Russia's 'acute threat.' Iran is typically relegated to a group of dangerous 'regional' actors. The IC's 2024 Worldwide Threat Assessment [PDF] likewise first addresses China as having the 'capability to directly compete' with the US to challenge the global order and Russia as a 'threat' to that same order. Iran, it says, threatens US 'interests, allies, and influence in the Middle East and intends to entrench its emergent status as a regional power ....' But analyst Becca Wasser told Breaking Defense that observers shouldn't read too much into Harris's answer as forecasting a change in priorities in a potential Harris administration, as much as a 'recognition of what the current challenge is.' 'Maybe that answer doesn't comport with what the current National Defense Strategy says, but there is the reality of acknowledging the ways in which Iran has, time and time again, complicated US efforts to focus elsewhere,' said Wasser, a senior fellow for the Defense Program at the Center for New American Security. The '60 Minutes' interview was broadcast amid a devastating conflict in the Middle East between Israel and Iran-backed proxies in the region, including Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, and just a week after Iran launched 180 ballistic missiles at Israel. Millions of civilians are caught in the middle, and it's a conflict that perpetually threatens to spiral into a wider regional war that could draw in American forces. Wasser said she wouldn't have necessarily put Iran at the top of her list of adversaries, but said she didn't believe Harris was 'wrong' that Iran is 'an obvious answer for one of the potential threats that faces America today and could face America tomorrow.' 'If you looking at the current threat environment, the current world in which [we] stand, Iran does stand out as truly one of the most relevant adversaries that is actually causing problems for the United States at this very moment,' she said. 'You hear a lot about China as a DoD &#8216;pacing' challenge, but that is a long-term challenge. And so here I think we have to sort of view her answer in different time frames.' Wasser also suggested it's possible Harris may have taken issue with Whitaker's use of the word 'adversary' in the original question, as the Biden administration, including the Pentagon, has attempted to frame American competition with China as just that — a competition, not a conflict. 'It is a US-China strategic competition; war with China is not inevitable,' Wasser said, noting that it's an eventuality the Biden administration has been trying to avoid 'at all costs.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/americas-greatest-adversary-kamala-harris-says-iran-is-an-obvious-answer/	2024-10-08T09:23:31-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/241008_DVIDS_kamala_harris_8552393-scaled-e1728403539598.jpg
The incubator from whence tomorrow’s radars, missiles, and jammers emerge	Raytheon’s Advanced Technology business makes extensive use of modeling and simulation in sensor and weapons development. Shown are renderings of the SPY-6 naval radar. (Raytheon image) The torpedoes, radars, missiles, and satellites that will be in the Defense Department’s arsenal of the future are being defined and crafted today by Raytheon’s Advanced Technology business whose job it is to turn next-generation technologies into real-world warfighting capabilities. This is the organization, for example, where the Air Force’s hypersonic air-breathing weapon, HACM, was conceived, designed, and matured. Colin Whelan, president of Raytheon’s Advanced Technology (AT) business, gave us a high-level look at the team. In two follow-up stories, AT will discuss: the flexible foundational building blocks it uses when developing new radar and weapon capabilities (such as software defined-apertures and composable weapons); and the importance of modeling and simulation in demonstrating radar and weapon system capabilities through its Rapid Campaign Analysis Demonstration Environment (RCADE) that analyzes capabilities at the theater level. Breaking Defense: Advanced Technology is RTX’s capability incubator business for Raytheon. How do you address future defense challenges? Colin Whelan is president of Raytheon Advanced Technology. Whelan: RTX is transforming innovative research into technologies that shape the future of aerospace and defense. At Advanced Technology, we approach our customer’s challenges from theater- and mission-level perspectives. I’ve spent the last 25 years working across the company to ensure we give our warfighters an unfair advantage on the battlefield. The output of the ‘AT team’ as we like to call it, spans the development of individual components to full-scale solutions, early ideation to production readiness, and from seabed to space. AT works to understand the future threat landscape and we shape our technology development for what our warfighters will need for the future fight, rather than only what may be written in a requirements document today. The team operates seamlessly across the entire RTX enterprise that also includes Collins Aerospace and Pratt &amp; Whitney, while routinely partnering with small businesses and academia to ensure we’re always bringing our customers the best, most innovative and capable solutions. What are some of the well-known DoD programs that were birthed and matured within the Advanced Technology business before they were handed off to the other Raytheon business units? This team has helped define, architect, and propel some of Raytheon’s most well-known franchise programs such as: the Navy’s SPY-6 radar on carriers and destroyers; the Army’s Air and Missile Defense LTAMDS radar complementing our Patriot system; the Air Force’s hypersonic air-breathing weapon, HACM; and the Next Generation Jammer, the Navy’s latest electronic warfare system for the EA-18 GROWLER. Why are you pulling back the curtain, so to speak, on Raytheon AT at this point? It’s always been hard to say much about what we do. The world has changed rather significantly in the recent past, but the AT team has been thinking about ways to solve for the emerging need for faster fielding, with more capabilities and at lower costs, for a long time. We are delivering many of those systems today. We leverage our expertise in systems integration and mission-level solutions to help define future product roadmaps. And thanks to the flexible foundational building block architecture that I mentioned earlier, our solutions can quickly receive customizable features enabled through software. How is AT translating that into new capabilities in radars/sensing and weapons? From a sensing system development perspective, AT is focused on harnessing the full capabilities of the RF spectrum. We’ve created a software-defined aperture architecture rather than a conventional radar approach to produce flexible hardware solutions that serve multiple missions with ‘software apps’ like on your cell phone. Fielded and future programs are receiving these upgrades today. From a new weapon-development lens, reuse once again becomes a catalyst for speed. Over the last decade, we have architected the use of common, scalable, Lego-like hardware and software building blocks, allowing us to go faster and streamline our factories. Final thoughts? I’m incredibly fortunate to be a part of Raytheon’s Advanced Technology business, and I see the impact our work makes to ensure the safety of our nation and allies around the world regularly. Our team is an agile one, built for speed. We take the challenge of developing next-generation defense technologies very seriously, and I look forward to being able to share more about our work soon.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/the-incubator-from-whence-tomorrows-radars-missiles-and-jammers-emerge/	2024-10-08T05:20:28-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/Raytheons-Advanced-Technology-business-makes-extensive-use-of-modeling-and-simulation-in-sensor-and-weapons-development.-Shown-are-renderings-of-the-SPY-6-naval-radar.-Raytheon-image-scaled.jpg
As Hurricane Milton intensifies, military bases in Florida prepare to weather another serious storm	The Arleigh-Burke class guided-missile destroyer USS Thomas Hudner (DDG 116) returned to Naval Station Mayport after an eight month deployment, Jan. 4, 2024. (U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class Brandon J. Vinson) WASHINGTON — As Hurricane Milton barrels down on the Florida coast, the US military there is once again working to move assets, prepare personnel and lock down equipment to weather the storm — just days after it had to make similar moves ahead of Hurricane Helene. Milton continued to gather strength Monday, rapidly swelling into a Category 5 storm. Current projections expect it to make landfall late Wednesday or early Thursday in the Tampa area, by which time it should have weakened somewhat, but still risking over 10 feet of storm surge for some areas still struggling to clean up from Helene’s aftermath. Tampa is home to MacDill Air Force Base, the headquarters of US Special Operations Command. The base evacuated 12 KC-135 refueling aircraft to McConnell Air Force Base in Kansas and are keeping two in a hangar on site, according to Department of the Air Force spokesperson Rose Riley. Riley added that the base will close Tuesday and personnel have been directed to follow local evacuation orders, though roughly 185 base personnel will work from an alternate emergency operations center at Raymond James Stadium, the home field of the Buccaneers that is also designated as a shelter and disaster response site by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The 482nd Fighter Wing has additionally relocated seven F-16s from Homestead Air Reserve Base in the Miami area to San Antonio, Texas, Riley said. Patrick Space Force Base and Cape Canaveral Space Force Station on Florida’s east coast are currently in Hurricane Condition 4 status, according to Space Launch Delta 45. Riley said 'tenant units have moved aircraft assets out of the local area,' though SLD 45’s website says that there are no mandatory evacuations as the storm is expected to considerably weaken by the time it reaches the area. 'While the anticipated impacts of this storm are not driving a mandatory evacuation, we do expect downed trees, power outages, possible cell service outages, and localized flooding,' the unit said. The Navy is also battening down the hatches in advance of the storm and told Breaking Defense in a statement today that the service will move out to sea three Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyers from Mayport in northeast Florida as a result: Donald Cook (DDG-75), Thomas Hudner (DDG-116), and Lassen (DDG-82). 'Other Mayport-based ships will remain in port at Naval Station Mayport. Mayport Harbor Operations will position those ships in designated ‘heavy weather mooring’ positions based on the latest forecast models of the storm. Meanwhile, aircraft will commence evacuations from local airfields or be safely stored in hangars designed to endure hurricane-force winds,' a Navy spokesman said. All bases are expected to close non-essential operations by Tuesday afternoon, the Navy added. Bryan Clark, a fellow for the Hudson Institute and retired Navy officer, told Breaking Defense that repeatedly moving ships to dodge the hurricanes is not a significant expense, relatively, for the service. But the cost of having to spend time securing equipment and stopping operations could add up fast for Florida-based private shipyards, to the tune of hundreds of thousands of dollars depending on the frequency of the hurricanes and how long it takes for the weather to come and pass, he said. A spokesperson for the National Guard said officials there are 'continuing to watch the speed, strength and track of Hurricane Milton, and we’re ready to help coordinate resources that may be necessary to deal with the storm’s aftermath. Like with Helene, Guard resources from multiple states can come in if needed to help areas impacted by Milton.' The Army did not immediately respond to a request for comment.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/as-hurricane-milton-intensifies-military-bases-in-florida-prepare-to-weather-another-serious-storm/	2024-10-07T14:23:10-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/241007_DVIDS_uss_thomas_hudner_8189347-scaled-e1728332422116.jpg
Sweden goes all-in on NATO with new deployment proposal	US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and Swedish Minister of Defense, Pal Jonson tour the Swedish Visby-class corvette, HSwMS Härnösand (K33) at Musko Naval Base, Sweden (US DoD) STOCKHOLM — The Swedish government today pitched a proposal to their parliament that would assign a large chunk of its military towards NATO operations, in a move all about showing Stockholm is ready to go all in with the alliance. The proposal requests that the Riksdagen (the parliament) should green-light the government to be ready to roll out a beefy Swedish military force — up to 1,200 troops from ground, special ops, and amphibious units, plus six warships complete with crew, and a fleet of up to 24 fighter jets [AM1] (25 percent of the overall fighter fleet) — to back NATO deterrence operations in the North Atlantic, through the end of 2025. While not huge numbers by American standards, this commitment is a serious one from Sweden and an increased on previously announced plans that appears designed to send a signal to the other alliance members that their newest ally is taking their security seriously, as well as its own. 'This is a historic decision. Sweden has previously declared that we will pursue a policy of solidarity within the alliance. Now we're putting that into practice, as we for the first time as an ally contribute with an armed force to NATO's collective defense,' Foreign Minister Maria Malmer Stenergard, said at an event announcing the request. To be clear, Sweden had already pledged a certain number of its forces towards NATO operations. For instance, it had planned to send up to 600 troops to Latvia as part of an alliance mission, side by side with the Danes under Canadian leadership. But today’s announcement would significantly boost the number of forces and materiel being planned for alliance missions. Just looking at the Latvia mission, the new plan would call for the soldiers to expand up to 1,000, which would consist of 'officers and full-time serving soldiers, so we're not talking about conscripts here,' said Defense Minister Pål Jonson. And the operational area for those forces would extend into Estonia, Lithuania, and Poland. While Sweden had indicated plans to join NATO's standing naval forces, today was the first time it was revealed six warships, a sizeable contribution for Sweden, would be considered. At least some of those ships will be focused on mine countermeasures in the Baltic and North Atlantic. Similarly, the size of Sweden’s contribution to the air policing mission would grow to potentially 24 jets. Overall, Swedish forces are planned to take part in three areas of operation through NATO in the coming year: One area that was not touched on today: how Sweden will work with NATO`s nuclear forces. NATO´s head for nuclear policy, Jim Stokes, highlighted at a seminar in Stockholm in June that 'Sweden needs to communicate to its public the importance of having joined a nuclear Alliance,' in part because the question of whether to allow NATO planes equipped with nuclear weapons to use Sweden’s air space is a controversial one. Jonas Olsson is a freelance national security journalist in Stockholm.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/sweden-goes-all-in-on-nato-with-new-deployment-proposal/	2024-10-07T13:59:55-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/02/7748705-scaled-e1708967242542.jpg
Northrop Grumman adds AI to Army’s command system for counter-drone defense	Forward Area Air Defense Command &amp; Control (FAAD-C2) tracks incoming threats from drones, rockets, artillery, and mortars. (Northrop Grumman photo) WASHINGTON — Since 2020, when the Pentagon established a technical architecture to connect counter-drone systems, their digital backbone has been the Army’s Forward Area Air Defense Command &amp; Control. FAAD-C2 is built by Northrop Grumman and in widespread use by US forces and, increasingly, foreign allies like the Baltic States. Today, Northrop announced it had developed a new AI-driven upgrade to FAAD-C2, an Advanced Battle Manager to help users handle 'complex aerial swarm scenarios.' 'The ABM can generate engagement plans in under a quarter of a second,' a Northrop spokesperson told Breaking Defense. The Advanced Battle Manager takes the data FAAD-C2 is already receiving from multiple sensors, analyzes the threat, and then rapidly recommends the best available weapon to engage each target — what’s called 'weapon-target pairing' — while avoiding 'friendly fire' shootdowns of US and allied assets. It boasts an 'open architecture' design, meaning it uses common industry and military technical standards that allow a wide variety of vendors’ weapons and sensors to plug-and-play, rather than being restricted by a closely-held proprietary interface. And, the release says, its algorithms were trained on 'years of live fire data' and then 'successfully tested in spring and late summer at the Yuma Proving Grounds in Arizona.' It’s not yet clear if these tests overlapped with June’s multi-week JCO Demo 5, also at Yuma, which pitted an array of defensive systems against up to 50 inbound threats at once, ranging from tiny propeller-driven drones to unmanned mini-jets weighing over half a ton. But that demonstration definitely indicated the kinds of threats the military is worrying about. The Pentagon has long seen air defense in general — not just against drones — as a prime area to deploy artificial intelligence, because threats can come in so fast, from so many different directions, that it can overwhelm a human’s capacity to respond. 'As threats evolve, the need for operations to become simple and clear during high-stress multi-target engagements has increased,' said Northrop Vice President and retired Air Force missile defender Kenneth Todorov, according to the release. 'This critical AI enhancement will create a streamlined and intuitive engagement plan giving service members more time to save lives with a single click.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/northrop-grumman-adds-ai-to-armys-command-system-for-counter-drone-defense/	2024-10-07T13:53:50-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/NorthropGrummansFAADC2PlaysIntegralRoleTestingJADC2MessagingStandard-e1728333621816.png

(US Air Force photo by Senior Airman Paige Weldon) WASHINGTON — The US State Department today gave their blessing to a trio of Foreign Military Sales that would see Italy bring online $680 million-worth of electronic attack systems, India load up $175 million in torpedoes and Romania light up a $110 million radar system. Specifically Rome appears to be in the market for the Electronic Attack (EA)-37B mission system made by BAE Systems — the radars, encryptors, terminals, etc. that make up the brains of the US Air Force's EA-37B Compass Call aircraft, which is based on a highly modified Gulfstream G550 [PDF]. Italy reportedly already has a couple Gulfstreams to host the new, high-end equipment. The potential sale 'will improve Italy’s capability to meet current and future threats by increasing interoperability with the United States Air Force (USAF) and disrupting enemy command and control communications when Italy is contributing to overseas contingency operations,' according to an announcement posted to the Defense Security Cooperation Agency's website. Meanwhile, New Dehli has been cleared to proceed with the potential acquisition of 53 aircraft-launched MK 54 MOD 0 Lightweight Torpedo all up rounds, as well as associated equipment and support, including 'in-country torpedo training.' The proposed $175 million agreement is one directly with the US government, as DSCA said 'a majority of the lightweight torpedos hardware will be purchased directly from U.S. Navy stock.' Should it go through, the sale would 'will improve India’s capability to meet current and future threats by increasing the size of its anti-submarine weapons stockpile for its MH-60R helicopters,' DSCA said. More broadly it would 'support the foreign policy and national security objectives of the United States by helping to strengthen the United States-India strategic relationship and improving the security of a major defense partner which continues to be an important force for political stability, peace, and economic progress in the Indo-Pacific and South Asia regions.' Lastly, Bucharest is a step closer to acquiring four AN/MPQ-64 F1 Sentinel radar systems, made by RTX, along with a host of non-Major Defense Equipment like encryptors, Identification Friend-or-Foe (IFF) equipment and anti-spoofing tech. The mobile three-dimensional radar systems support 'several command and control interfaces, providing consistent air surveillance and fire-control data to weapons that counter unmanned aerial systems, cruise missiles and fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft. It works both at fixed sites and in highly mobile maneuver operations,' according to an RTX description. 'The proposed sale will improve Romania’s capability to meet current and future threats by providing a credible force that is capable of deterring adversaries and participating in NATO operations. Romania will have no difficulty absorbing this equipment into its armed forces,' DSCA said. The announcements do not represent what the final deals may look like, as unit number and prices could change as negotiations continue. Congress could also step in to pause the deals, but that's a rare occurrence.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/us-greenlights-electronic-attack-system-for-italy-torpedoes-for-india-and-radars-for-romania/	2024-10-07T13:18:04-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/241007_ea-37B_compass_call_8612891-scaled-e1728331276195.jpg
Sole cancer center of excellence in the military health system has new ideas on treatment	Although breast cancer brings with it some sobering statistics, the treatments to combat it are continually evolving and improving. (Photo provided by the Henry M. Jackson Foundation for the Advancement of Military Medicine.) Breast cancer remains the most common cancer diagnosed among U.S. women and the second leading cause of death from cancer among women after lung cancer, according to the American Cancer Society. It’s also the most common cancer in the world. Although the disease brings with it some sobering statistics, the treatments to combat it are continually evolving and improving. 'Our goal is to improve the diagnosis and multidisciplinary treatment of patients through innovative clinical research, care, and education,' said Dr. Craig Shriver, retired Army colonel and director of the Murtha Cancer Center (MCC) at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. That goal is backed by the wherewithal to achieve it. MCC is the only DoD Cancer Center of Excellence within the Military Health System. The Breast Care Center at MCC has received full accreditation from the National Accreditation Program for Breast Centers. The facility provides treatment that is both comprehensive and highly focused. When a person is first diagnosed with breast cancer, they meet with the Murtha breast cancer team to determine the biology of the patient’s tumors in order to find the optimal course of treatment. A surgeon, medical/radiation oncologist, pathologist, geneticist, and nursing caregivers then work together on a treatment plan. 'Breast cancer treatment is stressful for patients on many levels, and our ongoing research is driven by compassion,' said Shriver, who noted that MCC’s multidisciplinary approach to breast disease integrates five key areas: prevention, screening, early diagnosis, treatment, and continuing care. Immunotherapy is an important part of treatment and brings it a unique promise because 'it trains your body to fight cancer by using your own immune system,' explained Marie Borsellino, RN, the survivorship coordinator for the Uniformed Services University’s Murtha Cancer Center Research Program at MCC, which was established to manage cancer care for the DoD. 'We have newer treatment options that target the subtypes of cancer beyond hormone therapy such as targeted treatments, which block certain proteins that control how cancer cells grow, multiply, and spread,' she said. 'Targeted treatments for HER2-positive cancer have improved survival over the last 10 years.' The ultimate success of any clinical care starts with the prevention and awareness of a person’s personal risk. Early detection is critical. Women who are at average risk of breast cancer are advised to have screening mammograms each year starting at age 40. In an effort to raise awareness of breast cancer research and the work that MCC is doing, the Henry M. Jackson Foundation for the Advancement of Military Medicine will once again partner with Leonardo DRS on their 'Stick It 2 Cancer' fundraiser during the 2024 AUSA Annual Meeting &amp; Exposition, which runs from Oct. 14 through 16 at the Washington, D.C. convention center. Donations can be made at the Leonardo DRS booth on the show floor.

On Army bases, nuclear energy can’t add resilience, just costs and risks	Twin containment domes, that house nuclear reactors, looks out over the Pacific Ocean at the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant in San Luis Obispo on August 9, 2024. (Genaro Molina/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images) Every now and then, the US government offers a huge subsidy to an industry on grounds that make no sense to anyone with even basic knowledge of the subject. The latest example, announced in June, is the Army’s Advanced Nuclear Power for Installations (ANPI) program to install small reactors on military bases, ostensibly to increase 'energy resilience.' This is perplexing for several reasons. First, such resilience can be provided much more effectively, safely, and cheaply with non-nuclear options. Second, nuclear reactors themselves cannot provide 'resilience,' because their safe operation always has required input of electricity to the reactors from other power sources. Third, the Army’s planned reactors would lack a robust containment building, so an attack or accident could disperse radioactive waste, endangering base personnel and neighboring civilians. Both the Army and taxpayers should cry foul on this indefensible waste of national security dollars. Of course, energy resilience is a reasonable concern for Army bases, which now get their electricity from the commercial grid that is potentially subject to blackouts from bad weather or even cyberattacks. The simple and inexpensive solution, already utilized by military bases and other essential services including hospitals, is to maintain backup diesel fuel and generators for emergency use. It costs only about $2 million to $4 million for a set of diesel generators to produce 5 megawatts of electricity — the amount the Army seeks — and the diesel fuel would be cheap since the generators would operate only during rare emergencies. By contrast, the price of a single nuclear reactor to produce the same five megawatts of electricity would be several hundred million dollars — roughly 100 times as expensive — according to government estimates and my previously published research. Even if, as the Army hopes, the reactor could replace the commercial grid as the primary source of power for the base, the electricity produced by the reactor would cost several times more than what the Army now pays for commercial electricity. So, regardless of whether the reactor was used for primary or backup power, Army costs would spike substantially. What about resilience, which is the supposed justification for buying these expensive reactors? Well, even though reactors can produce electricity, they have always required an external source of electricity to keep them running safely — most crucially to cool the fuel to avoid a nuclear meltdown and radioactive release. The Army’s recent request for proposals seems to acknowledge this reality by saying that in addition to an external electricity source, the reactor must have an 'alternative credited independent power source as a backup.' Therefore, an Army base reactor would almost surely depend on drawing electricity from the commercial grid. But this means the reactor would be no more resilient than the existing power source it is supposed to replace to increase resilience. In the event of a blackout of the commercial grid, what would the reactor do to get essential electricity? Of course, it would turn on its backup diesel generators. However, if the base requires backup generators anyway, it has no need for the super-expensive reactor. It gets even worse. To prevent costs from rising even higher, the nuclear industry has decided that its small reactors — the kind the Army is seeking — will be built without a containment building that could prevent radiation from escaping in the event of an accident. This also means the reactors would be more vulnerable to attack by aircraft, missiles, rockets, and drones. A successful kinetic attack could spread radioactivity in at least two ways. First, like a 'dirty bomb,' it could disperse the reactor’s solid irradiated fuel over a wide area into a few or many radioactive chunks that would be very hazardous if approached. Even worse, if the attack interrupted the reactor’s active or passive cooling, the fuel could overheat and breach its cladding, thereby allowing gaseous radioactivity to spread more widely. Ironically, it is not clear if the Army even wants these nuclear reactors, which originally were proposed in 2018 by Congressional advocates of nuclear energy, who also have promoted nuclear reactors for Air Force bases and forward operating bases — including in war zones where they would be even more vulnerable. Comments from Pentagon officials about these programs indicate that at least part of the motivation is to help America’s struggling nuclear reactor companies, which have yet to find a single private-sector customer for their small but pricey powerplants. The Defense Secretary’s manager for the Army’s mobile reactor project touts it as 'a pathfinder to advanced nuclear reactors in the commercial sector.' A Deputy Assistant Secretary in the Air Force says, 'We're trying to … create a playbook of how other villages or communities and cities' can pursue 'energy through a microreactor.' But even if the civilian nuclear industry deserved additional subsidies, which is questionable, that would not justify wasting defense dollars on unnecessary reactors that could endanger our troops. Truthfully, energy resilience for military bases is a real concern that deserves safe, effective, and economical solutions — but nuclear reactors satisfy none of those criteria. Fortunately, we live in a democracy, so there is still a chance to stop these dangerous boondoggles. Service members and their dependents, communities near military bases, and taxpayers in general can and should call on Congress to suspend the ANPI program — and instead explore how its funding could be reprogrammed more productively.

MOSA: A Winning Strategy for FLRAA and Army Current Fleet Modernization	The Army's Future Vertical Lift ecosystem is illustrated in this concept image by Collins Aerospace. The Army’s Modular Open Systems Approach (MOSA) will serve a dual purpose for both the Future Vertical Lift program/Future Long Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) and its current fleet of Black Hawk, Chinook, and Apache platforms in areas of affordability, interoperability, and the ability to quickly upgrade and integrate new technologies. We discussed this with Collins Aerospace’s Chet Treloar, director, Future Vertical Lift Strategic Pursuit, and Joseph Graf, Senior Fellow and communication systems architect. Breaking Defense: Discuss Army aviation’s open-systems approach to accelerating outcomes for FVL and in modernizing the current fleet. Chet Treloar is Director, Strategic Pursuits, Customer &amp; Account Management, Collins Aerospace. Treloar: The Army has done a great job of complying with the Modular Open Systems Approach and the new Title X regulations. That helps to keep them ahead of any threat since you can upgrade faster, keep up with technology, and maintain affordability. It is at the forefront of almost everything they talk about. The Army intends to spiral in new capabilities but in order to do that you’ve got to have the system, the digital backbone, and you’ve got to be able to implement improvements quickly and have the flexibility to work with multiple vendors to make operations and sustainment cheaper. Graf: Think of MOSA as a framework to enable more flexibility and capability. Part of that openness is standardizing on architecture. Chet mentioned the digital backbone, and to truly take advantage of new capabilities, we need an infrastructure to plug into to get data from point A to point B with a specified throughput and latency, so that new capabilities can be quickly and easily added to the mission. One of the things the Army wants to do more is graphical data distribution. Standards like ARINC 661 and OpenGL are helping create a framework where we share information in an open way across the digital backbone, so that the Army doesn't have to rely on vendor A or B to provide that capability. If another vendor comes along and they have a better way to synthesize the data and distribute it to the pilot or user, then that can be inserted efficiently. The digital backbone is also a framework for power and cooling, among other things. And once you get a basic infrastructure in place, for example in the current fleet, you can start to replace mechanical actuation with electromechanical and begin migrating the system to fly-by-wire. Then you can start looking at autonomous operations or even full up autonomy. There needs to be a more straight-forward path for technology insertions that allow the fleet to outpace the threat, and it all hinges on MOSA. What current fleet aircraft do you envision could take most advantage of this? Treloar: Recently, we attended Army Aviation Industry Days and based on the themes of that event, there seems to be modernization plans for the Sikorsky UH-60M Black Hawk and the CH-47 Chinook. There are likely to be opportunities for the Apache, as well. Of course, funding and timelines are subject to change, but there's certainly an emphasis on modernizing the current fleet with MOSA as the cornerstone. How is FLRAA and current fleet modernization working in tandem to meet capability goals for both? Treloar: The Army is showing a unified front and they are happy to leverage each other's investments and capabilities to improve their platforms whenever that fits and makes sense. They are looking at the capabilities being put on the -60 or the -47 that can go on FLRAA. When you hear the current fleet PMs talk, they mention that as FLRAA matures and uses the FAF, the FVL Architecture Framework, the digital backbone will flow down into the current fleet. I think they’re very much aligned. Joseph Graf is Senior Tech Fellow and FVL Chief Engineer at Collins Aerospace. Graf: To some extent, the existing fleet is a proving ground for a lot of these new capabilities even before they go into FLRAA. The question is how can we enable new capabilities, such as head-up displays or helmet mounted displays, in the existing fleet in the most cost-effective way to enable the users to start assessing that technology? You want to get those capabilities into the user's hands, so they can start using them as much as possible ahead of time. The Army has stated that they want the end users involved in the assessment of new capabilities in real-time. The users are not going to be able to fully assess the technology until they actually receive it and are flying with it. As we migrate toward this new world of open architectures, there's a huge learning curve. It's going to take some time as new technologies present themselves as possibilities, but their are certainly pathways to best utilize and deploy these technologies. What are additional benefits to the Army of upgrading current fleets with an open systems cockpit? Treloar: Take the UH-60, for example. It is expected to fly into 2070. Chinook and Apache are somewhere along the same lines. In order to do that, you’ve got to upgrade those fleets and MOSA is a key enabler to technology insertions, transformation in contact, and multi-domain operations. It won't just be FLRAA out there, you're going to have current fleet platforms doing all kinds of things they don't do today, especially in the area of launched effects. You’ll have FLRAA flying faster and farther, but the other platforms will also need upgrade capabilities, which MOSA expedites in order to be relevant. Graf: For example, if I have mission computing hardware that is based on an open standard like SOSA (Sensor Open Systems Architecture) and I need to integrate a new capability that requires more computing power than my existing system, I can swap out a component and it won’t take years to do. They want to be able to upgrade in months or faster. With faster upgrades, comes increased affordability in the long-term – a win-win for all parties involved. MOSA will prevent the Army from being dependent on single suppliers, the so-called vendor lock. How so? Treloar: As we just mentioned, with MOSA you have the capability to insert modification in weeks or months as opposed to multi-year integration programs. Enduring systems are not going to be on a platform forever. With MOSA, the Army can compete things as needed, which can make operations and sustainment cheaper. In the past when a system was not built with MOSA in mind, there were fewer opportunities for competition – often making upgrades and other enhancements more time consuming and expensive. Graf: Affordability is enabled because we're standardizing on particular interface standards, hardware profiles and so on. You snap a chalk line and give the industry some guide rails to know how they should be investing and what their boundaries are, so they can focus their investments. It is a different, but better way of thinking for industry. Now, I have to provide a solution that distinguishes my product from other vendors because they could replace me. That generates competition, drives the prices down, and enables the Army to take advantage of the latest and greatest. That's the whole vision for MOSA. In Europe, the Indo-Pacific, and the Middle East we fight with partners. How does the DoD’s MOSA translate to our ability to conduct joint operations? Treloar: In this country we have MOSA. They have other approaches in the UK, France, and other European nations. They call it something different, but it's all the same idea. The demands are out there and for the same reasons: affordability in the future, new threats, and the need to stay up with technology from the Army perspective. MOSA is the common thread in FLRAA, and I'd say it's becoming the common thread in the current fleet and beyond. The new avionics upgrade program coming out of the -60 office has MOSA as a requirement. So, the Army has doubled down on their commitment to MOSA and that consistency of message serves as a demand signal to industry. Graf: The standards that we're creating are open, but they're only open in the United States. So, the question to be asked is what information we can start sharing with our closest allies so that they can begin reaping those same MOSA benefits. For example, if I start upgrading my Black Hawks that are being used in the UK or Australia, I want to be able to give them the same kind of capabilities used by U.S. operators. In order to do that, they have to have access to the same basic digital backbone-type technology. How do you do that? That’s part of the equation that needs to be addressed to realize the benefits of MOSA on a global scale.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/mosa-a-winning-strategy-for-flraa-and-army-current-fleet-modernization/	2024-10-07T07:34:28-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/The-Armys-Future-Vertical-Lift-ecosystem-is-illustrated-in-this-concept-image-by-Collins-Aerospace-1.jpg
In a year of war since Oct. 7, Israel introduced new battlefield tech, honed its organization	An Israeli soldier rides an armoured personnel carrier on the border with the Gaza Strip on July 17, 2024, amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas. (Photo by MENAHEM KAHANA/AFP via Getty Images) JERUSALEM — In July, nine months after the devastating Oct. 7 attack on Israel, the Israel Defense Forces released one of its first publicly available investigations into the failures of that day, a study of the battle of Kibbutz Be’eri, where 101 civilians were killed during the Hamas attack. But it is clear the Israeli military could not wait nine months to begin reacting to the Oct. 7 attacks, as it mounted an aggressive, deadly retaliatory campaign in Gaza. The IDF has been evolving in real time in the year of war since — using new technology, reorganizing its fighting forces and even adjusting the way it trains its soldiers. With ground operations now expanding into southern Lebanon, where Israel hopes to push back Iran-backed Hezbollah, here’s a look at how Israel has responded to the demands of modern combat in the past year. RELATED: What life looks like in Lebanon after 1 year of conflict between Hezbollah and Israel Before the war began, the IDF was training the first crews of its infantry Nahal Brigade on the new wheeled Eitan armored personnel carrier, not knowing that it would shortly be making its combat debut. Since then, the new vehicles have been used in raids in Gaza and by the IDF’s 162nd Division during battles in Rafah in May. To protect those systems, the Trophy active protection system has seen its share of fighting and appears to have performed well, as there’s little evidence of incapacitated tanks sporting the system, though several Namer APCs do appear to have been destroyed. Still, the IDF is being forced to innovate in some decidedly low-tech ways — like adding metal nets on the top of some tanks to protect them from top-down drone attacks, as seen in Ukraine. As Breaking Defense has reported, the IDF has also transformed older vehicles into some of the first-ever robotic platforms to see combat. Unmanned versions of older M113 APCs have been spotted on battlegrounds in Rafah, and D-9 bulldozers are being remotely controlled to do dangerous grunt work like ground excavation, clearing rough terrain or setting up tank firing positions. A new wheeled artillery system, called the Roem, is expected to be introduced to the IDF artillery corps soon, though it’s unclear when the first pieces will see action. Once deployed it will give the artillery an automated ability to fire more shells at a faster pace with fewer artillery pieces, replacing the older M109 howitzers, according to several Israeli reports. Beyond vehicles, the IDF has made battlefield strides in networking, communicating between ground, air and naval forces. Handheld systems help soldier see assets on the battlefield, allowing better coordination between armor and drone operations, for example. Israel has also used a large number of drones in the current war, including the older Hermes 450 and employing smaller Skylark drones with units that aid the artillery. In cases Breaking Defense saw during the war, various units have also acquired commercially available smaller quadcopters. At the same time, the IDF has sought to counter drone threats using new technologies that can be placed on vehicles, or using hard-kill solutions such as fire-control sights on rifles and interceptors. With the exception of the first days of the war when Hamas used small drones, the IDF has confronted longer-range kamikaze UAV threats and has used the air force or Iron Dome to down them. Lastly, at sea the IDF’s new Sa’ar 6 corvettes got their first combat experience in this war. They have served off the coast of Gaza and in the Red Sea. The naval version of Iron Dome, called C-Dome has also seen its first interceptions in the war. The IDF has undergone several organizational changes during the war, perhaps the most prescient of which was to bolster its forces in the north well before the announced ground operations in Lebanon. Back in April the IDF created a new Mountain Brigade to defend Mount Dov and Mount Hermon, a triangle of land bordering Lebanon and Syria. The creation of the new brigade takes pressure off the IDF’s 769th territorial brigade, which is the eastern brigade of the 91st Division. The 91st is responsible for defending Israel’s border with Lebanon. The new Mountain Brigade comes under the control of the 210th Division, which historically defended the Syrian border along the Golan Heights. In essence this shortens the defensive line of the 91st and lets it concentrate on the Hezbollah threat while providing a new unit to safeguard the unique mountainous terrain that forms a triangle between Israel, Lebanon and Syria. The IDF is also expanding its combat helicopter squadrons. On the eve of the Oct. 7 attack the IDF only had two helicopters on station for an emergency, and they were both based at Ramat David base in the north. A recent article in the Hebrew-language website Mako noted 'there seems to be unanimity in the IDF regarding the need to increase the array of combat helicopters of the Air Force, after the intention was to close one of the two squadrons. The need for them was sharpened by the events of October 7, and since then they have operated in all sectors.' Now it appears the air force may acquire more combat helicopters to replace old Apaches as part of an ongoing multi-billion dollar expansion that has been in the works for years. The overall expansion will include new refuelers, heavy transport helicopters, more F-15s and the third squadron of F-35s that Israel has acquired. The war has also given Israel the chance to showcase its long-range bombing capability with two strikes on Yemen where the IDF used its aging refuelers and a variety of combat aircraft. Israel has also embraced the prominence of drone warfare, creating a new squadron dedicated to the Hermes 900.

(Kobi Wolf/Bloomberg via Getty Images) In the armored forces, the IDF began to bolster the regular armored brigades by creating new companies of regular army tank crews. This replaces the former model of having battalions that consist of two regular companies and a reserve company. It essentially means more tank crews that can be called upon to fight, rather than relying on as many reservists in the 7th, 188th and 401st regular armored brigades. It takes time to train all these new companies, but the pressure on the armored corps is clear. The 7th armored served throughout the war in Gaza, first with the 36th Division and then with the 9th Division. It was transferred north with the 98th in September 2024 and entered Lebanon on Oct. 1. The 401st Brigade has served in Gaza since the ground offensive began while the 188th entered Lebanon on Oct. 2 after guarding northern Israel for eight months. The last major change for the ground forces has been the experience gained in Gaza against tunnels. The IDF has learned to identify and destroy tunnels and also search for them. Much of this work was conducted by the IDF’s 98th Division and its commandos and combat engineers. However, other forces linked to the 162nd Division and other units have done the same work. Throughout most of the war the IDF has attached the 7th Armored brigade to the 98th Division, which could become a semi-permanent change, reducing the 36th Division from two armored brigades to one armored brigade. The first impact of the war has been the unprecedented pressure put on the IDF by calling up reservists for a long period of time. Historically, Israel fought short wars that lasted from a week to several months. Or, in times of long-term fighting, such as the Second Intifada, the war was usually of such low intensity that it didn’t require reserves to serve for months on end. In the war that began in October 2023, Israel initially called up around 300,000 reservists. Many of the combat units have now seen up to eight months of service in the last 12, according to numerous reservists who spoke to Breaking Defense. The long experience of reserve service has led to extensive and improved training of the reservists. For instance, some went through two weeks of specialized training before ground operations in Gaza, and other units conducted brigade and battalion level training in northern Israel in expectation of a ground offensive into Lebanon. Other personnel changes could be on the horizon. Israel has weighed extended the age of service for retirement from the reserves. In addition, the lack of manpower for the IDF has put a spotlight on the need to enlist ultra-Orthodox Jews who are usually exempt from service. Regular army service for conscripts may also be extended. In the end, the IDF is a force that’s evolving as it’s fighting. With Israeli soldiers in Lebanon now and no end to the fighting in sight, it’s sure to keep evolving — perhaps beyond what the failure of Oct. 7 alone could have taught.

System update: Army general takes over from Skinner as director of DISA, JFHQ-DoDIN	U.S. Army Cyber Center of Excellence and Fort Gordon Commanding General, Maj. Gen. Paul Stanton, welcomes attendees to AFCEA’s TechNet Augusta 2022 at the Augusta Marriott Convention Center in Augusta, Georgia, on August 16th, 2022. (Photo by Capt. Rebecca Harr) WASHINGTON — Gen. Robert Skinner today formally passed his responsibilities as director of the Defense Information Systems Agency and Joint Force Headquarters-Department of Defense Information Networks (JFHQ-DoDIN) to Army Gen. Paul Stanton. Skinner is retiring after a 40-year military career in which he started as an administrative supervisor for the Office of the Secretary of the Navy. He later worked his way up to an Air Force general and in 2015 became the chief of staff at DISA and deputy commander of the JFHQ-DoDIN. In 2021 he took over the post of director of DISA and JFHQ-DoDIN. In his final months on the job, DISA published a five-year strategy, with Skinner's top three priorities: a 'common IT environment,' more robust cloud computing and a push toward zero-trust cybersecurity. In his last address to Augusta Technet in August, Skinner also set an ambitious goal for DODNET, shooting for getting 100,000 users within a few months. 'We’re going to collapse a lot of these [defense] agency networks that have been stovepiped and have legacy technology in them,' he said at the time. U.S. Air Force Lt. Gen. Robert Skinner, director of Defense Information System Agency and the commander of the Joint Force Headquarters, delivers remarks during the DISA Central Field Command change of command ceremony at MacDill Air Force Base, Florida, July 7, 2023. (Airman 1st Class Zachary Foster, 6th Air Refueling Wing Public Affairs) 'At the core of our responsibilities, we must securely and reliably get the right data to the right place at the right time to make a better and faster decision than our enemies, period. This is our business,' he said at the ceremony. 'This is warfighting as it has been, it is today and will be in the future. This agency and command are critical to our nation’s warfighting success. Failure is not an option, and excellence is our standard.' 'This transition means not only a change in leadership, but also a change in perspective,' Leslie Beavers, acting DoD Chief Information Officer, said. 'I can tell you [Skinner] was the right leader to take on the challenges that DISA faced coming out of COVID and setting a path for the future. It is going to take a warrior-scholar to take the handoff from Bob and move those and many other initiatives down range, and we found one. [Stanton] is the perfect person to take on this challenge.' 'This team, all of you, are engaged with our adversaries and our competitors on a daily basis, 24/7, and the very definition of success is nothing short of mission assurance for the joint force and for serving our nation’s decisive advantages,' Haugh said. 'The mission has been accomplished by all of you over the past three years, enabled by Bob Skinner’s leadership. It is a fantastic way to wrap up a career of dedication serving our nation. JFHQ-DoDIN and DISA will be in terrific and very capable hands with Lt. Gen. Paul Stanton at the helm and all of you working missions. Paul was built for this job.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/system-update-army-general-takes-over-from-skinner-as-director-of-disa-jfhq-dodin/	2024-10-04T14:46:49-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/08/7396747-scaled-e1692386644383.jpg
What life looks like in Lebanon after 1 year of conflict between Hezbollah and Israel	A torn Lebanese flag flies on October 3, 2024 in Marjayoun, Lebanon. Israel continued airstrikes on Beirut and its southern suburbs as its military announced a ground offensive in Lebanon, part of what it said would be a 'limited' incursion to target Hezbollah forces. (Photo by Carl Court/Getty Images) BEIRUT — One year ago Monday, the Palestinian group Hamas attacked Israel. A day later, Hezbollah joined in what it called the 'Gaza support' front, dragging Lebanon into the conflict. Ever since, the country has been on edge, waiting for what felt like an inevitable all-out invasion from Israel over the border. The inevitable arrived last week, and the violence wrought so far could presage a much more intense second year of fighting here, with Lebanese citizens are caught between an Israeli rock and a Hezbollah hard place. Over the past year, the strikes across the border have expanded and diminished on a week by week basis. On the worse days, they would feature Israeli jets soaring overhead and bombs splashing down on what the IDF has called Hezbollah targets. But the last two weeks have seen a major escalation, including multiple direct strikes on Beirut — long seen as a safe haven that Israeli forces would avoid attacking. For many southern Lebanese, Israel's declaration of an invasion, which Jerusalem has stated has the goal of 'limited, localized' raids designed to push Hezbollah back from its border, has become a last straw. So many have left. The government is estimating that the number of migrants heading north will exceed 1 million — in a country of 5.4 million overall. Tens of thousands of Lebanese also have fled east to neighboring Syria, a dark reversal of time when desperate people from that wartorn nation fled the opposite direction. Even before the announcement of raids, the aerial campaign was proving brutal for those in the region. 'We couldn’t sleep all night, bombardment sounds never seem to pause. The nights are the worse,' one southerner told Breaking Defense. She added that when her family decided to leave the south earlier last week, there was no easy way out: The two main paths north, either via Nabatiyeh-Sidon or through the Beqaa Valley, are either blocked by rubble left over from airstrikes or in IDF-identified target zones — meaning braving that route could be more dangerous than staying home amid strikes there. Those who can't or won't leave their homes are stuck taking cover, having nothing to do but offer 'prayers' that things won’t escalate to a full incursion beyond the South Litani river. The pace of strikes does not appear to be slowing down — a Reuters tally of statements from Israel found that 70 towns, including predominantly Christian ones, have been ordered to evacuate in the last three days. On X, an Israel Defense Forces spokesperson has posted several maps of Lebanese cities with red squares superimposed on them, warning civilians to evacuate those areas, as they are near purported Hezbollah activity. 'You are located near Hezbollah facilities and interests, and the IDF will act against them in the near future,' one post reads. What those refugees will find in the north is unclear. Many people have become homeless, and the winter season is imminent. Despite a few incidents where refugees met resistance in Beirut neighborhoods, Lebanese solidarity is largely holding: The city's residents are busy collecting food and medical supplies, but without a national emergency plan, many families may face harsh days, especially as the temperature begins to drop. While not as frequent a target as in the south, Beirut, particularly its southern suburb Dahieh, is no longer immune to the sounds of jets screaming overhead and explosions rocking buildings and windows. Israeli air force pilots seem to prefer striking under Lebanon’s beautiful moonlight, adding an extra layer of terror for those who were able to find sleep in the moments of quiet. 'Are we going to die tonight?' my children ask me every night while they rush into my room, awakened from their sleep, not by calls to get ready for school but from bombs. It is easy to see the black and white smoke plumes from these attacks rising above the city. Mornings are not much better than the nights. People rush to check social media for what disasters happened in the few minutes of sleep they could get, and the situation seems to only grow more dire every sunrise. Many hospitals are near full capacity. In an Oct. 2 report, the Lebanese government said that since the war began, there have been 1,928 killed with 9,290 injured — including 55 killed and 156 injured in the 48 hours period from Sept. 30 to Oct. 2. Smoke rises above Beirut's southern suburbs during an Israeli strike on September 27, 2024. A source close to Hezbollah said the massive Israeli strikes on Beirut's southern suburbs flattened six buildings. (Photo by -/AFP via Getty Images) While there are no national sirens signaling threats, church bells are doing the duty — and seemingly never get a rest. On Beirut's roads, Lebanese Armed Forces are increasingly deployed near embassies. Schools are largely closed, turned into refugee centers for children, adults and old people who migrated from the south, Beqaa Valley and even Dahieh. It's unclear when children will be able to go back to school, and there are now discussions about online classes — which might fail entirely if Lebanon's traditionally iffy utility system collapses. When Hezbollah launched its rockets a year ago in support of Hamas, neither the Lebanese government nor the people were given a choice. Certainly, Hezbollah has its supporters, in the south, Beqaa and the southern suburb of Beirut, but there is no national consensus about this conflict, as the country is divided to sectors and parties. Hezbollah is only one of them, if the most powerful. Follow Breaking Defense’s full coverage of the region: But as the world has watched the conflict over the past year, watched Hezbollah's leadership taken out in a shocking manner, watched Iran's attack on Israel, watched Israel give updates on its 'raids' into the country — it is hard not to feel that the Lebanese people have been caught up in something beyond our control. Many Lebanese, myself included, feel like to the world we are mere numbers: numbers of casualties, migrants, injured people and demolished buildings. While international political and regional military actions might determine the day after, no one in the country right now knows whether they will live to see the sunrise on that day. Lebanon has been described as a Phoenix that rises from the ashes, but for five consecutive years the ashes have been piling up above the Phoenix's head. From the 2019 revolution against the ruling authority, to an ongoing economic crisis and the collapse of Lebanon's currency, to the 2020 port explosion and finally, the start of this war in October 2023, it has been one calamity into another. The most recent, Israel's invasion, continues now. When it will end, and what Lebanon will look like when it does, feels impossible to know.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/what-life-looks-like-in-lebanon-after-1-year-of-conflict-between-hezbollah-and-israel/	2024-10-04T12:20:26-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/lebanon-flag-4-e1728046722483.jpg
HASC leaders probe Navy on Newport News faulty welding problem	The world's largest aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN 78) transits the Mediterranean Sea, Aug. 21, 2023. Gerald R. Ford is the US Navy's newest and most advanced aircraft carrier, representing a generational leap in the US Navy's capacity to project power on a global scale. (US Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Jackson Adkins) WASHINGTON — Leaders of the House Armed Services Committee want the Navy to hand over data about the occurrences of faulty welding made to aircraft carriers and submarines under construction at HII Newport News Shipbuilding. In an Oct. 3 letter to Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro, four senior members of the committee called on the service to lay out a plan for how the Navy and Newport News will 'protect US Navy vessels against knowingly faulty work.' 'It is deeply concerning to learn that faulty welds may have been knowingly made to U.S. Navy submarines and aircraft carriers. The safety of our sailors is our top concern, and we must immediately understand any risks associated with the faulty work,' said HASC Chairman Rep. Mike Rogers of Alabama, HASC’s ranking Democrat Rep. Adam Smith of Washington state; Mississippi Rep. Trent Kelly, who leads the seapower subcommittee; and Connecticut Rep. Joe Courtney, the subcommittee’s top Democrat. The letter from HASC leaders comes a week after USNI News reported that the Justice Department had been notified by Newport News that workers had knowingly made faulty welds while building non-critical components of new and in-service submarines as well as Ford-class carriers. Naval Sea Systems Command has assessed that 'potential deficiencies' on three in-service ships are not on components or systems that affect ship safety or operations, and certified those ships as safe to operate, Capt. Clay Doss, a spokesman for Del Toro, said in a statement to Breaking Defense today. Additionally, Newport News and Navy technical experts are validating specific welds on 23 ships — including new construction vessels and those in refueling complex overhaul or maintenance — with results from the inspections expected in mid-October, Doss said. The Navy provided letters to the four congressional defense committees on Thursday with an update on the problem, Doss said. In a statement, Newport News spokesperson Todd Corillo said the company found through internal reporting that while 'some welders knowingly circumvented certain welding procedures,' initial investigations show 'no indication of malicious intent.' 'Upon this discovery, we took action to communicate with our customers and regulators, investigate, determine root causes, bound the issue, and put in place immediate corrective actions as we work through longer-term solutions,' Corillo said. Newport News declined to comment on how many and which vessels are suspected to have faulty welds, citing the ongoing investigation. The HASC lawmakers included a list of questions about the issue, including whether the Navy fully understands the scope of the problem and if the incorrectly performed welds present a safety threat. The letter also requests that the Navy provide details on all occurrences of faulty welds, a rework plan for impacted ships, and a detailed timeline of when the service was notified about the problems, setting a deadline of Oct. 11 for a response. The lawmakers added that they expect a briefing from Navy officials on the matter 'promptly.' On Sept. 27, a day after the USNI report, Newport News president Jennifer Boykin confirmed in a post on LinkedIn that the company had received reports from workers about welders who 'knowingly violated weld procedures' and produced work that did not meet the company’s quality standards, and had notified the Justice Department. 'I cannot over stress that individual actions and behaviors either strengthen — or weaken — our ethical culture in an instant. Every choice you make as a shipbuilder has long lasting impact,' she stated. Newport News is the prime contractor on the Ford-class carrier and manufactures Virginia-class attack submarines and Columbia-class ballistic missile submarines in partnership with General Dynamics Electric Boat.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/hasc-leaders-probe-navy-on-newport-news-faulty-welding-problem/	2024-10-04T11:10:13-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/10/7987135-e1696858610380.jpg
For a more lethal joint force, answer the ‘Five Ws’ of climate change	Debris litters Tyndall Air Force Base following Hurricane Michael on October 17, 2018 in Panama City, Florida. the base experienced extensive damage from the storm. Hurricane Michael slammed into the Florida Panhandle on October 10, as a category 4 storm causing massive damage and claiming nearly 30 lives. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images) After China became the focus of American defense in the 2018 and 2022 National Defense Strategies, the Pentagon got busy preparing its forces by breaking down the so-called 'China challenge' into smaller, manageable pieces. Professional military education (PME) scoped learning outcomes for intermediate and senior schools, while services created standalone courses and ensured training regimens factored in Chinese tactics. It might not have been easy to do, but the rationale behind the effort was clear: A 'one size fits all' approach to complex threats provides inadequate preparation. When the Pentagon said that the military needed to be able to counter China, it was understood that individual servicemembers’ missions, functions, and roles would guide what they needed to know and do in order to execute that mission. Lessons from that approach now need to be applied towards building the military’s understanding of another existential threat: climate change. A threat so systemic may seem too difficult to disaggregate, but, as with competition with China, there are clear ways to break the issue down and tackle it — despite entirely misguided assertions from some quarters that climate change distracts from the 'real' military mission and leapfrogs higher priorities. Through keeping a focus on what it takes to execute that mission, it’s possible to empower our forces to tackle multiple threats at the same time. I ran the Pentagon’s Office of Force Education and Training for three years, during which time we deepened mission-critical knowledge of China and climate change simultaneously. One did not come at the expense of the other — on the contrary, an understanding of climate realities enhanced the ability to plan for a China scenario. The approach wasn’t about turning on a firehose of climate change information at the expense of other topics. Rather, it was about answering the five Ws: Who needs to know what information when to do which job, and why. Large and complex as it may be, the military’s mission is extremely narrow: Preserve US national interests and security through the threat or use of overwhelming lethal force against any enemy, anywhere, any time. Each job and career path in the military ultimately contributes to that mission. So the question then naturally follows: How does climate change complicate that specific job and that specific career path? The answers to that question are what needs to be taught. For example, to effectively prepare for potential aggression from China, a surface warfare officer needs to understand the order of battle for the Chinese navy and how a Luyang III-class works. She also needs to understand what can affect the accuracy of her ship’s sonar. Ocean salinity is one cause, and salt levels are changing globally as the climate warms. Knowing how to account for that makes her more effective at her job. Or, to pick a ripped-from-the-headlines example, the installation commander of Tyndall Air Force Base needs to understand the impact of increasingly more intense hurricane seasons on his base so he can make climate-informed decisions when preparing and rebuilding. If he is expected to be able to flow forces forward for a China conflict, he needs to understand if his base is going to be unusable for stretches of time each fall and plan accordingly. Integrating climate change into overall preparations, while keeping the focus on the essential knowledge required to execute the mission, is a question of scope. Of course it can be complicated. So is modern warfare. But it can and must be done. And here are five proposals for how to do it well. First, make action, not knowledge, the purpose behind any dissemination of climate change information. Military education and training prepares those who wear the uniform to do something; it’s not a consciousness-raising regimen. Service members across the joint force today are facing operational challenges made worse — or in some cases created — by climate change, from nuclear-powered aircraft carriers unable to cool their equipment and reactors with hot seawater, to soldiers sickening and dying from the heat, to fighting wildfires instead of human adversaries. Information on climate change needs to help people know how to execute the mission, no matter the type or source of the obstacle. Second, tailor that information wisely: Dispense with the misperception that everyone in uniform needs a deep understanding of why the climate is changing. Beyond units like the 14th Weather Squadron that are trained climatologists and oceanographers, fluency in the details of anthropogenic change is not mission-essential knowledge. Moreover, delivering that information competes for time that is already overtaxed by the ballooning number of Common Military Training modules. Dispense too with the misperception that everyone in uniform needs to know the same thing about climate change. A Foreign Area Officer in Japan and one in Germany need to appreciate different climate effects; so too a missileer versus an installation commander versus a sub driver. Third, resist the temptation to 'set it and forget it' in professional military education (PME). Use PME and its subset, Joint PME, for what they are best suited for: an early foundation-builder for new officers and a cognitive chiropractor as they rise in the ranks. PME teaches leaders how to think by introducing students to complex issues, such as how to account for the effects of climate change in military strategy and operations (like factoring in warmer oceans when planning carrier deployments). However, PME only reaches a small portion of the total force at set touch points throughout a career, and it only sets the stage for the problems future leaders will face. A static dispensary of information is not an on-demand problem solver — and the problems today’s servicemembers will face are dynamic and fluid. Fourth, support the growth of and access to places that provide answers for dynamic and fluid problems, like the DoD Climate Resilience Portal. Such a website helps provide the sorting function for what a vast and complex military needs to know to achieve the mission in a climate-informed way. Finally, ensure that the places created to provide job-specific training include climate realism. A tank driver attempting to navigate a washed-out bridge with a 68-ton Abrams should be able to rely on the preparation she got at Ft. Moore. Build muscle memory early for the likely scenarios servicemembers will face over their careers. The US military is not only the greatest fighting force the world has ever seen, but also a world-class risk mitigation organization. Integrating climate information into how they perform their jobs only makes them better at them. Service and DoD leadership should deliver practical, climate-informed education and training that helps them know what to do. Then they can get after solving any problem.

US Heritage Foundation offers Pacific Islands’ blueprint for Trump	WASHINGTON, DC &#8211; SEPTEMBER 25: U.S. President Joe Biden participates in a group photo with leaders at the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) as part of the U.S.-Pacific Islands Forum Summit at the White House on September 25, 2023 in Washington, DC. President Biden and senior administration officials are meeting with Pacific Islands leaders to discuss regional corporation on climate change, economic growth and regional security. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images) SYDNEY — The US-based Heritage Foundation, closely associated with many supporters of former President Donald Trump, has published a report making competition with China the centerpiece of US policy in the Pacific Islands and urging it pump more money into the region to ensure that American interests be paramount. 'American policymakers should consider the Pacific Islands a region worthy of increased U.S. engagement and resource allocation,' the report says. 'While focused on making the case for and to Americans, the strategy also incorporates Pacific Island, allied, and partner interests and perspectives to emphasize shared interests, potential areas of cooperation, and long-lasting engagement opportunities.' The paragraph ends with the line that the US should 'counter Chinese ambitions in the Pacific.' The report, tellingly titled 'The Pacific Pivot: An American Strategy for the Pacific Islands,' notes that since the Solomon Islands former leader, Manasseh Sogavare, signed a still-secret security pact with China — catching the western national security establishment by surprise — competition for influence with island populations and their leaders has grown much sharper. 'The Pacific Islands occupy a pivotal location that is important to U.S. efforts to protect Americans and deny China’s regional hegemonic ambitions,' the report says. But this greater competition for influence requires careful management, the report says: 'If the United States does not carefully navigate these relationships, it risks ceding influence and access to China, thereby granting Beijing a potential foothold in the Indo–Pacific that can threaten U.S. national security interests and complicate possible future military operations in Asia, if and when needed.' Aside from simple competition for influence, the report, authored by Andrew Harding, points to the crucial strategic locations of the islands, as was so well demonstrated during World War II. They straddle the shipping lanes that carry the majority of global trade, span vast areas of the Pacific's fishing grounds, gas fields and possible sea floor mineral riches. As to how to accomplish the goals sought by Heritage, America should pursue 'at least one, if not more, of four vital national interests: In keeping with Heritage's heritage as the most stalwart of the conservative think tanks in Washington, the report focuses on the American Pacific territories and what it says are 'immigration loopholes' there that 'should be closed.' But the aperture widens when the report argues that the primary goal of the United States in the Pacific should be 'to defend its people, territories, and way of life.' While it praises elements of the Biden Administration's Pacific Islands strategy, the first of its kind, Heritage says it 'possesses two primary shortcomings,' ones that will sound familiar to those who follow Trump closely. The Biden strategy 'does not explain' how it materially benefits America, the Heritage report says, noting that it places great emphasis on climate change and its effects on the islands, something that many experts said played an important role in the Solomon's decision to bend toward China. Instead of putting American interests first in the region, Biden's strategy 'ranks the interests of the Pacific Islands above American interests and does not explicitly articulate why or how any of the proposed objectives or lines of effort directly benefit America’s interests or the American people.' In keeping with the Republican Party's strongly skeptical view of climate change, the report cites what it calls the Biden strategy's 'overemphasis on combatting the effects of climate change as a vital American interest.' (original italics). Instead, Heritage says 'a stronger strategy would include a more realistic, straightforward acknowledgement of the threats China poses to the region and the economic opportunities the U.S. could support—even if they may not be exactly what the region may prefer to hear.' While Heritage does not dictate what the Republicans in Congress or a possible Trump administration do, no other think tank carries as much weight in those communities. Heritage's Project 2025 document is widely viewed as a blueprint for how a Trump administration will govern, and a recent document from the organization openly billed itself as 'a draft Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) for a 2025 presidential administration.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/us-heritage-foundation-offers-pacific-islands-blueprint-for-trump/	2024-10-04T07:58:13-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/pacific-islands-forum-scaled-e1728048989585.jpg
CCA: What weapons and engines will let loyal wingmen drones hit their potential? [VIDEO]	WASHINGTON — When talking about aircraft, it's easy to focus on the main body of the plane itself. But in many cases, it's the subsystems that make a capability reach its full potential. That's true for drones as well as manned jets, meaning whether the US Air Force's Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) program is ultimately a success will come down, in part, to the engine, weapons, sensors and communications gear that are on board. In the final video from our CCA roundtable discussion, our panel — Editor-in-Chief Aaron Mehta, reporters Michael Marrow and Valerie Insinna, and Stacie Pettyjohn of the Center for a New American Security think tank — go into the development of those systems, where the technology is at and the pros and cons of different capabilities that can be strapped onto a CCA.

ULA’s Vulcan rocket makes second launch in quest to qualify for Space Force missions	ULA launches its Vulcan rocket on Oct. 4, 2024. (Screengrab via ULA livestream) WASHINGTON — Following its launch this morning, United Launch Alliance's Vulcan Centaur heavy-lift rocket could be on its way to being certified by the Space Force to launch critical national security payloads under its National Security Space Launch (NSSL) program. While the final approval for Vulcan awaits a Space Force review of the technical data from the launch — including what appeared to be a mid-launch anomaly — a successful launch was the critical hurdle for ULA as two 'certification' launches are required for any rocket to be given a thumbs up to fly NSSL missions. The first Vulcan launch was in January, nearly four years later than originally scheduled, and Pentagon officials have been anxiously awaiting today's success, concerned about military payloads backing up on the ground. Today's launch also came after about a month's delay, with ULA CEO Tory Bruno back in June saying the company was planning a flight in early September. The launch was first briefly delayed by a technical issue, and then during the launch some material unexpectedly appeared to come off one of the boosters, but the flight did not appear effected. Bruno addressed the issue on the ULA's webcast, saying the launch put its payload into space where it intended and the trajectory was 'nominal throughout.' 'We did, however, have an observation on SRB [solid rocket booster] number 1, and so we will be off looking into that after the mission is complete,' he said. 'Other than that the flight was nominal.' Bruno appeared confident whatever the incident was, it wouldn't stand in the way of ULA's NSSL certification. 'For ULA, we designed this rocket for the national security mission space. Completing the second certification flight successfully allows us to begin those missions that are urgent and important to the country,' he said. A failure to certify would put the Space Force between a rock and a hard place regarding NSSL launches. ULA and SpaceX were contracted by the NSSL Phase 2 program in 2020, under an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity award covering all Space Force and National Reconnaissance Office launches between 2022 and 2027. (The NRO is responsible for the nation's spy satellites.) ULA was awarded a 60 percent share of all the launches. While most of those were slated for its Atlas V and Delta IV Heavy rockets, both of those have been retired from military service. Vulcan has two national security launch missions on its manifest for this year, USSF-106 and USSF-87. If the certification doesn't go through, Space Force would have had to switch those missions to SpaceX — the only other launch company currently certified to fly critical payloads under NSSL. Not only does SpaceX already have a pretty full manifest for its Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy lifters, but Defense Department officials and some members of Congress have been fretting about ceding a national security launch monopoly to the company's unpredictable owner, Elon Musk. Further, ULA along with SpaceX and Blue Origin on June 13 won spots to compete for a total of $5.6 billion in contracts for launches to low Earth orbit under what the Space Force calls Lane 2 of the NSSL Phase 3 program covering launch orders of must-go payloads from fiscal 2025 to 2029, with an option for another five years of launch orders. The Space Force orders launches two years in advance. But Blue Origin's New Glenn rocket has yet to make its maiden flight. Delays in its development prompted NASA to remove its two small Mars exploration satellites, called Escape and Plasma Acceleration and Dynamics Explorers (ESCAPADE), from New Glenn's manifest for fears that the company could not meet the required Oct. 13-21 launch window, according to a Sept. 6 report in Space News. (Spacecraft flying to Mars need to fly at specific times every two years to coincide with the Red Planet's closest approach to the Earth.) Blue Origin, owned by Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos, now intends to attempt its first flight, and first NSSL certification flight, in November. Should Vulcan get the Space Force go-ahead, both planned NSSL missions are expected to fly by the end of the year as planned.

Pentagon on the hunt for cheap, one-way drones	A small unmanned aircraft system (sUAS) is shown in flight at Dugway Proving Ground. (US Army Dugway Proving Ground photo.) WASHINGTON — The Department of Defense is turning to industry for low-cost, one-way long-range unmanned aerial systems that can operate in 'disrupted, disconnected, intermittent, low-bandwidth' (DDIL) environments, according to a recent Defense Innovation Unit solicitation. The solicitation stated that such inexpensive drones have had an 'asymmetric impact' in modern battlefield settings, presumably in Ukraine’s ongoing fight against Russia and the escalating tensions in the Middle East. The US also approved the sale of hundreds of similar air vehicles to Taiwan earlier this year In addition to being DDIL compatible, the drones must also be able to operate in Global Navigation Satellite System denied environments, carry a payload of at least 10 kilograms (though ideally over 25 kg), and be able to travel over 50 kilometers, but ideally 300 km. The number of drones the Pentagon is looking to purchase is not predetermined, and there is no cap on how much the department will spend on this initiative, a DIU spokesperson told Breaking Defense. 'There is no set number of platforms, and we want to focus not on delivering bespoke hardware, but rather on relevant capabilities at the right cost per effect, that with a baseline hardware capability can execute rapid and timely software updates to remain combat effective on a rapidly changing Electronic Warfare battlespace,' the spokesperson said in an email. 'We have no cap on the number of vendors involved, but it will be bounded by capabilities offered and fiscal limitations. It is possible that multiple commercial partners will team on a single contract award as well,' they added. The department intends to 'move aggressively' during the compete process, with the goal of having signed contracts with the chosen companies by mid-January, the spokesperson said. 'From there, we plan to complete all contract items by the end of May, 2025,' they added. Furthermore, the Pentagon is looking for drones that can incorporate third-party software and hardware systems in a 'modular, warm-swappable manner,' the solicitation stated. Adding that 'proprietary interfaces, message formatting, or hardware that require vendor-specific licensing are not permitted.' When asked if this solicitation relates to the the Pentagon’s greater Replicator program — the DoD’s initiative to field thousands of inexpensive, attritable unmanned systems in multiple domains over two years to counter threats in the Indo-Pacific — the DIU spokesperson said: 'We have nothing to announce with any ties for this effort and Replicator.'

New way of operating: Navy medicine prepares for a distributed fleet	Sailors attached to Expeditionary Medical Force One participate in an emergency room simulation during Operation Northern Lights. (US Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class John Sorensen/Released). WASHINGTON — The US Navy’s medical capabilities are undergoing a gradual but steady transformation that is shifting the service’s old way of caring for its injured on the battlefield — focused on massive, discrete hospital ships — and aligning it with the distributed nature of warfare service leadership has embraced in recent years, focused on giving corpsmen precisely what they need to treat a patient when and where they need it. The shift has been necessitated by the broader changes introduced to the service’s way of fighting through its operational concept 'Distributed Maritime Operations,' which generally dictates the fleet should disperse its assets over a larger area to make it harder for an adversary to detect and engage an individual unit. 'When you think about what you need to do to provide medical care to a sailor who’s injured on the battlefield, there’s certain functions that are pretty common,' Capt. Jonathan Haase, program manager for expeditionary missions, told Breaking Defense in an interview. 'The question is: How do you actually get those [capabilities] in many places at the right time with the correctly trained people?' On the first issue, Haase’s office has been developing suites of medical capabilities such as the 'En-Route Care System,' which first deployed on the Eisenhower Carrier Strike Group last October. 'The ERCS consists of a critical care nurse and a search and rescue medical technician with an integrated intensive care mobile unit that will be a component of the overall skills and readiness within the medical department aboard Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower (CVN 69),' a Navy statement about ERCS said at the time. The purpose of a system such as ERCS is to give deployed forces a premade kit full of the medical equipment they would need to reach a patient and provide the right level of care necessary before returning them to a ship or established facility. Prior to now, it was the corpsman's responsibility to assemble that kit when they needed it. That individual responsibility becomes problematic as forces become more distributed. For example, Haase said, a sailor might need to be put on a ventilator and air-lifted in a helicopter. But is the ventilator a corpsman has available suitable for use on a helicopter? It’s a question more easily answered by engineers in Washington than a sailor deployed to the Indo-Pacific. And that gets to the second key issue Haase raised: Whether a piece of equipment is compatible with the Navy’s forms of transport. Much of the transition happening within the Navy has little to do with developing new medical procedures or devices. The Navy's practices largely mirror civilian medicine, but a hospital on land does not have to contend with volatile sea states that could shake the building and cause a mobile bed to slide across the room. A hospital ashore is also not concerned about how an incessant beeping or bright screen may show up to an adversarial sensor. These sorts of minor adjustments to equipment are part of what Haase’s office is working through — taking average medical devices and making them more suitable for use in a battlefield environment. 'We picked the ventilator that would work best in the field that would integrate with the power sources available that could work in a helicopter, and we put that with all the support equipment necessary for it,' he said. 'There’s no new ventilator in there at the end of the day. We just made sure that all those things would work seamlessly across all the different platforms.' Haase could not pinpoint a precise date when these kinds of shifts started taking place, but he did say that 2018 is when the service started to change its internal infrastructure for medical capabilities, or what it calls 'expeditionary medicine.' Prior to 2018, the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery, or BUMED, was responsible for nearly all aspects of the Navy’s medical practices, which included developing requirements, resourcing and contracting for capabilities. In 2018, Haase said, those responsibilities were divided up between BUMED, Naval Sea Systems Command and the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations, also called OPNAV. Those changes actually made expeditionary medicine more closely reflect how the rest of the Navy is structured, rather than having everything contained in BUMED. The full scope of changes being proposed by Naval Sea Systems Command would cost roughly $800 million to develop and implement, according to a draft requirement that Haase said is still going through the Pentagon’s approval process. To date, the captain said his office is managing roughly $122 million in funding that has already been allocated to his work. While not directly under Haase’s purview, his office works in conjunction with the NAVSEA office developing the Expeditionary Medical Ship, a new class of vessel derived from the Expeditionary Fast Transport and designed by Austal USA. EMS will replace the service’s 1,000-bed hospital ships, Mercy and Comfort. While iconic for their humanitarian work and unique white and red paint job, those two ships are at the end of their useful service lives. Further, their deep drafts make them much less mobile than the kinds of ships needed for the service’s more distributed operational concepts.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/new-way-of-operating-navy-medicine-prepares-for-a-distributed-fleet/	2024-10-03T11:20:13-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/1355058-scaled-e1727970123356.jpg
Despite hold on Diego Garcia, UK’s move to return Chago Islands sparks security concerns	Airmen from the 37th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron, Ellsworth Air Force Base, S.D., receive a B-1B Lancer at Naval Support Facility Diego Garcia (US Air Force) BELFAST — Backed by the White House, the United Kingdom agreed to hand sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius today, after 13 rounds of negotiations over the former African colony, but will continue to retain control of the UK-US Diego Garcia military base for an initial period of 99 years. London hailed what it called a 'historic agreement' and focused on the new legal status of the military base, saying that for 'the first time in more than 50 years, the status of the base will be undisputed and legally secure.' But the decision drew swift criticism from opposition lawmakers and analysts who questioned its strategic value in light of China’s close ties with Mauritius. The agreement is 'subject to the finalisation of a treaty and supporting legal instruments,' stated a supporting UK and Mauritius joint statement. The UK cut off the Chagos Archipelago, covering around 55 islands that sit in the middle of the Indian Ocean about 1,700 miles south of the tip of India, from Mauritius over 50 years ago, expelling its population and renaming the region the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT). It then granted the US permission, on a 50 year basis, to use BIOT, including Diego Garcia for defense purposes — an agreement that renewed in 2016 for an additional 20 years. The UK said that 'without' the new agreement signed today, 'the long-term, secure operation of the [Diego Garcia] military base would be under threat, with contested sovereignty and legal challenges — including through various international courts and tribunals.' It added, 'The agreement demonstrates the UK government’s commitment to safeguarding global security and averting threats to peace and prosperity in the Indian Ocean and wider Indo-Pacific. It sees Mauritius assume sovereignty over BIOT, with the UK authorised to exercise the sovereign rights of Mauritius on Diego Garcia.' The new agreement also commits London to a 'package of financial support' to Mauritius, based around an undisclosed annual payment, over the length of the pact. 'More broadly, the UK and Mauritius will cooperate on environmental protection, maritime security, combating illegal fishing, irregular migration and drug and people trafficking within the Chagos Archipelago,' according to the joint statement. In a separate statement, US President Joe Biden, welcomed the pact and stressed that the remote Indian Ocean base 'plays a vital role in national, regional, and global security,' and 'enables the United States to support operations that demonstrate our shared commitment to regional stability, provide rapid response to crises, and counter some of the most challenging security threats we face.' The base is critical for US air and naval operations across the Indo-Pacific in particular in support of B1-B Lancer long-range bomber deployments. Additionally, the site's Naval Support Facility offers 'logistical support for forces operating in and around the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean, and hosts a maritime pre-positioning squadron as well as detachments from the U.S. Fleet and Industrial Supply Center, Air Mobility Command, Pacific Air Force, and the 21st and 22nd Space Operations Squadrons,' according to the Congressional Research Service [PDF]. On the British side, some 40 personnel from the Royal Navy and Royal Marines are said to be stationed at the base. In the UK, a number of analysts and opposition lawmakers from the Conservative Party criticized London's decision — even if the Conservatives originally opened negotiations with Mauritius in 2022, which led to today's agreement. (A year before that the United Nations court ruled the UK had no sovereignty over the islands and said they should be handed back to Mauritius.) On X, Grant Shapps, a former British defense secretary, labelled the move 'absolutely appalling' and a 'deeply regrettable act.' Similarly, Tom Tugendhat, a Conservative party leadership candidate, called it 'a shameful retreat undermining our security and [one] leaving our allies exposed.' He argued the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office had 'negotiated against Britain’s interest.' His rival for the leadership position, Robert Jenrick, equally condemned the agreement. 'This is a dangerous capitulation that will hand our territory to an ally of Beijing,' he claimed on social media. 'You can bet a whole pot of aid money that those other islands,' besides Diego Garcia, 'will be of great interest to PRC [People's Republic of China] intelligence/special ops…' said David Blagden, associate professor at the strategy and security institute, University of Exeter. The potential for Beijing, which has a free trade agreement with Mauritius, to make a play for influence on the islands has been hotly debated before. UK naval analyst Emma Salisbury wrote on X, 'I have a nasty feeling that this UK deal with Mauritius over the Chagos Islands will be seen by historians as a considerable strategic mistake — particularly given the importance of Diego Garcia to UK/US security.' In 2022, the Mauritius ambassador to China penned an op ed for a Chinese state broadcaster highlighting the countries' 'special relationship' and their 'cooperation [in] all spheres, from economy, trade, culture, tourism, health and sports among others.' The Spectator, a conservative-leaning UK political publication, reported today that banks from China and Mauritius signed a 'bilateral currency agreement less than a month ago.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/despite-hold-on-diego-garcia-uks-move-to-return-chago-islands-sparks-security-concerns/	2024-10-03T10:15:28-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/6975971-scaled-e1727972502666.jpg

Aussie ammo company NIOA eyes expansion of 155mm shell production amid sky-high demand	One of the production stations for 155mm shells at the Maryborough, Queensland munitions plant, a joint venture between Rheinmetall of Germany and a privately owned Australian company, NIOA. (Colin Clark/Breaking Defense) MARYBOROUGH, Queensland — A $17,000 AUD ($11,600 USD) forge, the only one of its kind, heats and hammers out 155mm artillery shells at a plant here, helping to supply Ukraine with critically needed ammunition, even though the Australian military does not directly sell them to the besieged European country. Marvelously dexterous robots pick up the red-hot German steel bars sliced from a 2.5-ton slab and place them in the forge, pluck them out, douse them in chemically treated water and taper the nose of the shell. They are spin-balanced and checked to make sure they meet exacting standards. About 10 percent of the shells fail and are remachined or scrapped if they can't be fixed, company executives explained during a tour of the plant. Key machinery at the plant — designed by Australian firm NIOA with help from Germany's Rheinmetall — is designed for this facility and is patented. It is the first munitions plant built in Australia since World War II. The plant, a joint venture between the Rheinmetall (51 percent ownership) and NIOA, a privately-held company, is the only plant capable of producing larger artillery shells in this country, and it was built without direct funding from the Australian military. NIOA CEO Rob Nioa told reporters during a tour that the plant required an initial investment of $90 million AUD ($62 million USD). NIOA invested tens of millions to its own cash, used a nearly $30 million-dollar (AUD) grant from the federal government, and received a few million more from the Queensland state government, concerned because the town of Maryborough had the highest sustained unemployment rate in the state. There were personal reasons as well for Nioa to build the plant there: The family's business started in Maryborough in 1973, where some family members still live. Back in 2017 NIOA won a contract with the Australian Army not to directly produce the ammunition, but to 'source' it from 'international partners,' including another Rheinmetall subsidiary. At the time, Nioa said, 'Australia had lost the ability to forge an in-service shell.' 'We thought it was an important capability to bring on-shore — and we put some proposals to government that were ultimately supported, originally through a regional jobs program,' Nioa said. Construction began in 2020, and the plant currently employs roughly 120 workers, with that number, Nioa's CEO said, predicted to rise over the next several years. Part of the forging process at the Maryborough munitions plant, a joint venture between Germany's Rheinmetall and a privately owned Australian company, NIOA. (Colin Clark/Breaking Defense) The shells, which NIOA executives pointedly call the most desired military product in the world right now as the conflict in Ukraine has shown their utility, are currently rolling off the line at the rate of 20,000 annually. Company officials say they plan to ramp things up fivefold to 100,000 each year. But these are unfilled German DM 121 shells because Australia doesn't make the fuses or the explosives to fill them, despite the country's policy of what it calls being 'sovereign.' Instead of making the complete shells — from shell casing to fuse and explosive — the Australian government appears to have made the choice of investing in long-range precision strike weapons such as HIMARS, the Joint Strike Missile and the rocket motors associated with them, and importing the finished 155mm shells from elsewhere. Meanwhile, NOIA-made shells go to Germany, and company officials say, where they are filled with explosive, and receive primers and fuses. From there, many are sent to Ukraine as part of German security packages. The Nioa CEO believes more can be done here to help both Australia and the western effort to help Ukraine survive the Russian invasion, especially if the government more fully invests in each stage of ammo production. 'So I think we could, with some additional investment, we could significantly increase our output, and we could do more to support the combined allied effort, even if Australia doesn't need more right now, even if Australia is okay with its importer supply, I think Australia could lean forward more and actually support the allied effort, including the US and its preparations in the Indo-Pacific region,' he said. An explosives plant at Mulwala in New South Wales could produce TNT, although the Australian Army prefers insensitive munitions that can be transported and stored more safely. Fuses could be built at Benalla, a remote area in the state of Victoria, though it would require a new facility there. Nioa said that should probably occur at a government facility. The obvious choice would appear to be the government-owned munitions plant at Benalla, Victoria. Nioa did not have an obvious answer to producing primer for the shells, which he called a 'bottleneck' for a range of Australian munitions. (NIOA provided transportation, food and lodging to reporters for the two-day trip to Brisbane and Maryborough.)	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/aussie-ammo-company-nioa-eyes-expansion-of-155mm-shell-production-amid-sky-high-demand/	2024-10-03T08:38:17-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/IMG_3221-scaled-e1727963080320.jpeg
Israeli operations in Lebanon should draw on lessons from the past	Smoke billows during an Israeli airstrike on the the southern Lebanese village of Khiam near the border with Israel on October 3, 2024. (Photo by -/AFP via Getty Images) After almost a year of anticipation, the Israel Defense Forces began ground operations in southern Lebanon on the evening of Sept. 30. Less than 24 hours after Israeli forces stepped foot over the border, Iran unleashed over 180 ballistic missiles at Israel itself. Less than 48 hours after the invasion, the IDF announced eight soldiers had been killed in fighting with Hezbollah forces. Though it is early days still, the IDF is going to face challenges in this new operation. If history is any guide, a short, limited operation (as the IDF has described its plans) will leave the job undone, meaning Israel now faces the real prospect of becoming bogged down inside Lebanon’s boundaries if it can’t accomplish its mission quickly. At the start of the operation, the IDF described the situation as 'limited, localized, and targeted ground raids based on precise intelligence against Hezbollah terrorist targets and infrastructure in southern Lebanon.' The initial target of the IDF’s operations are villages near the border. The decision to begin a ground offensive in Lebanon came after almost a year of rocket, missiles and drone attacks by Hezbollah. This included more than 7,500 rockets launched at Israel between October 2023 and August 2024. In the wake of the first attacks on Oct. 8 of last year, Israel evacuated communities along the northern border, including the city of Kiryat Shmona; more than 60,000 Israelis remain displaced, with no way to return home as long as the Hezbollah attacks continued. In late August Israel’s Defense Minister urged the government to make returning the residents to the north a goal of the war. Prior to this point, the goals of the war were focused on Gaza and included returning hostages held in Gaza, and defeating Hamas’ military and governance capabilities. Once the government approved the new goal in the north in mid-September, the stage was set for a series of rapid moves against Hezbollah — including successful airstrikes against the group’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah — aimed at seizing the initiative and decimating Hezbollah’s command and control. The IDF began its offensive into Lebanon with the 98th Division, which includes the IDF’s Paratroop Brigade and Commando Brigade. The 7th Armored Brigade is also operating alongside this unit. This is the same group of units that fought in Khan Younis in Gaza and was credited with innovating tactics against Hamas tunnels; it is expected that in Lebanon they will face Hezbollah tunnels and a complex battlefield that includes small villages and terrain that is a mix of hills and streams. (Notably, since the ground operation began, the IDF has stated that units have carried out 70 small targeted operations over the last 11 months, helping prepare the ground for the current war.) On Oct. 2 the IDF said its 36th Division, which includes the 188th Armored Brigade, Golani infantry and a brigade of reservists, was also operating in Lebanon. So, what happens now that Israeli forces have crossed the border? History provides a lesson here. Israel has fought in Lebanon three times. The first event, which saw Israel crossing the border in March of 1978, ended up being a truly short campaign against Palestinian militants. The week-long operation targeted areas south of the Litani river and resulted in two UN Resolutions demanding Israel withdrawn and creating the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). Follow Breaking Defense’s full coverage of the region: There may be more to learn from looking at the two other incidents, 1982 and 2006. For instance, in 1982 the initial operation was envisioned as a near-border operation against Palestinian militants, but it rapidly expanded to a march on Beirut as more opposition was encountered. It quickly found itself fighting Hezbollah and other groups, meaning the original goal shifted to new fights against an emerging insurgency. The civilian population of villages near the border, some of whom initially welcomed the IDF, also quickly became unhappy with the Israeli presence. Although the stated objective of getting the militants to leave the border was accomplished, the IDF remained in Lebanon, slowly pulling back from Beirut to the south where it established a security zone working with local forces. In fact, Israel would remain holding some territory until 2000. Just six years later, Hezbollah attacked across Israel’s border, killing eight Israelis and kidnapping two more. That kicked off a 34-day war, which the IDF initially tried to win using airstrikes, drawing on lessons from the recent successful air campaign waged by the US in Kosovo. When this didn’t end the Hezbollah rocket fire, the IDF sent in ill-prepared ground forces who suffered heavier than expected losses against Hezbollah — a surprisingly strong resistance that burnished the group’s reputation and, over time, helped Hezbollah become even more entrenched in Lebanon. Eventually, the two sides settled, leading to UN Resolution 1701. Therefore, in 1982 and 2006 the initial advance into Lebanon led to unexpected results on the ground and mixed results regarding the stated objective. In both cases the end of the campaign left well-armed militant groups north of the border. Attempts to get groups such as Hezbollah to leave southern Lebanon have not succeeded, and UN Resolutions haven’t achieved their mandates. In both 1982 and 2006 the goal was the same: Remove militants from the border region. And in both cases, the IDF had initial success but then ran into challenges that led to an extended conflict. To achieve success in 2024 Israel will need to have measurable goals and a strategy to leave Lebanon when the mission is accomplished. The stated goal is to bring Israelis back to their homes in the north, which requires clearing out Hezbollah’s ability to launch rockets over the border with impunity. But the lessons from 1982 and 2006 show that even if Israel clears out the region, it will need to explain how it will fill the vacuum left by Hezbollah near the border. The Lebanese government lacks leadership at the moment — the president’s office is unoccupied because Lebanese factions cannot agree on a leader, and Lebanon’s Prime Minister has not proven an effective leader in recent years. Without a leader in Beirut to direct the Lebanese army, which has been funded and backed by the West, to take up positions in the south, and without a UN willing to enforce its resolutions, it’s unclear how Hezbollah will be removed permanently. Now, the 2024 war in Lebanon does have two major differences with earlier conflicts. First, the IDF is better trained for this war. The 36th Division and various reserve units have spent nine months training, rotating brigades into exercises that simulate the war in the north. Units such as the 98th Division have spent a year fighting Hamas in Gaza and rooting around in tunnels to uproot what the IDF calls terrorist infrastructure. The IDF has also spent a year carrying out precision strikes on Hezbollah in southern Lebanon and conducting clandestine raids with special forces, essentially softening up the area for the bigger ground incursion. A second major difference is the Iranian backing of Hezbollah and its attempt to knit Hezbollah into a wider group of Iranian-backed groups has led to a multi-front war against Israel. This led to direct Iranian attacks on Israel, most notably this week’s salvo of ballistic missiles. In addition, Iranian backed groups in Iraq and Yemen have sought to strike at Israel to distract from the IDF’s focus on other fronts, whether Gaza or Lebanon. This multi-front war is completely different than what Israel faced in 1982 and 2006 and has the potential to lead to a larger regional war. This leaves Israel with multi-layered challenges in Lebanon. The IDF wants to remove terrorist infrastructure that was built in villages near the border. It could achieve that narrow goal and withdraw. Hezbollah, which has lost many of its commanders and its leader to IDF strikes, may not be in a position to inflict losses on the IDF. In addition, the IDF has prepared for this war via years of training, and Israeli forces are equipped with the latest technology to help protect forces from threats such as anti-tank guided missiles. However, Iran’s threats and threats by Iranian-backed groups in Iraq, Syria, Yemen and elsewhere could lead to a wider war. If Hezbollah appears to be regrouping, the IDF could also be prodded to go further north to fight the group — dragging Jerusalem into more of a quagmire that could force it to stay in the country longer than it would like.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/israeli-operations-in-lebanon-should-draw-on-lessons-from-the-past/	2024-10-03T07:49:18-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/GettyImages-2175584066-scaled-e1727965787635.jpg
Space Force’s new ‘lexicon’: Move to define concepts wins praise, courts concerns	Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman delivers a keynote address on the state of the Space Force during the Air and Space Forces Association 2024 Warfare Symposium in Aurora, Colo., Feb. 13, 2024. (US Air Force photo by Eric Dietrich) WASHINGTON — A new memo from Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman sets out to redefine how the Space Force conceptualizes space operations, reframe the service's missions and creates new 'terms of reference' for official use. More than just an updated dictionary, it's a move that 'lays down a marker for the Space Force,' Doug Loverro, former head of Pentagon space policy, told Breaking Defense. 'This is actually a lot more important to forming the force then selecting uniforms and songs.' But it's also generated some concern in the military space community. The memo on 'Military Space Operations Terms of Reference,' dated Sept. 24 and obtained by Breaking Defense, lays out three 'core functions' for the Space Force, defines space 'mission areas' and their component 'mission sets,' and explains cross-cutting 'enterprise functions' that support the core functions. 'To ensure unity of effort, it is necessary for the Space Force to define common terms of reference (TOR) for military space operations (MSO). A common lexicon ensures clarity and precision across the enterprise, including but not limited to concept development, resource decisions, organizational structures, training, and threat reporting. This TOR serves as a frame of reference to drive understanding and alignment across the Service,' Saltzman writes in his introduction to the new document. 'The attached TOR defines the operational and enterprise activities a military force either red or blue could perform in, from, or to the space domain. Moving forward, the Space Force will normalize lexicon and messaging around the terms described therein.' The Space Force's three core functions are described as follow: Space Control: 'Space Control comprises the activities required to contest and control the space domain. The desired outcome of Space Control operations is Space Superiority, a degree of control that allows forces to operate at a time and place of their choosing without prohibitive interference from space or counterspace threats, while also denying the same to an adversary. 'Space Control consists of offensive and defensive actions, referred to as counterspace operations. Counterspace operations are conducted across the space, electromagnetic spectrum, and ground segments of the space architecture.' For example, the first mission area listed under Space Control is 'Orbital Warfare,' explained as 'Combat operations conducted through fires, movement, and maneuver to control the space domain.' (The memo here marks a further erosion in recent months of the semantic wall separating space operations from offensive combat operations, which officials had jealously guarded in the past.) Global Mission Operations: 'Activities to deliver space capabilities to the Joint Force and the nation.' This core function effectively is the catchall for traditional space support missions, including satellite communications and missile warning/missile tracking. It also includes a new mission area called 'Space-Based Sensing and Targeting' that includes among its subordinate mission sets 'Moving Target Indicator,' defined as the effort to '[c]ollect, process, and disseminate track data on moving targets in the terrestrial domains.' Space Access: 'The movement and sustainment of equipment in, from, and to the space domain.' This includes the 'Space Lift' mission area defined as: 'The movement of payloads (spacecraft or other materials) to and from the space domain.' Launch and 'recovery' of payloads are described as mission sets under Space Lift. Since Saltzman's memo was circulated last week, the effort's initial reception by military space professionals both current and retired, as well as outside analysts, has been far from unified. Some, like Loverro, praised the framework document as necessary for the newest service shape its role in the joint force, and create commonality of purpose internally. 'I do think this is appropriate coming from the CSO’s [Chief of Space Operation's] office,' Loverro said. '[T]hese terms have been defined and redefined over the years — but it is good for the Space Force to have a compendium of terms they use.' Others fretted that the document was developed in somewhat of a vacuum, both internally within the service and externally. In particular, a handful of sources — former and current officials and other close observers — said it does not appear to have been closely coordinated with US Space Command, considering that the new document in some ways doesn't reflect command thinking. This is despite the fact that, as a combatant command, SPACECOM is charged with conducting space operations and developing the requirements for doing so. The Space Force, by contrast and by law, is not a warfighting entity. Rather it is charged with organizing, training and equipping forces and 'presenting' them to SPACECOM and other combatant commands to deploy to the field. SPACECOM did not respond by press time to a query about whether its leaders or personnel had been involved in the document's drafting. Asked by Breaking Defense if the document had been 'coordinated' with SPACECOM Commander Gen. Stephen Whiting, a Space Force spokesperson replied: 'Yes, it has been shared with Gen. Whiting and USSPACECOM. Further, the spokesperson stressed, that the TOR 'was developed by an HQ team with inputs from the [field commands].' There's also the potential for confusion, as a number of sources also pointed out that the TOR document features concepts and terms that differ from those laid out in current Defense Department policies and joint doctrine, the latter of which prescribes how the US military fights as a joint force. The differences could mean a disconnect among the military services as well as with SPACECOM and the other combatant commands, and complicate battlefield operations, the sources worry. 'What stands out to me is that [Saltzman] is attempting to define the core functions and missions of the Space Force in a way that does not align with DOD 5100.1, which defines the core functions and missions of all the military services,' said Todd Harrison, of the American Enterprise Institute and long-time space policy guru. 'It seems like it would be prudent to get the foundation right by updating and clarifying the Space Forces core functions in DOD 5100.1 before attempting to build a complicated structure of frameworks and terms of reference. Otherwise, it seems like this is something that will not align with the rest of the department or the combatant commands, and thus will have limited utility,' he said. Likewise, several current and former Air and Space Force officials pointed out that the new TORs do not always align with those laid out in joint doctrine governing US military space operations, Joint Publication (JP) 3-14. The latest update of JP 3-14, signed off in August 2023, was crafted under the leadership of SPACECOM in close coordination with the Space Force and the Joint Staff, as well as representatives from the other services and combatant commands. That document — which has not been made public but was obtained by Breaking Defense — lays out 10 space mission areas for the joint force's space operations. The TOR document, using slightly different terminology, establishes 11 mission areas for the Space Force grouped under the three core functions. For example, one obvious difference between the two documents is that while the new TORs set 'Space Control' as a Space Force core function, JP 3-14 deliberately dropped the term 'space control' and had it excised from the definitive 'DoD Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms'. Similarly, 'orbital warfare' does not appear either as a mission area or a defined term in JP 3-14. A Space Force spokesperson explained that the TOR document should be seen as kick-starting the service's process of creating its own doctrine — something for which each military service is responsible, and which then informs joint force doctrine development. Meaning, Saltzman's new terms eventually could be reflected in a later joint doctrine publication. 'This is an initial step towards defining our service doctrine as an armed service focused on the space domain. As we mature space concepts and operations, we’ll likely find alignment between Service and Joint Doctrine definitions at the operational level,' the spokesperson said. The trouble is that for now, since the joint doctrine for space ops has been approved, JP 3-14 actually supersedes the Space Force's doctrine, meaning Saltzman's mission categories don't necessarily carry weight outside of his service. The same goes for terms of reference. 'Joint doctrine defines terms for Joint operations. Services have their own terms of reference to suit their unique needs. Any service or combatant command with interest in changing a Joint term can advocate for a change through the standard Joint doctrine review process,' explained a spokesperson for the Joint Staff. 'Over time, Joint doctrine terms adapt to best capture the changing character of war and evolving Joint force approaches. As space is a relatively new domain, doctrine terms and updates are likely to occur more rapidly as the Space Force and space operations develop,' the spokesperson added. Finally, another potential problem for the new mission area construct is that it does not comport with how the Space Force categorizes programs into mission areas in its budget and reports on its activities to Congress, several sources said. One consultant who works closely with Capitol Hill said this could pique complaints as staff has to try to match budget documents to service acquisition programs. That problem, however, is one that may disappear after the current budget cycle, one Space Force official noted. The fiscal 2027 budget simply could be constructed to parallel the TOR document, the official said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/space-forces-new-lexicon-move-to-define-concepts-courts-concerns/	2024-10-02T14:47:26-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/240717_DVIDS_saltzman_speech_8238081-scaled-e1721238990255.jpg
Adding second Virginia-class sub would come at expense of Navy’s next-gen fighter, Austin warns	The Virginia-class attack submarine Minnesota (SSN 783) is under construction at Huntington Ingalls Newport News Shipbuilding. (U.S. Navy photo courtesy of Newport News Shipbuilding/Released) WASHINGTON — Lawmakers hoping to authorize a second Virginia-class submarine in fiscal 2025 could throw a wrench into the development of the Navy’s sixth-generation fighter, potentially delaying the fielding of the new aircraft, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a Sept. 26 letter to lawmakers. The letter, addressed to the leaders of the armed services committees, lays out a laundry list of provisions contained in the House and Senate versions of the National Defense Authorization Act that the Pentagon opposes, including the addition of funding for construction of a second Virginia-class attack submarine. 'Adding a second submarine would require the Department to reduce the Next Generation Fighter program by $400 million, making the fighter program unexecutable and degrading the Navy's ability to field next generation aircraft capabilities required in the 2033 to 2037 timeframe,' Austin said in the letter. The House, which passed its version of the NDAA in June, authorized $1 billion for a second submarine, while the Senate Armed Services Committee approved $400 million in incremental funding to build a second sub. Austin noted that the department opposes both pathways for providing additional money for the program, stating that industry would not be able to produce a second submarine 'on a reasonable schedule,' and urging lawmakers instead to stick to the budget plan laid out by the Navy, which called for only one Virginia-class sub. The decision on whether to obligate additional money for a second submarine ultimately rests with congressional appropriators, who have been more hesitant to put forward the necessary funds. The House’s defense appropriations bill kept funding for the Virginia-class submarine at the levels requested by the Navy, while the Senate Appropriations Committee added $357 million to begin purchasing materials for a second shipset. (Austin’s letter did not touch on the appropriations bills.) The Navy’s sixth-generation program — also called F/A-XX or Next Generation Air Dominance — has already been subject to budget cuts in FY25, with the service delaying about $1 billion in funding previously anticipated for the program this fiscal year due to fiscal constraints and competing readiness needs. Asked whether the Navy could slow down its F/A-XX program even further — following in the steps of the Air Force, which has paused its own future fighter effort — Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Lisa Franchetti said the service remains in source selection for the program, with three companies competing for the contract. 'With F/A-XX, you know, we’re focused on that being our replacement for F/A-18 and the Growlers in the 2030s timeframe,' she said during a Defense Writers Group roundtable this morning. 'We expect that sixth generation platform to … have advanced sensor[s], advanced lethality, advanced range, and being able to integrate with manned and unmanned capabilities together.' Franchetti added that the Navy has been learning from the Air Force’s own work on its fighter program, with the hope of ensuring new capabilities are complimentary to each other.

Ireland draws up ‘record’ $1.5 billion defense budget	Ireland's 2025 defense budget includes funds for getting a new Airbus C295W military transport aircraft, a senior official said. (Irish Department of Defence) BELFAST — Ireland has announced a 'record' €1.35 billion ($1.49 billion) defense budget for 2025, offering funding for ongoing air surveillance radar, subsea awareness, force protection equipment projects and recruitment of 400 additional armed forces personnel. 'The record allocation of €1.35 billion in Budget 2025 demonstrates this government’s commitment to Defence and those who serve our State,' said Micheál Martin, Irish deputy prime minister and defence minister in a statement. He also said that the 2025 budget will 'allow the Air Corps to take delivery of the new Airbus C295W [military transport configured] aircraft,' after Dublin received a second of two C295 maritime patrol aircraft in October 2023. 'This level of investment is critical in the current geopolitical situation,' added Martin. The uptick in spending comes after decades of underfunding and amid accusations from some quarters that Dublin is failing in its responsibility to help defend Europe following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, not to mention an acute domestic military recruitment and retention crisis curtailing ambitions. Ireland does not supply Ukraine with military aid, but since the Russian invasion it has provided Kyiv with approximately €380 million in humanitarian assistance, according to figures from the President of Ukraine website. To overcome high-profile problems, the small, militarily neutral nation, is committed to transforming its defense forces by 2028, based on implementing a series of recommendations made by the Commission on the Defence Forces. Specifically, Dublin is working off the Commission’s Level of Ambition 2 (LOA2) concept, aimed at strengthening capabilities 'to address specific priority gaps in our ability to deal with an assault on Irish sovereignty and to serve in higher intensity peace support, crisis management and humanitarian relief operations overseas,' according to a government statement. Ireland is incapable of intercepting unauthorised or hostile aircraft within its own airspace because it does not operate an air surveillance radar and for political reasons has attempted to keep details secret about an agreement with the UK which allows for Royal Air Force fighter jets to deploy over Irish airspace should such interceptions be necessary. Some lawmakers have even demanded the Irish government share details of the pact to ensure it does not breach the country’s neutrality, according to Sky News. The project to acquire its own air surveillance radar has an estimated value of €300 million and 'will likely' involve three sites, reported The Journal, an Irish online news website. Elsewhere, Ireland's 2025 budget includes €469 million for armed forces permanent staff pay and €8 million for Air Corps fleet maintenance, alongside 'airfield and training costs.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/ireland-draws-up-record-1-5-billion-defense-budget/	2024-10-02T11:30:24-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/FzogUepWAAAw-vi-e1727892927663.jpg
Navy’s 80 percent surge-readiness target is a ‘stretch goal,’ says CNO	The Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS McFaul (DDG 74) participates in a multinational military exercise with NATO allies as part of the Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group. (U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Kerri Kline) WASHINGTON — Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Lisa Franchetti says the Navy's new goal to achieve 80 percent surge-ready forces across the service is a 'stretch goal' born out of a need to have forces ready to deploy outside the service’s normal training cycles. Combat surge readiness is 'a crisis force generation term. It’s really identifying units that can be made ready through tailored training and certification to go out and be deployed to do a mission outside of the [Optimized Fleet Response Plan],' the admiral told a group of reporters today at a roundtable hosted by the Defense Writers Group. The Optimized Fleet Response Plan, also called the OFRP, is the Navy’s formal process for managing the maintenance and deployment of units and assets. In Franchetti’s recently published 'Navigation Plan,' she sets a new goal for the service to 'achieve and sustain an 80 percent combat surge ready posture' across its ships, submarines and aircraft, and has designated the vice chief of naval operations as responsible for hitting that goal. 'Think back to 9/11. We know that all of a sudden we need to get ships underway to do different missions … We want to be able to have a process through each one of our communities: aviation, surface and submarines, that they can certify a ship as combat surge ready, and get it out the door on the timeline that it's needed,' she said. Franchetti’s focus on surge-ready forces is different than her most recent predecessors who all focused on maintenance and readiness in some capacity, but often through the lens of maintenance days and the extent to which delays could be eliminated. 'There is a distinction on the 80 percent and its emphasis should be viewed as on warfighting readiness. That said, take that as comprehensive ship repair, holding and training,' Brent Sadler, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, told Breaking Defense of the CNO’s NAVPLAN. 'Clearly, Navy is taking the 2027 date when China intends to be ready to fight/win a war with the US very seriously.' Much of the CNO’s new NAVPLAN is heavily focused on the year 2027, the deadline to which China’s military is preparing to potentially clash with the United States and allies over the forcible re-unification of Taiwan. Franchetti, who will be the Navy’s top officer when that year comes, has dubbed efforts to prepare the service for that moment as 'Project 33.' (The number 33 alludes to the fact Franchetti is the 33rd officer to serve as CNO.) The CNO characterized the 80 percent figure, as well as most of the other targets in the NAVPLAN, as a 'stretch goal,' but argued, 'they're measurable for a reason, which is why we picked the 80 percent because we think that's a stretch goal, and it will push people harder to get after that.' 'Each community will be looking at, how do they get to that 80 percent right now,' she added.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/navys-80-percent-surge-readiness-target-is-a-stretch-goal-says-cno/	2024-10-02T10:02:14-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/01/240108_ddgs_surface_navy_7452490-scaled-e1704744273645.jpg
What is the Fath-360, Iran’s ballistic missile now arming Russia?	Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian meets with Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin in Tehran, Iran on September 30, 2024. (Photo by Iranian Presidency / Handout/Anadolu via Getty Images) Several weeks ago, reports revealed that Iran has been delivering Fath-360 missiles to Russia. It was an announcement that raised eyebrows and alarm bells among pro-Ukraine nations, but how much will the missile actually change Russia's military calculus? Iran claims that this missile has maximum range of 120 km, with a 150 kg warhead. Computer simulations, based on Iranian information and video analysis, indicate that this claimed range is plausible. However, as such, this missile does not add a radically new capability to Russia’s military: Its range and payload are comparable to that of existing Russian artillery missiles, which Russia has used against Ukraine, particularly the 9M54 family. Furthermore, a comparison of the specifications shows that these Russian missiles are more accurate and spread their effect over a larger area by using sub-munitions. Why then, would Russia buy weapons from Iran which do not fit their existing launchers and for which Russia does not yet have a logistics chain? The answer is likely two-fold. First, Russia’s own industry may not be able to meet its military’s demand and, although the Iranian missiles may be less capable, they may still be suitable against some targets. And second, any weapon that can be used forces Ukraine to expend valuable air and missile defenses. One note: There are no signs the Fath-360 was used in this week's Iranian attack on Israel, likely due to the distance from the Iranian launch sites to their targets. Several weeks ago, US secretary of State Blinken stated that Iran has been delivering Fath-360 ballistic missiles to Russia and that Russia was expected to start using them within weeks. Iran denied this and, at the time of writing, there is no direct evidence in the public domain of Russia using such missiles. However, it is abundantly clear that, after having sold UAVs to Russia, Iran has also been eagerly marketing its ballistic missiles to Moscow. For instance, at the ARMY 2023 exhibition in Moscow, in August 2023, Iran had a large delegation and a stand displaying Iranian weapons including several models of ballistic missiles. Sergei Shoigu, then the Russian Defense Minister, visited the stand. Iran again had a stand at this year’s event, which displayed both UAVs and ballistic missile models, as reported by Breaking Defense. Iran started developing solid-propellant ballistic missiles around 1990, with the unguided Zelzal artillery rocket. That first weapon was rail-launched, with the angle of the rail determining the missile’s trajectory and impact point. To improve the accuracy of such missiles, Iran subsequently developed the Fateh-110. This is also rail-launched, but fitted with a navigation system and four aerodynamic control fins near the missile’s nose. These correct the missile trajectory for, for instance, the rail being misaligned and for wind. The navigation system uses a combination of inertial navigation and satellite navigation. Over time, Iran developed different versions with ranges up to 300 km. (Reportedly, Iran has supplied the Fateh-110 missile type to Hezbollah.) In turn, the Fateh-110 spawned a family of rail-launched solid-propellant missiles of various sizes and ranges. These include further improvements such as lighter casings and more energetic propellant. The largest and most advanced versions have separating re-entry vehicles and ranges of up to 1,450 km. The Fath-360, which is also marketed as the BM-120, is one of the smallest versions. It was unveiled in 2020 and saw combat use in 2022 in Iranian strikes against Iraqi Kurdistan. Because it is compact and uses solid propellant, this type of missile may also be suitable for use by Iranian proxies such as Hezbollah and the Houthis. BM-120/ Fath-360 specifications from the Export Center of the Ministry of Defense of the Islamic Republic of Iran and specifications for the Russian 9M544 and 9M549 artillery rockets from Armament Research Services and TULA news. The Export Center of the Ministry of Defense of the Islamic Republic of Iran has published specifications, including the missile’s mass, length and diameter, as well as the claimed maximum range of 120 km (hence BM-120). The claimed maximum velocity is Mach 4; four times the speed of sound. BM-120/ Fath-360 image compared to reconstruction. Original image: Export Center of the Ministry of Defense of the Islamic Republic of Iran The Export Center also published an image of the missile and of a missile launch vehicle. The proportions of the missile in the image correspond to the published specifications. It is smaller, but has a similar overall configuration as the Fateh-110, with two sets of cruciform stabilizing fins near the tail and four control fins just aft of its nosecone. As on the Fateh-110, these do not lie in the same planes as the tail fins, but have a 45-degree offset. Two different Iranian launch vehicles for Fath-360 missiles, with launch canisters with cylindrical (a) and square (b) cross-sections. Image credit: FARS News &amp; Mashreghnews.ir The launcher carries six missiles in individual launch canisters. These canisters have frangible covers, which suggests that they are also used to transport the missiles. Therefore, reloading the launcher likely requires a crane to stack individual canisters on the launcher with the missiles inside them. This is similar to, for instance, US Patriot surface-to-air missiles. There are at least two canister designs with either a square or a circular cross section. Because the missile’s fins do not fold, depending on whether the canister has a square or circular cross section, its diagonal or diameter has to be larger than the span-width of the fins. Based on a comparison with the size of the truck, the canisters are slightly longer than the missile. The launch vehicle is an IVECO Trakker with a trainable launcher mounted on the back. This elevates the launch canisters to the angle required for the desired range. IVECO is a Turin-based manufacturer that had (and may still have) an agreement with the Iranian vehicle builder Zamyad for assembling IVECO trucks in Iran. This type of commercial truck chassis is typically used for tipper trucks or concrete mixers, so it has limited off-road ability and its cab offers very little ballistic protection. The Iranian trucks are fitted with covers that can slide aft to disguise them as regular commercial trucks. The specifications published by Iran are insufficient to assess whether the missile can fly the claimed 120 km. The propellant mass, propellant specific impulse (a measure for how much thrust the propellant can generate) and the missile burn time are missing. Fortunately, a published video of the launch of a Fath-360 allowed measuring the missile position in individual frames as a function of time, since the length of the missile and the video frame rate are known. Combined with the angle of the launcher, this provided a relation between the missile’s mass and its thrust. The missile’s aerodynamic properties were derived from the image published by the Export Center. An estimated specific impulse of 250 s is suitable for the claimed propellant. Computer simulations of maximum-range trajectories as a function of the propellant mass, with the burn time adjusted such that the acceleration matched the measurement from the video, showed that the claimed range requires a propellant mass of 373 kg. Given the size of the rocket motor, this is reasonable. Since the missile warhead reportedly has a mass of 150 kg, this leaves 264 kg for the mass of the missile airframe, including the engine casing and the guidance equipment. Given its size, this is a reasonable number too. Thus the claimed 120 km-range is plausible. Simulated maximum-range trajectory (a) and Mach number as a function of time (b). The simulations show that on a maximum-range trajectory, the missile reaches a maximum altitude of close to 45 km. At burnout, the missile reaches a speed equivalent to four times the speed of sound, or Mach 4, as claimed by Iran. The missile subsequently continues to gain altitude, losing velocity until it reaches the highest point at 100 seconds into the flight. After this, it starts to fall down and gains velocity, which peaks at close to Mach 3. During the final phase of the flight, due to increasing air density at lower altitudes, the missile again sheds velocity, hitting the target at Mach 2. The total flight time to 120 kilometers is close to 200 seconds. Iran claims a Circular Error Probable (CEP) of 30 meters. This is the radius around a target within which 50 percent of the projectiles launched at that target land, so it is a measure of the missile’s precision. The Iranian claim is plausible. In their 2020 attack on US facilities at Al Asad AB in Iraq, in which they used missiles with maneuverable re-entry vehicles that also navigated using a combination of satellite and inertial navigation, they demonstrated a CEP of several tens of meters. To do significant damage to targets such as bridges or armored vehicles, a 150 kg warhead will have to hit within a few meters, however, so this CEP is only good enough to hit relatively large or soft targets. Otherwise, at least one landing close enough to do significant damage will require multiple projectiles. In Ukraine, the CEP likely will be significantly worse, since satellite navigation systems in Ukraine are being jammed to address the threat of drones. Russia has been using the SS-26 'Stone'/ Iskander-B ballistic missile against Ukraine, with a reported range of close to 500 km. With its 120 km-range, the Iranian missile may help Russia ‘preserv[e] its longer-range capabilities for use throughout the battlefield’, as a Pentagon spokesperson put it. However, Russia already has a missile system for similar shorter ranges. The Russian military has a history of using rocket artillery dating back to World War II, when the Soviet Army used Katyusha rockets. These had a poor CEP, but they were inexpensive and were fired in large numbers, to compensate. The most modern Russian artillery rockets belong to the 9M54 family and Russia has used these in Ukraine. Different versions have ranges of up to 120 km (or even 200 km). To improve their precision, depending on the particular version, these too use inertial and satellite navigation (in particular the Russian GLONASS system) and have nose-mounted control fins. Reportedly, the control fins can also make the missiles maneuver such that their final descent towards their targets is nearly vertical, making them harder to intercept. The missiles are longer and narrower than the Fath-360 and they have folding fins, so they take up less space in transit. Instead of a single warhead, the 9M544 and 9M549 missiles carry sub-munitions, spreading their effect over a larger area. Reportedly, the 9M544 carries 522 dual-purpose sub-munitions, suitable against armored vehicles and personnel, while the 9M549 carries 72 high-explosive fragmentation munitions optimized against personnel. Different sources give slightly different specifications, but the missiles are a bit heavier than the Fath-360. Their CEP reportedly is between 7 and 15 meters, which would make them more accurate than the Fath-360. Since the Fath-360 does not add a significantly new capability to Russia’s military, why then would Russia buy Iranian missiles? It suggests that Russia’s own industry simply cannot meet the demand for missile systems intended for this sort of range. Examination of electronics in the guidance section of a 9M544 missile, retrieved in Ukraine, revealed the presence of Western components. When this missile was designed, around the turn of the century, Russia still had easy access to Western electronics. Some of those components are still available on the civilian market, but Russia may now struggle to buy them in sufficient quantities. There are reports that the deal with Iran does not cover launchers. It would make sense for Russia to fit launchers to trucks already in Russian service, such that they can use the existing logistics chain, but Russia’s vehicle supplies may also be running low. Regardless, despite the Fath-360’s drawbacks, it may be suitable against targets such as Ukraine’s electricity distribution system or for use as a terror weapon against the civilian population. Furthermore, launching these missiles against Ukraine will force Kyiv to expend more air and missile defense capabilities against less valuable threats. Finally, improvements to these missiles based on the experience of their use in combat, may also help Iran and its proxies elsewhere, which Russia may hope to benefit from indirectly.

In new letter to White House, senators drill down for info on ICE Pact	The icebreaker USCGC Healy (WAGB 20) keeps station while conducting crane operations alongside a multi-year ice floe for a science evolution in the Beaufort Sea, Aug. 9, 2023. (U.S. Coast Guard photo by Petty Officer 3rd Class Briana Carter) WASHINGTON — A bipartisan trio of senators are seeking information from the White House about the impacts the new trilateral security agreement ICE Pact will have on the American shipbuilding industry and what changes may be necessary from Congress to move it forward, according to a letter obtained by Breaking Defense. The new letter, signed by Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn.; Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash.; and Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, R-Miss., applauded the security agreement announced earlier this summer during the NATO Summit in Washington, DC. The need for cooperation on the construction of heavy icebreakers capable of freely navigating the High North is particularly urgent given increasing Russian and Chinese activities in the region, the senators wrote. 'In response to the changing physical environment and growing international pressure following its invasion of Ukraine, Russia has significantly built up its military footprint in the Arctic and re-opened several Soviet-era military bases,' according to the letter. 'China, often in close coordination with Russia, has made critical investments to enable exploitation of natural resources above the Arctic Circle.' The senators also cited the three dozen icebreaking ships in Russia’s fleet compared to the United States’ two operational icebreakers . Breaking Defense in August took an in-depth look at the new race for dominance in the north, finding that while the American defense industrial base is large, the specific skill sets and capabilities needed to produce heavy icebreakers have atrophied in recent history. For at least part of the summer, the American icebreaker fleet — consisting of the Polar Star (WAGB-10) and the Healy (WAGB-20) — was completely unable to patrol the Arctic, with one ship tied up in maintenance while the other was being assessed for damage from a fire. The ability of the US and allies to continually be present in the Arctic, the senators wrote, is 'critical.' That kind of shortfall is in part why the Biden administration chose to partner with allies Canada and Finland, both of whom have significant experience in this niche sector of shipbuilding. When the leaders of the three nations announced ICE Pact during the NATO Summit, they promised further details would be released in a memorandum of understanding to be published later this year. In their letter, the senators said they were interested in information that would inform Congress' work in helping facilitate the pact's execution. Their questions include: 'Year-round presence and situational awareness in these areas is critical to enforcing the rules-based order in the high-latitudes, protecting freedom of navigation, and ensuring that natural resource extraction abides by environmental rules and regulations,' the senators wrote. 'A reliable icebreaker fleet operated by the U.S. and our allies is critical to achieving these strategic objectives, especially in the Arctic Circle.' 'By combining American industrial strength with the icebreaker design and shipbuilding experience of Finnish and Canadian partners, we see great potential in ICE Pact to bolster international collaboration in the Arctic and Antarctic broadly,' the letter continued.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/in-new-letter-to-white-house-senators-drill-down-for-info-on-ice-pact/	2024-10-02T08:00:45-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/240711_DVIDS_icebreaker_7966479-scaled-e1720703191686.jpg
Going for the gold: Chinese firms lead US firms in remote sensing ‘Olympics’	A Smart Dragon-3 carrier rocket carrying Tianyi-41 and other satellites blasts off from the waters near the city of Haiyang on Sept. 24, 2024 in Shandong Province of China.

(Photo by VCG/VCG via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — A new assessment of global commercial remote sensing satellite systems shows that Chinese firms are edging out US commercial firms in capabilities across a broad range of sensor technologies. The study produced a 'Top 3' ranking of the world’s best commercial space-based remote sensing systems in 2024 framed as a mock Olympic Games. China grabbed the 'gold medal' in five areas; the US in four. One company each from Finland and South Korea also nabbed gold. The report, 'Gold Rush: The 2024 Commercial Remote Sensing Global Rankings,' was released today by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), Taylor Geospatial Institute, Taylor Geospatial Engine, and United States Geospatial Intelligence Foundation. A new report by four research institutions show Chinese commercial remote sensing firms edging out US firms in technical capabilities. (Image credit: Kari Bingen, David Gauthier, and Madeleine Chang) 'Those China flags matter,' said Robert Cardillo, former director of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), during a CSIS seminar to debut the report. 'We're in a competition. It's not a secret, okay? It's an open competition, and as any world competition, state competitors are going to use everything at their wherewithal to create their advantage. So we should take it also as a warning that this game is afoot.' Cardillo's remarks echo the conclusions of the report's three main authors, all affiliated with CSIS: Kari Bingen, director of the Aerospace Security Project; Dave Gauthier, senior associate and former head of NGA Commercial and Business Operations; and Madeleine Chang, Horizon Fellow at the Aerospace Security Project. 'The stakes are high. Should any one country dominate the commercial remote sensing market, not only could it gain economic advantages, but it would also control the information narrative about the entire planet, from the environment to natural resources to human conflict,' the report concluded. The authors used 11 performance categories and open source information to assess company capabilities across the remote sensing technology landscape, including electro-optical (EO), synthetic aperture radar (SAR), and infrared (IR) sensors, the report explained. The assessment also included parameters relevant to each of those sensor categories, such as 'spatial resolution, spectral resolution, number of imaging bands, and the number of operational satellites (or persistence of imaging), among others.' A new report, 'Gold Rush: The 2024 Commercial Remote Sensing Global Rankings,' compares the performance of commercial remote sensing satellites around the world. (Image credit: Kari Bingen, David Gauthier and Madeleine Chang) The research was based in large part on a 2021 'Commercial Imaging Olympics' study by the NGA and spearheaded by Gauthier. That report, which used nine technical parameters that were also used in the new study, awarded three gold medals each to China and the US. That study helped spur the US Intelligence Community to open a door to acquiring foreign satellite imagery to bolster that provided by the National Reconnaissance Office's fleet of spy satellites and its US commercial partners. The report noted that in the new Olympic race, 'nearly half of the podium spots went to satellite systems launched between 2021 and 2024, showing a large amount of dynamism within the last four years and the speed at which more advanced capabilities are being introduced in the global commercial marketplace.' In addition, the authors presented recommendations that the US government 'should take as &#8216;a regulator, investor, and customer' to keep U.S. companies at the cutting edge of technology and globally competitive' — given that, whether policymakers like it or not, the US government (especially the national security community including the Defense Department) is 'the primary customer and market driver.' As such, the US government as a whole 'will need to take a more strategic and active role in advancing commercial capabilities that must endure and be competitive against Chinese commercial offerings, among others,' the report elaborated. 'This means building multiyear budget profiles for commercial remote sensing to create a stable demand signal, harmonizing government investment and private capital, aligning executive and legislative branch support, improving access to financial tools common in other economic sectors, and continuing to reform U.S. export policies and regulations.' Sue Gordon, former principal deputy director of national intelligence, used her keynote address at the CSIS event to urge national security leaders to grab on to the opportunities provided by commercial capabilities to keep in front of US adversaries — by 'thinking more about the outcomes we must have, rather than the things that we can build.' She added: 'You can only get to the future if you get let go of something that you have always believed in. We cannot hold on, whether companies or government, to everything that we have always believed to be true, you have to let go of some fixed points, otherwise you are dragging them and you won't get there.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/going-for-the-gold-chinese-firms-lead-us-firms-in-remote-sensing-olympics/	2024-10-02T05:54:47-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/241001_chinese_sats_launch_GettyImages-2174108904-scaled-e1727809406109.jpg
What it was like on the ground during Iran’s attack on Israel	Missiles fired from Iran are seen over Jerusalem from Hebron, West Bank on October 01, 2024. The Israeli army announced that missiles were fired from Iran towards Israel and sirens were heard across the country, especially in Tel Aviv. (Photo by Wisam Hashlamoun/Anadolu via Getty Images) Editor's note: On Oct. 1, Iran launched roughly 180 ballistic missiles at Israel. The following is a first-person look at what it was like to be in Israel tonight from Breaking Defense correspondent Seth J. Frantzman. JERUSALEM — Iranian ballistic missiles look like small points of light from far away, almost like little yellow stars, streaking slowly through the atmosphere. I could see them from my balcony tonight, starting around 7:30 in the evening. It would be awe-inspiring, in another context. Today's attack by Iran wasn’t unexpected. Earlier in the day, the Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said that 'a short while ago, our partners in the United States informed us that they have identified that Iran is preparing to launch missiles towards the State of Israel.' The IDF urged people to follow the guidelines of the IDF’s Home Front Command, which sends civilians scrambling for shelters, while pledging that 'our aerial defense systems are fully prepared.' Since Israel began a large-scale campaign against Hezbollah in Lebanon, the public has been bracing for some form of retaliation from Iran, but the warnings came faster than many people expected. It was around 4:30 in the afternoon, sending people streaming from offices for home. Like many parents, I had to rush to pick up my kids from school activities early. On the way home I decided to get some gas for the car, because in emergency situations it is expected that sometimes gas stations or other services won’t function. I wasn’t the only one with that thought, leaving us stuck in a long line. By the time I got home, statements by Israeli officials and media painted the looming attack as more serious than the one conducted by Iran in April. During that previous attack, Iran launched 170 drones and 120 ballistic missiles. Because drones take several hours to reach Israel, there was a lot of time to prepare. Tonight’s attack unfolded differently; reports initially indicated it could come over the next 12 hours, but it wasn’t clear when those 12 hours had begun. The countdown likely began in the early afternoon when the US and Israel became aware of the threat. Media reports in Israel also indicated Israel was taking this attack more seriously. This sense of concern was communicated vaguely, but it was clear this time things were different than in April. It was as if the danger might occur over a longer period of time and that Israel was more likely to respond. Several minutes before 7:30 in the evening Israelis received an emergency alert on their phone saying they should enter their safe rooms or bomb shelters. Many homes in Israel have a safe room, but in other areas people have to go to public shelters that are usually in basements underground. Our family sheltered in our safe room with a radio that can be used to get updates. I brought in bottled water in case we had to remain for a period of time — and then went out on the balcony to see what would happen. More rounds of sirens and dozens of projectiles seen flying over Jerusalem, including interceptors and missiles; explosions heard far in distance. pic.twitter.com/ncjocyO2j5 &mdash; Seth Frantzman (@sfrantzman) October 1, 2024 From my experience in the April attack, the Iranian missiles and the Israeli interceptors being sent up to stop them can be seen before sirens sound. This is because in some cases ballistic missiles can be seen many miles away, but they are not actually a threat to the area you are in. In addition, sirens sound due to the missiles and the potential shrapnel from interceptions, creating different reasons to set off the alarms. As in April, the IDF’s Arrow interceptors could be seen being launched before the sirens sounded. What I was less prepared for was the fact that many of the ballistic missiles appeared to continue overhead, in large numbers and waves that lasted for 20 minutes. Sirens came and went, but the missiles could be seen streaking over, sometimes in groups of five or six, and sometimes in long lines. It was stunning, seeing burning balls of fire fly through the sky, giving the same almost awestruck feeling of watching a meteor enter the atmosphere. However, the knowledge that these were missiles with warheads that would land somewhere was sobering. The ballistic missiles fired by Iran, around 180 of them the IDF said after the event, flew over Jerusalem, some toward central Israel and some toward southern Israel. Some of them were intercepted, from what I could see, but it appeared that many continued on their journey. Later videos shared on social media showed some of the missiles impacting Israel. (As of publication, there are reports of at least half a dozen killed in the strike.) If any country is prepared to protect against this kind of attack, it’s Israel. The country has excellent air defenses and a good warning system in place to prepare people to take shelter in these kinds of attacks. In addition, the intelligence sharing with the United States is very good: An Israeli security official said after the attack that 'in cooperation with AFCENT [the US Air Force component of Central Command], the IAF [Israel Air Force] operated in an effective and precise manner, intercepting most of the missiles — several hits were identified, and the damage is being assessed.' US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin also spoke with Israel’s Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant before the attack unfolded. And speaking after the barrage, Pentagon spokesman Maj. Gen. Patrick Ryder told press that the USS Cole and USS Bulkeley fired 'about' 12 interceptors during the attack but did not have an assessment yet on whether they hit their targets. Overall, Ryder said, the US is seeing 'minimal' damage on the ground, adding that 'Israel was able to successfully defend itself, of course with support from the US.' Nevertheless, despite the preparations, the sight of Iranian ballistic missiles raining down overhead is intensely disconcerting. It illustrates the power of Iran and its ability to coordinate large attacks. It’s possible Iran hopes to normalize this kind of attack on Israel itself, now having made such a launch twice this year after decades of avoiding direct confrontation. Certainly, Iran is seeking to send a message to its proxies that it hasn’t completely abandoned them in the wake of the killing of Hezbollah’s leader. For its part, Israel has reportedly pledged a widespread response to Iran’s actions tonight. For now, the night is calm, and the louder noises — which would warn Israelis another round of missiles are incoming — are absent. We’ll see how quiet the country, and the region, is in the morning.

Brenda Salgado) In a request for information (RFI) posted online, the Army’s program executive office for command, control, communications-tactical (PEO C3T) announced it is seeking input on 'experimentation, pilots and, prototyping' in establishing NGC2. Monday’s RFI is the first one related to C2NG to come out of PEO C3T and came after the office held an industry day to provide more information to interested vendors on Sept. 16. The document was released 'in accordance with the Army Futures Command (AFC) Characteristics of Need (CoN) requirement,' related to that office's own interest in next-gen C2, which came out May 21, according to the RFI. PEO C3T's RFI includes questions about how industry would 'design and manage a common services architecture for warfighting applications' while allowing for a 'plug-and-plan' architecture, and how industry would use a common data layer to leverage capabilities to 'meet war fighting needs.' Furthermore, it asks how industry sees the role of the Army’s Unified Data Reference Architecture — a broader service framework — in creating and managing NGC2. The requirement will also include 'maximizing vendor access to capabilities and users' all while aiming to bolster the relationship between industry and government. Additionally, all services and products that are chosen to be part of NGC2 will be 'heavily dependent' upon progressive software analytics, artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities to assist feedback in performance, the RFI states. NGC2, sometimes called C2 Next, is the service’s plan to create an integrated C2 structure focusing on data centricity 'at every echelon,' which will be a 'system of systems,' per the RFI. It's designed to combine intelligence, C2 and fires all in one system so commanders can have information more readily available — a key driving idea behind the Pentagon's wide Combined Joint All-Domain Command and Control effort. RELATED: Army’s upcoming Project Convergence billed as early test for ‘C2 Next’ plans The service will test out the NGC2 principle in March of 2025 at the Project Convergence capstone five event, Col Michael Kaloostian, the AFC’s networks and security director for NCC2, told Breaking Defense in August. 'We are in the S&amp;T [science and technology] phase, and we’re still doing [research and development] on this project,' Kaloostian told Breaking Defense during an Aug. 22 interview. 'We’re going to learn [with] each step. … It’s always gonna be iterative, because technology is always going to improve,' he later added. The RFI released Monday is currently open for comment and will close on Oct. 4 at 5 p.m. ET.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/army-seeks-new-industry-input-for-next-generation-command-and-control-initiative/	2024-10-01T12:37:31-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/02/240214_DVIDS_tact_air_ops_light_7467434-scaled-e1707951323568.jpg
Space Moves: Anduril solidifies DoD-focused market strategy	AI-powered software startup Anduril and Apex Space are partnering to rapidly produce satellites for military applications. (Image: Anduril) The Space Force on Sept. 27 awarded Anduril a $25.3 million contract to expand the use of its artificial intelligence-powered Lattice software that enables mesh network communications to more sites in the service's Space Surveillance Network (SSN) of globally dispersed telescopes and radar. The contract, which extends through March 2026, follows a pair of Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) awards in 2022 and 2023 for similar work, with the aim of making the network's communications more resilient and helping ensure US Space Command can keep eyes on the skies. The software also is designed to allow the addition of new sensors, including those owned by private sector entities, to the SSN. Today, Anduril announced it is partnering with Los Angeles-based Apex Space, which mass manufactures commercial satellite buses in a variety of standard sizes that can be customized by users. 'Anduril will use Apex’s buses for missions where Apex’s off-the-shelf approach and scalable manufacturing enable Anduril to rapidly deliver capability to customers; such as space situational awareness, proliferated LEO architectures, and missile warning and tracking,' according to Anduril's press release. (Proliferated LEO is a term of art for large constellations of small satellites in low Earth orbit.) 'As part of this agreement, Anduril will utilize its capabilities as a mission systems integrator to field operational systems by bringing together technology across the industrial base. Anduril will also contribute its own products from on-orbit edge processing, versatile payloads, ground C2 [command and control] systems, and other autonomous operations support that is essential to field mission-ready satellite constellations,' the release added. Anduril’s Senior Vice President of Space and Engineering Gokul Subramanian on Sept. 13 said the company intends for its first space monitoring satellites to be launched by the end of 2025 — with the Space Force clearly the target market.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/space-moves-anduril-solidifies-dod-focused-market-strategy/	2024-10-01T11:45:56-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/Apex-Anduril-Image82-1-e1727799837617.png
CCA: How partners — and foes — are developing their own loyal wingman drones	WASHINGTON — The US Air Force is pursuing Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) that will fly alongside military jets, but it's not alone in thinking these loyal wingman systems could be the future of airpower. The US Navy has the same idea, as do partner nations like Australia and the United Kingdom — and adversarial ones like China and Russia. As part of our CCA video series, Breaking Defense assembled a panel featuring Editor-in-Chief Aaron Mehta, reporters Michael Marrow and Valerie Insinna, and Stacie Pettyjohn of the Center for a New American Security think tank to discuss the global picture for CCA-like systems.

As Israel invades, Lebanon’s military ‘repositioning’ itself, but for what?	Lebanese army takes security measures in the area for a missile used in an Israeli airstrike on Hasbaya district that fell on a road without exploding in Nabatieh, southern Lebanon on September 21, 2024. (Photo by Ramiz Dallah/Anadolu via Getty Images) BEIRUT — A day after the Lebanese prime minister suggested there was political willingness to deploy more of the Lebanese military to secure the southern border, the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) announced it was 'repositioning' what forces it had there already in response to Israel’s ground invasion. The repositioning — to larger barracks and posts a little further north, according to expert observers — came as the LAF attempted to refute media reports that it was withdrawing from the south. And while it may not be pulling out altogether, the move highlights the contrast between what might be expected of the country’s formal military and what it’s actually capable of doing when caught between Israeli forces and Hezbollah, the armed Iran-backed group that’s been the de facto power in much of Lebanon’s south for years. 'The LAF is concentrating its forces at company and battalion headquarters, effectively shifting its forces north by some [five to six kilometers],' analyst Aram Nerguizian told Breaking Defense. 'To do otherwise would have made little tactical sense as those forces would have been unnecessarily exposed. The LAF will now maintain a concentrated force with the Litani River to its rear.' What the military will do there as Israeli troops breach Lebanese territory remains to be seen, however. Nerguizian, a senior associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the LAF has an 'aspirational national security role centered on preserving the territorial integrity of Lebanon,' which could include taking 'defensive actions against invading IDF [Israel Defense Forces] forces.' But, he said, considering how poorly Hezbollah has fared against the Israelis, any LAF action would be 'costly in the extreme.' 'While it is technically feasible for the LAF to deploy more forces along the border, the army lacks the advanced military capabilities required to fully protect the area from incursions, particularly against a well-equipped adversary like Israel,' agreed Elie Elias, director of the Middle East Institute for Research and Strategic Studies (MEIRSS). 'The LAF would need substantial reinforcements in air defense systems, advanced radar technologies, and armored vehicles, as well as support in intelligence capabilities to adequately secure the southern borders.' The LAF would most likely avoid a direct fight with Israel, and retired Lebanese Brig. Gen. Andre Bou Maachar said it’s likely the US has already put pressure on Israel not to engage the military as it works to push back Hezbollah. (LAF troops have been killed by Israeli strikes before but are generally not thought to be intended targets.) LAF will more likely do what it can to stabilize the situation as best it can with locals also caught in the crossfire. 'The conflict has and will continue to displace more mainly Shi'a IDPs [internally displaced persons] to other parts of the country. This will accentuate already high demographic, political, and sectarian tensions with risks ranging from tensions to open armed conflict. The LAF will work to mitigate those risks at all costs,' Nerguizian said. But Bou Maachar said the LAF will likely play more of a key role later, when the fighting finally stops. They are expected, he said, 'to have a significant role in the day after a ceasefire is reached, to implement 1701.' That figure, 1701, is a reference to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701 that ended the July 2006 Israeli war on Lebanon under the conditions that Israel withdraw its forces south of what’s known as the Blue Line of demarcation, while LAF and a multi-national group of peacekeepers dubbed United Nations Interim Forces in Lebanon (UNIFIL) will maintain peace to the north — excluding Hezbollah. But the resolution was never fully implemented, as Hezbollah never left the south. But at least some Lebanese officials in the caretaker government have recently seen 1701 as a way forward. On Monday, Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati announced that Lebanon was ready to 'implement Resolution 1701, establish a ceasefire, and deploy the army in the south.' (As Breaking Defense previously reported, that’s a move that the French have said they would support, going as far as to organize a conference dedicated to helping to modernize the LAF’s capabilities should the political willingness be there to send troops to the south.) At the time of Mikati’s remarks, however, it was unclear how such a move might be received by Hezbollah, which is unlikely to welcome LAF troops to any territory it controls. And now that Israel has sent troops across the border, it’s unclear if Mikati would still support sending additional LAF troops. 'Hezbollah is unlikely to cede control over southern Lebanon to the LAF,' Elias said. 'Therefore, any attempts to deploy the LAF effectively in the south would have to carefully navigate the complexities of Hezbollah’s influence and military dominance in the area.' Bou Maachar suggested that if the war continues on its current trajectory and Hezbollah is sufficiently weakened, after a ceasefire the LAF could find a role in finally implementing 1701 as it was originally written up. Nerguizian said that 'over the long term, the government of Lebanon will need the LAF to be ready and able to restore order and fill any potential security vacuum in the SLS [South Litani Sector], if and when the opportunity presents itself.' 'The core question is what sort of enabling environment &#8211; politically in Lebanon, and at the geopolitical level &#8211; might emerge, and does that empower the LAF to extend the sovereignty of the government of Lebanon to the SLS? If the answer is yes, then capability requirements can be fleshed out fairly easily based on real world mission parameters,' he said. 'If, however, there is no enabling environment, or if Hezbollah remains preeminent in the SLS in political terms, then the subject is a moot issue.' In the meantime, villagers in South Lebanon told Breaking Defense that they have clearly heard for hours a mixture of artillery, surveillance drones and helicopters as the IDF pushes north. 'Last night was unlike anything seen before, way more intense than any scene in action movies,' one villager said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/as-israel-invades-lebanons-military-repositioning-itself-but-for-what/	2024-10-01T09:49:08-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/241001_LAF_truck_GettyImages-2172612276-scaled-e1727799965733.jpg
Pentagon awards Pratt $1.3 billion to continue work on F-35 engine upgrade	A Pratt &amp; Whitney F135 engine hangs in Arnold Engineering Development Complex (AEDC) Sea Level Test Cell 3 at Arnold Air Force Base, Tenn., between test runs Sept. 2, 2021. (U.S. Air Force photo by Jill Pickett) WASHINGTON — RTX subsidiary Pratt &amp; Whitney has secured a not-to-exceed $1.3 billion contract to continue developing an upgrade for the F-35’s engine, the Pentagon announced Monday evening. Known as the Engine Core Upgrade (ECU), the enhancement is expected to boost performance as well as power and cooling for the Pratt-made F135. Monday’s award — issued as an undefinitized action, meaning the Pentagon and Pratt are still working to finalize terms — says that work under the contract is expected to be completed in March 2028. 'This contract is critical to continuing our positive forward momentum on this program,' Jill Albertelli, president of Pratt’s military engines business, said in a statement. 'It allows us to continue work in the risk reduction phase with a fully staffed team focused on design maturation, aircraft integration, and mobilizing the supply base to prepare for production.' The ECU is needed, Pentagon officials say, in large part to head off power and cooling concerns on the F-35. The current F135 engine is already overtaxed by cooling demands, and a suite of forthcoming upgrades known as Block 4 is expected to turn the temperature higher. The engine upgrade is planned to restore engine life that has been lost to heating issues and fully enable Block 4 capabilities, while a separate improvement to the fighter’s cooling system is geared at facilitating features beyond Block 4. Pentagon officials last year, somewhat controversially, opted to upgrade the current engine in a sole-source deal with Pratt rather than pursue a wholesale replacement through a competition, reasoning in part that a new engine was too expensive and not compatible with all three variants of the F-35. The ECU, on the other hand, is planned to fit with the fighter’s existing A, B and C models. The ECU cleared a preliminary design review in July. Pratt officials have previously estimated the ECU could cost as much as $2.4 billion, and have recently set a target to begin deliveries in 2029. Pratt did not immediately respond to questions about the contract issued Monday. Engine giants Pratt and GE Aerospace are separately competing to develop a new engine that will power a planned sixth-generation fighter for the Air Force. That engine effort is known as Next Generation Adaptive Propulsion, though the program's outlook is in question as the service aims to drastically reduce costs for the sixth-gen jet.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/pentagon-awards-pratt-1-3-billion-to-continue-work-on-f-35-engine-upgrade/	2024-10-01T09:24:22-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/f135-e1721819269990.jpg
Survey shows very few DoD contractors ‘fully’ ready for CMMC 2.0 ahead of 2025 rollout	U.S. Air Force Airman 1st Class Leann Munoz, 18th Force Support Squadron customer service technician, types on a computer Mar. 29, 2018, at Kadena Air Base, Japan.

Micaiah Anthony) WASHINGTON — A new survey suggests that very few defense industrial base companies are &#8216;fully' prepared for the looming cybersecurity regulations known as Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) 2.0 set to drop in the first quarter of 2025. The online survey, which took input from 300 respondents in the DIB, was conducted by Merrill Research, a firm that conducts qualitative research for a range of clients including Microsoft, Intel, and Mastercard and was commissioned by CyberSheath, an IT firm that provides CMMC compliance services. 'The defense industrial base is one of the 16 critical infrastructure sectors, and is not only non-compliant, but actually woefully under-secured relative to cybersecurity,' Noonan said. 'The two biggest implications are, first and foremost, we have really a kind of crisis of cybersecurity, or lack of, within the defense industrial base. And then second, for those individual companies, contractors, primes and subs, they're going to be ineligible going forward to continue to win DoD contracts.' The survey also highlighted what pollsters suggested was a potential blindspot: though only 4 percent of respondents were actually CMMC compliant based on third-party assessment, fully 75 percent thought they were based on self assessments. 'It's just a complete disconnect, where, on one hand, contractors are saying, ‘I'm doing a self assessment, and I'm in great shape.’ But then I think when facing the light of day, and the fact that an independent third-party auditor is going to be looking at that [and] they're being very honest and saying ‘We're actually not anywhere near compliance.’ So you have 96 percent of respondents who are saying they couldn't pass these requirements,' Noonan said. 'It highlights the disconnect between the rigor of a self assessment and an actual audit.' The study also revealed that the Supplier Performance Risk System (SPRS) scores among the respondents averaged at a -12, despite needing a score of 110 to meet CMMC standards. SPRS is a tool used by the DoD that measures contractor’s cybersecurity abilities in protecting CUI. CMMC 2.0 is a Pentagon initiative designed to create an upgraded version of CMMC 1.0 which was the baseline that set cybersecurity standards for contractors who handle CUI in 2020 The idea behind CMMC 2.0 is to piggyback off the ideas of CMMC 1.0, while responding to industry complaints that the first compliance program was too costly and restrictive. The study received 300 responses via an online survey in April of this year, including respondents from companies with 40 to up to 1,000 employees, and ranging from C-level executives down to engineers or technicians. The study also surveyed prime contractors, firms that were sub and prime contractors and those who were only sub contractors. All people who responded were part of firms that had at least some Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) obligations in their existing business or contracts.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/survey-shows-very-few-dod-contractors-fully-ready-for-cmmc-2-0-ahead-of-2025-rollout/	2024-10-01T08:32:13-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/240925_DVIDS_soldier_hands_keyboard_4299583-scaled-e1727275120995.jpg
Philippines, US, Japanese coast guards to boost cooperation after Quad meet	A member of the Philippine coast guard vessel BRP Malabrigo mans his post while being shadowed by a Chinese coast guard ship at Second Thomas Shoal in the Spratly Islands in the disputed South China Sea. (Photo by TED ALJIBE/AFP via Getty Images) SYDNEY — The Philippines is readying to step up efforts to secure its waters in the South China and so-called West Philippine seas as a result of a recent Quad meeting, which could also leave China facing increased international maritime pressure. In a White House fact sheet about the Quad gathering, held in Wilmington, Del., Prime Minister Anthony Albanese of Australia, Prime Minister Kishida Fumio of Japan, Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India and US President Joe Biden, made clear that their coast guards would work together increasingly closely. The four maritime security organizations 'plan to launch a first-ever Quad-at-Sea Ship Observer Mission in 2025 in the Indo-Pacific to improve interoperability,' the fact sheet said. 'Through this effort, members of Japan Coast Guard, Australian Border Force, and Indian Coast Guard will spend time on board a U.S. Coast Guard vessel operating in the Indo-Pacific. The Quad intends to continue with further missions in the Indo-Pacific.' All this happens in the shadow of the aggressive and often dangerous operations by Chinese ships and planes apparently intended to compel the Philippines and other nations in the disputed waters to cede control. China has no valid claims to them, according to a United Nations tribunal ruling. China simply argues that, while it works closely with the UN on many issues, it does not accept the organization's decision. The Philippines spokesman on the West Philippine Sea and special advisor to the Coast Guard commandant, Commodore Jay Tristan, said today the US Coast Guard is already helping train Philippine personnel in the US and executing trilateral exercises with Japanese ships. Speaking at the Australian National Press Club in Canberra, Tristan said, 'We have been engaging with the United States Coast Guard in a lot of different issues, whether maritime safety, search and rescue, &#8230; law enforcement, combating piracy, and for exercises that we have with the Japanese Coast Guard.' However, Tristan said bilateral sailing operations with the US Coast Guard 'is something that has not yet been discussed.' The commander of US Coast Guard Indo-Pacific operations, Vice Adm. Andrew Tiongson, told regional reporters that he will 'work very closely with those nations to ensure that we’re operating in the correct place, the correct time, and actually exercising the correct things. &#8230; We always seek to meet our partners where they are, what they need, and always seeing the threats and challenges through their eyes.' Outlining how the US works with the three other Quad members, he added, 'in the planning stage' of engaging with partners, they need to 'figure out the exact locations that we’ll conduct these operations' carry out 'this at-sea ship observer mission — and hopefully we can do that and improve our interoperability as services together.' As with the Philippine-US ship sailings, Tiongson said there are 'no specifics on that just yet, but we are open to a lot of input from our partners.' While not all four nations have had sailors together on one ship, they have worked 'to share insights about how each one of us does our business in terms of maritime law enforcement, search and rescue, maritime security — all of those types of operations that we conduct,' Tiongson said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/philippines-us-japanese-coast-guards-to-boost-cooperation-after-quad-meet/	2024-10-01T07:47:09-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/05/230519_chinese_philippine_ships_GettyImages-1252225704-scaled-e1684519593218.jpg
Former Dutch PM Rutte takes NATO reins, doubles down on Ukraine support and warns China	Mark Rutte, NATO Secretary General, (left) vowed to 'step up' support for Ukraine, on his first day in office as the new alliance leader. BELFAST — Mark Rutte, the former Dutch prime minister, officially took charge of NATO today, succeeding longtime leader Jens Stoltenberg as the alliance's new secretary general, during a handover ceremony in Brussels. In his first address to members gathered at NATO headquarters, he said that his main priority will be 'to keep NATO strong and ensure our defenses remain effective and credible against all threats.' Additionally, Rutte pledged to 'step up' support for Ukraine and 'bring it ever closer to NATO,' echoing consistent messaging from his predecessor that the country will eventually join the alliance, though there is still no timetable for membership. Rutte arrives in his leadership role with Ukraine facing a third winter of war against Russia and as Moscow continues to make territorial gains in parts of eastern Ukraine. 'Supporting Ukraine is the right thing to do, and it is also an investment in our own security, because an independent and democratic Ukraine is vital for peace and stability in Europe,' Rutte told media, following the handover ceremony. 'The cost of supporting Ukraine is far, far lower than the cost we would face if we allow Putin to get his way.' Rutte's stewardship of the alliance's backing for Ukraine will be forced to reckon with a geopolitical delimma: despite intense lobbying by Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the US is still unwilling to give Kyiv permission to use Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) long-range weapons against targets inside Russia, denying it the opportunity to strike aircraft and airfields of tactical importance. London has similarly refused to allow MBDA Storm Shadow long-range air launched cruise missiles to be operated in such a manner. 'I understand Ukraine's request &#8230; but in the end it is up to each ally to decide what they want to do,' Rutte said. 'When I look at the particular allies which are involved here &#8230; for example, the United States and their leadership, have spent billions of dollars to support Ukraine's right to self defense. Let's be clear, Ukraine likely would not exist as a country today without US support.' US President Joe Biden welcomed Rutte to his new post, in a statement today, describing him as a 'consensus-builder and decisive leader.' Biden added that he had 'full confidence' in Rutte's ability to 'build on our work to create a NATO that is stronger, larger, and more resolute than ever.' Deeply honoured to succeed @jensstoltenberg as Secretary General of #NATO – the most successful political-military Alliance in history. I thank the 32 Allies for their confidence and I am excited to get started. pic.twitter.com/bCZX7KxEYs &mdash; Mark Rutte (@SecGenNATO) October 1, 2024 Elsewhere in his remarks, Rutte called for 'significantly more defense spending' across the alliance, alongside 'better-equipped forces, a more robust transatlantic defense industry, increased defense production capacity' and 'greater investment in innovation and secure supply chains.' He has been criticised in the past for the failure of the Netherlands to reach the NATO spending target of 2 percent GDP under his watch and admitted, 'We should have done this earlier.' NATO defense expenditure forecasts [PDF] put The Hague on track to hit the 2 percent mark this year. Earlier this month, the Netherlands also vowed to spend an extra €2.4 billion ($2.7 billion) on defense, lifting annual military spending to €24 billion. In spite of urging allies to increase defense spending, he paid tribute to efforts underway by member nations to invest in new equipment, including 'plans to acquire thousands of air defense and artillery systems, many hundreds of modern aircraft, mostly fifth generation F-35 [jets], as well as substantial high end capabilities.' In a warning to China, Rutte said that Beijing 'cannot continue to fuel the largest conflict in Europe since the second world war without this impacting its interests and reputation.' He condemned China's propping up of Russia's military industry, in the wake of US officials judging that the Indo-Pacific adversary is responsible for helping Moscow produce drones and boosting space-based capabilities. On EU matters, Rutte also noted the 'potential to boost' cooperation with the bloc, in particular on support for Ukraine and countering hybrid warfare threats. He also plans on strengthening cooperation with Indo-Pacific partners and shared that 'later this month' Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea will take part in a NATO defense ministerial meeting for the first time. Having earned the nickname 'Teflon Mark' for avoiding political scandal throughout his career as a Dutch lawmaker, Rutte is said to be particularly skilled at building improbable partnerships. Patrick Bolder, a defense analyst at The Hague Centre for Strategic Studies think tank and retired lieutenant colonel from the Royal Netherlands Air Force, previously told Breaking Defense that Rutte is often referred to in Dutch circles as the 'little oil man' who 'greases all the wheels in the machinery, so they can run smoothly.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/former-dutch-pm-rutte-takes-nato-reins-doubles-down-on-ukraine-support-and-warns-china/	2024-10-01T06:45:34-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/241001a-015.jpg
Navy struggling to contain costs for Columbia-class sub program, says GAO	Washington D.C. Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton speaks during the keel laying ceremony for the future USS District of Columbia. (Photo courtesy of General Dynamics Electric Boat) WASHINGTON — A new independent audit of the Columbia-class submarine program shows the Navy is struggling to contain the price of the shipbuilding program with cost overruns reaching 'six times higher than' the prime contractor’s estimates and 'five times more than the Navy’s.' 'As a result, the government could be responsible for hundreds of millions in additional construction costs for the lead submarine,' according to a Government Accountability Report published today. The Columbia-class submarine program, the Navy’s No. 1 acquisition priority and one leg of the Pentagon’s nuclear triad, has long been a target of GAO, which has reported on the program’s deficiencies and potential future obstacles for the past seven years. The watchdog’s latest report stems from a provision in the 2018 defense policy bill mandating GAO assess the extent the program is on track to meet its cost and schedule targets as well as the efficacy of the Navy and its shipbuilders’ actions to do as much. The result of GAO’s analysis is that from January 2022 through May 2023, the 'cost and schedule performance for lead submarine construction has consistently fallen short of targets.' 'Through early 2024, those trends had not improved, and future risks will likely add to current cost and schedule growth,' the report said. 'The program has reported that the shipbuilder needs to take swift and significant actions to address the causes of poor construction performance. However, as GAO has previously reported, the program has tried to mitigate some of these causes — such as late materials and detailed design products — for years.' RELATED: Navy lays out major shipbuilding delays, in rare public accounting In its report, GAO acknowledges the billions in funding the Navy has distributed to its suppliers since 2018 to strengthen the industrial base, but auditors said the service has failed to ensure the investments 'support construction goals or that outsourced work meets quality expectations.' Increased investment in the submarine industrial base has been a focus for the Navy’s annual budget requests since the inception of the AUKUS security pact in 2021. The service just recently awarded a $950 million contract to Texas-based, non-profit BlueForge Alliance to continue doing as much. As of December 2023, GAO said the Columbia-class program reported distributing funds to 193 suppliers. The amount of funding Congress provides to the Navy for industrial base development can be tracked through the annual appropriations process. But, where that funding goes and how it’s used is not publicly available. Lawmakers, such as Rep. Joe Courtney, D-Conn., have said even Congress only sees a 'basic pie chart' outlining broad categories of how the funds are being used. As a routine part of producing its reports about the Pentagon, GAO seeks and incorporates feedback from the Defense Department on its criticisms and recommendations. In this report, the watchdog recommended the Navy direct its prime contractor General Dynamics Electric Boat to revise its cost estimates as well as work to identify what information is needed to determine whether its SIB investments are effectively supporting the Columbia-class program, among other things. Responding for the Defense Department, Gary Ashworth, a senior civilian overseeing Pentagon acquisitions, concurred with all of GAO’s recommendations.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/navy-struggling-to-contain-costs-for-columbia-class-sub-program-says-gao/	2024-09-30T12:33:51-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/GD-EB-7-e1654433934548.jpg
