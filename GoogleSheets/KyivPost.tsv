We do have to find diplomatic solutions,' Ukraine’s President Zelensky said in an interview with Kyodo News, admitting that it is difficult to retake by force some of the Russian-occupied territories, including Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014.Key Points from the Interview:▪️The current support from Ukraine’s partners is insufficient, given the situation on the front lines. Zelensky emphasized the urgency for NATO to invite Ukraine to membership talks.▪️The war has entered a challenging and prolonged phase, requiring strategic patience.▪️Some North Korean soldiers have reportedly been killed fighting for Russia, but Ukraine is verifying evidence before disclosing exact numbers. A major concern is the potential transfer of advanced military know-how, such as drone operations, back to North Korea. This could have significant implications for Asia and beyond.▪️Zelensky stated that Trump and his team are aware of Ukraine’s victory strategy, which aims to position Ukraine for a diplomatic resolution. 'There will be no capitulation from Ukraine. That is a fact, and I think he understands it.'Website | WhatsApp | X | FB | Inst | YouTube | LinkedIn | Bluesky📢 Subscribe to	https://t.me/s/Kyivpost_official/26938	2024-12-02T02:09:55-08:00
