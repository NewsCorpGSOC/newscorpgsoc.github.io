The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry addressed Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico over his controversial remarks, including calling Ukraine an enemy.'Slovakia’s Prime Minister Robert Fico, amidst falling trust among the Slovak society and protests against his pro-Russian course, resorted to looking for the enemies and found them... in Ukraine.We consider these absurd statements as an attempt to shift responsibility for his own failures in domestic policy to foreign states and leaders. We would advise better to look not outside, but in the mirror.The Ukrainian Side has repeatedly warned about the danger of the pro-Russian policy of the Slovak leadership. The result is obvious: Robert Fico and some parliamentary leaders of Slovakia were poisoned by Russian propaganda, ceased to distinguish between black and white, and have already begun to call the leaders of neighboring friendly democracies as 'enemies.'We are confident that such a move and policy of Robert Fico are flying against the choice of the people of Slovakia to be an integral part of the European community,' the statement said.Website | WhatsApp | X | FB | Inst | YouTube | LinkedIn | Bluesky📢 Subscribe to	https://t.me/s/Kyivpost_official/27863	2025-01-29T05:21:23-08:00
