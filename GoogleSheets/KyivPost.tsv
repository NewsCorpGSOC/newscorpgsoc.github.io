Today, Ukraine marks 11 years since the Revolution of Dignity, a defining moment in its modern historyIn late 2013, Ukrainians took to the streets of Kyiv to demand democracy, justice, and closer ties with Europe.What began as peaceful protests became a nationwide movement, toppling a corrupt government but at a great cost—the lives of over 100 heroes, remembered as the Heavenly Hundred.This anniversary is especially meaningful as Ukraine continues to defend its freedom against Russian aggression. The values of the Revolution—independence, dignity, and a European future—remain the foundation of its fight today.The legacy of the Revolution reminds the world of the courage of those who stand up for their rights.
