In a public statement, the recently ousted Russian-backed Syrian dictator Assad proves a Russian puppet until the very end, explaining how the Putin regime managed his escape to Russia. 'I moved to Lattakia in coordination with our Russian allies to oversee combat operations. Upon arrival at the Hmeimim airbase that morning, it became clear that our forces had completely withdrawn from all battle lines and that the last army positions had fallen. As the field situation in the area continued to deteriorate, the Russian military base itself came under intensified attack by drone strikes. With no viable means of leaving the base, Moscow requested that the base's command arrange an immediate evacuation to Russia on the evening of Sunday 8th December.'	https://t.me/Kyivpost_official/27161	2024-12-16T05:38:47-08:00	https://cdn4.cdn-telegram.org/file/FHo_kKR3ZYcYr-uZ4CD88eMtqwesszXoBWIA8bRZmdDQD9LkPm4FXNZzlT-OexQVomEHaDtSs8QTwaI5fFTFUGR8YK8dkKBzToSPGFXSkHLKn7bPpI4mXDwhrEnP246ySEaclCDgO92htc0aT6TxXkU9w9bWpxRdKFDmEH_KIkjhX0-Gg8S9FL4rBQS8i4pUaQr_4aMKWAI4GwTG5C2ABtnB9JuHtlL8oERaZZoPMnHaSfWC9bG06zHZ9T_p0ZpHaYUVhPGUrryRxZ6rJniAumKfrxqoqsE2XgrruLEvSPygpys3j1RSdOji1NVv0jf-697vgx0fpwsaOuMnatc1NA.jpg
