Zelensky emphasized the urgency for NATO to invite Ukraine to membership talks.▪️The war has entered a challenging and prolonged phase, requiring strategic patience.▪️Some North Korean soldiers have reportedly been killed fighting for Russia, but Ukraine is verifying evidence before disclosing exact numbers. A major concern is the potential transfer of advanced military know-how, such as drone operations, back to North Korea. This could have significant implications for Asia and beyond.▪️Zelensky stated that Trump and his team are aware of Ukraine’s victory strategy, which aims to position Ukraine for a diplomatic resolution.
