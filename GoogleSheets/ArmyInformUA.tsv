The aggressor country hit the shelter of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant with a drone — the Presid...	Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced this on February 14. -Ukraine built this shelter together with other countries of Europe and the world, together with America - with everyone who wants real security for people. Today's Russia is the only state in the world that can attack such facilities, occupy the territory of nuclear plants and conduct hostilities without considering the consequences. And this is a terrorist threat to the whole world,- said the President. The shelter at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant was damaged by this drone. The fire was extinguished. Currently, the radiation background has not increased, and this is constantly monitored. According to the first estimates, the damage to the shelter is significant. -Russia carries out such attacks every night against Ukrainian infrastructure and our cities. Russia continues to increase its army. Russia does not change its crazy anti-human state rhetoric. And this means that Putin is definitely not preparing for negotiations. He is preparing to continue deceiving the world. That is why we need the united pressure of all those who value life, pressure on the aggressor. Russia must bear responsibility for what it does,- Volodymyr Zelenskyi said. As reported by ArmyInform, Volodymyr Zelensky held a conversation with the President of Lithuania. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/14/krayina-agresor-vdaryla-dronom-po-ukryttyu-chornobylskoyi-aes-prezydent/	2025-02-13T23:25:37-08:00

The video about the fighter appeared on February 14 on the brigade channel. -The first battle of a junior sergeant. The cold-bloodedness and confidence of this young fighter would be envied even by strangers.

Jump in and try to survive — in Chasovoy Yar, the Russians are experimenting with their infantry	Andrii Polukhin, a representative of the press service of the 24th mechanized brigade named after King Danylo, told on the ArmiyaTV stream about this. -The enemy is attacking towards the center of the city, the battles are taking place in the city buildings. If the buildings are destroyed and there are ruins, it is still a shelter. There are basements. Erasing a building to zero is not so easy. There is shelter and the enemy is using it,- Andrih Polukhin said. According to him, from time to time the enemy manages to throw his infantry into the ruins, but it is worse when it comes to providing them with ammunition or food. But after the destruction of some infantry groups, new ones arrive, the enemy continues its assaults. As ArmiyaInform reported, there is a lot of destruction in Chasovoy Yar. The enemy, not feeling hungry for ammunition, is busting the city with artillery, street by street.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/14/zaskochyty-j-sprobuvaty-vyzhyty-u-chasovomu-yari-rosiyany-stavlyat-eksperymenty-na-svoyij-pihoti/	2025-02-13T22:17:53-08:00

- I have nothing to hug you-. The story of love, injury and support of Alexander and his Nadia	This ward is a temporary home for Alexander and Nadia. He was seriously wounded during the operation of the Defense Forces of Ukraine in Kurshchyna, his two upper limbs were amputated. She is a beloved wife who will always be there: both in grief and in joy. They have been together since 9th grade. Both are from Poltava Oblast. A quarter of a century as acquaintances. 21 years in marriage. They are raising two sons. And the war and the serious wounding of Alexander, unfortunately, only emphasized how strong the feelings of this couple are. This short story, recorded by the correspondent of ArmiyaInform in one of the medical institutions of Kyiv, is about love during war, mutual support and understanding during war, as well as plans for the future. -I studied in the 9th grade, Sasha was four years older than me. He used to visit my brother on business, and he introduced us,- recalls Nadiya and adds that, unfortunately, her brother died seven months ago in the Russian-Ukrainian war. The initiative in the relationship was mostly shown by Nadiya. There were many evenings at dances, discos. In 1999, Oleksandr served a term of service in the PPO. Worked with a radar station. Nadiya studied, and Alexander served his time and started working in Pyryatyn. Sometimes the girl went to visit her lover. -And we are from the village! That's what they said in the village: -And why does she go there?!- Let's either sign up or not go.- So we applied on my birthday, March 23rd. April 25 was the wedding.- They got married when Nadiya was 20 years old, Alexander was 24. A year later, the first-born Dmytro was born, and at the age of 29, Nadiya gave birth to her second son, Roman. Alexander lived a civilian life. By 2024. Then he went to the TCC, because he had to update his military registration data by July 16. I updated the data and received a combat summons on the same day. First, the training center in Chernihiv Oblast (30 days), then Kryvyi Rih (additional staffing), and from there the Kursk direction. At first he was in the ranks of the 47th separate mechanized brigade, then the 25th separate assault battalion. Position: Grenade Launcher. -I had enough for six days. Told to take a stand. We got there, and it turns out that there were already people sitting there. The landing was dense, nothing was visible - they started working on us with machine guns. The right hand was wounded as a result of machine gun fire, an artery was hit. The left hand was injured due to mortar shelling. The first was the wounded right hand. While they were evacuating, a mortar arrived literally in 10 minutes. As soon as it got dark, the FPVs arrived with cameras and began to cover. I still hid properly, in a hole&#8230; And thanks to my brother with the call sign -Father-. If it weren't for him, I would have stayed there. He pulled me out and dragged me into the evacuation vehicle. He is also injured now, undergoing rehabilitation,- the soldier recalls the circumstances of the injury. -&#8230; My brother put tourniquets on him. If it weren't for him, Sasha would have bled and been the 500th. Because many boys from the Kursk region are missing,- adds Nadiya. The evacuation lasted a long time. The tourniquet was applied for 34 hours. -If everything had been faster, the right arm would have been saved,- says the soldier. All this happened in October 2024. Since then, treatment and rehabilitation. -When Sasha was mobilized, I cried every day. I waited, went to work. When he was taken to the battlefield, he did not confess to me, only told his eldest son. But he called every day: morning and evening. Then a few days of silence and suddenly a call. Sasha calls. Said it was fine. At that time, he was in intensive care. And then in the evening he called again and told what had happened: -I have nothing to hug you.- I was glad that he was alive. While I was in the positions, I cried every day. When she found out that he was injured, she did not cry. I came to Kyiv, saw him, and didn't cry either. Yes, when they were taken to the war, there were tears. When I'm already near him, I try not to cry,- the woman says firmly and confidently. After she left for her husband in Kyiv, Nadia was fired from the Kremenchug Carriage Works. -As far as I know, when our colleagues go abroad to earn money, they have three months in reserve. I thought that I would go to Sasha in Kyiv - it would count for me either as a vacation or at my own expense, etc. I warned that I would not return to work anytime soon, because my husband is without two hands. But two weeks passed and I was fired. I worked for 17 years,- says Nadiya. -&#8230; And in two weeks they were fired. But she is next to me!-, adds Oleksandr. Followed by further treatment and prosthetics. The application was submitted for state prosthetics at the Ortho-pro company. For the time being, there will be mechanics on the left hand (while the stump is prepared - ed.), bionics on the right. Oleksandr's plans for the future are to learn to work with new hands. In rehabilitation, he emphasizes, time is of the essence. Nadia plans to breed chrysanthemums in the future. This is what she was still doing at the factory: breeding indoor plants, cuttings, etc. -I want to buy chrysanthemums that no one has yet. And breed them. Work should be such that you can be at home. Next to the man. And the most insulting thing is that Sasha was called a universal soldier, because no matter what he did, he succeeded in everything. And here it is,- says Nadiya. -&#8230; But never lose heart: I have two sons who need to be put on their feet!-, Oleksandr seems to conclude his wife's thoughts. The 11-year-old son continues his studies. He is especially interested in mathematics, music, football. Parents help with lessons remotely. The eldest son is already working. -As soon as Sasha was taken into the army, he immediately showed himself as a man. Dad used to give a sample,- says Nadiya. In the end, I ask Nadiya what she would advise wives who, unfortunately, find themselves or may find themselves in the situation in which she herself found herself - when her husband was seriously injured. After all, cases are not rare, according to doctors, when spouses separate after the injury of a defender. To this the woman replies: -I don't understand how this is possible&#8230; We are always together. 20 years!..- says Nadiya. -21,- Alexander corrects. -&#8230; But, for example, we go to the store together, visit together, visit our mother together. We are all in this together. And when he was taken to the war, I came home from work, went into the yard, passed the arch made of grapes, and began to cry. I go in and he's gone. Therefore, I do not understand how I can leave him after he was taken to war. So he was taken away and there is no part of the family. Is our heart not there? Oleksandr continues the idea of ​​mutual support in a couple: -When you are lying alone and being treated, it is psychologically very difficult. And when a woman is around, there is nothing to compare it with! And we'll talk, and we'll laugh, and we'll joke. When your significant other is around, it's wonderful. And we are out of Kyiv, we can go for a walk. When the children arrived, they went to the water park and Fairyland. We try not to lie in one place, because the tummy will grow,- Oleksandr says with a laugh. And the couple walks a lot. Walks alternate between procedures: either go out for coffee, then go to the market for beads, or just take a walk in the park. And everything, of course, together.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/14/meni-nemaye-chym-tebe-obijmaty-istoriya-kohannya-poranennya-i-pidtrymky-oleksandra-i-jogo-nadiyi/	2025-02-13T21:02:34-08:00
Standby mode: how Donald Trump's statements affected the NATO meeting and what Ukraine should prepar...	But very quickly the focus of the discussions shifted to one and only one topic - potential negotiations on ending the Russian war against Ukraine. The trigger for this was US President Donald Trump's statements about telephone conversations with Kremlin dictator Volodymyr Putin and President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky. Usually, such topics concern diplomats, but it was impossible to ignore this flow of information. Therefore, the ministers of defense expressed their positions and had to respond literally on the go to new and new statements from the White House. How European allies perceived the actions of the USA and whether this will affect the further support of Ukraine - read more in the article of the ArmiyaInform correspondent from Brussels. In a certain sense, this ministerial ended up being a preparation for the Munich Security Conference, which begins on February 14. It is in Munich that the American diplomatic mission will arrive, which, as expected, will outline its position regarding support for Ukraine for the first time and will talk about its vision of possible negotiations to end the war. However, events developed so rapidly that two days before Munich, drastic changes occurred. It all started with the harsh statements of the new head of the Pentagon, Pete Hegseth, who arrived at the ministerial for the first time and also took part in the Ramstein meeting held at the NATO headquarters for the first time. ArmyInform wrote in detail about his demands to the allies to increase defense spending and the statement that returning to the borders of Ukraine by 2014 is an unrealistic goal. As it turned out, this was only the beginning. A little later, Donald Trump announced that he had a phone conversation with the Kremlin dictator, and an hour later - with the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyi. Trump also said that preparations for the negotiations have actually begun and that he is ready to meet with Putin in Saudi Arabia. He did not mention the meeting with the Ukrainian president. Next, the American president questioned the need for Ukraine's future membership in NATO and avoided answering whether Ukraine should even be part of the negotiations. And therefore, he actually called into question the subjectivity of Ukraine. However, already on February 13, Pete Hegseth announced at the final press conference in Brussels that the US president will hold talks with the presidents of Ukraine and Russia. -Any negotiations that are held will be held with both. President Zelensky understands the realities on the ground, Putin understands the realities on the ground, and President Trump, as a person who makes agreements and conducts negotiations, also understands these dynamics,- he said. The American minister also suggested that a -demarcation that will not suit either side- will be carried out as part of the peace agreement. On the same day, Donald Trump himself declared that Ukraine would be part of the negotiations: -We will have Ukraine, Russia will be there, and there will be other people... I believe that he (Putin. - Ed.) wants peace. I think he would have told me if he didn't want to.- These statements hardly convinced anyone, given the changeable position of the US president. In addition, Europe's participation in the negotiations remained unclear, for which the head of the Pentagon assigned a -certain role-, without specifying what exactly. This scenario obviously does not suit the US's European allies, and many of them immediately made it clear. Mark Rutte stated at the final press conference that the members of the Alliance are already holding consultations among themselves, including the USA. -As NATO, of course, we coordinate intensively. And I know that many allies and EU members are doing the same with Washington. And what we have been doing for the last 24 hours is that the clocks were ticking,- the NATO Secretary General added. At the same time, he emphasized that NATO's commitment to Ukraine's membership does not apply to future negotiations. Mark Rutte reminded that at the summit in Washington, NATO adopted commitments regarding Ukraine's future membership. -But there was never an agreement that whenever peace talks began, these peace talks would end - in any case and always - with NATO membership,- he explained. The head of EU diplomacy Kaya Callas, who was invited to the meeting of the Ukraine-NATO Council yesterday, reacted much harsher to the US statements. -Any agreement concluded without us will fail, because Europe and Ukraine are necessary to implement this agreement. Without us at the negotiating table, you can agree on anything, but it will all fail due to the lack of implementation,- she emphasized. German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said Europe should be involved in the negotiations, especially if the US expects European allies to play a peacekeeping role in any future deal. He emphasized that Putin should stop the attacks on Ukraine if he is really serious about negotiations. -It would be better if the US did not make concessions to Russia even before the start of negotiations,- the German minister added. Before leaving for Munich, President Volodymyr Zelenskyi made it clear that Ukraine will not accept the results of the negotiations if the USA and Russia conduct them themselves. -We simply will not be able to accept as an independent country any agreements without us. I articulate this very clearly to our partners. Any bilateral talks about Ukraine - I am not talking about other topics, here they are free - we will not accept any bilateral talks about Ukraine without us,- the head of state said. It is safe to say that today all discussions regarding potential negotiations will resume with renewed vigor in Munich. The Secretary General of NATO will meet with Volodymyr Zelenskyi and the US delegation, and the Ukrainian leader is also scheduled to meet with representatives of the US administration. The previous evening, Donald Trump announced that a meeting of high-ranking officials of the USA, Ukraine and Russia will be held in Germany. The Office of the President of Ukraine replied that negotiations with the Russians are not foreseen. -The Ukrainian position is unchanged. Ukraine should first talk with America, Europe should participate in any serious conversation. And only then an agreed joint position should be on the table for discussion with the Russians,- the OP said. Placement of peacekeepers in Ukraine may become one of the points of a potential agreement. The USA immediately ruled out sending its troops, shifting the responsibility to Europe. According to Volodymyr Zelenskyi, 100,000 military personnel are needed for the peacekeeping contingent. However, even before the meeting in Brussels at the beginning of this week, the Russians clearly demonstrated their attitude to the negotiations by launching another missile attack on Kyiv. Likewise, they continue daily assaults on Ukrainian positions at the front and bomb the houses of civilians. Meanwhile, Europe has obviously realized that it will have to rely much more on itself in defense matters and also take on the support of Ukraine. Great Britain has already held the first -Ramstein- under its leadership and announced an increase in military aid to Ukraine from 3 to 4.5 billion pounds. London is also preparing a major defense deal with the EU and could replace Washington amid continued pressure from the White House. All this shows that Europe is clearly aware of the Russian threat and is not going to leave Ukraine alone with the Russian invaders.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/14/rezhym-ochikuvannya-yak-zayavy-donalda-trampa-vplynuly-na-zustrich-nato-i-do-chogo-gotuvatysya-ukrayini/	2025-02-13T20:35:26-08:00
Love at first sight -Kenobi- and -Acid-: about service in the Legion, annual injuries and the comman...	After all, they are both military professionals who never hid behind other people's backs during a brutal war with an insidious enemy. How to be able to speak without losing your mind when the monitor of the combat control point shows the burst of a 152-mm projectile at the place where your beloved was just performing a task? How do you keep your composure after reading a message that the father of your unborn son is injured and may not survive? How to go into battle, having more than one wound and many contusions, and most importantly, how to let a loved one go on a dangerous mission? Their path has never been simple or easy, but despite all the trials, they confidently look to the future and have no intention of backing down from their chosen goal, because they understand how much Ukraine needs them. - How was your first meeting? — Ian Kenobi: The Year 2022 Far Away. Kruglyakivka settlement. I was the commander of an infantry company in the Legion at the time. Anastasia just joined us, served at the medical station. The company commander injured his back and medics came to help him. Then we saw each other for the first time&#8230; — Anastasia -Acid-: When I first saw him, I immediately liked him - so manly, you know, serious. It was love at first sight&#8230; — How did you manage to combine relations with service in combat conditions? — Ian -Kenobi-: She was originally in the medical unit. Then I knew that her duties were limited to evacuating the wounded, providing aid and delivering to stabilization points and it was safe. But already, when I went to a higher position and became the deputy commander of the battalion, Anastasia was transferred to an infantry company. Then, I'll be honest, it was difficult for me at times. Especially when you are on the other side of the screen (video surveillance at the command post - author), and she is on a combat mission in the field at the time. There were a couple of situations that were simply heart-stopping. We immediately drew a clear line between relationships and tasks. There was no such thing as -you're not going there because you're my girlfriend.- There was a distribution of personnel: who, when, how and what tasks are performed. In Anastasia, it was mainly medical support of assault groups during missions, evacuation of the wounded directly from the battlefield and evacuation of dead soldiers, etc. I remember one such moment. I then lost the ability to speak literally somewhere for a minute of time. I watch how they evacuated the soldier, unfortunately, the deceased. She and another serviceman. They put him on a stretcher and began to tie him up. And at that moment I see: a large white spot appears on the entire screen. Arrival of a 152 mm projectile. It was literally a few meters away from them. I thought it was all over&#8230; — Anastasia -Acid-: We went to evacuate the soldier who died. All we had to do was take the body. I had such a partner who was funny, who moved very slowly behind me with these burdens. We did not take anything extra with us, no medical backpacks - only our first-aid kits, because we understood that the soldier could no longer be helped. He just had to be evacuated. There was a landing and an open area. He was right in that open area. Before this corpse, I had only seen the corpses of Russians who had been lying for a long time. And to come face to face with a dead person right after death was the first time. We squatted down, began to unfold the stretchers. And, by the way, these stretchers, I think, saved us. I cut the plate carrier. We were right above the ground when it hit. Everything happened very quickly: you turn around, there is some smoke. I look, -Zulu-, that's the callsign of that guy, he's already running. I think it's clear, so I have to run somewhere too. And then already on the radio station: -Some back! Come back!-&#8230; And then we turn around. From my side, it's always on adrenaline. And you don't think for what was thought on the other side of the screen. - Ian -Kenobi-: And then, literally in 30 seconds, the duty officer shouts, tries to communicate with them on the radio station. They answer. The weather helped us. Wet, mud around, so the projectile just buried itself in the ground. The main shock wave went up. They were very contused then. The fighter was evacuated and left. — Anastasia -Acid-: The first time he went on a combat mission, and we were not yet in a relationship, it was just the year of the large-scale invasion. He went out as a company commander with his guys, because they needed to raise morale. - Ian -Kenobi-: To put it simply, it was just the anniversary. It is February 24, 2023. And the guys were a little wary. They thought that now a mass attack of the enemy would begin or something else. We know, the enemy loves such significant dates and doing something bad on these days. Then I went out with the guys on a combat mission. On the way, we were fired upon with cluster munitions, a mortar caught us, then there was remote mining. But we got to the position, thank God. It's standard there: -nightmare- a little with resets. At that time, they were not yet very popular, but drones with ammunition drops were already working. The position itself was shelled. During the three days when we changed, the way back was also -fun-. Repeated remote mining, the route was changed four or five times during the advance to the exit point. All these remote mines started going off. A witty situation - already when we reached the exit point, an armored personnel carrier of friendly units passed by us. Apparently, the enemy decided to inflict fire damage on it. But this was a very bad decision for us - they wanted to -nightmare- the -beha- with an 82 mm mortar. It is not very effective against armored vehicles. Another thing is that we were walking along this road at that moment. Mine landed literally eight meters from me. But I was walking in the center of the formation, and the fighter who was walking first was probably two or three meters away from him. We were saved by the fact that there were tracks rolled by armored vehicles, it was winter and everything froze. We moved with a night vision device. They saw the flash and how the exit from the mortar takes place. At that moment, a nightlight dazzled. We turn our heads in that direction, we hear that it is starting to whistle. I give the command: -Lie down!- Foreigners understood this command. Because if I fall, everyone falls. Well, we just fall into this rut. I had an easy view from the track, I saw this mine land. On the one hand, it is scary, on the other hand, it is very beautiful. To see how the mine breaks, and on the ice such sparks go. The warrior who went first, to whom the closest distance was, runs to me and says: -Sir, my seals were knocked out by the shock wave.- I'm like, -Dude, let's get the hell out of here!- I'll send you to the hospital later, you'll get new ones.- — Anastasia -Acid-: I was already five to six months pregnant. And I just went on vacation and did not know that he went to war. I'm reading a message in the group: -Kenobi 300- and another guy. And then they convey that maybe -200-. And I am like that&#8230; (sigh - ed.). — Ian -Kenobi-: I didn't run much back then. I was more carried back&#8230; At the moment when the boys were pulling out, I thought more about the fact that the child would remain without me. This was really the most stressful for me at that moment (at this moment in the story, the son of Jan and Nastya, who was sleeping peacefully in the cradle, woke up and cried - ed.). — Anastasia -Acid-: I will say yes&#8230; I talked about this (injury - author) with him for a long time afterwards. — Ian -Kenobi-: A long time! That's it, don't cry! (cradles the baby - ed.). I'm around now. To be honest, the very first month of my son's life is very similar to being on duty at the command post. It's the same: you don't sleep, there's no time to eat, there's no time to take care of your personal affairs, even to wash yourself. Constantly screams, wants something from you, you can't understand what. Very similar work in the legion with foreigners, and just being on duty at the command post (smiles - author). — How many wounds did you have while repelling a large-scale invasion? — Ian -Kenobi-: Nastya has one wound and a hell of a lot of other injuries. — Anastasia -Acid-: Five concussions. - Ian -Kenobi-: I have three wounds during the period of the large-scale invasion. The extreme was the most serious. Yes, once a year is stable. I hope I can get by this year (smiles - ed.). — Anastasia -Acid-: By the way, when the 152 mm shell arrived, I was already pregnant. I just didn't know that. So the child should be given the status of a participant in hostilities (smiles - ed.). — Ian -Kenobi-: I already have at least three official reasons to resign from the Armed Forces. But I just can't leave the unit. I invested a lot of my energy in him. I literally shed my blood in this unit. And I have no intention of leaving him. — Anastasia -Acid-: We have discussed this more than once. But I saw him at work and I understand that I simply do not have the right and will not deprive Ukraine of a commander like him. And these are not just my words. When he thought he was going to leave the service because of his health, many people from our Bravo company wrote to me that they would not be able to trust anyone else the way they trusted him. Without him, this legion will be different. RS: People have different family photo albums. Yan and Anastasia's photo and video archive will definitely stand out. Life gave them little time for theaters, flowers, ice rinks or romantic walks. But there will be trophy rare weapons and equipment, captured prisoners and personally removed enemy flags in settlements freed from the invaders, shelling, battles and injuries, evacuation from the battlefield. Anastasia has retired from military service, but her soul is always with the Legion. When Yang, an outwardly intelligent, fit, thin young man of average height, enters the unit, many people immediately appear around him. The sincere respect and communication style of experienced, battle-hardened warriors from different countries of the world, often much older in age and stockier in stature, is visible to the naked eye. They are worth a lot and testify to a lot. One can only guess at what price and under what conditions such authority was gained and what an officer is capable of when he has to make a decision or act personally. To the question -What is the Legion for you?- Yan and Anastasia answered in one voice, without thinking: -Family, family-&#8230; You can learn more about the International Defense Legion of Ukraine on the official website https://ildu.mil.gov.ua/ Photo from the archive of Yan and Anastasia Volodymyr Patola for ArmiyaInform	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/14/kohannya-z-pershogo-poglyadu-kenobi-ta-acid-pro-sluzhbu-v-legioni-shhorichni-poranennya-ta-syna-komandyra-v-lyulczi/	2025-02-13T20:24:12-08:00
Changing the approach to combat operations: German machine builders offer ground drones to support t...	The manufacturing company on its official portal positions this line of ground drones as those designed to support the military in dangerous missions, difficult terrain and in adverse weather conditions, ArmiyaInform notes. According to the authors of the Dutch defense website Army Recognition, the Mission Master family of unmanned vehicles is famous for its versatility and state-of-the-art capabilities. These autonomous ground vehicles (A-UGVs) are designed to perform a variety of missions, ranging from reconnaissance and logistical support to medical evacuation, CBRN detection, use as signal relays and fire support. Their modular architecture allows for rapid configuration changes to suit specific mission requirements. Central to their functionality is the autonomy suite PATH, a navigation and operational control system that enables autonomous operation while retaining human oversight of any lethal functions. PATH maintains control over potentially lethal human functions in compliance with safety and ethical standards. This approach ensures that autonomous systems remain a reliable and secure tool in the hands of operators. The Mission Master family consists of three different models, each tailored to specific operational needs. The Mission Master SP is a compact and stealthy platform designed for missions where maneuverability and stealth are required. It is equipped with an electric propulsion system that ensures quiet operation and low visibility, making it ideal for reconnaissance operations or transporting small loads such as sensors and consumables. The minimal noise and environmental friendliness of this model make it irreplaceable in difficult operational scenarios. The Mission Master CXT is built for tougher operations and features a hybrid powertrain. This platform is distinguished by its strength, the ability to transport loads up to 1000 kg and work in extreme conditions. The CXT is suitable for logistics support tasks and can perform short silent operations thanks to its built-in battery system. Such characteristics allow CXT to be used in areas with harsh climatic conditions or difficult terrain. Mission Master XT is optimized for longer missions. With a maximum range of up to 750 km and the ability to overcome water obstacles, the XT offers exceptional autonomy and amphibious capabilities. This model supports the integration of heavy weapons and complex optical systems, which expands its application in combat conditions, increasing situational awareness and firepower. Autonomous UGV Mission Master platforms have already proven themselves as versatile and reliable systems, but their potential continues to grow. It is planned to integrate more complex sensor systems, improve artificial intelligence algorithms to increase autonomy and adaptability, as well as develop new modules that meet specific needs. Increasing energy efficiency and communication capabilities will also be prioritized to make A-UGVs even more practical in operations of varying complexity. The UGV Mission Master demonstrates how modern technologies can effectively combine autonomy, modularity and reliability, providing new opportunities for military and civilian missions, reaching hard-to-reach places.

SZCH, studio -Krylya- and unidentified actors: new cinema from Moscow fakers	In fact, this incident has no corroboration. The filming is done in such a way that it is impossible to identify the place and the actors, and people behave unnaturally, so the video has all the signs of being staged. Even last year, the Center for Countering Disinformation of the NSDC found out the source of such fake videos, which are distributed exclusively by propaganda resources of the Russian Federation. -Krylya studio, which is connected to the Russian Ministry of Defense, is involved in the production of fake videos with allegedly Ukrainian military personnel on the front lines, in the trenches. Contractors related to Novorossiya TV are also working on such videos, and infrastructure acceleration is provided by agencies working with the Russian Federation,- says the head of the CSDP of the NSDC, Lieutenant Andriy Kovalenko. The purpose of such fakes is to discredit and demoralize the Armed Forces of Ukraine, so they should not be trusted.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/14/szch-studiya-krylya-ta-neidentyfikovani-dijovi-osoby-nove-kino-vid-moskovskyh-fejkorobiv/	2025-02-13T20:03:17-08:00
Communal -horror show- at the TOT of Luhansk region: the occupiers brought the city to the state of ...	informs about this the head of Luhansk OVA Artem Lysohor. Instead of looking for missing budgets for repairs, the occupation administration turned to Moscow for help. They are not only asking for funding, but also demanding to send emergency teams - because there are almost no qualified workers left. The reason is simple: due to forced mobilization, Luhansk lost most of its specialists, and now virtually no one can work in the communal sector. Restrictions on freedom of movement are added to infrastructural problems. The occupying forces blocked civilian traffic on the highway between the front-line Rubizhnye and the relatively rear-facing Starobilsk, citing the -security situation.- At the same time, the Russian military themselves continue to use this road without hindrance. Now local residents have to choose an even more dangerous route, which runs close to the battle line. Destruction, chaos and lack of responsibility are the realities of the temporarily occupied Luhansk Region. And while the invaders cover their own failure with loud statements, the city literally sinks into a sewage crisis. As reported by ArmyInform, the temporarily occupied territories of Luhansk continue to plunge into chaos and degradation. The other day it became known about the mysterious death of the head of the occupation administration of Severodonetsk, who was accused by the Russian security forces of creating a criminal group and a number of serious crimes..	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/13/komunalnyj-horror-show-na-tot-luganshhyny-okupanty-dovely-misto-do-stanu-sos/	2025-02-13T11:52:16-08:00
Bloomed and burned: how the soldiers of the Defense Forces turned the enemy -Tulip- into scrap metal	The video of combat work was made public on the brigade's page. Russian self-propelled mortar 2C4 -Tulip- is a formidable weapon that has a caliber of 240 mm and can deliver devastating blows to fortifications. However, this time this -flower- was not able to harm the Ukrainian forces - it was in the field of view of the UAV operators. Thanks to the well-designed plan and the jewelry work of the FPV drones, the -Tulip- burst into flames like a Christmas garland. The lightning strike of the -Voron- fighters did not leave the occupiers a chance to save the equipment - it burned to the ground. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the VORON unmanned systems battalion of the 100th separate mechanized brigade of the -Steel Hundred- installed the Ukrainian flag over by the Tsentralna mine in Toretsk.

Survived the sniper, survived three aerial bombs and returned to battle - the story of Yuriy Kameny	The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. As a member of the 61st separate mechanized Steppe brigade, Yurii worked his way up from a grenade launcher to the battalion chief sergeant. He fought for the Kherson region, personally provided logistics of ammunition and evacuation of the wounded under mortar fire. In Soledar, he was wounded by a sniper's bullet, but after treatment he returned to the front. -I came back because I have a great responsibility to the soldiers, I have to take care of them. I can't leave mine, they are all heroes for me. They went to war because they understand that if they don't defend their homeland, the enemy will be in their homes and will mock their loved ones,- says Yuriy. In 2024, during the defense of Orlivka and Semenivka in Donetsk region, Kameny sent reinforcement groups to the most difficult areas of defense. During one of the operations, his car was hit by an enemy FPV, but the man remained unharmed. At the beginning of the Kursk operation, Kameny's battalion raised the Ukrainian flag over Souzha. During one of the tasks, the man was injured again. -Three CABs have arrived. Pure luck - I remained alive. Wounded his left hand, put out his eye. Eyesight has worsened. But I take responsibility for my position and again with my boys. We must remember that we are of the Cossack family and our great-grandfathers fought with everyone who entered our land,- emphasizes Yuriy. As reported by ArmyInform, when the combat medic of the -Rubizh- Brigade with the call sign -Sam- decided to go to the front, he had a choice - to stay in a civilian job thanks to -armor- or to defend the country.

He was also awarded the -Exemplary Service-, -Military Cross- and -Silver Cross-. These two examples are just a drop in the sea of ​​stories about how representatives of various professions and social statuses came to the defense of Ukraine. Their stories prove that patriotism and the willingness to defend one's land do not depend on position or status. -I have been in local self-government and state authorities since 1995. And I think that this experience helps,- says Oleksii Kaida. -I got into the army, like most of those who continue to serve. On February 26, 2022, after taking my family out of the city of Kyiv, I went to the military and was called up for military service.

-TikTok-expert- from Kharkiv Oblast will appear in court for justifying Russian aggression	The Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office informs about this. He is accused of spreading public calls for violent change and overthrow of the constitutional order, seizing state power, as well as justifying and acknowledging the armed aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine. According to the investigation, since March 2023, a man who lives in the town of Zmiyiv, Chuguyiv district, began actively spreading anti-Ukrainian videos on the TikTok platform. In his videos, he broadcast theses and statements of Kremlin propaganda, passing them off as his own -expert- opinion. In his videos, the -expert- repeated pro-Russian narratives about the causes of the war in Ukraine, called on Ukrainians to unite and speak out against the current president, talked about the -threat from NATO-, because of which the president of the Russian Federation started the so-called -svo-, the oppression of Russian speakers and justified the actions of the Russian military.

Secrets of survival from marine special forces: a first aid kit is always at hand, even underwater	This was reported on the center's page. The combat medic of the 73rd SSO center, -The Spaniard-, said that in their group, all the first-aid kits are located behind on the warbelt, the unloading belt. This location is very convenient, because it does not interfere with the manipulation of the weapon and is always within quick access. If necessary, the fighter can get the first-aid kit himself or his comrade can do it. The first-aid kits are quick-release, and the combat medic of the group deals with their collection. However, before each operation, the composition of the first-aid kit can be adjusted depending on the situation. Usually, medics add more essentials - decompression needles, tamponades, etc. - so that in the event of losing the medical pack, the fighter has a larger supply of aid. Turnstiles are always located in a prominent place - at least four for yourself and a few more for your companions. The most important thing for every fighter is to regularly check his first aid kit: whether the products have lost their airtight packaging, whether something has spoiled, or whether the expiration date has expired. The medic also checks the first-aid kits before each combat mission, but the fighters themselves must control this moment. In some cases, when there is a probability of a large number of wounded, fighters can take two individual first-aid kits with them. One is located on the belt, and the other is in another place. This is done to help the medic and wounded comrades. However, the second first-aid kit is taken only for specific combat tasks. As reported by ArmyInform, in modern combat, where it is often necessary to operate in conditions of limited visibility, a flashlight on a weapon is a critical piece of gear. Operators from the 73rd Naval Special Purpose Center shared their experiences using different types of lights and their importance to operational success.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/13/sekrety-vyzhyvannya-vid-morskyh-speczpryznachencziv-aptechka-zavzhdy-pid-rukoyu-navit-pid-vodoyu/	2025-02-13T10:11:39-08:00
-Tactical crutch- became the last hope of the lame occupant to be saved from the FPV drone	A rather interesting example in this sense was shared on social media by the drones of the 77th separate airmobile Naddniep brigade of the Airborne Assault Troops of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. In the footage they published, you can see a lone Russian occupier limping somewhere on two crutches when he suddenly notices the approach of an FPV drone that has clearly targeted him. At the same time, the Russian invader, of course, did not have any weapons with which he could try to shoot down the quadcopter while in flight, or even more so an electronic warfare device to -silence- it. Realizing that he would not be able to escape or hide either, the Kremlin's -cannon fodder- faced such desperation that he tried to shoot down the FPV drone with one of his -tactical crutches-. You can evaluate the result of this approach on the video. Russian soldier of the Special Needs Forces was treated by an FPV drone of the 77th Airmobile Brigade. The Russian command spares no one.

--Emka- is a rocket, but they break it all the same-: a frank story of a mechanic-driver about milit...	The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. -When I joined the 32nd brigade, they asked if it was interesting to ride on the M113 tracked armored personnel carrier. I agreed,- Vitaly says. At first he was a gunner, and then, after the mechanic was injured, he took his place. -Emka- in control is a rocket. But they break them all the same. There are still no cars that don't break through,- he adds. One of the most vivid episodes shared by Vitaliy took place near Kotlyny. Then his APC was destroyed, but luckily everyone survived. -I'm just leveling up with this -beater- - arrival. The car is full of smoke, everyone is crazy. You feel in your gut that everything. I check myself, my legs are moving - that means I'm alive,- he recalls. After this incident, Vitaliy and his comrades successfully evacuated, although mortar shelling from behind -caught up- with them. Vitaly is the father of two children, and in his civilian life he was a repair mechanic. -I worked at a shoe factory for 15 years. He took care of the technical condition of conveyors and sewing machines. I don't care what nuts to twist,- he says about himself. Now he is the head of REBs and drives American MaxxPro armored vehicles. -The boys were traveling from Pokrovsk, so the FPV with the -zucchini- flew like half a bucket into the lobeshnik. The car flipped over on its side, it is clear that it no longer had controllability, but inside there are all the targets, both mechs and landing gear,- Vitaliy shares his observations about American equipment. In his crew, Vitaly and his gunner-operator are interchangeable professionals. -When I sit in the gunner's seat, I help the infantry to throw out the bags during the landing. I work on the lever of the apparatus, because it is not convenient for me to move. In MilChat, I control the road so as not to drive into p@#$rasiv. Mekhan only steers with the steering wheel, and I tap him on the left shoulder if he needs to turn left,- Vitaliy says about his work in the crew. To be a good mechanic, you need to know your car well. -Don't catch the gav until someone does it, because some people there are used to the fact that fixers have to come from the repair company. No, I went myself, checked the tracks, tightened them properly. So that the machine, as it should be, immediately -jiked- and flew away. This is important,- Vitaly shares his experience. As reported by ArmyInform, war blurs the boundaries between people, changes destinies, destroys and at the same time creates something new. Ian -Kenobi-, commander of the 1st International Legion, and Anastasia, a combat medic, found each other in the midst of hostilities. Their story is one of struggle, loss and a love tempered by war.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/13/emka-raketa-ale-rozbyvayut-vse-odno-vidverta-rozpovid-mehanika-vodiya-pro-vijskovi-budni/	2025-02-13T08:47:50-08:00
NATO Secretary General: We cannot allow Putin to win	He said this at the results of the ministerial meeting in Brussels, the correspondent of ArmiyaInform reports. -All members of the Alliance and Ukraine are united in their desire for peace in Ukraine. We all agree that we should put Ukraine in the strongest position for negotiations. And we need a strong, lasting peace, not Minsk-3. We cannot allow President Putin to win,- Mark Rutte said. Today, the members of the Alliance also met with representatives of Ukraine at the meeting of the Ukraine-NATO Council, which was joined by the High Representative of the EU Kaya Kallas. The Minister of Defense of Ukraine, Rustem Umerov, informed the members of the Alliance about the latest events at the front. -We discussed the importance of our continued support to Ukraine. Which is crucial to bringing this brutal war of aggression to a just and lasting end. And we discussed the need for the European members of the Alliance and Canada to do even more,- Mark Rutte said. He added that in 2024, NATO members provided Ukraine with more than 50 billion euros in security assistance — almost 60% of this amount came from Europe and Canada. -Both yesterday and today the members of the Alliance announced new packages of military support. This will help Ukraine in its struggle today and the development of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the long term. We had an honest and frank discussion between ourselves and with Ukraine. And we end our meetings with a clear sense of purpose, commitment and urgency,- Mark Rutte concluded.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/13/gensek-nato-my-ne-mozhemo-dozvolyty-putinu-peremogty/	2025-02-13T08:38:51-08:00
-Each of our departures brings benefits-: the story of the chief sergeant of the UAV platoon	The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. With the beginning of a full-scale invasion, Nazar joined the territorial defense, although he was not yet eligible for mobilization due to his age. There, he got his first experience with drones, striking enemy shelters. Later, when the commander changed in the unit, many fighters began to transfer to other units. Nazar, knowing about the combat effectiveness of the 128th OGSHBr, decided to transfer there. -I immediately wanted to serve in a combat brigade, but at that time only those with combat experience were hired. I gained the necessary skills in ground defense, and now I work with FPV drones already in the 128th brigade. Our attacks destroy enemy antennas and fortifications, which seriously affects the combat capability of the occupiers,- says Nazar. One of the key aspects of the new service for the military has become adequate command, which not only sets combat tasks, but also helps develop professional skills. -If something doesn't work out, no one here will insult you. On the contrary, they will explain and help correct mistakes. It motivates and gives confidence,- says the fighter. His wife and two sons are waiting for his return in Vinnytsia. The youngest was born already during the war, and the eldest, who is four and a half years old, believes that his father is -fighting zombies.- -It's difficult for him - he sees that dads come to the kindergarten to pick up other children. I communicate with my family via video, but it is no substitute for face-to-face communication. The most difficult thing in this war is separation from family,- the soldier admits. Despite everything, Nazar and his comrades remain on the front lines because they understand that Ukraine's success in the war depends on their work. -Each of our sorties is beneficial - if not destroying the enemy, then at least damaging their logistics. It adds strength.'' As reported by ArmyInform, when the combat medic of the -Rubizh- Brigade with the call sign -Sam- decided to go to the front, he had a choice - to stay in a civilian job thanks to -armor- or to defend the country. He chose the second and not only became a combat medic, but also set a unit record for destroying enemy armored vehicles. On his account includes five destroyed vehicles along with the landing party.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/13/kozhen-nash-vyyizd-prynosyt-koryst-istoriya-golovnogo-serzhanta-vzvodu-bpla/	2025-02-13T08:32:23-08:00

The story of the fighter was made public on the page of the Land Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The warrior went through many hot spots of the war: the defense of Kharkiv, the liberation of the region, battles for Bakhmut, border skirmishes in Sumshchyna. However, the battle in the Zaporozhye direction, near the Chereshnya observation point, is most vividly etched in my memory. That day, Klim spotted an armored infantry vehicle approaching his trench. Five enemy paratroopers were sitting on the armor. He lay in wait, waiting for the right moment. The car stopped five meters away, the paratroopers got out and started moving, unaware of the danger. -As soon as the BMP began to leave, I realized that there would be no machine gun cover. I shot down two or three with a machine gun, they were lying down. Then I threw ``efka'' into the pile. From the fierce, hateful cries, it was clear that I still touched the trio. The guys covered me from behind with machine gun fire and we dealt with him in almost a minute or a half. At that time, the BMP was running at full throttle,- Klim recalled. Before the war, -Klim- lived a peaceful life: he built, repaired shoes, took care of the dacha. -Valery dreams of taking up his favorite work again, leaving the war in the past. His children and grandchildren are waiting for him at home,- the message reads.

-Shelters- failed: the drones of the Iron Brigade found an enemy tank and deleted it from the game	The video of combat work was made public on the brigade's page. At the forefront of today's chronicle is the Crazy Cats group of the rifle battalion. Their FPV drones sent the enemy into the scrap -Ural- with frontal strikes, destroyed the antenna complex and blew up the mortar. Border guards are not far behind: kamikaze drones destroy a grader engaged for engineering work and a 122-mm D-30 howitzer. Each such blow not only reduces the enemy's potential, but also brings victory closer. But the real gem of this combat selection is the work of the Flint crew from the Control and Artillery Reconnaissance Battery (BUAR). They managed to find and destroy a carefully camouflaged tank. A powerful charge turned the occupants' armored car into a pile of scrap metal. The 3rd Tank Iron Brigade does not give the enemy a chance. Ukrainian soldiers continue their journey, breaking the occupation hydra to pieces. And this is just the beginning.

It shows two Russian soldiers going down to an underground shelter among the ruins of one of the settlements destroyed by the Soviet Union, after which they mask the entrance with some kind of garbage.

As reported by ArmyInform, an attempt to break through a convoy of enemy armored vehicles to Ukrainian positions turned into a disaster for the USSR.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/13/ne-zalyshyvshy-shansiv-bijczi-zsu-pidibralysya-vprytul-do-shovanky-rosiyan-ta-zakydaly-yih-granatamy/	2025-02-13T05:43:10-08:00
From the keyboard to the gun: how the Aitivite -Apostol- became a threat to the Russian invaders	The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. Mykhailo served in the army in 2018-2019, and after the full-scale Russian invasion, he took up arms again. Having an officer rank after the military department, he was trained as a platoon leader, and later became an artilleryman. Since the spring of 2023, Mykhailo has been serving in the 58th motorized infantry brigade, where he first worked with the Soviet D-20 guns, and then mastered the British AS-90 self-propelled gun. -I saw the world a little, because we were taught in Great Britain, at the Royal School of Artillery,- Mykhailo says. — The Allies wanted us to be versatile, able to work both as mechanics-drivers and as gunners, to know the basics of repairing equipment. This helped a lot in a real combat environment. Because there were times when up to 100 shells were fired a day. British guns are more accurate, easier to aim, a lot of automation.- Thanks to the work of -Apostol- and its brothers, enemy columns, Russian tanks and other armored vehicles were hit, enemy positions and manpower were destroyed. The range of ammunition for British guns allows for a wide range of combat missions. -In addition to destroying identified targets on command, our main task is to protect the infantry. Do not let the enemy get close to our brothers. Only the drones see the advance of the enemy or the assault, we open fire to eliminate the invaders while they are on the way. That's how we worked at one time near Urozhany, and then near Prechistivka, in Donbas,- says the officer. At home, Mykhailo's parents and sister are waiting. After the war, he dreams of returning to a peaceful profession and starting a family. But it will be after the victory, when the guns die down. As reported by ArmyInform, on the front line, where every day there is a fierce struggle for every meter of Ukrainian land, fighters of the 21st separate mechanized brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine use unexpected weapons against modern enemies drones - Maksym machine gun, developed back in the 19th century.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/13/vid-klaviatury-do-garmaty-yak-ajtishnyk-apostol-stav-grozoyu-rosijskyh-okupantiv/	2025-02-13T05:32:04-08:00

However, it was not possible to wait - Ukrainian drones found everyone. The footage released by the military shows Russian fortifications turning into fire traps. The occupiers tried to hide, but they could not escape from the highly accurate Ukrainian -bird-. Each blow is minus one enemy position, minus the next plans of the Russian command and minus the cannon fodder that the Kremlin drives to the front. -This is just another working day for our team. We are methodically clearing the Ukrainian land from invaders,- the stormtroopers comment on their work. As reported by ArmyInform, a column of Russian armored vehicles with an amphibious assault tried to break through to Ukrainian positions, but this attempt turned into a catastrophe for the invaders. to a real disaster.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/13/vykuryly-z-nir-yak-drony-kyyivskoyi-brygady-prygostyly-okupantiv-garyachenkym/	2025-02-13T05:14:00-08:00

Ukrainian veteran won bronze at the Invincible Games in skeleton	This is reported by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Ilya Hayduk covered the distance in 32.67 seconds, demonstrating great skill and strength of spirit. This victory is especially important, because Ilya is a military man who, despite being wounded, found the strength to move on and achieve success in sports. Ilya Hayduk is a 34-year-old serviceman of the 36th Brigade. Before the war, he served in the police and took the Murphy test every year. During a full-scale invasion, he transferred to the Armed Forces, where he was assigned to a company of strike unmanned aerial systems. In November 2023, while performing a combat mission in the Zaporizhzhia region, he was wounded and lost his leg. At the Invincible Games, Ilya again felt lightness and enjoyment of life. Loves adrenaline and believes that the veteran community is very important for an active post-war life. Skeleton is a sport most likely invented by the British military in the late 19th century. This is a sled race, when athletes move along the track head first, maneuvering between turns. Participants must overcome not only the distance, but also their own fear. This year, the skeleton is featured for the first time at the Invincible Games. We are proud of Ilya Hayduk and all Ukrainian military and veterans who, despite being wounded, found the strength to move on! As ArmiyaInform reported, a skeleton was presented for the first time at the Invincible Games 2025, and Ukrainian veterans and military could not miss this opportunity.

Three days in hell on the Dnipro: the confession of a combat medic -Cossack- about an extremely diff...	The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. -I never thought that I would have to crawl over corpses, that I would have another person's brains on my beard, that all my armor would be covered in blood,- says -Cossack.- His words are not just scary details, but the reality of the war that Ukrainian defenders face. The operation on the island was a turning point for him. He already had combat experience - he served as a senior medic of a mortar battery, provided assistance to units' fighters, and detected enemy equipment. But what he experienced on the left bank of the Dnieper was beyond anything that could be imagined. Since the beginning of the assault, the enemy has destroyed up to 20 of his fighters, but Ukrainian units have also suffered losses. The wounded were taken to the island, which quickly became a priority target for the occupiers. At night, the Russians started a massive fire, turning a small patch of land into an inferno. -You're walking through the swamp, debris is flying at you, you're covered in blood, you don't even count the contusions- Among the wounded is a boy who has no life left. In the abdominal cavity there are fragments with which I cut my fingers to the bone, trying to stop his bleeding,- recalls -Cossack-. At a critical moment, it is important not only to save, but also to manage chaos. -Cossack- remembers how he shouted at the wounded and shocked soldiers, forcing them to act. It was the only way to survive. One of the most difficult tasks was to find and extract a wounded comrade nicknamed -Psycho-. When he was being pulled out, another flight happened. -I pressed myself against him, and then I realized that I had his brains on my beard- - recalls the fighter. The -psycho- survived, but when he regained consciousness, he tried to tear off the breathing tube. Then -Cossack- had to tape his hands. Later, in the hospital, he apologized to his friend, although he probably owed him his life. After the evacuation of the wounded and a series of logistical operations, it was time for the -Cossack- itself to leave the island. He remembers that moment with trepidation: -When I stepped on the asphalt of the right bank with my bare feet, I felt such relief that words cannot express it.- Today, -Cossack- not only continues to serve, but also transfers his experience to young fighters. His main rule is to train every day, challenge yourself and never stop. This is how the legendary marines who are making history right now are hardened. As reported by ArmyInform, a junior sergeant with the call sign -Katran- is an example of dedication and professionalism in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. holds the position of commander of the guard company branch of the 15th separate marine support regiment of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/13/try-dni-v-pekli-na-dnipri-spovid-bojovogo-medyka-kozaka-pro-nadskladnu-operacziyu/	2025-02-13T04:37:55-08:00

- Barrels are also timeless - the Armed Forces explained why the occupiers began to use artillery le...	Major Viktor Tregubov, the spokesman of the Khortytsia operational-strategic group of troops, told about this on the air of the Yedyny Novyni telethon. -Fighting continues near Toretsk, as before. The problem is that we report on the results of battles when there is already a certain consolidation and a certain stabilization of the line on which it is happening. We can say something only when we are already convinced that there is confirmation,- he assured. According to him, the enemy has not changed the intensity of the use of armored vehicles. -If we talk about equipment in other directions, its use is reduced not so much because of weather conditions. The earth was already frozen. The point is rather that it was limited by the use of FPV drones, it was limited by the effective countermeasures of Ukrainian locations. Therefore, we do not observe any serious increase in the use of heavy equipment,- he explained. Viktor Tregubov said that the occupiers cross the Oskil River in small groups that can fit in a boat. -They move as much as a normal rubber boat can fit. They are also crossed by small watercraft. As long as the river does not freeze over, they can only do so. Therefore, they are limited by the number of seats in those plazas that are directly there,- he noted. Also, the spokesman of the -Khortytsia- OSUV said that the Russian troops began to use artillery less in certain directions. -Where there are certain supply problems, there are fewer of them. Supply problems also create strikes by Ukrainian forces. This is no longer our area of ​​responsibility, but when their warehouses begin to blow up or even explode something on the territory of the Russian Federation, it negatively affects the supply of ammunition. Trunks are also eternal,- he summarized. As reported by ArmyInform, the enemy has recently been trying to look for weak spots in our defense in the Novopavlov direction. Attack mainly in small infantry groups. In addition, the weather makes it possible for both Ukrainian and enemy unmanned systems to work.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/13/stvoly-tezh-ne-vichni-okupanty-pochaly-menshe-vykorystovuvaty-artyleriyu/	2025-02-13T03:13:06-08:00

- Economic effect up to 15 million - the Ministry of Defense invented how to use used rubber from ca...	This was reported by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine on Thursday, February 13. According to the state secretary of the department, Nikita Nikitenko, -implementation of this project will allow to reduce budget costs and ensure the needs of the army in material means-, since currently in the warehouses of military units there are more than 6 thousand tons of used tires that need disposal, which costs -from 200 to 400 thousand hryvnias for 1000 tons.- -Accordingly, at the level of the Ministry, it was considered expedient to build our own processing line. This will make it possible to reduce costs and provide the repair units of the Armed Forces with their own products. For example, with rubber mats. If the military needs are fully met, it will be possible to consider the production of products for Ukrainian road enterprises and construction companies,- explained the head of the Office for Alienation and Disposal of Surplus Military Property, Colonel Oleg Koval. He also added that for the creation of the line, they have already purchased the appropriate domestic equipment, which is being installed on the territory of one of the military units under the direct control of the Ministry of Defense. In particular, it will allow processing 1,000 tons of secondary raw materials per year and produce finished products worth 1.2 million hryvnias per month, and taking into account the savings in disposal costs, the annual economic effect of the operation of the line will amount to 15 million hryvnias. -The line is already 80% installed. It is expected that the commissioning works will be completed in the near future, and the line will reach its design capacity in March,- said Oleg Koval. As reported by ArmyInform, the Ministry of Defense told which art systems increased the firepower of the Armed Forces.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/13/ekonomichnyj-efekt-do-15-mln-u-minoborony-vygadaly-yak-vykorystaty-vidpraczovanu-gumu-z-mashyn-dlya-potreb-zsu/	2025-02-13T01:17:32-08:00
Estonian Defense Minister: Europe must be part of the negotiations, otherwise peace will not last lo...	This was stated by the Minister of Defense of Estonia, Hanno Pevkur, at a press briefing in Brussels, ArmiyaInform correspondent reports. -Europe should be part of the negotiations. This is for sure. Because Europe has imposed sanctions on Russia, Europe is investing in the defense of Ukraine and Europe is rebuilding Ukraine through EU money and bilateral aid. Otherwise, this peace will not last long, it will not be the way we would like to see it,- said Hanno Pevkur. He added that Ukraine wants to be a member of the European Union, and therefore this is another additional reason why Europe should be part of these negotiations. -There will be no peace without Ukraine. It is Ukraine that should say when they are ready for negotiations, when the conditions will be set. It cannot be that someone will come and say when the negotiations will begin,- the Estonian minister added. As ArmiyaInform reported, US Defense Minister Pete Hegseth denied that the latest statements of the White House and the Donald Trump administration regarding negotiations with the Russian Federation are a betrayal of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/13/ministr-oborony-estoniyi-yevropa-maye-buty-chastynoyu-peregovoriv-inakshe-myr-ne-tryvatyme-dovgo/	2025-02-13T01:02:08-08:00

He said this while answering journalists' questions in Brussels, ArmiyaInform reports. -These are your words, not mine. Of course, this is not cheating. There is no betrayal, there is recognition that the whole world and the US are invested in peace, in negotiated peace. As President Trump said, the bloodshed must stop. It requires recognition on both sides that they want it,- said Pete Hegseth. The head of the Pentagon added that his task is to -talk realistically- about what is happening in Russia's war against Ukraine. He added that Russian aggression against Ukraine showed that NATO must change and become stronger. Also, Pete Hegseth reminded that the USA provided the most aid to Ukraine, giving the amount of 300 billion dollars. -That's why President Trump called for increased defense spending. For Europe, Russian aggression is a clear threat signal. The US actively participates in the defense of the Alliance and will continue to do so,- the head of the Pentagon said. As ArmiyaInform reported, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said that Ukraine should be in the strongest position at the time of the start of any negotiations on the end of the war, and the Allies should make maximum efforts for this.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/13/glava-pentagonu-zaperechyv-shho-peregovory-ssha-ta-rosiyi-ye-zradoyu-ukrayiny/	2025-02-13T00:45:57-08:00

I count on Mr. Vladyslav's support and constructive solutions. Poland has been with us since the first days of the full-scale invasion, and we are grateful for that support.

How to destroy an enemy mortar attack with three shots: a master class from the commander of the sel...	Is it possible to hit an enemy tank with a 2C1 self-propelled gun? But who are the main targets for our gunners today? The military man told our correspondent about this: -Now, as in 2015, I work for the 2C1 Gvozdika self-propelled guns.- In 2022, he even got into the same battery he was in during the anti-terrorist operation. 2С1 is a Soviet self-propelled artillery system of 122 caliber. In principle, it is quite accurate, considering that there are now drones that provide the ability to adjust fire. This ACS shows itself well. If the ammunition is normal, you can even hit the target area with the third shot. The system is effective for destroying manpower, mortars, lightly armored targets. We mainly work on infantry, enemy mortars. All guidance in Soviet systems is the same, if you once learned, then everything there is more or less similar, you will be able to work on 2C1 as well. Of course, there are nuances. But, in principle, every weapon, every artillery system likes to be serviced after a certain number of shots. -Clove-, in my opinion, is more reliable. It can be compared with a Kalashnikov assault rifle, because it is also not very picky. &#8230;I can remember how we recently destroyed an enemy mortar. We received the command -to battle-. They set up, we aimed, fired. It so happened that we hit this enemy mortar with several shots. It seems somewhere in the three, and that's a very good result. We then destroyed the mortar, the ammunition and the Russians included in the calculation. In fact, the precision of our work is the result of efforts not only of our calculation. Because we are only one of the final chains of this process. It is very important who corrects us. These are our UAV operators. Then they quickly detected this mortar, gave the coordinates. So if everyone did their job well, then the result is good. By the way, if we compare with 2014-15, then there were not so many drones. And there was no such precision. Then we worked harder to cover the defined plane. Now due to the technologies that have moved forward, a bet is placed on accuracy. There were other episodes with hits. If we recall Mykolaiv Oblast and Kherson Oblast in 2022, there was even a time when a tank was hit. Now the enemy does not have so much equipment. And then there was, and they simply dug it in from landings: BMP, tanks. And they didn't worry about them that much. We could hit a buried BMP in the landing, and then the next day the enemy would bury another one next to it. And it turns out that there is one burnt one, and a new one is already in the hood next to it. Now they don't have such stocks of equipment anymore, they are saving. Therefore, our main targets now are infantry, mortars. &#8230;The commander of Maksym told our correspondent about the case when the calculation of his subordinate hit a moving enemy BMP. The commander added that Maxim has a lot of experience as an artilleryman: he has more than two thousand shots under his belt.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/13/yak-znyshhyty-minometnyj-rozrahunok-voroga-z-troh-postriliv-majsterklas-vid-komandyra-sau-gvozdyka/	2025-02-12T20:57:59-08:00
Battalion -Predators of height-: reconnaissance at 50 km, night bombers and records of defeating the...	What is the secret of success of this battalion, due to which it is possible to destroy Russian targets, what is the daily record for defeating enemy attack aircraft, about the specifics of combat missions and the specifics of the operation of the unmanned aviation component, which bombers is the enemy most afraid of and whether the invisibility cloaks save the occupiers near Pokrovsk, the commander of the -Predators of Heights- battalion, Major Maxim with the call sign, told ArmyInform -Condor-. Maxim from Vinnytsia, a teacher by education. Since 2016, he has been serving in the 59th brigade, he joined the unit as an ordinary soldier. Sociable and charismatic commander. He graduated from the leadership course at the National Academy of Ground Forces in Lviv and received the rank of officer. Since the beginning of the large-scale invasion of the Russian Federation, the brigade repelled the offensive of the occupiers in the south of Ukraine. In August 2022, he headed the first infantry battalion of the brigade, which he had formed before that. He has a huge experience in the destruction of rasches in Kherson region, Luhansk region, and now also in Donetsk region. Since September of last year, the command of the brigade offered to lead the battalion of unmanned systems -Predators of Heights-. The performance indicators of this unit are simply amazing. -In the Armed Forces of Ukraine, a rating is conducted on the impact of Russian manpower, military equipment and other enemy targets. This is what specifically applies to UAV damage. Points are awarded there for all destroyed (hit) Russian targets. These points can then be exchanged for different weapons. In addition, it is a good indicator of the work of the units of the Armed Forces. It is not for nothing that for the fourth month in a row, our brigade has taken the leading position in this rating in terms of the number of enemy personnel affected. In January alone, our military eliminated 2,667 occupiers, of which 1,230 were irreparable losses, and 1,437 were wounded. As for the combat work of the -Height Predators- battalion, the numbers of destruction (damage) of various enemy targets speak for themselves. So, about the statistics from January 1, 2024 to February 1, 2025. This is the current data, see for yourself - hit/destroyed: Figures are constantly updated, they can be viewed on the website of the battalion. We like to be tops, this is our job, we stop and destroy the enemy. We go to the command post of the battalion of unmanned systems -Predators of Heights-. The point itself consists of several rooms, workplaces are equipped with large monitors with computers and tablets. There are live video broadcasts from different areas of the line of battle and the depth of the enemy formations. Enhanced aerial reconnaissance is conducted by various reconnaissance UAVs for enemy activity. Absolutely all information about the movement of Russian troops, for example, small assault groups on the front line and the identified targets of the Rashists: shelters, fortifications, KSP, field warehouses, placement of enemy equipment, flows here. Those on duty accumulate all the information and report to the command. Hot targets are identified that must be destroyed immediately. Then the coordinates are transmitted to the attack drone units. The -Altitude Predators- unmanned systems battalion combines two components: the use of unmanned aerial systems and ground robotic systems. This makes it possible to increase the effectiveness of combat missions and preserve the lives of personnel. UAV units carry out aerial reconnaissance and attack the enemy. In terms of reconnaissance functions, there are various UAVs that are engaged in this. These are primarily -Maviks- and -wings- of various ranges. What are our intelligence capabilities? We can close a lane from zero to 50 km deep into enemy territory. If desired, even a little more. That is, different UAVs for different flight ranges. We fly up to 5 km on Maviks, if we need 10 km, we use Autels and the same Maviks, only with a paired battery. If we need to work even further and the weather allows us, we use different types of -wings-. There are -wings- that can fly up to 15 km, and there are those that can fly up to 50 km and even further. The complex application of various reconnaissance UAVs gives a complete picture of informing about the actions of the enemy in our area of ​​responsibility. With up-to-date streams, we can react quickly and destroy the targets of the raiders. We -unwind- the Russians with attack drones of various types with different combat capabilities. These are FPV drones that work as kamikaze drones and drop drones, Maviks with a warhead, heavy large bombers such as Nemesis and Vampires plus shock -wings-. According to the reaction of the Rashists, the enemy is most afraid of large bombers such as Nemesis and -Vampires-. With these bombers, we can effectively destroy enemy equipment up to 20 km or more. Bomber drones can drop different types of munitions on the enemy: thermobaric, cumulative and high-explosive munitions to effectively hit different types of targets. Just last night, our Nemesis and Vampire calculations were hit by two Russian 152mm self-propelled artillery pieces. At the same time, the Russian equipment was on the move, moving quite quickly. They were hit while moving, the equipment stopped and it was already finished on the spot. On the same night, it was also possible to burn a tank and three enemy cars, one of the cars was destroyed on the move. The distance to the enemy targets was approximately 12-15 km from the contact line. The drones struck and returned successfully. Our tactics are simple: we find a target, determine its priority, think about which drones to destroy faster and more efficiently, and take off. There are goals that are nearby and need to be worked on immediately. Depending on the distance, features of the terrain, weather conditions and the goals themselves, we mostly use FPV drones. If the target, such as a stationary one, is far from the front and is well camouflaged, we use other strike UAVs. It is not always possible to destroy equipment with -fpvishkas-, then more powerful means of destruction are needed. If targets are detected at a distance of 50 km or more, then we transmit the coordinates to neighboring units equipped with HIMARS. Recently, our -wing- 35 km from the front line detected the calculation of an enemy UAV, perhaps it was an Orlan-10 complex or a Supercam. The location coordinates were quickly reset and the HIMARS calculation did its job. Our brigade has been carrying out combat missions in the Donetsk direction since November 2022. In principle, here the enemy constantly tried to act actively. Now, already here in the Pokrovsky direction, he continues offensive actions with the involvement of a very large number of infantry. Involves heavy machinery when possible, but very rarely lately. And it is mostly non-armored vehicles: motorcycles, buggies, pickups, UAZs and -loaves-. Large armor can be seen far away, it can be heard, it can be detected faster and, accordingly, there is more time for its damage. But these are quiet and small machines, they are used en masse. They are not particularly visible, they are more mobile and maneuverable. And rashists often use this easy technique just in one direction. The assault group arrived, disembarked and left the car there. Combat work to detect and destroy enemy assault groups is very energy-intensive and intensive. There are a lot of stormtroopers coming from different directions, so all of them must be identified and destroyed. So that you understand, we had such difficult days when, in just one day, we destroyed more than 100 Russian soldiers who were advancing near Pokrovsk with the means of destruction of the -Predators of the Heights- battalion. Rashists were killed with FPV drones, Maviks and other drones. About 80 Rashists were dying on the spot from our blows, others were bleeding for some time. The absolute record of -Predators of the Heights- for a day for the destruction of enemy manpower was at the end of November at the beginning of December. Then 117 raschits lay forever in the Ukrainian soil. In general, if you take the means of destruction of the entire 59th brigade: it is infantry, tanks, artillery plus our battalion, then usually during one day it is possible to destroy more than 200 invaders. Enemy assaults do not stop for a single day. If once stormtroopers moved along forest plantations, attacked key intersections, now they go straight across the field in groups of 8-10. The enemy also learns and understands what points in the area are being scouted, so he tries to act more cunningly and bypass them. Especially often they move in the fog or in the morning, after a while large groups break up into several people and want to bypass our infantry positions. Do not come into fire contact, expecting that new forces will come up and it will be possible to take our infantry into the encirclement. Of course, we will not let the enemy do this. The main thing is to detect the movement of assault groups in time, then drone calculations are connected and inflict damage on the enemy. Infantry units of the Russian Federation are being depleted very quickly, new ones are coming. And so we work monotonously every day. Assault teams have now begun to use anti-thermal imaging cloaks or invisibility cloaks. Let's put it this way, they give a certain effect. When the weather is not very good, the raschits are not so far visible, but they can still be seen by their characteristic features. For example, kamikaze raiders walk across the field at night, hear our drone flying somewhere, immediately lie down on the ground, completely cover themselves with these cloaks, do not move and think that no one has -besieged- them. A few nights ago, our calculations of fpvish, Maviks, Vampires and Nemesis dismantled 30 of these stormtroopers in a 1 km area. Vampire and Nemesis heavy bomber drones are formidable and effective weapons. There are, of course, certain differences between them in combat capabilities and characteristics. These are means of different damage ranges. If the -Vampire- works up to 10 km, then the Nemesis up to 20 km and more. -Vampire- covers a distance of up to 10 km in 23 minutes with a 10 kg reset weight. If it is necessary to carry a warhead over a long distance, then a slightly smaller ammunition is attached to it. In good weather, we can hit equipment and other enemy targets at a distance of up to 30 km. These two bomber drones are particularly effective at night. It is not for nothing that the Katsaps set up observation mobile guard posts in places of deployment, for example, armored vehicles or warehouses with ammunition. These posts at night are supposed to neutralize heavy bombers so that they do not reach their targets. Similar to how our mobile fire groups work on -Shahedam-. Rashists usually use small arms. -Baba Yaga-, as the occupiers call them, is quite noisy at work, so it can be heard from afar. At the front, the enemy constantly uses EW means. Starting from tiny devices in the backpacks of Russian attack aircraft and ending with operational-level EWs located at a depth of 20-30 km from the front edge. Work on their detection is carried out around the clock. We make special maps with the routes of the location of EWs of the occupiers, bypass in the air the zones of their radius of action. Ideally, we find and destroy these means, because they affect the operation of our drones. The enemy is improving and every time it is more difficult to fight the enemy. But we are also developing strongly, we are looking for new ways and methods of combating the EW means of the Russians. In different directions, the enemy uses different means of countering the work of our reconnaissance and strike drones. For example, when we were defending in Krasnohorivka, the Rashists tried to block with their -maviks-. They just dropped an ordinary fishing net on our bomber, then the blades spin and it falls to the ground. I once remember a case when the enemy dropped a net on the -Vampire- a little unsuccessfully, but then the drone's blades did not stop, it successfully hit the target and turned back. FPV drones with thermal imaging are often used to attack our bombers. As this happens, enemy infantrymen report that they have been detected and hear the operation of a Ukrainian bomber drone. Immediately, an enemy -fpvishka- flies out, which should already find and hit our drone. But, usually, when it arrives, the rockets are destroyed and the bomber is no longer in place. Even with a light -Mavik- they went for a battering ram, but nothing came out of them. Our pilots skillfully maneuvered and got out of the attack. From my own experience and combat experience, I can say that the most skilled UAV pilots of various types are our infantrymen who performed combat missions on the front line. We have a lot of guys who have been drafted into the army since 2014 and those who have participated in assault operations since the first days of the large-scale invasion. These are people from different regions of Ukraine, teachers, businessmen, IT specialists, people of other peaceful professions. The guys are united by a single goal - to destroy the enemy and drive them out of our land. Someone was transferred to the -Height Predators- battalion due to their health, someone of their own volition, someone was recently called up for mobilization. No one is better at piloting a drone than a person who understands what it's like to be an infantryman in the trenches and how difficult it is to be there and perform tasks under enemy fire. The infantryman-pilot perfectly understands how to do so in order to save his comrades in -SPeshki- when they are attacked by the invaders. He understands the enemy, how he will act. Of course, anyone can become a strong drone operator, the main thing is the desire to learn.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/13/bataljon-hyzhaky-vysot-rozvidka-na-50-km-nichni-bombery-ta-rekordy-urazhennya-voroga-pid-pokrovskom/	2025-02-12T20:44:20-08:00
New military aid and tough statements by the Pentagon: what Ramstein was like for Ukraine in Brussel...	This meeting was expected primarily because of the arrival of the new head of the Pentagon, who was supposed to outline the future attitude of the US to this format and to the provision of security assistance to Ukraine in general. What agreements did yesterday's meeting bring and whether the format of -Ramstein- will change - read more in the material of the correspondent of ArmiyaInform. Unlike most previous Ramsteins, which took place at a German airbase, yesterday's meeting took place at NATO headquarters. It was decided to combine it with the ministerial meeting of the Alliance in the Belgian capital. Another peculiarity was the presiding of Great Britain — for the first time in almost three years, Rammstein was not presided over by the United States. According to interlocutors in Brussels, London itself initiated such a decision due to the arrival of the new administration of US President Donald Trump and the related uncertainty regarding the future fate of this format. And it was Britain that announced the largest aid package at the end of the meeting. It should also be recalled that the previous -Ramstein- was only a month ago and yesterday's meeting was primarily not about new aid packages, but about coordinating work in the future. The new head of the Pentagon, Pete Gegset, saw with his own eyes how Rammstein works, heard about the needs of the Ukrainian army and for the first time met with the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Rustem Umyerov. Pete Hegseth also spoke at the beginning of Rammstein with a statement that contained a number of harsh messages and caused a heated debate. The main message of the head of the Pentagon was unequivocal — European allies should increase defense spending and share the financial burden of assistance both in supporting Ukraine and in ensuring their defense capability. -We call on your countries and your citizens to redouble their efforts and reaffirm their commitment not only to Ukraine's immediate security needs, but also to Europe's long-term defense and deterrence goals,- Pete Hegseth told his NATO colleagues. The US is the largest donor of military aid to Ukraine, but other NATO countries have actually already seriously increased their spending. In 2024, NATO members in Europe and Canada invested $485 billion in defense, which is almost 20% more than in 2023. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte supported the US demands, saying that last year Canada and European allies provided more than 50% of the total amount of aid to Ukraine. -And I fully agree with President Trump and his team that this is the only sensible way forward. Of course, there will undoubtedly be debates regarding the issue of future support for Ukraine, who will pay for it, where it will come from, etc. But there is also an agreement between all members of the Alliance that Ukraine should have all the necessary military assistance, so that whenever peace negotiations start, it can conduct them from a position of strength,- he explained. Potential peace talks were another point in Pete Hegseth's speech. -Like you, we want a sovereign and prosperous Ukraine. But we must start by realizing that returning to the borders of Ukraine by 2014 is an unrealistic goal. The pursuit of this illusory goal will only prolong the war and cause more suffering,- he said. The head of the Pentagon believes that it is possible to achieve an end to the war only by combining -allied forces with a realistic assessment- of the situation on the battlefield. In his opinion, lasting peace for Ukraine should include reliable security guarantees to prevent the recurrence of war. But how to get these guarantees from the Kremlin, the US Defense Minister did not explain. He also said that the United States does not consider NATO membership for Ukraine to be a realistic outcome of a negotiated settlement. However, not all allies share the US position on this point. Danish Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen disagreed with the US position expressed at Ramstein. -We have decided to offer Ukraine membership in NATO, but it is also clear that for this we must all agree. So we can say that there is a discussion going on now about what future awaits Ukraine,- he said on the sidelines after -Ramstein-. Defense Minister of Ukraine Rustem Umyerov emphasized that Kyiv is not going to abandon the path of European and Euro-Atlantic integration. -Our position is unchanged: we want to be a NATO country, we will be a NATO country, we will be an EU country,- he said in a conversation with journalists in Brussels. However, this -Ramstein- was distinguished not only by harsh statements of the USA, but also provided Ukraine with new packages of military aid from a number of countries. Great Britain hands over 150 million pounds worth of weapons and equipment: thousands of drones, dozens of battle tanks and armored vehicles, as well as air defense systems. Britain plans to provide Ukraine with more than 10,000 drones during the year, and by the end of spring it will deliver more than 50 armored vehicles, including modernized T-72 tanks. Germany will soon hand over to Ukraine about 100 missiles for the IRIS-T anti-aircraft missile complex, which will help strengthen the protection of Ukrainian infrastructure against Russian air threats. The Netherlands is handing over 25 armored tracked vehicles to the YPR, which will be used to transport the wounded. In total, the country has allocated more than 10 billion euros in military aid to Ukraine, of which approximately 6 billion euros have been implemented. -We have to continue our support, especially now, when Ukrainians are having a hard time at the front. Peace against Russia is possible only with the help of military force,- Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans is convinced. The Netherlands also handed Ukraine the last promised T-72 tanks as part of a joint program with the Czech Republic and the United States. In addition, Ukraine recently received a new batch of Dutch F-16 fighters, but the exact number of transferred aircraft is not is disclosed Norway has joined the Drone Coalition for Ukraine and will help strengthen the protection of Ukraine's critical infrastructure. Latvia, which last year spent 0.25% of its GDP to support Ukraine, will hand over 42 more armored personnel carriers. -We are determined to continue supporting Ukraine. It must be emphasized that any peace negotiations must be conducted from a position of strength,- said Latvian Defense Minister Andris Spruds. For now, we can definitely say that -Rammstein- will survive, only technical issues remain, such as the chairmanship. Whether it will be Great Britain in the future, or the format will return under the auspices of the United States, is still unknown. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte is confident that the format should work in parallel with the new command in Wiesbaden (NSATU), which is responsible for the coordination and delivery of aid to Ukraine. -Obviously, both are needed. Because in the Rammstein format, the members of the Alliance and other countries outside NATO undertake to guarantee that Ukraine has everything it needs,- he explained. At the same time, NSATU not only organizes logistics for the transfer of weapons, but also, for example, conducts training for the Ukrainian military. -So we need these two programs. Therefore, I think that the future depends on both,- said the NATO Secretary General. Rustem Umyerov is also convinced of the continuation of Ramstein's work. -I believe that Rammstein was held productively and it was agreed that the next meeting will also take place, the place and time will be announced later,- he said, summing up the meeting in Brussels.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/13/nova-vijskova-dopomoga-ta-zhorstki-zayavy-pentagonu-yakym-buv-dlya-ukrayiny-ramshtajn-u-bryusseli/	2025-02-12T20:30:47-08:00
Mobilization of drones: a Californian firm has redesigned its civilian UAV for the needs of the US A...	As informed by the profile defense edition The war zone, in February 2022 the Californian drone manufacturer Skydio won the army competition under the SRR project, in which the company presented its Skydio X2D civilian drone adapted for the needs of the Pentagon, which in The US Army received the name RQ-28A, according to ArmyInform. As part of the agreement with the Pentagon, the amount of which amounted to $99.8 million, the Skydio company undertook to transfer 1,080 units of RQ-28A quadcopters to the army units of the United States Armed Forces. In turn, the authors of the Dutch defense portal Army Recognition (AR) was informed that as part of one of the first in 2025 Army multinational exercises Combined Resolve 25-1, which took place in mid-January at the Joint Multinational Readiness Center on the Hohenfels training ground in Germany, fighters of the 317th Engineer Brigade of the US Army actively tested the advanced RQ-28A drones in their arsenal. Skydio X2D, an American unmanned aerial vehicle designed for rapid deployment and capable of being fully ready within a minute of activation. This portability is one of its key features—soldiers can carry the drone in their backpacks, making it an ideal accessory for platoon-level operations. Weighing just under 2.25 kg (5 pounds), the Skydio X2D can conduct high-resolution video surveillance both day and night, with a range of up to three kilometers. The drone's robust autonomous capabilities set it apart from other unmanned systems as it can navigate complex environments while avoiding obstacles such as trees and buildings. This level of autonomy reduces the burden on soldiers, allowing them to focus on their mission rather than piloting the UAV. In addition, the drone's ability to operate in low-visibility environments, such as populated urban areas with heavy construction or dense forests, further expands its usefulness. A properly trained operator can access control of the RQ-28A using a dedicated controller with a 6.8-inch 720p LED touchscreen and an internal antenna. The latter is used to communications at a distance of up to 6 kilometers using the 5 GHz band, and such a relatively modest signal transmission range clearly defines the RQ-28A as belonging to the short-range drone class. Speaking of equipment, the RQ-28A provides comprehensive reconnaissance capabilities thanks to the presence of 4K optical cameras with 16x digital zoom and dual sensors, including 12-megapixel color camera and thermal sensor FLIR. Such a set guarantees a 360-degree view of the field of view, the ability to detect people and vehicles, and an equally impressive obstacle avoidance system. A kind of -icing on the cake- is the ability to perform 3D scanning of the environment, which makes it possible to automate the process of observing a given target, although the low battery life on a single charge somewhat limits this efficiency. What sets the Skydio X2D apart from other drones is its exceptional autonomy and obstacle avoidance technology. Equipped with Skydio's proprietary computer vision software, the AR site's authors say the drone can navigate complex environments without requiring constant manual control. This level of autonomy allows it to avoid obstacles while maintaining a smooth flight path and minimizing the risk of accidents. Skydio X2D is designed to deploy in less than a minute, offering soldiers a fast and reliable aerial reconnaissance tool that greatly improves their ability to respond to new threats on the battlefield. Deployment of Skydio X2D as part of the initiative Transformation in Contact reflects the US Army's desire to integrate advanced technology into its warfighting strategies. According to the official website of the U.S. Army, this initiative aims to increase the speed and accuracy of decision-making, enabling a real-time tactical response in crisis or conflict scenarios. Using drones such as the Skydio X2D, soldiers can gather real-time intelligence that can be quickly transmitted to commanders, thereby improving situational awareness and the ability to respond to rapidly changing conditions on the battlefield. Using small drones for tactical reconnaissance is an increasingly common approach as they allow the military to assess enemy positions, identify potential threats, and gather critical information without putting soldiers in direct harm. The transition to wider use of drones in The US military is part of a broader trend in modern military strategy. Unmanned systems, previously used primarily for large-scale surveillance, are now critical tools for small units operating at the platoon level. Looking to the future, the US Army plans to expand the use of drones and other unmanned systems in various echelons of military operations. The increasing deployment of these systems at the platoon level reflects a shift to smaller, more nimble and flexible units that can quickly respond to new threats. The Army is expected to integrate even more advanced drone technology, focusing on improving data connectivity, communication between drones and ground units, and expanding the range of operations. As technology advances, drones will likely incorporate artificial intelligence, swarm capabilities, and even autonomous decision-making, making them even more effective tools in combat. The Skydio X2D drone test during Combined Resolve 25-1 in Germany underscores the U.S. Army's commitment to using new technologies to improve battlefield awareness and operational readiness. This drone is a key element of the US military's ongoing efforts to modernize the way it conducts war, ensuring that soldiers are better equipped to meet the challenges of today's conflicts.

Disrupt the mobilization and demonize the TCC: the enemy continues to -pump- the audience with fakes	This week, the topic of the mobilization of Ukrainian teenagers is actively -rocking-. In particular, a video with a Ukrainian prisoner of war, who says that he allegedly saw teenagers from an orphanage in his brigade, is circulating on Russian resources. The propagandists do not provide any other evidence for their lies. They base the charges solely on the -confession- of a Ukrainian prisoner of war, who in the hands of the enemy could have been subjected to torture and death threats. Another example: the dissemination of information that teenagers are being mobilized for the 41st OMbr. In these messages, pro-Russian resources provide screenshots with various comments of military personnel and relatives on Facebook. However, the screenshots turned out to be drawn in Photoshop and generated by artificial intelligence, and the comments under them were added by fake accounts. In order not to fall into such -throwaways-, it is worth knowing that according to the current legislation, citizens of Ukraine between the ages of 25 and 60 are subject to mobilization. Citizens under the age of 25 can join the ranks of the Armed Forces only voluntarily by signing a contract. Traditionally, fakes related -to the atrocities of the TCC and SP- continue to appear. Their goal, in addition to disruption of mobilization, is destabilization of the internal situation in Ukraine. Unfortunately, such fakes are often spread by Ukrainian men. Mostly those who are violators of the law: have not yet updated their data or fled the country. In January, I went through the VLK and did not see any disdain or prejudice towards me in any of the offices. Also, none of the fifty people who spent several hours with me in the queues complained about something similar. Because those citizens who are conscious reservists know very well that in case of need they will fulfill their constitutional duty. And in the TCC and SP, they also treat conscientious citizens who updated their data on time, passed the VLC, and do not hide in the bushes after seeing a person in a military uniform. Those who do not want to serve, are wanted and evade mobilization are criminals. And the attitude towards them is appropriate. Of course, it is easier for them to blame everything on the TCC and SP, ZSU or the government - anyone but themselves. The enemy dreams that such sentiments will prevail everywhere in Ukraine, because that is the only way he will be able to overcome our resistance. That is why it reproduces staged videos, which it tries to cause fear, panic and shake up the internal situation in our country.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/13/zirvaty-mobilizacziyu-ta-demonizuvaty-tczk-vorog-prodovzhuye-kachaty-audytoriyu-fejkamy/	2025-02-12T20:06:15-08:00
Ukraine and the USA are preparing a new agreement on security and economy	The Office of the President informs about this on February 12. -Just held a meeting of the National Security Council - the decision has been made and will be published tomorrow. We are protecting our state and restoring justice: everyone who destroyed Ukraine's national security and helped Russia should be held accountable,- the President assured. According to him, the billions that were actually earned by selling Ukrainian interests and security should be blocked and should be used to protect Ukraine. He also met with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and announced the preparation of a new agreement. -We plan to work out all the details so that already within the limits of the Munich Conference and our meetings there with American representatives, in particular the Vice President of America Vance, so that we have a ready vision of how we will add more security and what document can record it,- the head of state said. He also talked about the talks with the US president. -Very substantive negotiations with the United States of America. President Trump briefed me on what Putin told him. We believe that America's strength is enough to push Russia and Putin to peace together with us, together with all partners,- the President of Ukraine noted. We will remind you that Volodymyr Zelensky conducted long a telephone conversation with former US President Donald Trump about the possibilities of achieving peace in Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/12/ukrayina-i-ssha-gotuyut-novu-ugodu-shhodo-bezpeky-ta-ekonomiky/	2025-02-12T11:59:00-08:00
Love Through Explosions: The Story of an International Legion Commander and a Combat Medic	The story of the defenders was made public on the page of the Land Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Their paths crossed in 2022 in Kruglyakivka. Jan then commanded an infantry company, and Anastasia served in a medical station. Their acquaintance happened by chance - when medics came to help the injured commander of another company. -He was so courageous, serious - I liked him right away,- recalls Anastasia. But then she didn't allow herself to even think about a relationship. War left no room for sentiment, and war rumors only increased caution. Jan himself took his time. They just talked for a long time, until all his personal issues were resolved, and only then did a real feeling develop between them. Together they went through moments when the heart was clenched with fear. Ian saw on the screen an explosion where his beloved had just been. Anastasia - saved the wounded under fire, knowing that someone who was worried was waiting for her. -We immediately drew a line between personal life and work. It wasn't like, 'you're my girl, don't go there,'- says Ian. She worked in evacuation groups, took the wounded out of the hell of battle. Yang had to come to terms with the fact that he couldn't protect her the way he wanted to. Once, while evacuating a dead soldier, Anastasia came under fire. Ian watched it on the monitor, a huge flash, followed by a few seconds of silence that seemed like an eternity. -I thought - that's it, she's gone- But then I heard a voice on the radio- Shelling, contusions, operations. The war more than once made them wonder whether they would return alive. Ian recalls one of his combat exits: mines exploded a few meters away, and only the frozen ground saved their group from death. Anastasia survived serious injuries. -When you're injured, you don't think about how they care about you. You think about your soldiers, about how to save them,- she says. Their feelings were hardened under the bullets. They passed tests that would be enough for several lifetimes. When Anastasia became pregnant, Ian felt even more afraid of losing her. -When I was injured, I was most afraid that my son would be left without a father,- he admits. -But when you're with the one you love, all fears fade away.- Despite all the difficulties, they do not back down, because they know: together, Ukraine needs them - and each other. As ArmiyaInform reported, she saves lives on the front line, helps the wounded and finds time for creativity. -Shantal- is a combat medic of the 34th separate coastal defense brigade, who has been faithfully fulfilling her mission since 2022. An Odessa resident, artist, writer and big animal lover, she shares her experiences, thoughts about the future and the inspiration she finds even in the most difficult moments.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/12/kohannya-kriz-vybuhy-istoriya-komandyra-internaczionalnogo-legionu-ta-bojovoyi-medykyni/	2025-02-12T11:57:36-08:00
Volodymyr Zelenskyi commented on the possibility of Ukraine joining NATO	He said this during a meeting with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. -We were constantly told about the open door policy. But no one has invited us to NATO yet. The fact that there are appropriate steps and the inclusion of this issue in the Constitution of Ukraine&#8230; You know how it happened. This does not mean that NATO said: -Include this in the Constitution, and you will be in NATO tomorrow,- he noted. The head of state recalled the Budapest memorandum. -Exchange for nothing. On paper. Yes, we all want to be in NATO, we are all adequate people with you. But you must understand that all these talks are about steps, about reforms, about re-equipment of the army, about a new level of the Ukrainian army. Where is higher? We stopped Putin,- Volodymyr Zelenskyi said. According to him, membership in NATO can really become a security guarantee for Ukraine. -But the United States, Germany, Hungary, they don't see us there - yet. When we talk about the alternative, I always say that the cheapest option for everyone is Ukraine in NATO. The most expensive is to build NATO in Ukraine, because you, the Ukrainians, will have no other way. There will be no other way for security in Europe. And then it will be reflected in the security of the United States,- the President assured. He noted that Putin does not want to end the war. According to the head of state, building NATO in Ukraine means keeping the same army as in Russia. -That is, there are 220 brigades in Russia, and we have 110 combat brigades. This is the usual arithmetic. And in Europe, I spoke about this recently, approximately 80-82 combat brigades. If there is no Ukraine tomorrow, Russia will go to Europe and occupy it. And we need real security guarantees. And I ask President Trump to give us these security guarantees, to help Ukraine strengthen us,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy assured. He also reminded that large resources are needed to maintain the Ukrainian army. -Of course we should talk to Europe. We currently have a budget deficit. To have an army at least as small as it is now, and to feed this army and arm it is to have a large resource. This money has to come from somewhere,- he explained. As reported by ArmyInform, the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky conducted a long telephone conversation with former US President Donald Trump about the possibilities of achieving peace in Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/12/volodymyr-zelenskyj-prokomentuvav-mozhlyvist-vstupu-ukrayiny-do-nato/	2025-02-12T11:41:41-08:00
Tank funeral: Ukrainian drones turned the armored vehicles of the Russian Federation into a pyre	The video of combat work was published on the regiment's page. UAV operators worked brilliantly on enemy targets. As a result, one tank and a fuel-lubricating material warehouse (FMM) were destroyed, and another tank and an armored fighting vehicle (AMV) were critically damaged. In addition, at least six occupiers were eliminated. As reported by ArmyInform, the operators of the 429th regiment of unmanned systems -Achilles- knocked out the strike from 8 occupants in the truck and continued the hunt.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/12/tankovyj-pohoron-ukrayinski-dronari-peretvoryly-bronetehniku-rf-na-zgaryshhe/	2025-02-12T11:39:44-08:00
As a defender of the Donetsk airport - Katran - found a new mission in the army	The soldier's story was made public on the page of the Ukrainian Navy.

- The Koreans have changed their tactics - in Kurshchyna, soldiers from the DPRK are climbing the po...	This was told by Stanislav Krasnov, platoon commander of the 95th separate amphibious assault brigade, on the broadcast of the -Edyny Novyni- telethon.

We all know very well that there are extrajudicial massacres, executions and so on,- said the platoon commander of the 95th separate amphibious assault brigade. The enemy, as Stanislav Krasnov is convinced, threw a lot of forces to prevent the advance of the Defense Forces, which happened a few days ago, but could not do anything about it. Despite the fact that the Koreans returned to the battlefield. -They changed their tactics somewhat. They are already moving in smaller groups. If before that they moved in groups of up to 50 people, now there are 15-20. But their tactics are the same. All the same, they climb like cockroaches on our positions. Somewhere they are accumulating in landings, trying to break through. In this regard, nothing has changed, they will also suffer huge losses,- said Stanislav Krasnov. As reported ArmyInform, in Kharkiv Oblast, in the Borova district, in the area of ​​responsibility of the Third Assault Brigade, repelled an attempt mechanized offensive.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/12/korejczi-zminyly-svoyu-taktyku-na-kurshhyni-soldaty-z-kndr-lizut-na-pozycziyi-syl-oborony-yak-targany/	2025-02-12T07:02:10-08:00
The NATO Secretary General explained whether the Rammstein format will continue to work	He stated this at a press conference in Brussels, the correspondent of ArmiyaInform reports. -Obviously, both are needed. Because in the -Ramstein- format, the members of the Alliance and other countries outside NATO undertake to guarantee that Ukraine has everything necessary, in particular, support with specific material means for waging war against Russia,- said Mark Rutte. He recalled new military aid packages announced in the past two weeks by Canada, Sweden, the Netherlands and France. -So, you need this format, but you also need NSATU to make sure that all the aid goes to Ukraine in the best way, that it will be as useful as possible,- the NATO Secretary General explained. Mark Rutte added that Ukraine needs weapons for defense, such as tanks, air defense systems, but also needs to organize training for the Ukrainian military. -And this is exactly what NSATU is organizing. So we need these two programs. That's why I think that the future depends on both,- the NATO Secretary General concluded. It should be noted that today, for the first time, the meeting in the format of -Ramstein- is being held under the chairmanship of Great Britain, and not the USA, as it was before. As reported by ArmyInform, today at a meeting of Ramstein it became known that this year Great Britain will allocate military aid to Ukraine in the amount 4.5 billion pounds.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/12/gensek-nato-poyasnyv-chy-praczyuvatyme-nadali-format-ramshtajn/	2025-02-12T07:00:56-08:00

Prince Harry in the Frontier: how the Duke of Sussex supports Ukrainian soldiers at the Invincible G...	This was reported on the brigade's page. Whether this was a planned move or a sincere impulsive decision is unknown. However, this sign did not go unnoticed. Ukrainian military and veterans participating in the competition felt special support from the Duke of Sussex. This is not the first time Prince Harry has expressed solidarity with our country. During the Invincible Games, he actively communicates with the Ukrainian military, inspires them and, it seems, has become even closer to the defenders of Ukraine. -Welcome to the -Rubizh- Brigade, prince Harry!- — humorously remarked the fighters of the brigade in social networks. And although the title of prince does not imply service in another army, it seems that he has already become an honorary -fighter- of the Ukrainian -Rubezh-. As reported by ArmiyaInform, fighters of the 4th battalion -Freedom Force- of the 4th brigade of the operational assignment -Rubizh- of the National Guard hit enemy equipment and finished off the Russian landing party.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/12/pryncz-garri-u-rubezhi-yak-gerczog-sassekskyj-pidtrymuye-ukrayinskyh-voyiniv-na-igrah-neskorenyh/	2025-02-12T06:28:33-08:00
Latvia will transfer 42 armored personnel carriers to Ukraine	He said this before the start of the meeting of the Contact Group on Aid to Ukraine at the NATO headquarters, ArmiyaInform correspondent reports from Brussels. -We will announce new aid in the form of 42 armored personnel carriers, which corresponds to the number of armored vehicles for the battalion. We also continue to co-chair the Drone Coalition and participate in the training of the Ukrainian military,- Andris Spruds said. He reminded that last year Latvia provided more than 0.25% of its GDP to help Ukraine. -We are determined to continue supporting Ukraine. It must be emphasized that any peace negotiations must be conducted from a position of strength. Practical steps are also needed: financial support, military aid,- concluded the Latvian minister. As reported by ArmiyaInform, the member countries of the North Atlantic Alliance have already provided Ukraine with more than the 40 billion euros of defense support promised last year.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/12/latviya-peredast-ukrayini-42-bronetransportery/	2025-02-12T06:05:14-08:00
-Maxim- vs. -Shakheds-: how a 19th century machine gun destroyed a modern kamikaze drone	The story of the fighters was published on the brigade's page. Their comrade-in-arms is -Maxim-, a legendary machine gun that survived two world wars and, as it turned out, is still capable of effectively destroying the enemy. Although its firing range is limited to 800 meters, it was enough to shoot down an enemy Shahed during combat duty. -When we saw the drone, we started working from all six positions. But it was our -Max- that shot him down,- the fighters say. Volodymyr, a builder from Cherkasy region, and Petro, a 58-year-old military man whose son also defends the country, know well the price of accuracy. -If you don't hit the target, it can kill civilians - that's the hardest part,- Volodymyr adds. Such combat experience once again confirms: even century-old weapons can be formidable if they fall into the hands of those who are ready to defend their land. However, the fighters do not hide: they dream of more modern weapons. -We would like something more powerful, DShK or Kanik, then we could shoot down more targets,- says Petro. The Ukrainian army once again demonstrates that war is not only about technology, but also about determination, courage and ingenuity. And if the enemy thinks that his drones will fly through the Ukrainian sky with impunity, he should review history - because even 19th century technologies can work in this game. As reported by ArmyInform, the chief sergeant of the unit with the call sign -Puzzle- is one of those who does not hesitate for a minute when it is necessary to go into battle or save his brothers. His story is a story of courage, bravery and iron will, which became the basis of the battles for Krynky.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/12/maksym-proty-shahediv-yak-kulemet-xix-stolittya-znyshhyv-suchasnyj-dron-kamikadze/	2025-02-12T06:03:46-08:00
-Gifts for an imaginary friend- - violators invented an original scheme for crossing the border, but...	On Wednesday, February 12, reported in the DPSU press service. -First, the young men met with the border guards during verification measures in the controlled border area. They said that they were going to a friend's birthday in one of the border towns, and to be convincing, they took gift packages and food,- &#8211; the message says. However, later the border guards discovered these same citizens in a completely different place. -During the conversation, the boys admitted that they don't have any friends in Volyn - they just wanted to cross the border illegally. During the inspection, it turned out that the -gift- packages contained warm tactical clothing, medicine, canned food, as well as an ax, a saw and other items necessary for the trip,- &#8211; told the DPSU. As a result, the violators were taken to the border division for the preparation of administrative materials under Art. 204-1 of the Criminal Procedure Code (illegal crossing or attempted illegal crossing of the state border of Ukraine). ArmyInform reminds that it is better not to break the law or risk your life, but to use vacancy aggregator in the Armed Forces and recruiting centers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/12/podarunky-dlya-uyavnogo-druga-porushnyky-vygadaly-oryginalnu-shemu-peretynu-kordonu-prote-vona-yih-pidvela/	2025-02-12T05:56:38-08:00

The story of the fighter was made public on the page of the Land Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. A man eliminates enemies with a variety of weapons - from a machine gun to an MLRS. It is noted that one of the most memorable episodes of the war for Roman is related to the destruction of enemy attack aircraft. This happened when the enemy temporarily captured Ukrainian positions. Several fighters went to return them, and -Roks- with a Browning machine gun went behind the Russians and opened fire. -I poured it into the back of their head,- Roman recalls with a smile. The Ground Forces reported that the enemy was completely destroyed, and the positions were returned to the control of the Defense Forces of Ukraine. -Before the war, Roks worked as an energy engineer for more than 20 years.

Mark Rutte: NATO countries exceeded their obligations to Ukraine by providing EUR 50 billion in aid	This was said by NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte on the eve of the ministerial meeting in Brussels, ArmiyaInform correspondent reports. -At the Washington Summit, the Alliance members promised to provide Ukraine with 40 billion euros of security assistance until 2024. They not only fulfilled their obligations. They significantly exceeded them. They provided more than 50 billion euros, more than half of which came from European Allies and Canada,- Mark Rutte said. He emphasized that this is a clear signal of NATO's unwavering commitment to Ukraine. -It's also a big step in the direction of what President Trump has called for. I agree with him that we should distribute security aid to Ukraine evenly. But in order to really change the trajectory of the conflict, we must do even more,- said the NATO Secretary General. Mark Rutte added that the stronger Ukraine is on the battlefield, the stronger it will be at the negotiating table: -The more chances there are to get a good deal to achieve lasting peace.- As ArmiyaInform reported, on February 12, the defense ministers of the NATO countries will participate in the work of the Contact Group on Defense of Ukraine in the Ramshtein format under chaired by Great Britain.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/12/mark-ryutte-krayiny-nato-perevykonaly-zobovyazannya-pered-ukrayinoyu-nadavshy-50-mlrd-yevro-dopomogy/	2025-02-12T05:38:43-08:00

Mobilizing 18-year-olds: when the idea first arose	And it happened in revolutionary France. On August 23, 1793, the National Convention (constitutional and legislative assembly of the period of the French Revolutionary Wars) passed the -Decree on the Mass Levy- (French: Levée en masse), written by Bertrand Barér with Lazare Carnot. The revolution that took place in France in 1789 caused friction between the new republican government and its European neighbors, who decided to invade France to restore the monarchy. The war with Prussia and Austria began in April 1792. And already by March 1793, France was in a state of war with Austria, Prussia, Spain, Great Britain, Piedmont and the United Provinces of the Netherlands. The French army at the time was a mixture of volunteers and what was left of the old royal army. Due to the introduction of conscription on 24 February 1793, the size of the mercenary army was increased to approximately 645,000 soldiers, but this number was insufficient and the military situation continued to deteriorate, especially when Mainz fell on 23 July 1793. The convention began to be demanded to increase taxes, but the assembly solved the problem in a different way, announcing the first general mobilization. A member of the Convention, Bertrand Barrère, asked the convention -to make a solemn declaration that the French people are going to rise up in defense of their independence.- It contained, in particular, the following points: 1. From now on and until the enemies are expelled from the territory of the republic, the French people are constantly in military service. Young men go to battle; married men - forge weapons and provide transport; women make tents and clothes and will serve in hospitals; children turn old rags into lint; the elderly should assemble in public places to stimulate the courage of the warriors and to preach the unity of the Republic and the hatred of kings. 2. National buildings are turned into barracks; public places - in the armory; the soil of the cellars will be washed with lye to remove nitrates from it. 3. Weapons of various calibers should be transferred exclusively to those who oppose the enemy. 4. Saddle horses will be used to equip the cavalry corps; draft horses, other than those used in agriculture, must carry artillery and provisions. 5. The Public Security Committee is instructed to take all necessary measures to immediately establish the special production of weapons of all kinds&#8230; He is empowered to establish all establishments, manufactories, workshops, and factories, as he may deem necessary for the execution of such works, and also to require for this purpose throughout the territory of the Republic such workers as may contribute to their success&#8230; The central establishment of said special production shall be established in Paris&#8230; 8. Bulk collection is general. Unmarried citizens or childless widowers between the ages of eighteen and twenty-five shall be the first; they are to meet without delay at the capital of their districts, where they are to exercise daily while waiting for the hour of departure. 9. Representatives of the people regulate meetings and marches so that armed citizens arrive at places of assembly only in those for which there are sufficient supplies, ammunition and everything that constitutes the material part of the army. 10. The places of assembly shall be determined by circumstances and appointed by the representatives of the people seconded to execute this decree, on the advice of the generals in cooperation with the Committee of Public Safety and the Provisional Executive Council. 11. The battalions organized in each district must be united under a banner with the inscription: The French people have risen against the tyrants&#8230; The mass conscription resulted in the creation of a national army in France composed of citizens rather than mercenaries, which was standard practice at the time. Its maximum number was reached in September 1794 — 1,108,300 people. Most of the soldiers were peasant farmers. The rich and urban workers were given special privileges and exemptions. In addition, the rich could buy replacements (poorer men to take their place) from families who needed money. Men who did clerical work, as well as other men who could read and write, were released from service and worked in government offices. Despite the solemn rhetoric, the mass collection was not popular; desertion and evasion were very high (the number of deserters was later estimated at 175,000). However, these efforts were enough to turn the tide of the war and protect the French borders from all enemies. France's brilliant victory surprised and shocked monarchical Europe. There was no need for further conscription until 1797, when a permanent system of annual conscription was introduced. General mobilization was used in France and during the Napoleonic Wars. Later, the French term -Levée en masse- came to refer to the policy of mass national conscription, often in the face of invasion. But the further practice of mobilizations in the world led to a constant increase in armies with each subsequent war. The culmination was the mass conscription into the armies of various countries during the First and Second World Wars, which claimed millions of lives of those mobilized.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/12/mobilizacziya-18-richnyh-koly-czya-ideya-vynykla-vpershe/	2025-02-12T05:26:25-08:00
A rat in a trap: how the SBU turned a traitor into a weapon against the FSB	This is reported by the Security Service of Ukraine. According to the head of the SBU, Vasyl Malyuk, operation -Rat- made it possible not only to identify the traitor, but also to use him for disinformation of the enemy. During the entire time of being under surveillance, the agent transmitted to the FSB data that was carefully prepared by the Ukrainian special service. The occupiers received information that looked plausible but worked against them. -We monitored his every move, all contacts, communication and correspondence around the clock. He literally lived under the supervision of our special services,- said Vasyl Malyuk. However, in addition to agent activity, the -mole- also had family support in the form of his parents, who openly justified the aggression of the Russian Federation. The SBU is already preparing suspicions against them under Article 436-2 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine. The investigation revealed that the official was recruited in 2018 in Vienna. After a temporary -conservation-, it was reactivated in December 2024, when it began to transmit classified data to the enemy. However, all these actions were under the control of the Ukrainian special services. Together with the -topshurt-, the entire FSB intelligence network was exposed, and its curator - Yuriy Shatalov - was also established. During the operation, a hidden conspiratorial apartment, a mobile phone for transmitting information and other evidence of treason were discovered. The official was charged with treason (Article 111 of the Criminal Code), he faces life imprisonment with confiscation of property. The case is under the control of the Office of the Prosecutor General of Ukraine. The SBU emphasizes that the cleansing of its own ranks from traitors continues, and no FSB agent will remain unnoticed. The enemy can be sure of only one thing - a trap is waiting for him. As reported by ArmyInform, employees of the Security Service of Ukraine discovered a -top- Russian FSB agent in their ranks.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/12/shhur-u-pastczi-yak-sbu-peretvoryla-zradnyka-na-zbroyu-proty-fsb/	2025-02-12T05:13:55-08:00
A downed missile can explode on the ground - the Air Force has revealed the details of a night attac...	About this wrote on February 12 the head of the public relations service of the Air Force Command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, colonel Yuriy Ignat. -The anti-aircraft guided missile of the Patriot air defense system is capable of knocking down a ballistic missile only with a direct -head-on- collision. Due to the kinetic energy during the collision, the enemy missile either explodes or changes its trajectory and falls to the ground. We have no other way to hit ballistics! If the missile did not explode in the air, there remains a high probability of detonation of the warhead on the ground,- Yuriy Ignat said. He attached a video of the downed Iskander-M in Odesa to his post. According to him, there were similar cases in Kyiv (on Lukyanivka) and in other places. -The hit missile will no longer fly to the target where the enemy sent it, but it will definitely fall to the ground! On February 12, suddenly, at 4:30 in the morning, the enemy tried to destroy the objects of critical infrastructure in the capital, to deprive the residents of Kyiv of heat and electricity, to create a humanitarian disaster during the frost! The consequences could have been terrible...- assured Yuriy Ignat. According to him, the anti-aircraft missile division, headed by the Hero of Ukraine, was engaged in repelling the attack on the capital, and on whose account dozens of ballistic missiles were shot down in the sky of the capital. Yuriy Ignat dedicated his post to People's Deputy Maryana Bezuglii, who once again criticized the work of the Air Force and made a statement about the rocket explosion in Kyiv.

Two attacks on military personnel of the TCC and SP in a day: incidents in Kharkiv and in the Rivne ...	The first incident occurred in the Rivne region. During the verification of military registration documents, persons of mobilization age attacked servicemen of the TCC and SP, injuring them and damaging military equipment. The attackers fled from the scene of the crime and are being sought. This was notified in the Rivne Regional TCC and Joint Venture. The second incident happened in Kharkiv. On the territory of the regional TCC and SP, the attacker, using a gas canister and a knife, injured a serviceman of the Armed Forces. The assailant was detained, and the wounded soldier received the necessary medical assistance. This was reported in the Kharkiv Regional TCC and JV. Both incidents are united by the fact that they took place against the background of an information campaign aimed at discrediting the servicemen of the TCC and SP and the Defense Forces of Ukraine. The Kharkiv and Rivne regional TCCs and SP draw the public's attention to the fact that such crimes are a direct consequence of destructive activities aimed at undermining trust in the defenders of the country. Assaulting a military serviceman in the line of duty is a serious crime that requires a swift and objective investigation.

The first, but not the last: how the attack aircraft of the Defense Forces eliminated the general of...	He told about this in an interview on the -Defenders of Independence- channel, the official YouTube channel of the Main Communications Department of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. In the first weeks of the full-scale invasion, the Ukrainian military carried out a unique operation, during which an enemy convoy was destroyed along with an enemy general. -We carried out a frontal assault - literally went to the enemy's column. Without losses on our side, we took two prisoners - the general's bodyguards, and destroyed the entire column along with the general himself,- says Brigadier General. The operation took place in Zhytomyr Oblast. The Ukrainian military conducted reconnaissance, determined the location of the enemy and carried out a lightning raid. In just a few minutes they were out of the battle without any casualties, while the enemy suffered a devastating blow. -It was important for us. This was the first case of the destruction of an enemy general on the territory of Ukraine. After this operation, the morale of the personnel rose significantly,- Colonel Vasyl Matiyev admits. The colonel says that the war has evolved over the past two years. The Russian army began to actively use the tactics of small tactical groups, reducing the time of attacks to avoid being hit by FPV drones. -Now they can storm even with two soldiers, trying to break into the shelter as quickly as possible,- explains the commander. Not only the tactics of the enemy have changed, but also the methods of the Ukrainian military. The 5th Assault Brigade uses a multi-layered battlefield surveillance system, including drones that broadcast real-time data. This allows you to make decisions faster than the enemy. -I see the full picture of the battle before the battalion commander has time to report to me,- emphasizes Brig. Vasyl Matiyev also emphasized the danger of excessive dissemination of military tactics in social networks. An example is the use of incendiary munitions from FPV drones, a method that quickly spread online and was soon used by the enemy against Ukrainian defenders. -A free country also has its risks: the enemy learns from our mistakes,- he explains. The colonel emphasizes the importance of psychological training of personnel. -You can't immediately throw newcomers into difficult tasks. They have to experience the first success, and then the fire in their eyes will only grow,- he says. In his opinion, the motivation and morale of the soldiers is the key to victory. As reported by ArmyInform, drone operators of the 5th separate assault brigade of Kyiv turned another offensive of the invaders. in the spectacle fiasco in the Pokrovsky direction.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/12/pershyj-ale-ne-ostannij-yak-shturmovyky-syl-oborony-likviduvaly-generala-rf-na-pochatku-vtorgnennya/	2025-02-12T03:34:16-08:00

This is confirmed by the story of Denis from Chernivtsi on the pseudo -Dysant-, which shared by the DPSU. -He received his call sign for the initials of the Air Force in his passport.

Recalling his -baptism in combat-, Denys notes that it was then that he first encountered the loss of a brother. -We dragged him into the basement. They shot back and tried to provide help at the same time. The injury was severe. We did everything we could, but, unfortunately, he did not wait for the evacuation.

Bohdan Petrenko, the head of the communications department of the 48th separate artillery brigade, told about this on the Espresso broadcast. According to Petrenko, the enemy is coming in small infantry groups. Russians do not protect their people. In fact, the history of the Second World War is repeating itself, when the Soviet commanders simply pelted the enemy with the bodies of their soldiers - a kind of -collective Matrosov-. However, from time to time they still attack with highly guarded equipment. And these assaults look as strange as possible. -The -uber-weapon - the Wunderwaffe- is driving ahead. This is a tank, hung with all kinds of protective appendages. -Barbecue-, then -dreadlocks- are such chains that hang on the sides of this -barbecue-. Ahead is an anti-mine trawl, and what is interesting is that on top of the -barbecue- there is dynamic protection. But despite these -wunderwaffe-, none of these columns, and there were three of them, did not even reach the battle line&#8221; — said Bohdan Petrenko.

It didn't sit well - a pedestrian spy with a prison record was detained in Donetsk region	The Security Service of Ukraine reported this on February 12. The man corrected the aggressor's rocket-bomb and artillery strikes on the locations of the Defense Forces on the hottest direction of the front — Pokrovsky. The main targets of the enemy were the places of the greatest concentration of personnel and combat equipment of the Ukrainian troops. In order to get the coordinates for the fire attack, the FSB used its -sleeper agent-. He turned out to be a 39-year-old recidivist who had twice served a prison sentence for robbery. During his first -term- in the colony in the temporarily occupied Makiivka, he was recruited by an FSB personnel officer and transferred to -waiting mode-. After leaving prison, the agent left for the territory controlled by Ukraine and settled together with his roommate in the city of Bilozersk, Pokrovsky district. According to the case file, at the end of 2024, a Russian curator approached him remotely and instructed him to spy on the bases of the Defense Forces. To gather information, the traitor went around the frontline area, where he secretly observed the locations of Ukrainian troops. After such investigations, the person involved would return home to submit the intelligence report to the FSB through an anonymous chat in the messenger. Employees of the Security Service exposed the agent early and detained him at his place of residence. Simultaneously, comprehensive measures were carried out to secure the locations of the Defense Forces on the relevant front line. During the search, a mobile phone and special devices were found in the detainee's possession, which he used to communicate with the FSB. SBU investigators informed him of the suspicion under 2 Art. 111 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (treason committed under martial law). The perpetrator is in custody. He faces life imprisonment with confiscation of property.

-Shot, destroyed and forgot-: near Pokrovsk, our troops destroy the invaders from Stugna-P and Javel...	-Gimli- worked as a truck driver in Europe for 5 years before the large-scale invasion of the Russian Federation. On the first day of the great war, he was in France. When there were thousands of queues of people leaving Ukraine at the western borders, Serhiy, on the contrary, moved back to the Motherland. He is from the Chernihiv region, his wife, children and parents were waiting at home in Nizhyn. The Polish border guards were surprised and asked him: -Are you going to war?-. He answered that yes - to defend Ukraine. They shook his hand and wished him well. At first, Serhiy joined the local DFTG, then enlisted in the ZSU. -Ghimli- is a pro, has tremendous experience in destroying Russian equipment from various anti-tank missile systems of domestic and foreign production at different areas of the front. -Ukrainian Stugna-P ATGMs are part of the unit's armament, and calculations of American Javelin complexes from other units of the Armed Forces have also been seconded to us. The -Stugna-P- complex is a real pride and one of the important achievements of domestic production. Developed and manufactured by Kyiv Design Bureau -Luch-. The complex has a guided anti-tank missile guidance system based on a laser beam, which is carried out in a semi-automatic mode from a closed firing position with the help of a remote control that is carried by a cable at a distance of 50 to 100 meters. Some variants of this complex are equipped with a thermal sight for working on targets at night. ATGM can fire missiles with different warheads: tandem cumulative or high-explosive fragmentation and hit tanks or other armored vehicles and fortifications at a maximum distance of 5 km. Remote installation control is one of the key advantages of Stugny-P over other similar anti-tank systems. This is primarily the preservation of personnel, which is very relevant at the moment, given the intensity of hostilities. How we work: we are assigned a territory, relatively speaking, a square where there are tank-dangerous lines, where the enemy can go to bring in and land his infantry. We take off with Mavik, scout the area and determine the plus-minus point where the anti-aircraft missile position can be set up. Next, our scouts go out and on the spot determine at which specific point of the terrain it is advisable to deploy, from which there will be the best opportunity to destroy the enemy. Be sure to use -Nettle-, a map of the area with heights, whether there is direct visibility, and so on. A dugout is being equipped and only after careful measures to mask the position, we advance there with ATGM. Depending on the direction and actions of the enemy, we decide how many anti-personnel and cumulative missiles we will need at this position. We raise the -Mavik- again so that our pilots from the air can see whether the firing position and the camouflaged installation are visible. The -Stugna-P- installation can be located 100 m away from the calculation, which at the same time is in a shelter or in a dugout, and using the remote control method through the monitor, the guys can determine the distance to the target, and just in observation mode watch the battlefield, and, of course, shoot at a distance of up to 5 km. That is, hit from a safe distance, hit the target and forgot. Such are the obvious capabilities of our ATGM. For example, the calculation of the American Javelin complex makes a shot manually from firing positions and at a shorter distance, depending on the type of missiles. It can be 2, 3 or up to 4 km. Currently, there are three -Stugny-P- calculations and one -Javelin- calculation in constant combat mode. Ideally, what a combat job: one shot, one target. The capabilities of -Stugny-P- plus professional calculations are a formula for success, which gives many great results from hitting enemy combat vehicles. For example, in the Zaporozhye direction, at a distance of 4,800 meters, a Russian T-72 tank, which was moving at the same time, was destroyed with one shot. Or at a distance of 3 km, a racist BMP with occupants was destroyed. Their car came to take away the killed and wounded from the battlefield, the guys waited for the moment when 12 bodies were loaded onto the BMP and struck, the damage is one hundred percent, no one survives the rocket. In total, about 30 units of various enemy vehicles were destroyed in Zaporozhye. Now we are in Donetsk recently, so we are just shooting, as they say. The relief of the area completely does not allow to work. But we are already destroying the enemy. Just the other day, our calculations from the Javelin destroyed two BMPs of the Russian Federation from a distance of 2 km. Enemy combat vehicles tried to break through to the rear of our infantry and land a landing party. The situation developed very dynamically. It was only three or four minutes for two damage to the enemy. The guys were sitting at a good height, there was good visibility. One car was completely destroyed, the other was hit and stopped. Then the FPV drones took up the work, which until the end dismantled this BMP and the Russian attack aircraft that ran out of the burning car. Our unit is specially strengthened with calculations of FPV drones, which work in the interests of anti-tank calculations -Stugny-P- and -Javelin-. Another interesting story. In the last week, the Russians have tried to break through our positions on the front line 4 times. And all 4 attempts fail for them. These were columns with equipment. A tank with a minesweeper was ahead, followed by 3-4 BMPs and another tank. So, the first tank with a trawl destroyed the Javelin anti-tank calculation from the neighboring unit, it was most convenient for them to hit it. Then the total destruction of this mechanized convoy began. Everything flew there: artillery shells, drops from drones, tanks joined. Moreover, not only the units of the 117th brigade, but also the artillery of the neighbors hit the occupiers. Destroyed everything! &nbsp; All our calculations have undergone professional training in the operation and combat use of -Stugna- and received educational certificates. The guys are professionals, motivated to beat the enemy, quick learners, mastering new ways and methods of destroying the enemy. What is interesting, in addition to the main work of destroying enemy equipment and fortifications, our calculations, together with air reconnaissance units, adjust artillery fire against small enemy assault groups and Russian equipment advancing in the Pokrovsky direction. Again, the calculation at a safe distance from the complex in a specially prepared shelter remotely monitors the designated area of ​​hostilities. In the radio communication mode, artillery unit strikes are being adjusted. These things about the interaction of brigade weapons significantly affect the success of the process of destroying the enemy. Somehow in the Zaporizhzhia direction, we captured the Katsap anti-tank missile -Kornet- and missiles for it. Interestingly, we even destroyed a Russian tank later with this complex. The disadvantage of this anti-tank installation is that the settlement is directly next to it, and this greatly increases the chances of being spotted, for example, by the Mavik UAV from the air. Our calculation, on the contrary, is at a distance of 100 meters from the camouflaged -Stugna-P-, that is, in cover and in safety, it strikes the enemy's equipment. We value our people, unlike the Russians. -Cornet- also works on the principle, like -Javelin-, -see and hit-. But the installation is heavy, it is difficult for two people to carry it. -Thigh- is also heavy, but it is more adapted to defensive actions. Like any ATGM calculation, we are tied to height and line of sight. The range of use of the -Cornet- is the same as that of the Ukrainian installation. Another minus is that it has poor optics, there is a Soviet sight, while the Stugny-P, on the contrary, has modern optics with a zoom that allows you to change the picture scale three times. Even if there is thick fog for 3-4 km, some signatures will be visible. And you won't be able to do this on a Russian ATGM, you just have to look at the sight. -Kornet- is actually a Soviet type of anti-tank weapon, so of course our ATGM is much better. The enemy is trying to improve its combat capabilities, but so far I have not come across a modernized version of the Rashist ATGM. Enemy anti-tank calculations are always a fat target for us. As we are for the enemy. Russians, because of their stupidity or because of something else, it is not clear, make mistakes. And that's good. I remember a case: a Rashist ATGM calculation fired three or four shots from one and the same place. Then there was a thick fog and our guys just saw by flashes, even the signatures were not visible, that it was an enemy calculation. They waited until the occupiers fired one of the shots. And as soon as their missile went off, we fired our shot and that was it, the damage was done - the enemy calculation was destroyed. After that, the enemy is already afraid to deploy their ATGMs near the contact line. This, in turn, allows our tanks to strike at the enemy with direct fire in the zone of responsibility of our unit. If the enemy does not use armored vehicles in the area of ​​hostilities, we conduct surveillance and identify the locations of enemy FPV drones, reconnaissance and attack UAVs. It is an effective weapon in the fight against dandruff. The missile has a thermal homing warhead, so the operator of the missile complex does not have to follow and correct the flight of the missile after launch while it approaches the target. That is, if you fixed the target, fired a shot, then you do not need to prove this missile, it hits the target automatically, simply by aiming. If there is direct visibility, you can work at a distance of 4 km. The big advantage is mobility, it is a portable installation, not as bulky as the stationary Stugna-P ATGM. One Javelin complex weighs only 22 kg. And, of course, the question of the price of missiles. If the Ukrainian rocket costs about 20,000 dollars, then the American one - at least 175 thousand. dollars But if you look at the price of, for example, a destroyed Russian tank, then the cost of even American missiles does not seem so high. But the Javelin installation has some peculiarities in terms of hitting targets. For example, if the first target, let's say, is hit and a second target is spinning near it, then the missile will again fly into, relatively speaking, a burning BMP, which gives off more heat, even though the aiming device is already fixed on this second target. Everything depends on the successful actions of the calculation, which already has similar experience. That is, you have to wait for the second target to move a little further, or move forward, or, on the contrary, roll back, and only then shoot. This is the -principle of heat transfer- in -Javelin-. You have to have a desire. You can learn absolutely everything. Our unit consists mainly of volunteers who came from the very beginning of the large-scale invasion and are not professional soldiers. That is, they did not have the concept of green in anti-tank complexes. A lot still depends on the professional training in the Training Centers. But the main thing is to constantly learn and develop. Now the preparation lasts a month. I will say from my own experience: if a person is motivated and wants to learn, ten days will be enough for him to study. I still studied on a shortened course - two weeks. You yourself understand that due to the cost of the Stugna-P missile and the limited number of these missiles, we did not have training shots during training. Worked at training complexes. Therefore, the first combat shots were already on the front line. Of course, there are some issues with this setup. When you see that the enemy column is moving towards our infantry, you forget absolutely everything, the adrenaline kicks in and you work on automaticity. You gain more and more experience with each subsequent shot at the grids.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/12/vystrilyv-znyshhyv-i-zabuv-pid-pokrovskom-nashi-nyshhat-okupantiv-zi-stugny-p-ta-dzhaveliniv/	2025-02-11T21:05:43-08:00
-Poles- and -Czechs- are repaired along -Shustrom-: who -fixes- the tanks of the 117th brigade	During his military service in 2008, Oleksandr became a mechanic-driver of the T-64 tank, the then main battle tank of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Then he worked in his native Khmelnytskyi region as a forest feller and believed that a military specialty would no longer be needed in peaceful life. During the anti-terrorist operation, the serviceman recalls, he was called to the military commissariat four times, but each time everything ended with a verification of credentials and a warning to be ready to appear at the next call. A large-scale invasion changed everything, when Shustroy's knowledge and skills made him one of the most experienced tankmen in the 117th separate heavy mechanized brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. — When we came to Poland for training, the Poles showed us their PT-91 Twardy tanks and said that we would go to the training ground. I then asked if it was possible to -take a ride- - drive the tank by yourself. Only, I say, show how to launch, because the -sixty-four- has a different launch system. The Poles were surprised, but they allowed us - three of us from the entire battalion immediately sat down like that and drove off, - Oleksandr recalls. However, Shustrom did not have to use the privilege of driving for a long time - already after several trips, the Polish instructors recognized the high level of qualification of the Ukrainian tanker driver and ordered to hand over the driving of the armored vehicle to less experienced comrades. - I haven't been there for a long time, maybe I've been riding for a week - and I was told that it's enough, let those who know worse drive. That's why I went to the test site as a passenger for another month, - the tanker driver smiles. -Shustriya- remembers training in Poland with gratitude, noting the extremely friendly and at the same time demanding attitude of the instructors, well-thought-out living arrangements and good financial support for the cadets. - They taught us very well - everything was explained, chewed up. Everything was explained very clearly. The main thing was not to be ashamed to ask - everything you need will be shown, everything you are interested in will be analyzed. And together with you, everything will be collected and disassembled, and then they will be allowed to sort through everything themselves, says Oleksandr. The tank driver practically did not feel a language barrier when communicating with the instructors, because he had previously visited and worked in Poland for some time. Not needing an interpreter, he not only had more opportunities to study personally, but also helped his fellow students in this. Thanks to good basic knowledge, diligence and the help of instructors until the end of training, Oleksandr mastered PT-91 Twardy -excellently-. This allowed him to become responsible for the technical condition of armored vehicles in the tank company. Since the Twardy -Poles- are in many respects identical to the T-72, on the basis of which the Czech modernization of the T-72 Avenger was also created, -Shutriy- eventually became a universal specialist in the repair of the entire tank fleet. Now, under his leadership, a team of high-class specialists is working, capable of carrying out technical maintenance of all tanks of the company in field conditions. — Now I am considered to be the senior among the driver mechanics, I am responsible for all the cars so that they are in good working order, on the move. I sit down with the boys, go where necessary, organize and help. Is it for the evacuation of equipment that has been knocked down or is broken there. I make sure that the drivers do their work correctly, maintain the equipment, -Shustriy- explains his tasks. The tanker is convinced that a fully functional machine that will work flawlessly on the battlefield is the key to the completion of the combat mission and the survival of the crew. After all, if even a small thing in the tank does not work like clockwork, it can have irreparable consequences. Oleksandr praises PT-91 Twardy and T-72 Avenger, although he notes that, in his opinion, there are no fundamental differences from the basic T-72 model. However, he admits that the more powerful engine, fire control system and sights of modernized armored vehicles are important on the battlefield because they increase their combat capabilities. — The running gear is all the same. This T-64 is very different from them, and they are not really different from T-72. If you learned on the T-72, you can relearn on them very quickly - if you wish, -Shustriy- assures. So, when necessary, Oleksandr himself takes the seat of a mechanic-driver and can lead any tank of the company even for repairs, even for changing positions, even for battle. The senior mechvod, jokes -Shustriy-, is like a universal soldier - he must be -on you- both with equipment and with personnel. — If someone doesn't know something, doesn't know how, I have to show, explain, teach. It is necessary to do it together so that the guys in the process understand how it is done and then they can repair, sort through, fix it themselves, - explains Oleksandr. He is convinced that the main thing in the war is brotherhood, mutual understanding and mutual assistance in the team. After all, a well-coordinated team is able to perform the most difficult tasks precisely by insuring each other and offering a shoulder of friendly support. — Help the boys, show, do. And for everyone to be together. Unfortunately, we have losses. Very good guys are no longer with us. But this is a war, you can't do anything about it. We need to get together and hold on, do our work, because otherwise, nothing will be solved without us. If we don't do it ourselves, it won't get better or easier, the tanker explains his position. Fighting is hard, losing comrades is even harder. However, it is much worse to be defeated, because then nothing can be fixed, because the conditions will be dictated by the enemy and you will have to follow his whims. Therefore, the Shustriya tanker is convinced that he is now in his place - exactly where he should be at this time - among his brothers in tank company 117 of the separate heavy mechanized brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/12/polyakiv-i-chehiv-remontuyut-po-shustromu-hto-fiksyt-tanky-117-brygady/	2025-02-11T20:40:52-08:00
Availability and mass: the well-known American manufacturer of drones will master the production of ...	This company is well known in the world arms market as a manufacturer of reconnaissance and attack drones, such as MQ-9 Reaper and MQ-1C Gray Eagle, which ArmyInform talked about in detail in its materials, did not previously specialize in the creation of air-to-surface missiles. As the authors of the defense portal The War Zone (TWZ) told, the latest charge was presented at the annual Surface Navy Association symposium, which testifies to the growing need of Armed US forces in available and mass-produced air-based munitions. TWZ writers who visited the General Atomics (GA) booth firsthand pointed out that the company's website mentions past experience in the development of surface-to-surface and surface-to-air munitions, including low-cost and modular munition designs. Its Aeronautical Systems division also has extensive experience with drones. In general, as TWZ noted, the line between unmanned aerial systems, especially long-range kamikaze drones, and cruise missiles, as well as decoy UAVs carrying electronic warfare payloads, is becoming increasingly blurred. A single modular design can also be configured to perform different sets of missions. The fact that GA had not even chosen a name for it at the time of the presentation of the idea for a new charge can speak of the urgency and speed of implementation of this project. At the exhibition stand at the Surface Navy Association, the missile was given the tentative name Strike Missile, which in the Ukrainian version can be translated as -Strike Missile-. TWZ analysts noted that, according to the sketches, the newest charge has a compact and modular flat design. Its distinctive features include: At the moment, the size and technical characteristics of the rocket remain unknown. However, a representative of the General Atomics company noted in a comment to reporters that the project is at the development stage, and the name of the missile may be changed. TWZ believes that the new missile is also likely to be no exception to the trend towards an increasingly blurred line between drones, cruise missiles and air defense systems. What's more, the Strike Missile could be a cost-effective solution that the US military has long needed. And the creation of mass-produced and inexpensive air-launched munitions is driven by necessity: Analysts also noted that the presence of such weapons in the portfolio of General Atomics means that they can be offered directly in conjunction with its proposals for unmanned aircraft and other unmanned systems. -The shock missile can fit both in the internal compartments and under the wings of other drones, including the one that General Atomics is developing as part of the Air Force Collaborative Combat Aircraft program (CCA),- TWZ experts concluded.

-Biolaboratories-, -troll factories- and something else: what propagandists are trying to accuse USA...	In fact, the US Agency for International Development (USAID) financed Ukrainian mass media quite differently. Some grants, indeed, amounted to 100% of the budget, some - 40-60%, some even less. After all, the media in Ukraine receive support not only from USAID, but also from the European Union, the United Nations, other countries, foundations and organizations. Therefore, the propagandists' statements that practically all mass media in Ukraine -remained on the verge of bankruptcy- after the newly elected US President Donald Trump suspended all grants from USAID for 90 days are not true. But the fakers did not stop at these -throw-ins- and published several portions of their favorite nonsense about -troll factories- and -biolaboratories-. So, pro-Russian sources spread a fake video with the Bloomberg logo on the network, in which it is claimed that USAID -lost control over biolaboratories in Ukraine, although it invested $20 billion in their creation and development.- In fact, it is no longer a secret to anyone that under the pretext of the presence of so-called -biolaboratories- on the territory of Ukraine, which are allegedly engaged in the development of biological weapons, the Russian Federation has been continuing a large-scale disinformation campaign for years, aimed both at discrediting Ukraine and the United States, and at whitewashing its own crimes. Accusing the US Agency for International Development of financing so-called -troll factories-, the Russians shared a screenshot from the USAID website, which allegedly proves the financing of -students from Eastern Europe writing Russophobic comments on the Internet.- Allegedly, almost 500 thousand dollars were allocated for this. However, USAID did not actually fund any -troll factories-. The funds were directed to the implementation of the SURE program - Students for a United and Resilient Europe (-Students for a United and Resilient Europe-). As part of the program, students from 16 Eastern European universities conducted research and implemented campaigns aimed at countering propaganda that sows discord between refugees and local communities. As is known, it is Russian propaganda that actively uses the so-called -botfarms- to manipulate public opinion and spread disinformation. Thousands of automated or human-operated accounts flood social media with fake news, comments and fake likes, creating the illusion of mass support for pro-Russian narratives. But the avalanche of fakes, misinformation and manipulations regarding USAID did not end there. In the X social network, for example, a fake spread that the Agency sponsored the arrival of Hollywood stars to Ukraine during the war&#8230; -The worst thing is that the Russians are trying to use X against US interests. It is the same as if the Tomahawks were flying not at America's enemies, but at America itself. And for this, the Russians will have to be punished,- said the head of the CSDP of the NSDC, Lieutenant Andriy Kovalenko.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/12/biolaboratoriyi-fabryky-troliv-i-shhe-deshho-v-chomu-propagandysty-namagayutsya-zvynuvatyty-usaid/	2025-02-11T20:08:01-08:00
Life and death in the same hands: how combat medic -Sam- set a record for the destruction of armored...	The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. Before the war, Sam had no medical education, but when he was offered to become a combat medic, he accepted without hesitation. He passed the school of combat medics, attended numerous courses with foreign instructors and obtained a certificate. -I have never regretted my choice,- he admits. But his mission at the front is not limited to saving lives. -Sam- is also an anti-tank gunner. And although he helps his wounded brothers every day, the destroyed occupiers are on his account even more. His first combat operation took place on May 12. Together with his partner, he was on duty all night, waiting for the assault. At four o'clock in the morning, the enemy forces launched an attack with two MTLBs. The first was destroyed from the Javelin, the second the next day. Later, -Sam- was sent to another position, where he worked at a height. On May 22, a large convoy - seven units of equipment - went to Spirne. As a result of the battle, they knocked out one tank and three -motorcycles-. These successful strikes made -Sam- the unit's record holder for the number of vehicles destroyed. -I don't turn up my nose, we are all equal. After a successful job, the boys were praised, everyone was happy. Everyone does their own thing here,- he notes modestly. But war is not just about hitting shots. Sam clearly remembers the moment an 82 mm mine hit their position. One comrade died instantly, and he stabilized the other and handed over for evacuation. Today, that fighter is back in action. -I have a great team: the guys are cheerful, positive, will always support me and will not leave me in trouble. I am very happy to serve here,- says Sam. His story is an example of dedication, resilience and true love for his country. He not only saves lives, but also does everything to prevent the enemy from advancing further. As reported by ArmyInform, a fighter of the Defense Forces Major Dmytro Polonchak under the pseudonym -Coyote- knows well how to disrupt -hunting- an enemy sniper, turning him into prey, and willingly shares his experience.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/11/zhyttya-i-smert-v-odnyh-rukah-yak-bojovyj-medyk-sem-vstanovyv-rekord-iz-znyshhennya-bronetehniky/	2025-02-11T11:58:19-08:00
Desperadoes from the Air Force: how -Pazl- and his comrades defended Krynka	The story of the fighter was made public on the page of the Eastern Air Command. After the decision to join the Armed Forces in 2022, -Pazl- got into the anti-aircraft missile regiment, but when the need arose to strengthen the infantry units, he did not think twice. Arriving at the position, -Puzzle- immediately went to work. Not paying attention to the skeptical attitude of the marines, he and his brothers began to train intensively under the guidance of experienced fighters. They practiced anchoring on the shore, maneuvering on the river and battle tactics. -Puzzle- often sailed for evacuation. When the soldiers came under enemy fire, he did not hesitate to gather an evacuation group, get into a boat and, under fire from mines, he sailed after his men. According to Puzzle, the marines quickly changed their opinion of them and started calling them desperate warriors. He told several heroic stories about his fellow Air Force men. One of the exceptional stories was the feat of the -Deputy-. Together with a group of six fighters, he took up positions in Krynk, holding the defense for six days without communication. At a critical moment, the -Deputy- crossed two rivers under enemy fire, reached the headquarters, transmitted the coordinates and returned the same way with the necessary equipment. Or the story of -Kuzi- - a 46-year-old soldier who, after undergoing combat training, together with his comrades destroyed two enemy armored personnel carriers, leaving no chance for the Russian landing party. Eight months of fighting in the Kherson region, endless risks, saving brothers and incredible endurance - this is what is behind the stories of these soldiers. And -Pazl- has no doubts: he is proud of each of them, because it is such people who are creating a new history of Ukraine. As reported by ArmyInform, a serviceman of the 11th brigade named after Mykhailo Hrushevskyi of the National Guard of Ukraine, nicknamed Melman, originally from Dnipro region, began his military service in the ranks in December 2021. 11 brigade named after M. Hrushevskyi NSU, and in two months, Russia launched a full-scale invasion.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/11/vidchajduhy-z-povitryanyh-syl-yak-pazl-ta-jogo-pobratymy-boronyly-krynky/	2025-02-11T11:43:42-08:00
Left without wheels: how drones of the Defense Forces turned an enemy armored personnel carrier into...	The video of combat work was made public on the brigade's page. The video shows how the calculation of the FPV drone skilfully adjusts the flight of the UAV, pointing it precisely at the enemy armored personnel carrier that was trying to escape from our pilots. The result did not take long - after a good hit, the car burst into flames. -And the enemy did not hesitate to provide our pilots with their APC to improve accuracy and efficiency. The knight warriors performed the practical task perfectly. It was burning brightly,- the brigade said in a statement. As reported by ArmyInform, the Ukrainian military continues to mercilessly destroy the enemy at the front. In the Pokrovsk region, the fighters of the 32nd separate mechanized brigade showed how UMBRELLA BBS pilots work without days off , delivering precise strikes on positions around the clock invaders.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/11/zalyshylys-bez-kolis-yak-dronari-syl-oborony-peretvoryly-vorozhyj-btr-na-kupu-bruhtu/	2025-02-11T11:23:47-08:00
Masquerading as a man, fake certificates and illegal routes: 4 schemes for evaders have been elimina...	informs about this on February 11. For bribes from 3 to 20 thousand US dollars, they issued fake documents to the evaders or transported them across the border bypassing checkpoints. Thus, in Kyiv, a citizen of the Russian Federation who organized the escape channel of conscripts to the European Union as drivers of international flights was arrested -in the heat of the moment-. -For the purpose of the conspiracy, the person involved acted under the guise of a man - cut her hair short, wore men's clothes and introduced herself under a fictitious name. -According to the investigation, before committing this crime, the Russian woman had previously been held criminally responsible for kidnapping and fraud,- the SBU said. Also in Lviv Oblast, a 32-year-old local resident was suspected of offering potential conscripts to flee across the border -bypassing- checkpoints. The attacker assured his clients that his accomplice would meet them outside of Ukraine, who would help the evaders to -legalize- in EU countries. In addition, a local resident was detained in the Poltava region, who decided to make money by -trading- fake medical certificates on disability. The suspect used personal connections among doctors to forge documents. In Ternopil, the military counterintelligence of the SBU detained a local businessman who, with the help of accomplices in the TCC, -wrote off- evaders from the military register based on their health status. -According to all the facts, the persons involved were notified of the suspicion in accordance with the committed crimes under Part 3 of Article 15, part 3 of Art. 332 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (illegal smuggling of persons across the state border and attempt to commit this crime). Perpetrators face up to 9 years in prison with confiscation of property,- the report says. ArmyInform reminds that it is better not to break the law or risk your life, but to use the aggregator of vacancies in the Armed Forces and recruiting centers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/11/maskuvannya-pid-cholovika-falshyvi-dovidky-j-nelegalni-marshruty-likvidovano-4-shemy-dlya-uhylyantiv/	2025-02-11T11:09:31-08:00

The caption to the video reads: -There are no easy days on the front lines. One of the units of the 153rd OMBr, holding positions on the hottest part of the front, repelled the enemy's attack and prevented a breakthrough.- The footage shows how, thanks to aerial reconnaissance, an enemy column was detected moving in the direction of the positions of the Ukrainian defenders. After that, an artillery attack was made on the enemy column, as a result of which the enemy suffered losses and fled into the bushes. However, the story did not end there. Aerial reconnaissance drones continued to monitor the area and found all the hiding places where the occupiers tried to hide. After that, they were subjected to mortar fire, which forced the enemy to finally retreat. As reported by ArmyInform, the drones of the 153rd mechanized brigade could not destroy the enemy tank shed, but forced the crew to leave it.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/11/ochi-v-nebi-grim-na-zemli-yak-bijczi-syl-oborony-rozgromyly-vorozhu-kolonu-ta-vidbyly-shturm/	2025-02-11T10:54:19-08:00

-Sumoshedsha- — a former Ukrainian athlete was convicted as a traitor	This was announced on February 11 by the Prosecutor General's Office. The convict is a former Ukrainian athlete and multiple European and world champion in sumo, who began competing in the Russian national team in 2016. Prosecutors proved in court that in 2023 the convict founded and led a volunteer movement in Crimea. She held numerous fundraisers for the purchase of diesel generators, walkie-talkies, thermal imagers and other resources for Russian military personnel who were fighting against Ukraine, in particular in the city of Bakhmut. At the same time, the -volunteer- distributed information and reports on fundraising in the Telegram channel and on personal pages in social networks. The convict repeatedly appeared in propaganda media, broadcasting pro-Russian narratives in the information space of Crimea.

He said that this week and next week, Ukraine will talk with partners about greater capabilities of Ukrainian air defense. In addition, according to him, Ukraine will be able to complete the construction of two more power units at the Khmelnytskyi nuclear power plant. -This is more than 2 gigawatts of electricity for Ukraine. And to be clear, now, during these difficult winter months, we can import approximately this amount of electricity to Ukraine from our neighbors. Our completed power units will enable Ukraine to go without imports even in the winter months,- assured Volodymyr Zelenskyi. According to him, this will help curb the rise in electricity prices for people. -And even regarding special economic projects with our partners - with the United States, with President Trump - regarding Ukraine's special resources, mining and processing, Ukraine will now be able to speak more confidently, having an additional and significant source of electricity in the future,- added the President. He noted that industrial growth and the development of any economy should be based in the modern world on the development of energy sources. -Already ready to meet with representatives of the United States - talks will be held in the near future. On many levels. And I scheduled a meeting of the National Security Council for tomorrow. We will make medicines cheaper in Ukrainian pharmacies - this is important. And we will continue to protect our state with sanctions,- he summarized.

Mastery Multiplied by Caliber: Knight Harmaches exhibit the highest class of artillery	The video of combat work was made public on the brigade's page. The video released by the military shows how the enemy occupiers tried to hide among the ruins of the city. But the experience and impeccable accuracy of the Ukrainian gunners left them with only one prospect - to quickly leave the -air-. While FPV drones and new technologies are actively changing the nature of modern warfare, artillery remains a formidable force that has proven itself irreplaceable. It is not only about the power of the caliber, but also about the skill of the warriors, who know how to cancel the enemy's intentions with one well-aimed blow. -First of all, it's beautiful,- comments the military, urging you to watch the video until the end. And indeed, the finale of this wrestling episode is definitely worth watching.

Special officer -Georgian-: how a teacher became a master of mortar fire	The story of the fighter was made public on the page of the 8th Special Purpose Regiment of the SSO named after Prince Izyaslav Mstislavich. With the beginning of a full-scale invasion, -Georgian- immediately decided: his place was in the army. The choice of the unit became obvious for him thanks to the instructor who gave him important knowledge during the training. It was he who advised the 8th SSO regiment, and the fighter did not regret his decision. He chose his nickname -Georgian- not by chance: his father is a Georgian who moved to Ukraine in 1985 because of love. The family is closely connected with the struggle for freedom, because during the war in Georgia, relatives of -Georgians- also fought, and some gave their lives for it. The fighter himself considers the war for Ukraine to be a war for Georgia at the same time - because we have a common enemy. The work of a mortar gunner requires perfect calculations. From the moment of receiving the coordinates to the first shot, usually 2 to 5 minutes pass. The accuracy of shots depends on the knowledge of mathematics, geography and geometry - disciplines in which the -Georgian- understands not only as a soldier, but also as a teacher by profession. Among the most effective operations of the fighter was the destruction of the enemy column near Chasov Yar. Together with their comrades, they hit 30 infantrymen under the cover of tanks and -Grads-, forcing the enemy to retreat. For -Georgyn-, the biggest motivation is his three children. He raises them in a patriotic spirit, teaching the history of Ukraine and Georgia so that the next generation does not repeat the mistakes of the past. On the front lines, the fighter has his own talismans: a bracelet from his wife, given to him on SSO Day, and the image of Vikings and Cossacks, which he embodies in his hairstyle and earring. -Georgian- and his comrades continue their struggle, forcing the enemy to pay for every meter of Ukrainian land every time. And he is sure: victory is only a matter of time. As reported by ArmyInform, a serviceman of the 11th Brigade named after Mykhailo Hrushevskyi of the National Guard of Ukraine, nicknamed Melman, originally from Dnipropetrovsk region, in December 2021 year began his term service in the ranks of the 11th brigade named after M. Hrushevskyi NSU, and in two months, Russia launched a full-scale invasion.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/11/speczpryznachenecz-gruzyn-yak-vchytel-stav-majstrom-minometnogo-vognyu/	2025-02-11T09:23:00-08:00

Paladin on the guard of Ukraine: how the guns of the Defense Forces destroy the enemy with American ...	The video of the combat operation of the calculation was published on the brigade's page. -With the appearance of the 155-millimeter howitzer M109 Paladin, our Cossacks have become much more confident, because the American machine allows you to work faster and more accurately, and also expands the range of possibilities: different projectiles perform different functions - damage, mining, illumination,- the brigade said in a statement. The video shows how Ukrainian gunners skillfully aim the howitzer at the target and fire. According to the soldiers of the calculation, with the receipt of 155-mm equipment, the amount of ammunition increased significantly, and the accuracy of fire improved. The firing range of an active-reactive projectile reaches almost 30 kilometers, and the working distance for artillery is about 22 kilometers. -Since a digital guidance and fire control system is installed here, the plus 155 caliber has a wider functionality for projectiles. There are remote mines, there are cluster munitions, there are ordinary high-explosive fragmentation, active-reactive, smoke, lighting and so on,- the fighters say. One of the gunners who was trained on the Paladin in Germany notes the speed and convenience of the machine, as well as its superiority over the 2C3 -Acacia- in terms of loading and aiming speed. -We try so that nothing breaks, we support, fill, lubricate so that it works at full speed,- the fighters add. According to them, they often observe the result of their work from a drone with almost no delay, which brings satisfaction from accurate hits and destroying the enemy. -At this moment, the enemy conducts aerial reconnaissance more actively, uses barrage ammunition -Lancet-, -Privet-82-. It also actively uses FPVs, which have already begun to fly to the firing positions of the artillery,- the fighters note. Despite the threat of enemy shelling, Ukrainian artillerymen continue to perform their work, because they are motivated by the protection of their land and their families. -I am from Kharkiv region, I have four children. And so that they don't reach us, my family, the family motivates,- says one of the fighters. As reported by ArmyInform, in the Kharkiv direction in the Lyptsi-Hlyboke front line zone, the movement of infantry remains stable. and also the movements of enemy equipment are not recorded.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/11/paladin-na-varti-ukrayiny-yak-garmashi-syl-oborony-troshhat-voroga-amerykanskoyu-sau/	2025-02-11T08:52:32-08:00

Marker -self-other-: The Ministry of Defense is strengthening cooperation with the language ombudsma...	This was reported by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine on February 11. Serhiy Melnyk said that the state should promote the comprehensive spread of the Ukrainian language in the interpersonal communication of military personnel. According to him, Ukrainian is used 100% in the defense system at the official level, but in informal communication defenders sometimes use Russian words. -This, in particular, is a consequence of more than three hundred years of Russification of the country. We are fully aware of the importance of the Ukrainian language not only in terms of observing the language law, but also in everyday communication. The Ukrainian language in the Armed Forces remains one of the main factors of unity and identification,- noted Serhii Melnyk. Taras Kremin emphasized that in the conditions of the Russian-Ukrainian war, the state language became a key marker of -own-alien-, allowing to quickly identify the enemy and destroy him. He emphasized that in order to strengthen national priorities, strengthen unity and struggle, it is important to strictly adhere to the current legislation, use the state language, and demonstrate an example of respect for the defining factor and main feature of the nation's identity. -Having an extensive network of educational institutions, language courses, state and local language programs, all of us, overcoming the consequences of the colonizers' assimilation policy, strengthen the power of the Ukrainian word, thereby ensuring the full functioning of the state language in all spheres of social life and strengthening the unity of our Ukraine,- Taras Kremin emphasized. Currently, the Ministry of Defense is an organizer and an active participant in a number of measures to implement the state language policy in the Armed Forces. In particular, this is work on normative and legal acts on cultural and language issues, support for measures to spread and popularize the Ukrainian language, holding language competitions, including: As reported by ArmyInform, in all training centers that prepare mobilization personnel of the Armed Forces of Ukraine href=-https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/10/z-akczentom-na-psyhologichnu-stijkist-v-zsu-onovleno-programu-bzvp/->implementation of the fifth edition of the program of basic military training (BZVP) with an emphasis on psychological stability.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/11/marker-svij-chuzhyj-minoborony-posylyuye-spivpraczyu-z-movnym-ombudsmenom/	2025-02-11T08:24:15-08:00

How a smartphone can become a threat at the front: the Ground Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces r...	The Land Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine inform about this. A fighter's smartphone is one of the most vulnerable points in cyberspace. The enemy can use mobile devices to gather intelligence, track whereabouts, intercept conversations, and even influence military morale. Main Threats and Recommendations: Location Tracking: An enemy can determine the movement of military units by merging geolocation data. Recommendation: Turn off GPS and Bluetooth in a combat zone, avoid connecting to unknown Wi-Fi networks. The IMSI-catcher technique (fake base stations) allows the enemy to intercept calls and SMS. Unsecured messengers can become a source of leakage of confidential information. Recommendation: Use only secure communication channels, avoid personal conversations on the phone on the front line. Photos taken on a smartphone contain GPS coordinates, device model and other metadata. The enemy can track the location of units through this data. Recommendation: Turn off geolocation for the camera and delete metadata before publishing a photo. Fake emails and messages may contain malware. Through infected files, the enemy gains access to the devices. Recommendation: Do not open suspicious links or files from unknown senders. The enemy tracks military groups on social media, analyzing activity to gather information. Recommendation: Limit the use of social networks during service, avoid posts with geotags and personal information. In case of capture or loss of the device, all data can fall into the hands of the enemy. Recommendation: Use two-factor authentication and configure automatic data deletion in case of device loss. A soldier's smartphone is not just a means of communication, but a potential security risk to the entire unit. Best practice is to completely avoid the use of civilian devices in a war zone or to strictly follow cyber hygiene rules. Remember: following simple rules can save lives. As ArmiyaInform reported, the Land Forces were the best in the Defense Forces in implementing electronic reports submitted through the Army+ application in January.

Ukrainian -key- to -Lancet-: how paratroopers effectively counter enemy UAVs	The video of combat work was made public on the brigade's page. The defenders of Donbas already know well how to fight against enemy UAVs. From now on, the -Lancets- of the Russian occupiers do not just lose their effectiveness - they become the next downed targets for Ukrainian soldiers. -Our comrades from BPS (combat application of systems. - Ed.) do not just oppose enemy drones - they actively hunt them. The enemy's drones more and more often end their flight not where the operators wanted, but on Ukrainian soil - in the form of scrap,- the brigade reports. In addition to fighting Lancets, paratroopers continue to conduct active aerial reconnaissance and attack the enemy with FPV drones. Hitting the occupiers' positions, destroying enemy equipment and firing points became commonplace for them. The only thing that changes is the count of eliminated invaders. And it is steadily growing. As reported by ArmyInform, Russian invaders continue to suffer devastating losses from units of unmanned systems and air defense 46 separate airmobile brigade of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/11/ukrayinskyj-klyuchyk-do-lanczetayak-voyiny-desantnyky-efektyvno-protydiyut-vorozhym-bpla/	2025-02-11T07:32:02-08:00

They focused on building schools and hospitals. However, it is more likely that a total mortgage development is planned on the site of the real historical part,- the report says. It is noted that cultural and historical monuments, which were built at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century, can be destroyed in this way. The Mariupol City Council noted that during the three years of Russian occupation, the local pseudo-administration was hardly involved in the restoration of damaged buildings in the historical part of the city. As reported by ArmyInform, in the temporarily occupied Kherson Oblast, the Russians, in the best traditions of the Nazis, destroyed Ukrainian literature in the captured libraries.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/11/zamist-shkil-i-likaren-zhytlo-dlya-rosiyan-okupanty-planuyut-zrujnuvaty-istorychnyj-czentr-mariupolya/	2025-02-11T07:23:15-08:00
21 days on the brink of life and death: how -Student- took his fellow students out of the environmen...	The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. Mykhailo says that at first he received a summons, but then his armor was still active. After being called again, he decided to go to the Military Commissariat on his own. That's how he got to the rifle battalion, and already there he was entrusted with the duties of an orderly. -It was fate,- says the soldier. - In peaceful life, I was not a doctor, but the war changed everything. We were trained in Norway to save lives on the battlefield. There, we experienced firsthand what hypothermia is - we stood in icy water at minus five degrees to understand how to act in critical conditions.- When their unit got into position, they found themselves isolated, with no food, no ammunition, and no way to retreat. Russian troops mined the roads with -Petals-, and the enemy constantly attacked. However, there was nowhere to retreat. -The first two days it was difficult to realize that there was no going back. But no one broke down. Everyone listened to each other, understood that the assault was inevitable, and when it began, everyone gave a fight, even the wounded. No one ran, everyone did their job,- Mykhailo recalls. Twenty-one days in the trenches under constant fire is a test not only physically, but also psychologically. The 15th day became especially difficult, when some fighters began to be unable to withstand the pressure: -Here it was important to find words of support, to give people the opportunity to change their shift schedule in order to preserve their fighting spirit.- On the 21st day, a group of three fighters broke through to them - the rest died in minefields. That's when the order to leave came. However, the confusion with the coordinates almost cost them their lives - they went in the wrong direction, realizing the mistake already on the way: -I ordered everyone to turn back - and everyone turned back. No one objected, everyone knew that time was short, and acted in concert.- Later, their unit was evacuated. Despite the first combat experience, all survived, showed iron endurance and self-sacrifice. Mykhailo has no doubt that war changes everyone. But he believes that he survived for a reason: -If the war ends tomorrow, then I was needed for something bigger. And now the main thing is to survive and win.- As reported by ArmyInform, -It was hell- - this is how the fighters of the 58th Motorized Infantry Brigade with the call sign -Student- describe their three weeks on the front lines. Together with four brothers, he fell into a real trap where every day was a struggle for survival.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/11/21-den-na-mezhi-zhyttya-i-smerti-yak-student-vyviv-pobratymiv-iz-otochennya/	2025-02-11T07:03:08-08:00

Ivan Petrychak, a representative of the 24th separate mechanized brigade named after King Danylo, told about this on the air of the Yedyni Novyni telethon . According to him, each attack follows the same scenario. Enemy infantrymen rush out of armored vehicles and run around the basements. All these small groups of infantry have to be constantly searched and destroyed. -When we talk about small infantry groups, there may be a false impression that a whole brigade is fighting against three invaders. There are many such groups, and from time to time they try to drive in a large number of vehicles. Some are distracting, others are trying to enter the rear,- said Ivan Petrychak. He noted that this happens all the time. The enemy in the -non-stop- mode replenishes its units with new soldiers. There is no shortage of Russians willing to fight. As Petrychak says, the prisoners say that the main motivation is money. -They divide themselves into categories A and B. These are those who signed the contract and those who come from the colony - they have the motivation to remove the criminal case from themselves. And plus money. Because the money they are paid for signing a contract or entering the army is a large amount. And plus a salary of 210,000 rubles plus or minus,- said the representative of the 24th separate mechanized brigade named after King Danylo.

Don't be like Ivan: a resident of the Zaporizhzhia region forcibly mobilized by the Russian army is ...	In this video, the sixth prisoner in a row is from the Zaporizhzhia region. -(unintelligible)&#8230; Ivan Dmytrovych September 14, 2003. Zaporozhye region, Mykhailivskyi district, Mykhailivka village. Group of 34 -I don't remember any more-, - says the boy, who was captured by our paratroopers, about himself. Note that Ivan is only 21 years old. We are still debating whether to lower the conscription age from 25 to 21 or 18. And in the Russian occupation military committee, no one asked Ivan how old the conscript is - he is just 21 years old already on the battlefield, already fighting under the Russian flag and has already failed. Although - remained alive and that's good. And still, a significant number of our contributors in social networks continue to hate the military personnel of the TCC and SP. And positive posts about this topic are simply drowning in hundreds, thousands of reposted -news- from Russian bots. The material of our author about how he passed the VLK to sign a contract with the Armed Forces of Ukraine was subjected to hate by readers (real readers?). In his comments, the author was accused of lying, of living in a parallel reality. Almost the same thing is said in one post from Facebook contributors: -The TCC approached, asked to show documents and drive to the Military Commissariat. They checked what was on the record, gave them tea and sent them home. I didn't have time to call in the sleet.- I can tell you dozens more of these stories. &#8230;Why doesn't anyone say anything good?.. &#8230;Because you are more interested in reading something related to gyno..&#8230; &#8230;The word of mouth radio is still working, one story is told from mouth to ear through 10 people and from one story about 1 mobilized person becomes 10 mobilized boys who storm Donetsk from the Military Commissariat on the 3rd day with an AK-100 assault rifle. It's funny!-. Yes, it's funny. And it is difficult to hear the voices of the active military again in the noisy row of treasonous posts. Thus, on the air of -Public Radio-, the commander of the 3rd separate battalion -Brodyaga- as part of the 411th regiment of control of unmanned aviation complexes Ilya Mashina told-advised what Ukrainian men should do for a long time. And why: -I recommend to young and healthy men: get ready, now the third year is coming to an end, you could take at least basic training courses. Because the enemy will not stop at the borders of the Dnipropetrovsk region, and I know for sure that if you do not defend Ukraine and are not in the Armed Forces of Ukraine, then you will be in the Russian armed forces and storm Europe. And this shows in the practice of Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhya (regions - ed.)&#8230; where the enemy entered, now they (inhabitants of the temporarily occupied territories - ed.) serve there.- But will the Ukrainian men, who in 10 years have not found time to get to the TCC, hear the serviceman Ilya? Will they continue to sit quietly at home, afraid to leave the apartment and catch the eyes of their children and wife?	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/11/ne-bud-yak-ivan-prymusovo-mobilizovanyj-armiyeyu-rf-meshkanecz-zaporizkoyi-oblasti-vzhe-voyuye-proty-ukrayiny/	2025-02-11T01:57:48-08:00

According to the fighter himself, if the Ukrainian positions get hot because of the overwhelming enemy forces, he takes his sniper rifle to support his comrades. -We made a decision to -give at the drop of a hat-&#8230; If, for example, up to 10 people storm our position, if you overwhelm two, count on the fact that the remaining eight are already starting to run back and take their own. Their assault failed. Perfect,- Coyote explains. When Ukrainian defenders are threatened by a Russian sniper, Dmytro Polonchak also knows what to do. -Heard from the reports that they work on a spot basis. The sniper is working specifically, you have to do something with him. We took a long time to get to that sniper, we got there, the second number gave me his coordinates, where he was, which balcony, which floor, and I was already working directly on him,- the soldier recalls. But how this duel ended in the end, see in the video. As reported by ArmyInform, over the past week, the Defense Forces stopped more than 700 enemy attacks.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/11/dayemo-po-shapczi-boyecz-dpsu-kojot-podilyvsya-svoyim-dosvidom-polyuvannya-na-vorozhogo-snajpera/	2025-02-11T01:42:20-08:00
-Pilots offer large tank mines to the heads- — north of Kharkiv, drones are methodically destroying ...	Volodymyr Degtyarev, a representative of the public relations service of the -Charter- brigade, told about this on the Espresso broadcast. According to him, so far we are talking about a tactical initiative. The enemy has an advantage in artillery, so the Defense Forces have to compensate for this factor with the accuracy and training of drone pilots who destroy bunkers, generators, and generally destroy enemy logistics. -It can be said that our pilots of large drones were offering to the enemy. They offered, as usual, large tank mines that fall on heads. All in order to be as uncomfortable as possible now, when it is frosty and cold. And in order to reduce the main factor in this war - morale. And the ability to withstand all the difficulties that war entails,- Volodymyr Degtyarev noted. As ArmyInform reported, in the Novopavlov direction, the enemy has recently been trying to find weak spots in our defense. Attack mainly in small infantry groups. In addition, the weather makes it possible for both Ukrainian and enemy unmanned systems to work.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/11/piloty-proponuyut-velyki-tankovi-miny-na-golovy-na-pivnich-vid-harkova-dronari-metodychno-nyshhat-rosijsku-logistyku/	2025-02-11T01:27:22-08:00
Strikes on the territory of the aggressor — more than 3,500. long-range drones in six months	Commander of the Unmanned Systems Forces, Colonel Vadym Sukharevskyi, said this in an interview with Radio Liberty. More than 3,500 long-range strike UAVs were launched, which carried out strikes on critical military facilities of the Russian Federation, depriving the enemy of safe depth and reducing his ability to wage war. The SBS pays special attention to the operation of heavy bombers and FPV drones. -Only in the last two months, the operators of the 412th -NEMESIS- regiment destroyed more than 15 units of expensive air defense systems of the -Buk- and -Tor- type. And the fighters of the 413th battalion -RAID- of the SBS hit an enemy tank with an FPV drone at a depth of more than 34 kilometers, which was another confirmation of the rapid development of technologies on the battlefield,- said the message of the SBS of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. As reported by ArmiyaInform, in recent weeks, various departments have codified more than 14 manufacturers of fiber-optic drones with general parameters from 10 up to 15 kilometers with coils of various types.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/11/udary-po-terytoriyi-agresora-ponad-35-tys-dalekobijnyh-droniv-za-piv-roku/	2025-02-11T01:12:34-08:00

The leftovers are smoked at night — near Pokrovsk, a wave of infantry attacks in cars	Serhii Tsehotskyi, an officer of the 59th separate mechanized brigade named after Yakov Handziuk, told about this on the air of -Suspilne Novosti-. According to him, shelling is almost 24 hours a day. In the dark part of the day, there are fewer assaults. For the most part, the Defense Forces are finishing off what is left of the enemy's daytime assaults. They try to smoke out the underdogs from their hiding places at night, not to leave even a few people near our positions. -A large number of occupiers is negated. Equipment, mainly passenger cars, is also destroyed as quickly as possible. For them, it is a one-way street. They drove to the positions in passenger cars, disembarked, and then the task was to escape back. They rarely succeed in this,- said Serhii Tsehotskyi. As ArmyInform reported, a video appeared on social networks with a Russian invader that was hit by a drone of the Defense Forces in Toretsk and died right under the Ukrainian flag.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/11/nedobytkiv-vykuryuyut-vnochi-bilya-pokrovska-hvyli-atak-pihoty-na-legkovykah/	2025-02-11T00:32:52-08:00
They turned guns into -pipes- - destruction of enemy artillery	The video of the combat work was published on February 11 on the detachment's channel. Inspired by the example of the Magyar Birds, the Phoenix pilots destroyed the guns by burning holes in their barrels. After this, the gun can no longer shoot, it has to change the barrel, and this part is very scarce. Consequently, the capabilities of Russian artillery in the Kharkiv region were reduced. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the -Phoenix- detachment destroyed a lot of Russian armored vehicles. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/11/peretvoryly-garmaty-na-sopilky-znyshhennya-vorozhoyi-artyleriyi/	2025-02-11T00:22:01-08:00

Bohdan Petrenko, the head of the communications department of the 48th separate artillery brigade, told about this on the air of -Social News-. According to him, the weather in general now plays one of the decisive roles in the course of hostilities. So, for example, the soils in the brigade's area of ​​responsibility are mainly black soil, and when warming occurs, passage for any equipment becomes much more difficult. Sometimes the Ukrainian weather actually kills the occupiers. -For example, there was a case when the Russians attacked. It was snowing in the morning, they put on white masks. But by a certain hour the snow had melted. And their white maschalats were kind of white spots on a gray background. This assault was stopped,- Bohdan Petrenko noted. As reported ArmyInform, fighters of the unmanned systems battalion 110 of the mechanized brigade named after Corporal General Mark Bezruchka tracked down in advance the assault group of the occupiers. The invaders launched an attack without the cover of equipment that the Russian command guards.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/11/mashalaty-buly-bilymy-plyamamy-na-siromu-foni-na-novopavlivskomu-napryamku-okupantiv-vbyvaye-navit-pogoda/	2025-02-11T00:11:34-08:00

A real revolution in the field of drones: an expert on the unique Ukrainian experience, the newest W...	Military expert Petro Chernyk answered these questions. -In fact, we, Ukrainians, have now carried out a coup in two parts. Part one: the use of FPV drones. The level of skill of various types, both quadcopters and on the wing (UAV type - ed.) has reached so high that aiming takes place - at the head, even at the knee of the enemy. One very serious example for 2024. In the dry weather cycle from conventional May to conventional September, we destroyed more than 4,500 units of enemy artillery. If you divide by 72 - this is how the full-time trunk brigade is completed - then it is more than 60 brigades. This is a fantastic thing, incredible. If, conditionally, until the middle of 2023, the bulk of damage to equipment was done with the help of artillery, then starting from the middle of 2023 - especially for the past year, when the indicators of the production and use of drones by us, Ukrainians, increased 10 times - then 50% of the destruction of all equipment, and sometimes and up to 80% in individual locations of personnel destruction is FPV drones. We are the first, I emphasize, in the world to use these unmanned systems on such a large scale. We are the first in the world to have systems of unmanned complexes starting from the mouth. We have no doubt that we will be the first in the world to form a separate brigade of unmanned systems, because we already have a separate command, as a separate type of the Armed Forces. This is the first revolution that Ukrainians really wrote on their own battlefield in the eternal Russian-Ukrainian war. But there is one more nuance that we somehow ignored, it is no less important. It was with the help of naval drones — the beautiful Magura-5 and C Baby — that we managed to expel the regular Russian fleet, which was considered one of the best in the Black Sea, from their bases in Sevastopol. What is the conclusion? The state, which did not have a classic fleet, solved this problem (regular Russian fleet in the Black Sea - ed.) precisely thanks to unmanned systems. And this is an unprecedented phenomenon in the history of naval warfare. So, let's summarize. Indeed, the phenomenon called -unmanned systems of various types of purpose- is being actualized on our battlefields. It should also be mentioned here that there are not only air and sea, but also ground robotic complexes. In fact, a revolution of a serious global order is taking place. It will determine the logic of hostilities for several decades to come. But there is a nuance. You can't look at these systems as if they were some new Wunderwaffe, which is, they say, everything - now only drones. Artillery will still have meaning and significance. And still the main fire shafts with a powerful coefficient of action, because after all, 3-5 kg ​​of explosives are not equal to a heavy 50-kilogram projectile - will remain in the war as a phenomenon. Not to mention aviation. As Winston Churchill once said, aviation is the cavalry of modern times. Indeed, the sixth generation of aviation is being developed in a binary sense: that there will be both a pilot and an aircraft with an unmanned system based on machine learning. But drones will not fully replace the main strike capabilities of artillery and aviation. Therefore, it is necessary to carefully approach the part that they (UAVs - ed.), they say, have no alternative. This is a serious high-quality weapon that needs to be developed, but we also remember about other weapons systems.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/11/spravzhnya-revolyucziya-u-czaryni-droniv-ekspert-pro-unikalnyj-ukrayinskyj-dosvid-novitnyu-wunderwaffe-ta-4-tysyachi-vorozhyh-stvoliv/	2025-02-10T21:06:08-08:00

During the day, in the interests of the Russian Federation, passage through the Kerch Strait was carried out: -the Russian Federation continues to violate the International Convention on the Protection of Life at Sea of ​​1974. (SOLAS), turning off automatic identification systems,- the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine noted. As reported by ArmiyaInform, the Commander of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine discussed the security situation in the Black Sea with the Commander-in-Chief of the Swedish Armed Forces.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/11/okupanty-vyvely-u-chorne-more-raketonosij-z-kalibramy/	2025-02-10T21:04:22-08:00
-Innovator- at the front: what the modern Ukrainian armored car is capable of. Report from Donetsk r...	The brigade notes: -Novator- combat vehicles demonstrate good combat capabilities when performing tasks on the front line. -Now, without armored vehicles, it is almost impossible to deliver infantrymen to the front line, transport food or ammunition, and evacuate the wounded. Armor protection, speed and passability on country roads and hard-to-reach areas are especially valuable in cars,- says the driver of -Novator- Kostyantyn. A boy from the Kirovohrad region, mobilized in the Armed Forces since the beginning of the large-scale invasion. Served in the 69th Rifle Battalion, then joined the 117th Brigade. -We work mainly at night and in the morning. Cars in gray weather or even better in fog are not too visible to the enemy, so they are effective for us. Quickly deliver people, weapons and BC to the positions, and just as quickly left the front line. That's it - the task is accomplished,- says Konstantin. The cabin can accommodate 5 military personnel together with the driver. In the rear part, the landing compartment is quite large, designed for 8 people, but 10 soldiers in full equipment and with equipment can fit in there. Plus the transportation of BC, the car can even fit the Stugna-P ATGM, which is a large stationary installation, along with missiles. -The armored car is completely Ukrainian-made, has a basic Ford chassis, has a diesel engine, and an automatic transmission. The maximum speed on the highway is 140 km/h, a very maneuverable car. It can overcome a small swampy area and softened fields, of course, the speed is not the same as on the highway, but it is quite decent. On a normal road, it rips from under itself, but you need to be careful on turns, reduce speed, it can skid. If FPV drones attack, there is a much better chance of running away from them. The armored capsule can withstand shrapnel damage, hits from large-caliber machine guns, and even detonations from anti-tank mines. Fortunately, the boys have not yet had to fall on mines. Infrared lighting is installed for driving at night. By itself, the car is equipped with a EW to counter enemy UAVs and a communication system. Also, the car is equipped with NATO-style anti-mine seats and a fire extinguishing system. Each wheel of the -Innovator- is additionally equipped with rubber that works on the principle of a cushion. If the wheel is punctured by fragments, this cushion allows the car to continue moving without stopping. The 117th brigade received Roshel Senator armored vehicles from Canada as part of international military-technical assistance. These vehicles are also used by infantry and other front-line units. -I traveled on both Rochely and Novatori. I can already compare. The main advantage of the Ukrainian car is its chassis. Springs were installed at the back, so the -Novator- -catches potholes- much more gently. And -Rochelle- has springs, so it is thrown a lot on a bad road. The guys who go in the landing gear are not very comfortable. But instead, more people get into the Canadian armored car. The obvious disadvantage of the Canadian is the high center of mass located at the back, and if you drive carelessly and make a sharp turn, you can turn over on its side. Plus, the car likes to get stuck, it's hard for her, after all, our swampy roads are given. The armor protection of the -Rochelle- is generally sufficient, allowing it to withstand fragments from projectiles, even 122 mm caliber.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/11/novator-na-fronti-na-shho-zdatnyj-suchasnyj-ukrayinskyj-bronovyk-reportazh-z-donechchyny/	2025-02-10T20:45:56-08:00
Achieving Defense Autonomy: Turkey Moves to Mass Production of New Short-Range Air Defense Complex	As informed the authors of the Turkish Defense Agency portal, this system was completely developed in-house to raise Turkey's air defense capabilities to a new level, ArmyInform reports. Haluk Gjorgun, Minister of Defense Industry (SSB), shared the news on social networks, emphasizing the exceptional accuracy of the system in intercepting targets at a sufficiently long distance and at a considerable height. -The results demonstrated the technological maturity of HİSAR-O and the efficiency of Turkey's manufacturing processes. ASELSAN and ROKETSAN, in cooperation with local subcontractors, play a central role in the supply of competitive defense systems,- the Turkish official emphasized. HİSAR-O is a short-range air defense system designed to counter a wide range of threats, including aircraft, helicopters, drones, cruise missiles and air-to-surface munitions. It has a range of 25 km and can intercept targets at an altitude of more than 15 km using missiles equipped with radar and infrared (IIR) guidance. Its equipment includes a fire control center, a radar, three missile launchers, an optical-electronic system, a transport and handling unit. This modular architecture, combined with the ability to engage 360° targets using vertical launchers, provides operational flexibility. According to the analysts of the Dutch portal defense technology research Army Recognition (AR), the system includes advanced technologies such as mid-course navigation through data channels and remote control using wired or wireless communication. It is compatible with Link 1,11B and 16, tactical data lines, working within the framework of an open architecture that allows the integration of future technologies. Integrated testing and simulation systems provide efficient maintenance and high operational readiness, meeting the requirements of modern air defense scenarios. A systematic approach was followed in the development process of HİSAR-O. After the design and qualification tests, the prototypes undergo acceptance tests. The certification of the production line and the stages of pilot production ensure the compatibility of the project with the requirements of large-scale production. These rigorous processes reduce risk and ensure budgets and deadlines are met. In addition, batch testing during production ensures consistent quality and includes on-site feedback for potential adjustments. Compared to systems such as the American Patriot or the Russian S-400, HİSAR-O offers an intermediate solution. With a range of 25 km, it has a shorter radius than the Patriot (160 km) or the S-400 (400 km), but provides excellent mobility thanks to its integration on the chassis of a Mercedes-Benz 6×6 truck. This mobility, according to the experts of the AR portal, combined with simpler logistical support makes the Turkish air defense complex well suited for the tactical and operational needs of the Turkish Armed Forces, in contrast to the more complex requirements for the deployment of the S-400 complex purchased by it from Russia at the time. The transition to mass production of the HİSAR-O demonstrates Turkey's ability to independently design and manufacture advanced defense systems. By strengthening the strategic capabilities of the Turkish Armed Forces while reducing dependence on foreign suppliers, HİSAR-O makes a significant contribution to the country's defense autonomy. This achievement also highlights the growing competitiveness of Turkey's defense industry on the world stage. Testing of the HİSAR-O air defense complex.

What did a shooter with the call sign -Luga- receive -Golden Cross-: about training, fart, friendshi...	-Skillfully commanded the actions of the assault group, due to which the enemy suffered significant losses in manpower and equipment-, - this is how the actions are described, for which the serviceman of the 142nd separate mechanized brigade Vyacheslav with the call sign -Luga- received the Commander-in-Chief's award - -Golden Cross-. It is difficult for Vyacheslav to remember the details of the battle. What for military statistics is success on the ground comes at a price. Then three of his comrades died: -Let me say this - we simply defended our position, giving our comrades the opportunity to gain a foothold and further destroy the enemy. There were two attempts to take our position. We beat them back. That was the task. I just did my job. And how it feels from the inside, I don't want to talk about it. The guys who died are Heroes: Shaman, Olshava, Gypsy.- While working with the second group, Vyacheslav was injured. When he was brought to the evacuation center, it was unexpected for him that he was congratulated and praised. Then he learned about the award. When asked how motivating this is, he jokes that he would be happy to receive motivation in the form of a monetary equivalent: -Not for myself, of course. You understand, we lose all the time. Sometimes to repair cars, then we need to buy some equipment,- and adds: -Of course, awards for soldiers are important—it's attention, because they see you and your work.- &nbsp; Vyacheslav spent most of his life working in the restaurant business in various positions: from waiter to service manager. He had no combat experience before mobilization, but he felt what war was while still a civilian. The man was born in Luhansk, then moved to Kharkiv Oblast. In 2022, he met the large-scale phase of the war in Kupyansk. Recalls how the Russians taught the local population to call the occupation -liberation-. -Whoever spoke to them -incorrectly- was explained by force. They could be stopped and beaten in the middle of the street. They did not care about people's affection, they had enough fear. At the same time, it was clearly visible that there is no unity among the Russians. They are angry at each other. There was a vested interest in making money from the war. When they fled, they abandoned their own - wounded, drunk. Those who could not get into the trucks were simply thrown at checkpoints. People then wrapped such drunkards with scotch tape and handed them over to our military,- Vyacheslav recalls. Joined the Defense Forces in July 2023. At first he was a cook. But due to the lack of people, he ended up in the infantry. Now he is a shooter with the call sign -Luga- (in memory of his hometown - ed.). -BZVP was held in part. The instructors all had combat experience and were indifferent to their work. For the fact that I managed to persevere in difficult moments, I am now grateful, including to them. Many say that in such a war, luck determines a large percentage. To me, the concept of a fart is like a cat's life. Someone has 9 of them, and someone has only one. But if you are not prepared, no fart will help you. Preparation, attention, concentration are the real keys to accomplishing the task and coming back alive,- Vyacheslav believes. Vyacheslav studied in the Czech Republic for another month, although, he laughs, at that stage Ukrainians could already teach foreign colleagues something. -They didn't expect the way we -navigated- them at practice. They were surprised. It's nice when professional soldiers are beaten by yesterday's civilians. So we have the spirit and flair.- Vyacheslav talks about the need for psychological work with fighters. He himself would not hesitate to contact a specialist. But in parts of psychologists who actually work by specialty, there are few, and during rehabilitation - how lucky. The fighter himself says that when he was treated after his injury, communication with a psychologist was -for a tick- - a standard test survey. Meanwhile, tension levels are high and trigger situations abound. -I was on examination in Dnipro. I was going to the train station in a tram. And the conductor spoke to me, at first it seemed as if everything was normal, a person worried that the front was approaching. And suddenly he says: -we would have already surrendered the city and everything.- So that people are not afraid of destruction.- And I ask her: -What do you think would happen to the military personnel who are here in hospitals and hospitals?- Do you understand that they would be killed?-. And she says: -I didn't think about it-.. You can still find this kind of thinking in people.- Vyacheslav laughs, if he has to deal with psychological problems himself, then the way is simple - to occupy himself with something. For the opportunity to go for a walk and just look around. Call loved ones. He perfectly understands that, like most of his brothers, he postpones painful reflection - dwelling on grief and loss for later. All together, they save themselves with humor and mutual support. -I was lucky to experience true brotherhood. Of course, civil collectives happened to be different. They were also quite friendly. But people there did not become close to each other so quickly and so much, as here. During a year and a half of service, I saw interaction, mutual understanding. Disputes are resolved much more calmly than in ordinary life. What brings people together the most? I will tell you this: after the first exit to zero, the question of whether someone -sent- someone does not arise. But friendship in war has a painful side, and that is losses.- Vyacheslav replaced the struggle with fears in his mind with the philosophical -must, then must-: -It's scary until you enter the battle, then there are no thoughts. Focused on the task of survival for you and those with you. Covers after a few days of silence and awareness. You understand where you came from. Every exit is different. But once you've experienced this delayed fear, it's a normal, healthy feeling that you don't want that experience to happen again. That is, you have to overcome this, not fear. Pick yourself up and go again.- Vyacheslav dreams of returning to civilian life and opening his own bakery. And while he ponders philosophical questions about how to stand when those who are like dogs have been pitted against you for years, and a large part of your society is just learning to make complex adult decisions. In his opinion, the issue of psychological readiness is critical: -Psychological preparation is needed. Appropriate selection is required and physical and professional skills are secondary. Because no matter how diligent a person is on the range, if he drops his weapon when he has to cover his comrades, it can turn into a tragedy. There are people who cannot psychologically cross a certain barrier. And they won't be able to. My personal position is that there is only one harm from a hare sitting under a bush. I've seen them. Most of them are already -two hundred-. They cannot shoot at the enemy, even when they are being shot at. When moving around the landing, it is a burden that falls into a stupor, runs away, hides, screams. And we can't throw them away. What is the point of this to the state? Some costs, I will say harshly. The selection must be realistic. You can still deal with -I don't want to join the army, let my neighbor go,- but not with stupor. The shooter should shoot at a person, not at a target on the shooting range. As an enemy do not name - this is the same person on two legs with two hands. We see the enemy very close. Any indecision is your death or the death of your brothers.- When asked whether he thinks he has become a fatalist, Vyacheslav answers with a smile: -If you are destined to die by choking on a spoonful of soup, you will not drown in a puddle. If I was destined to die from the reset, then so be it. For me, to be afraid is simply to waste vital energy and time for no apparent reason. To clarify the relationship with oneself. You have to live here and now. In actions and deeds. Such times fell to us. Kyiv was already taken in three days, and they received a cap at a time. So, we can -take it easy- more. And we will be-.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/11/za-shho-otrymav-zolotyj-hrest-strilecz-z-pozyvnym-luga-pro-pidgotovku-fart-druzhbu-na-vijni-ta-mriyu-pro-pekarnyu/	2025-02-10T20:10:59-08:00

An article about this was apparently published by a German publication. But the source referred to by the propagandists does not have any real evidence of such an event, including official registers, contracts or public data that would confirm it. Furthermore, the material has neither the posting date nor the author, which is a typical sign of disinformation. In addition, the site, which is used as the primary source of news, does not contain any contacts, and the specified names appearing on it are fictitious. Similar fakes are regularly distributed by the enemy with the aim of discrediting and demonizing the President of Ukraine and his family. Yes, in October of last year, a fake was actively spreading on the Internet that Volodymyr Zelensky allegedly bought Hitler's state car for 15 million dollars. In November, enemy propaganda tried to convince its consumers that the President of Ukraine allegedly bought the Palace Des Neiges hotel in the ski resort of Courchevel in France for 88 million euros. And in January, the enemy spread a fake about the alleged purchase by the President of a -villa with an underground bunker- for 17 million euros on the -island of billionaires- Saint Barthelemy.

It is noted that a 36-year-old resident of Lviv Oblast undertook to prepare a package of documents and further escort through one of the checkpoints in Lviv Oblast for a citizen of Ukraine of conscription age for $1,500. -The woman promised the client that she would help remove him from the military register and secure an invitation for employment in Germany,- the report said. During the searches, law enforcement officers seized mobile phones, bank cards, as well as other things that can be used as evidence in criminal proceedings. -Currently, the person involved in the case has been notified of suspicion for h. 3 Art. 332 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (Illegal transportation of persons across the state border). The sanction of the article provides for punishment in the form of deprivation of liberty for a period of seven to nine years. Other persons who may be involved in this scheme are being identified,- the DPSU said.

A Russian propagandist who called on the enemy to turn Sumy into a -dead zone- was sentenced	The SBU informs about this on February 10. According to the investigation, in June 2023, Mikheev called on the command of the occupation groups of the Russian Federation to carry out a series of massive rocket-bomb and artillery strikes on Sumy. -In this way, the attacker proposed to turn the frontline Ukrainian city into a -dead zone- in which, according to him, -no living people should remain.- Mikheev, who positions himself as a -political scientist-, made this thesis public during one of his broadcasts on the Kremlin's mouthpiece, Vesti FM, the SBU said. In addition, he regularly appears on Solovyov's propaganda talk shows, where he calls for the continuation of airstrikes and shelling of civilian infrastructure in the border areas of Ukraine. On the basis of the collected evidence, the court found Mikheev guilty of committing a crime under Art. 2 Art. 110 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (encroachment on the territorial integrity and inviolability of Ukraine) and sentenced him to 8 years of imprisonment. -Since the perpetrator is hiding in Russia, comprehensive measures are underway to bring him to responsibility for crimes against our state,- the message reads. As reported by ArmyInform, an enemy agent was detained in Donetsk who was correcting Russian airstrikes on Kramatorsk.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/10/zasudzheno-moskovskogo-propagandysta-yakyj-zaklykav-rosiyan-peretvoryty-sumshhynu-na-mertvu-zonu/	2025-02-10T11:21:07-08:00

This symbolic step is of great importance for the Ukrainian people, because it demonstrates the indomitable spirit and desire for victory. The return of the Ukrainian flag to the -Centralna- mine is another step towards the liberation of the entire territory of Ukraine from the Russian occupiers. The -Centralna- mine is a historical symbol of Donbas, its age reaches more than 150 years. Placing a blue-yellow flag over it means that Ukraine is returning to its land, that the history of the struggle for freedom continues, and that victory will be ours. As reported by ArmyInform, at the age of 59, most men enjoy a well-deserved rest, spend time with their family or engage in their favorite activities.

Volodymyr Zelenskyi: Ukraine is strengthening security guarantees and preparing for important intern...	This is reported on the website of the official online representation of the President of Ukraine. The next week will be important for Ukraine in the field of international security. As early as Wednesday, negotiations with allies will start - both in the format of the Contact Group on Defense of Ukraine -Ramstein- and during meetings in Kyiv. On the agenda is the strengthening of military support, the expansion of arms supplies and the strengthening of the Ukrainian army. A key event will be Ukraine's participation in the Munich Security Conference, one of the world's main platforms for discussing security issues. Volodymyr Zelenskyi emphasized that Ukraine is working on consolidating international support, increasing sanctions pressure on Russia and obtaining additional resources for defense. -It is important for all of us to work together for the sake of real peace and effective security guarantees - the safety of people, the safety of our state, the safety of economic relations and our resource sustainability,- the president emphasized. Along with security issues, Ukraine continues to receive financial support from international partners. The President reported on the meeting with the head of the European Investment Bank, as a result of which the allocation of another 2 billion dollars was agreed upon. The funds will be used to restore the energy infrastructure, implement housing programs and support critical projects. Separately, the head of state emphasized the need to lower the prices of medicines. He held a meeting with the participation of the Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Svyridenko and Minister of Health Viktor Lyashko, during which they discussed ways to solve this problem. In the near future, the NSDC will make specific decisions aimed at regulating the price policy in the interests of Ukrainians. The President emphasized that peace is not just the cessation of hostilities, but the building of a reliable system of international security guarantees. Ukraine, together with its partners, continues to work on the creation of long-term protection mechanisms that will strengthen the security of the country and the entire free world. As reported by ArmyInform, the Baltic states - Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia - officially completed the process of disconnection from the Russian energy system, synchronizing their networks with continental Europe. This is a historic event not only for the region, but also for the whole of Europe, which further strengthens energy independence from Moscow.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/10/volodymyr-zelenskyj-ukrayina-posylyuye-bezpekovi-garantiyi-ta-gotuyetsya-do-vazhlyvyh-mizhnarodnyh-peregovoriv/	2025-02-10T10:14:48-08:00
Under fire and with a flashlight: how a combat medic - Historian - saved his comrades	The story of the soldier was made public on the page of the Land Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. One of the first combat forays into the trenches was most remembered by the Historian. Then the position was attacked by an enemy drone, and the fighter received a shrapnel wound almost under the armpit. The historian had to perform an operation to remove the fragment. Everything happened at night, under fire, in a cold dugout, by the light of a lantern. The medic, working on adrenaline, managed: the fighter survived and is already back in action. The historian joined the army in 2023. In the 141st OMBr, he underwent training, combat coordination and, without hesitation, decided to become a combat medic. It was his own decision - not just to be in the line, but to save lives at ground zero. Under fire, in cold dugouts and in firing positions, he is the first to come to the rescue: he pulls the wounded out of the fire, stops the bleeding, and brings his comrades back to life. Before the full-scale war, the soldier studied at the history faculty, worked as a guide, and was fascinated by the past. But when it was time to act, he chose the path of a defender. Now he himself has become part of a great story. As reported by ArmyInform, a soldier with the call sign -Fox-, platoon chief sergeant of the 128th separate of the Transcarpathian Mountain Assault Brigade, shared his thoughts about the war, comrades and dodgers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/10/pid-obstrilamy-ta-z-lihtarem-yak-bojovyj-medyk-istoryk-vryatuvav-pobratyma/	2025-02-10T10:02:02-08:00

This figure is impressive in its scale and demonstrates the titanic efforts that Ukrainian defenders make every day to contain the enemy. 741 attacks in a week is more than 100 attacks every day, each of which could have been decisive. Oleksandr Syrskyi thanked every Ukrainian soldier for their professional combat work, emphasizing their courage and dedication to the defense of the Motherland. -The fight continues!

The special forces hit the Russian Nona-S and more than a dozen occupants	The video of combat operation was published on the SSO channel. In particular, the FPV calculation of the SSO unit in several sorties destroyed the enemy self-propelled gun -Nona-S-, a D-20 howitzer, two mortar firing positions with ammunition, two communication repeaters of the occupiers and four vehicles used by the Russian military.

-Water is a luxury-: 220,000 people were left without water at the TOT of Luhansk Oblast due to the ...	This was reported by the head of the Luhansk OVA, Artem Lysogor. Last week, Russian security forces detained the head of the Severodonetsk occupation administration, accusing him of forming a criminal group behind the murders of 11 people, kidnappings, extortion and embezzlement. However, as it turned out, he did not manage to collect enough money to escape - and the Russians decided to -deal with- another traitor. According to reports from the occupied territories, the other day he allegedly attempted suicide in a pre-trial detention center. If this information is true, it is further confirmation that the Kremlin uses collaborators for its own purposes, and then ruthlessly disposes of them when they become inconvenient. While the occupiers are dealing with their own oppressors, the residents of the temporarily captured cities of Luhansk region are once again on the verge of a humanitarian disaster. Due to the accident on the power lines, the pumping stations that supplied water to Khrustalny, Anthracite, Bryanka, Almaznaya, Petrovo-Krasnosillia and 40% of Kadiivka were cut off. As a result, more than 220,000 people were left without drinking water. The most interesting thing is that this region has not experienced hostilities or shelling - the whole problem is that during more than 10 years of occupation, Russia has not even tried to maintain critical infrastructure. Pipes, stations, power grids are deteriorating due to the complete inaction of the occupation authorities. Problems that could have been prevented with routine repairs are now becoming a real disaster for local residents. As reported by ArmyInform, the Russians continue to implement their best corruption traditions in the temporarily occupied territories of Luhansk region. Now they have officially legalized the robbery of housing, handing over -ownerless- property, and at the same time for ten years they -forget- to pay debts to state employees.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/10/voda-cze-rozkish-na-tot-luganshhyny-220-tysyach-lyudej-zalyshylysya-bez-vody-cherez-bajduzhist-okupantiv/	2025-02-10T09:23:46-08:00
Blowing up the Kakhovskaya HPP: military ecologists received training on collecting evidence of the ...	The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine informs about this. In particular, specialists of the Center of Excellence for Mine Action and Environmental Safety took samples of environmental components. For this, they used equipment received from international partners. The experts of the Center shared the knowledge gained during the training with representatives of the State Environmental Inspection of the Southern District (Zaporizhia and Kherson regions). -The training took place within the framework of the activities of the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) in Ukraine. The organization was supported by the Belgian Nicole Foundation and the NGO -Institute of Public Policy and Consulting-, the report says. As a reminder, on June 6, 2023, the Russian occupying forces committed one of the largest environmental crimes of the 21st century — we blew up the dam of Kakhovskaya HPP. As a result of its destruction, more than 75,000 hectares of land were flooded. The devastating flood caused the destruction of the habitats of many species of animals and plants, pollution and littering of large areas. A lot of pollutants, harmful substances, oil products got into the soil. As a result of the flood, thousands of mines and explosive objects were washed away and ended up under the soil layer.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/10/pidryv-kahovskoyi-ges-vijskovi-ekology-projshly-navchannya-zi-zboru-dokaziv-zlochynu-armiyi-rf/	2025-02-10T09:04:53-08:00

She studied at Normal School No. 14, and then entered a medical college. But the plans for a peaceful life were destroyed by the war. In 2022, she decided to become a combat medic and set out to save the lives of Ukrainian defenders. -My weekdays are, of course, specific. If there are teams - I do the work.

It is a constant movement and a responsibility,- says -Chantal-. As a doctor, she is faced with extremely difficult situations. It is often necessary to quickly make decisions on which the lives of soldiers depend. -I don't just provide first aid. If there is even the slightest complaint, the guys can contact me at any time. I contact the commanders, organize transportation. Apart from that, there is a lot of paperwork, but for me it is more important to work with my hands, to help people directly,- she explains. Before becoming a soldier, -Chantal- was actively involved in volunteer activities. And even now, despite the service, she continues to help. -I collected funds for frontline aid, supported the de-occupied territories, and now I also donate to charity initiatives. -I recently helped the Ark shelter in Odessa, which collects funds for laboratory equipment to save animals,- she says. Despite all the hardships of the war, -Chantal- finds solace in creativity. She paints pictures, writes books and even organized her own exhibition, the money from which she gave to charity. -Drawing and writing books is my way of dealing with stress. My dream is to create an art therapy center for military personnel and their families. This is important, because art helps to recover not only physically, but also emotionally,- she shares. Currently, -Chantal- is fully committed to the service, but is thinking about what will happen next. She dreams of returning to Odessa, doing art and continuing to help those in need. -I hope that the war will end already this year. In the meantime, I'm doing everything in my power to make that day come as soon as possible,- she concludes.

-One against three-: the border guard -Lysyy- single-handedly cleared the position of the occupiers ...	The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. Yuriy, like many other Ukrainians, went to war -for the company- with a godfather who received a summons. However, this decision was not spontaneous. According to -Bald-, he always felt responsible for his country and was ready to defend it. Yuriy's first combat missions fell on the eve of Easter. At a time when the whole country was celebrating, he and his brothers held the defense on the battlefield. -Our first event in Bahmut was the night before Easter. People celebrated Passover, and we, together with our brothers, performed a combat mission. Then everything happened quickly. It was very hot around, we were being fired upon. I remember how on the go I jumped into Roshel and tore my back,- the soldier recalls. Despite the injury, Yuriy did not stay behind. -They didn't take me, I went to the doctors, got a few shots in the back and asked for a position with another group. My brothers clearly did not expect to see me there, they were surprised. But it was on this day that I agreed,- says -Bald-. During one of the combat missions, Yuri single-handedly cleared the position occupied by the occupiers. -All the young guys were with me, I didn't want them to take any risks and I went alone. He threw two grenades through the door, three from above through the hole. Three occupiers were eliminated, one remained. He was wounded, I heard him squeak. I asked my brothers to bring more BC, and I shouted to him to surrender, because I would throw a grenade. He came out with his hands raised,- the border guard recalls. During the search of the prisoner, Yuriy discovered that he was well equipped and had narcotic substances with him. According to the prisoner, all Russian soldiers received such -stimulants-. After the battles in Bakhmut, Yuriy realized that the Ukrainian military does not need artificial stimulants, because they are motivated by nature to protect their land and their families. -After Bakhmut, Yuriy understood one simple truth: Ukrainians, unlike Russians, do not need any stimulation, because we are naturally motivated to protect our family and our home,- the message reads. Yuriy is currently serving in the Vovchansk region as a machine gunner in the crew of the Roshel armored car. He is convinced that the Motherland must be defended until the last breath, until the last occupier on our land. As ArmiyaInform reported, Vasyl Ilyus, a fighter of the -Hart- brigade with the call sign -Faithful-, received five bullet wounds during fierce battles for Bakhmut.

Valentyn has considerable life experience: military service in the Airborne Forces, liquidation of the consequences of the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, career in law enforcement, the rank of lieutenant colonel. On the eve of a full-scale invasion, he sensed that a great storm was coming. -I had a persistent feeling that something bad was about to begin.

On one of the combat sorties in the Toretsk direction, his intuition saved his life again. -Enemy artillery worked on our positions. I felt that I had to go to the fellow -Agronomist-. Just a few minutes after I left my position, a mine hit there,- Valentin says. This was his third injury, and probably his most severe. The doctors wanted to write him off, but the fighter did not give up - managed to return to the formation. Despite his age and battle wounds, -Kupol- does not think about rest. For him, the most important thing is to be close to his brothers, to fight for Ukraine. -I could be fishing at home right now, but I can't leave my boys. We are one family.

In Kyiv, the prospect of Russia's disintegration was discussed at the Banderiv readings	The participants of the event discussed the history and prospects of the struggle of the peoples enslaved by Russia for their independence. Banderiv readings were held in Kyiv for the twelfth time, they were started during the Revolution of Dignity. For the second year in a row, researchers have been developing and justifying scenarios of the disintegration of the Russian Federation in their reports and during panel discussions. This time, representatives of peoples enslaved by Moscow, who have been fighting for their freedom and independence for many years, have long since become dissidents and are persecuted by Putin's regime, have been involved. The participants of the readings are convinced: only the disintegration of the Russian Federation into dozens of independent states will be a real Victory and the final point in the Russian-Ukrainian war. Recently, more and more military personnel, scientists, and politicians in the world are inclined to this opinion. Recently, during a meeting with students, the ambassador of Ukraine to Great Britain, General Valery Zaluzhny, spoke about this: -Our victory is the collapse of Russia into 27, and preferably 69 principalities, before taking away nuclear weapons from it...-. Each people, nation, on whose land the Moscow occupier came, made a desperate, sometimes more than a century, resistance to the empire. And Moscow, unfortunately, systematically destroyed the disobedient, encouraged traitors, and rewrote history. Only the current Russian-Ukrainian war has opened up a unique opportunity for peoples enslaved by Russia - to throw off the yoke of Moscow colonialism and imperialism and finally become masters of their own destiny on their land. The event began with greetings from the co-organizers - the participants were addressed by Yuriy Syrotyuk - the initiator of the Banderiv readings, chief sergeant of the fire support company of the 5th separate assault brigade of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, director of the non-governmental analytical center -Ukrainian Studies of Strategic Studies- and Oleg Medunytsia - head of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (Banderivites), President of the Anti-Imperial Bloc of Peoples.

Mechnikova; Vyacheslav Trush, chaplain of the -Right Sector-, historian of the Eastern Ukrainian Research Center -Heritage-; Dmytro Bily, professor, doctor of historical sciences, senior researcher of the National Museum of the Holodomor-genocide, researcher of Kuban history. Also, on the first day, the finalists of the traditional Youth Essay Competition on the topic of readings were awarded. This year, the first place was taken by an active serviceman, captain of the ZSU, Oleksiy Tkachenko. They also presented signal copies of the book -Involuntary Joining: The History of the Liberation Struggle of Peoples Enslaved by Russia.- This is the first comprehensive publication in Ukraine, which introduces the centuries-old history of the liberation struggle of peoples enslaved by Russia, none of whom voluntarily wanted to become part of the empire and used the slightest chance to try to gain independence and freedom from their enslaver and colonizer. &nbsp; The second day was dedicated to the prospects of the national liberation struggle at the current stage. Researchers of Russian colonialism and the struggle against it, as well as representatives of national liberation formations of peoples enslaved by Moscow, took part in the discussion. Among them: Ruslan Gabbasov, head of the Committee of the Bashkir National Movement Abroad, one of the founders of the -Bashkort- organization; Rafis Kashapov, Prime Minister of the Government of Independent Tatarstan in exile, a political prisoner of the Kremlin regime, Jambulat Suleymanov, a veteran of the wars with Russia in the Caucasus, the leader of the Chechen national liberation movement -United Force- and others. Political scientists and public figures currently serving in the Armed Forces discussed with them: Yuriy Syrotyuk, Yuriy Oliynyk, Mykhailo Basarab. Finally, the partner of this year's Bander readings, the Anti-Imperial Bloc of Peoples, held a panel of teachers and graduates of the University of Free Peoples under the title -Actual issues of the national liberation struggle of peoples enslaved by Russia at the present stage-. Should we die in Russian captivity, being a blind tool in the hands of the Kremlin, powerless on our land, deprived of language, history, identity or remember the glory of our ancestors and fight for freedom- &#8211; the convinced initiator of the Banderiv readings, chief sergeant of the fire support company of the 5th separate Kyiv assault brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Yuriy Syrotyuk.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/10/u-kyyevi-na-banderivskyh-chytannyah-obgovoryly-perspektyvu-rozpadu-rosiyi/	2025-02-10T07:51:03-08:00

The commanders assure: -But you will move quickly, at such a speed no one will be able to catch you.- The task is simple: to quickly cross the field under fire. To the accompaniment of explosions and epic music, the -assault group- rushes forward. However, the ending is predictable: the Ukrainian fighters precisely work on their goals, and the attack collapses right in front of our eyes. The command of the Russians watches the battle live and in desperation shouts into the radio: -Crawl! Don't lie for revenge! Burn alive now!- However, orders do not help - those who remain among the living cannot even reach the trenches. -No, it's some kind of circus,- the occupiers themselves summarize. -Exactly-. And then they remind themselves once again about the finale: -Im f*zda-. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the 110th mechanized brigade named after Colonel-General Mark Bezruchka recorded how during the movement of Velika Novosilka Russians are hiding behind civilians.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/10/motoczykletnyj-bliczkryg-po-rosijsky-yak-zakinchylasya-guchna-ataka-okupantiv-na-donechyyni/	2025-02-10T07:07:17-08:00

-History shows that ceasefires with Russia do not guarantee lasting peace-. An interview with Admira...	During his meeting with Ukrainian political and military leaders, Admiral Cavo Dragone discussed the needs of the Ukrainian Defense Forces and security sector reforms, and saw the capabilities and characteristics of Ukraine&#8217;s long-range weapons. In an interview with ArmyInform, Admiral Cavo Dragone spoke about the urgent needs of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, assessed Ukraine&#8217;s strikes on Russian military targets and the likelihood of negotiations on a peaceful settlement of the war. — What will be your priorities as Chair of the NATO Military Committee, and what are the key challenges now? — As Chair of the NATO Military Committee, my top priority will be ensuring that Ukraine will continue to receive the supports it needs to be in the strongest position, while maintaining NATO’s readiness to deter any threats to Allied territory. The situation on the battlefield remains difficult, with Ukraine holding parts of the Kursk region while facing ongoing Russian advances and air attacks on its power grid. The current key challenges include maintaining the strongest NATO momentum in support for Ukraine, countering hybrid threats such as cyberattacks and sabotage, and ensuring strong NATO defense capabilities. Russia's reliance on support from North Korea, Iran, and China highlights the global nature of the threats we face. Strengthening NATO's deterrence posture, particularly on the eastern flank, and increasing defense production remains critical. We are adapting to ensure we can deter and defend against a broad and evolving range of threats, including in the context of gray-zone or hybrid warfare tactics, with clear destabilization objectives. These threats include international terrorism and terror groups, threats from the South, and challenges in the Arctic, which demand a 360-degree security approach. — What do you see as the main challenges in maintaining Ukraine&#8217;s defensive capabilities? — The primary challenge is ensuring a continuous and predictable supply of military aid, including ammunition, air defense systems, and long-range strike capabilities. Ukraine's forces intercept Russian missile and drone attacks daily, but air defense stocks must be replenished. Another key challenge is Russia's sustained pressure on multiple fronts. Over 700,000 Russian soldiers have been killed or wounded since February 2022. The introduction of North Korean troops is a dangerous development, demonstrating Putin’s reliance on external forces. Russia’s attacks on Ukraine’s infrastructure also weaken its defense production and energy sector. This is why at the Washington Summit last year, Allies agreed a robust package of support for Ukraine for the long haul: — What are the most critical types of military aid that NATO and its member states should prioritize for Ukraine? — Allies are strongly committed to further strengthen Ukraine's defense and we welcome any announcements to provide Ukraine with additional military capabilities. We saw great examples at the last meeting in Ramstein – from the US, Canada, Latvia, the UK and others. We see clearly that Ukraine needs advanced air defense systems, long-range precision strike capabilities, and increased artillery and ammunition supplies. Given Russia's continued missile and drone attacks, NATO and Allies must ensure Ukraine has sufficient air defense to protect its infrastructure. Ukraine also requires sustained deliveries of 155 mm artillery shells, armored vehicles, and long-range weapons to strike Russian military targets. To enhance long-term sustainability, NATO must also support Ukraine in developing its domestic defense production. — How does NATO assess the use and impact of F-16s on the battlefield? — The introduction of F-16s into Ukraine's air force has strengthened its ability to contest Russian air power, intercept enemy aircraft, and strike military targets effectively. These jets are particularly valuable in countering missile and drone barrages. However, their full impact depends on sufficient pilot training, maintenance capabilities, and continued supplies of weapons and spare parts. NATO has facilitated training and logistics support to maximize their effectiveness. — How do Ukraine's strikes on military targets in Russia affect the aggressor's ability to continue the war? — Ukraine's strikes on military targets inside Russia are a legitimate form of self-defense under international law. These attacks disrupt Russian logistics, weaken its ability to launch further assaults, and force Moscow to allocate more resources to its own defense. While these strikes alone may not end the war, they impose significant costs on Russia by targeting fuel depots, airbases, and ammunition stockpiles. Russia's growing battlefield losses, combined with mounting pressure on its defense industry, are gradually degrading its long-term military capabilities. — How long does NATO estimate Russia can continue its war against Ukraine? What are Russia's losses? — Russia has suffered over 700,000 casualties since February 2022, including killed and wounded soldiers. Thousands of tanks, armored vehicles, and aircraft have been destroyed, and the Russian navy has been pushed out of large parts of the Black Sea. Despite these losses, Russia continues the war with support from North Korea, Iran, and China. However, sustaining such high attrition levels is unsustainable in the long run. Continued military support for Ukraine will further degrade Russia’s war-fighting capabilities, placing Ukraine in a stronger position when negotiations occur. Our focus needs to be on supporting the end of the war is to ensure Ukraine can enter any negotiations from a position of strength. — What is NATO’s assessment of North Korea’s involvement in the war? How can its support for Russia be stopped? — North Korea is supplying Russia with ammunition, missiles, and even personnel, escalating the conflict. This poses a significant threat, allowing Russia to replenish its stocks despite heavy losses. It is also another breach of UN Security Council resolutions and a dangerous expansion of Russia&#8217;s war. NATO has called on Russia and North Korea to cease these actions immediately. Stopping North Korea's involvement requires tightening sanctions, increasing diplomatic pressure on China, and intercepting arms shipments through intelligence and naval cooperation. Strengthening deterrence measures against North Korea is necessary to discourage further military collaboration with Russia. — What could be NATO&#8217;s role if individual member states decide to participate in a peacekeeping mission in Ukraine? — Recommend to shift the focus towards bolstering support to Ukraine, so that it is in the strongest position possible when it reaches the negotiation table for peace talks. Discussions about what follows after this depend on how strong Ukraine's hand can be at the table. And to ensure Ukraine has agency in deciding ultimately what comes next once peace talks conclude, on Ukraine's terms. NATO's focus remains on strengthening Ukraine's military capabilities, rather than deploying peacekeeping forces in an active war zone. — Russia has been making statements about its alleged readiness to negotiate, but at the same time it has set the condition that Ukraine cannot be a member of NATO. Should talks begin under such conditions? — Ukraine has the sole right to decide the terms of any peace talks. NATO fully supports Ukraine's sovereignty and rejects any conditions that would force it to renounce its future security. History shows that ceasefires with Russia do not guarantee lasting peace. The best way to bring Russia to negotiations under favorable conditions is to ensure Ukraine remains strong militarily. Furthermore, Ukraine's path to NATO membership is irreversible, as affirmed at the Washington Summit. — If a new U.S. administration reduces military aid, is NATO prepared to compensate? — At the Washington Summit NATO committed to long-term support for Ukraine, with Allies pledging a minimum of 40 billion euros in security assistance for 2024. The NATO Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine (NSATU) assumed responsibilities in December. While I will not speculate on potential changes in U.S. policy, NATO is working to ensure aid is evenly distributed and sustainable. The establishment of NSATU demonstrates NATO's commitment to long-term support regardless of political changes in individual member states. Ukraine's security is our security, and we remain steadfast in our support.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/10/history-shows-that-ceasefires-with-russia-do-not-guarantee-lasting-peace-an-interview-with-admiral-giuseppe-cavo-dragone-chair-of-the-nato-military-committee/	2025-02-09T20:43:37-08:00
Arms supply, F-16 effectiveness and Russian losses in Ukraine: interview with the head of the NATO M...	He headed the committee only three weeks ago and made his first foreign visit to Ukraine. This is a clear signal that NATO will play an increasing role in the coordination and delivery of military aid to Ukraine, in particular through the new structure in Wiesbaden. At a meeting with Ukrainian political and military leaders, Admiral Dragone discussed the needs of the Defense Forces of Ukraine and reforms in the security sector, as well as got acquainted with the capabilities and characteristics of Ukrainian long-range weapons with his own eyes. In an exclusive interview with ArmiyaInform Admiral Giuseppe Cavo Dragone spoke about the urgent needs of the Armed Forces, assessed Ukraine's strikes on Russian military facilities and the likelihood of negotiations on a peaceful settlement of the war. — What will be your priorities as the head of the NATO Military Committee and what are the key challenges facing you? — As the head of the NATO Military Committee, my priority will be to ensure the further support Ukraine needs for to be in the strongest position while maintaining NATO's readiness to contain any threats to the Alliance's territory. The situation on the battlefield remains difficult: Ukraine holds part of the Kursk region, while dealing with a constant Russian offensive and airstrikes on the power grid. Among the current key tasks is to maintain the strongest NATO momentum in support of Ukraine, countering hybrid threats such as cyberattacks and sabotage, and the provision of powerful NATO defense forces and assets. Russia's dependence on support from North Korea, Iran, and China underscores the global nature of the threats we face. Therefore, it remains critical for us to strengthen NATO's deterrence capabilities, especially on the eastern flank, and to increase defense production. We are adapting to ensure our ability to deter and defend against a wide and changing range of threats, including in the context of -gray zone- tactics or hybrid warfare with clear destabilization goals. Among these threats are international terrorism and terrorist groups, threats from the South and challenges in the Arctic, which require an integrated approach to security. — What do you see as problematic issues in maintaining Ukraine's defense capability? — The primary challenge is to ensure a continuous and predictable supply of military aid, including ammunition, air defense systems, and means for lesions over long distances. Ukrainian defense forces are intercepting Russian missiles and drones every day, but the stockpile of air defense equipment needs to be replenished. Another key challenge is the constant pressure from Russia on many fronts. Since February 2022, more than 700,000 Russian soldiers have been killed or wounded. The involvement of North Korean troops is a dangerous development that demonstrates Putin's dependence on external forces. Russia's attacks on Ukraine's infrastructure are also weakening its defense production and energy sector. That is why, at the Washington Summit last year, Alliance members agreed on a powerful long-term support package for Ukraine: — What are the most important types of military aid that NATO and its member states should prioritize for Ukraine? — Alliance members are determined to further strengthen Ukraine's defense capabilities, and we welcome any announcements on providing Ukraine with additional military capabilities. We saw great examples at the last Ramstein meeting from the USA, Canada, Latvia, Great Britain and other countries. We clearly see that Ukraine needs modern air defense systems, the ability to deliver high-precision long-range strikes, as well as increased supplies of artillery and ammunition. Given the ongoing missile and drone attacks by Russia, NATO and Allies must provide Ukraine with sufficient air defenses to protect its infrastructure. Ukraine also needs stable supplies 155-mm artillery shells, armored vehicles and long-range weapons to hit Russian military facilities. In order to strengthen long-term stability, NATO should also support Ukraine in the development of its domestic defense production. — Half a year ago, Ukraine received the first F-16 fighter jets from its partners. How does NATO evaluate the effectiveness of the use of these aircraft? — F-16 aircraft, which have entered the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, have increased the ability to counter Russian air threats, intercept enemy aircraft and deliver effective strikes on military targets. These aircraft are especially valuable in countering missile strikes and drone strikes. However, their full the impact (on the situation at the front, — ed.) depends on sufficient pilot training, maintenance capabilities and continuous supply of weapons and spare parts. NATO contributes to the training of pilots and technical personnel and logistical support to ensure the maximum efficiency of these aircraft. — How Ukraine's strikes on military facilities in Russia affect the aggressor's ability to continue war? — Strikes by Ukraine on military facilities on the territory of Russia are a legitimate form of self-defense in accordance with international law. These attacks undermine Russian logistics, weaken its ability to carry out further attacks, and force Moscow to devote more resources to its own defense. While these strikes cannot end the war by themselves, they do significant damage to Russia, as their targets are fuel depots, air bases, and ammunition stocks. Russia's mounting battlefield losses, combined with increasing pressure on its defense industry, are gradually eroding its long-term military capabilities. — How long does NATO estimate Russia can continue the war against Ukraine? What are Russia's losses? - Since February 2022, Russia has lost more than 700,000 soldiers killed and wounded. Thousands of tanks, armored vehicles, and aircraft were destroyed, and the Russian fleet was forced out of most of the Black Sea. Despite these losses, Russia continues the war with the support of North Korea, Iran, and China. However, in the long term, it will be difficult for Russia to continue to ignore such a high level of casualties. Continuing military support for Ukraine will lead to further deterioration of Russia's military capabilities and will put Ukraine in a stronger position during negotiations. We must focus on supporting the end of the war to ensure Ukraine is able to enter any negotiations from a position of strength. — Have North Korean soldiers been involved in the war against Ukraine since the beginning of the year? How to stop North Korea from further supporting Russia? — North Korea supplies Russia with ammunition, missiles and even personnel. This poses a significant threat, allowing Russia to replenish its reserves amid heavy losses. This is also another violation of UN Security Council resolutions and a dangerous extension of Russia's war. NATO called on Russia and North Korea to immediately stop these actions. Ending North Korea's involvement requires increased sanctions, increased diplomatic pressure on China, and the interception of arms supplies through intelligence and naval cooperation. Strengthening deterrence against North Korea is necessary to prevent further military cooperation with Russia. — What might NATO's role be if individual member states decide to participate in a peacekeeping mission in Ukraine? — We recommend shifting the emphasis to strengthening support for Ukraine so that it has the strongest possible position when it sits down at the negotiating table for a peaceful settlement of the conflict. The discussion of what will happen after that will depend on how strong Ukraine's position at the negotiating table will be. And from the extent to which Ukraine will be able to independently decide what will happen after the end of the peace negotiations, on its own terms. NATO continues to focus on strengthening the military capabilities of Ukraine, and not on the deployment of peacekeeping forces in the zone of active hostilities. — There are statements from Russia about the alleged readiness for negotiations, but at the same time the condition is set that Ukraine cannot be a member of NATO. Should we start negotiations with such demands? — Ukraine has the exclusive right to determine the terms of any peace negotiations. NATO fully supports Ukraine's sovereignty and rejects any conditions that would force it to give up its future security. History shows that a ceasefire with Russia does not guarantee lasting peace. The best way to bring Russia into negotiations on favorable terms is to ensure that Ukraine remains militarily strong. Furthermore, Ukraine's path to NATO membership is irreversible, as confirmed at the Washington Summit. — If the new US administration cuts military aid to Ukraine, is NATO prepared to compensate? — At the Washington NATO Summit made a commitment to long-term support for Ukraine, with Alliance members pledging at least 40 billion euros in security assistance until 2024. In December, the NATO Security Assistance and Support Program for Ukraine (NSATU) began operating. I will not speculate on potential changes in US policy, but NATO is working to ensure that aid is evenly distributed and sustainable. The creation of NSATU demonstrates NATO's commitment to long-term support regardless of political changes in individual member states. The security of Ukraine is our security, and we remain steadfast in our support.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/10/postachannya-zbroyi-efektyvnist-f-16-i-vtraty-rf-v-ukrayini-intervyu-z-golovoyu-vijskovogo-komitetu-nato/	2025-02-09T20:42:35-08:00
Save Private -Scooby-: Ukrainian soldiers pulled out a wounded brother from Britain from the battlef...	-The same thing would have been done for us,- they confidently assert, daily telling ArmyInform the unique story of the rescue of their brothers. -Nike-, -Cat- and Alexander are fighters of a grenade launcher that covered the front edge of the positions of the Defense Forces units. Three soldiers received a message about a wounded soldier who remained in a forest lane on the last line in front of the enemy from another one of the command and observation posts of the battalion. — I went to the guys, informed them about the situation, because their position was the closest. They knew very well that I would not ask them to do something that I would not have done myself under other circumstances. However, the decision was difficult, because their firing position covered the front edge and during the evacuation, it could stop working for one and a half to two hours, says a fighter with the call sign -Afghan-, who was on duty at the KSP. The fighters agreed without hesitation, so their sector was covered by additional surveillance from drones and neighboring positions. All the time, while the mission lasted, the evacuation group and the surrounding area were closely monitored by the battalion's reconnaissance drones. - First of all, we found out the soldier's call sign - -Scooby-, the nature of his injury and his whereabouts. It was clarified whether he remained in the same place where he was given primary medical care, or whether he could have already been moved. There was a danger that an enemy drone was watching the location of the wounded man, waiting for someone to come to evacuate him, says Naik, who was contacted by Afghan radio. The wounded soldier was about 200 meters from the position of the grenade launchers, but this distance was an open field between neighboring forest strips, which was extremely dangerous to cross during the day. However, after reporting that there were no enemy drones nearby and using EW suppression, the fighters rushed to help the wounded man. The terrain was hilly - between the higher forest strips there was a hollow, through which the trio of rescuers ran in a few minutes. An easy descent and a slightly more difficult ascent were made without any particular complications - the ground, frozen during the night, firmly held the infantrymen's heavy berets. — All the time our movement was accompanied by a drone, we kept in touch with the KSP by radio. This added confidence - we are being watched and will be warned about danger and will be told where to look for a fighter. They gave a reference point - a point in the landing, where the last location of the injured person was recorded, - says -Nike-. However, when the fighters reached the indicated place, they could not find the wounded man. The fact that he was there was evidenced only by a bloody stretcher and a checkered -arafatka- scarf. The fighter himself was neither there nor nearby, so the rescue team began searching, rummaging through the trees and bushes of the forest strip. While grenade launchers searched for the wounded on the ground, reconnaissance drones inspected the area from the air. The drone observers were lucky - they found the fighter half a kilometer away from the previous location. Having the strength to move, he tried to get out on his own and managed to crawl a considerable distance. Unfortunately, the efforts of the -Scooby- turned out to be not only useless, but also harmful - all the time it was moving towards the enemy, moving away from Ukrainian positions. Only the end of the line of trees, behind which the open space began, made him stop. Not knowing what to do next, the wounded man froze. — -Scooby- was detected from a drone at the intersection of two landings while the boys searched everything around his original location. Then, on the radio, I went to Naika and said: -He crawled down 500 meters from you, go there,- says -Afghan-. It was lucky to find the wounded person quite quickly - in about 10 minutes, but the time seemed much longer to the fighters of the evacuation team. -Cat- and Alexander assume that they had to search for Scooby in the forest strip for at least half an hour - the time in the high danger zone was unbearably long for them. — But if it is necessary, then it is necessary. No one but us could do it, so we would go and search as long as it took. We just did the human thing. And everyone thought at the moment when we were asked to do it that one of us could have been in his place. That's it, says Oleksandr. The fighters are sure that anyone from the Ukrainian military, being in their place, would have done the same - went to save their brothers, despite the risk. This is military karma, they explain - if you go to save the wounded, then someone will definitely help you in a difficult moment. — We just did our job, did what had to be done. They helped a person. For me, this is not the first time to pull out a wounded person - both -two hundred- and -three hundred- were pulled out. This is not the first time for me, so I went to the rescue without any questions, - continues the fighter with the call sign -Cat-. He earned his nickname -Cat- near Kupyansk, where he saved a kitten with a broken paw. He personally fed and treated the -three hundredth- furrier so that he could stand on all four legs. Since then, in memory of this story, his brothers call him -Cat- or affectionately - -Kitten-. Having learned about the location of the wounded, the fighters picked up stretchers and moved to him as quickly as possible. It was necessary to walk along the forest strip carefully - there were often things left by the fighters, remote mining of the area was not excluded. Bypassing dangerous objects, the fighters got to Scooby. - We were told that there was a drone hanging over -Scooby-, so it was not difficult to find it. They called him by his call sign, made eye contact to make sure he wouldn't mistake us for enemies. And then they provided help and began evacuation, says -Nike-. -Scuba- had a shrapnel wound to the leg, but the bleeding had already stopped, and the injured person's condition after checking according to the protocol was stable. Having secured the wounded man on a stretcher, the fighters marched back to their dugout, from where further evacuation could be organized. Plastic stretchers were arranged like an Indian haystack, into which all three fighters of the evacuation group were harnessed together with the help of belts. -And that's how three ZSUSH forces pulled on ZSUSHNA traction,- -Afghan- jokes. So, first along the forest strip, and then with a jerk across the open field, -Scooby- was brought to the firing position of the grenade launchers' calculation. Descending into the hollow from above was not so difficult, the fighters recall, but it was already very difficult to climb up - by the middle of the day, the frost had subsided and the soil began to turn into a swamp. — -Scooby- is generally handsome. While we were dragging him, he kept his cool, didn't scream. He cried out only once, when he was jumped on some hump. And he held on like that - when we asked him how strong the pain was on a scale from 1 to 10, he said that it was a 6. He was very happy that he was taken away, - recalls -Nike- after the end of the rescue mission. Extracting a wounded man in full protective gear was extremely difficult, so when the fighters reached their position, everyone was extremely exhausted, but extremely satisfied that they had managed to save a comrade in arms. Now -Scooby- is in one of the hospitals of the Defense Forces of Ukraine, and -Nike-, -Kit-, -Afghan- and -Olexander- continue to serve in the 2nd International Legion. They do not consider themselves heroes, but they are happy that they were able to save the life of their brother.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/10/vryatuvaty-ryadovogo-skubi-ukrayinski-voyiny-vytyagly-z-polya-boyu-poranenogo-pobratyma-z-brytaniyi/	2025-02-09T20:34:57-08:00
Bradley anti-laser upgrade: the American infantry fighting vehicle will receive the latest ATGM prot...	As goes in the text of the release posted on the U.S. portal. Army, at the Yuma Proving Ground of the United States Army, the new Vehicle Protection System Base Kit (VBK) protection system was tested, which significantly increases the survivability of this BMP on the battlefield, ArmyInform reports. The statement says that the new system uses advanced sensors mounted on the corners of the Bradley turret. This allows laser threats to be detected around the entire perimeter, providing a 360-degree field of view, increasing the crew's awareness of potential attacks. VBK is designed to detect laser sights that are used to guide guided missiles and anti-tank weapons. If a threat is detected, the crew can quickly identify its source with the commander's vision device in order to take protective measures. -The system alerts the crew with an audible signal and a visual indicator,- explained Alan Vega, test officer. -This allows soldiers to decide whether to repel a threat with available weapons or simply evade it,- publication Defense Industry Europe said. Tests of the VBK system were carried out in the difficult conditions of the Hume proving ground. The total length of the test route was 6.5 thousand. miles (over 10,000 km). This test simulated real combat conditions, which made it possible to find out how the protection system copes with vibration, difficult terrain and other stress factors. In the course of testing, both static and dynamic combat situations were simulated, including movement under the threat of damage. According to the developers, such a comprehensive test demonstrated that the VBK is able to work effectively in the most extreme conditions. In addition, the system was tested for its ability to detect threats coming from shelters or from behind hills. -The VBK offers Bradley aircrews an increased level of protection,- noted Tracy Hafley, another test officer. -Providing this ability to make quick decisions is a significant advance for the safety of Soldiers.- The US Army said in a statement that the modernization of the Bradley, including the introduction of the VBK, is aimed at increasing its resistance to modern weapons, including precision munitions. This technology complements the vehicle's existing armor, providing an additional layer of protection for the crew. Overall, observers noted, the introduction of the Bradley Basic Protection Kit is part of a long-term modernization program aimed at ensuring that the BMPs remain effective and protected in future conflicts. As ArmyInform reported, in September 2024, the Pentagon signed a contract to purchase Iron Fist active protection systems (APS) for its Bradley infantry fighting vehicles. Iron Fist (in Ukrainian - -Iron Fist-) APS is an advanced Hard Kill system aimed at increasing the self-defense capabilities of armored platforms against modern threats on the battlefield.

-Instead of lifeguards — buckets of water-: a new -sensation- from propaganda	Judging by the level of this -news-, Kremlin propagandists were inspired by post-apocalyptic films or simply forgot that science fiction is not their genre. Russian Telegram channels and media resources are spreading -horror stories- about the fact that rescuers are being -massively reduced- in Ukraine, so in the event of a fire, Ukrainians will be left without help and will have to fight the fire on their own - with buckets, pans or prayers. Of course, without any evidence or references to official sources. The State Service of Ukraine for Emergency Situations (SES) is working as usual. Moreover, Ukrainian rescuers daily eliminate the consequences of Russian attacks, dismantle rubble after missile strikes and extinguish fires caused by -liberators- with Russian passports. As for funding, despite the war, it remains stable. Rescuers receive new equipment, and their units receive equipment and equipment. And if optimization changes took place somewhere, this does not mean that Ukrainians were left to their own devices. As always, the purpose of such -news- is to sow panic. The enemy is trying to create a picture of the -collapse of the state-, saying that -everything is bad in Ukraine-, -no one will help-, -we must surrender-. But as practice shows, every such fake is a demonstration of the powerlessness of Russian propaganda rather than a real threat to Ukraine. After all, who really has problems with the liquidation of emergency situations is Russia itself. In Siberia, hectares of forest burn every year, and local residents really put out the fire on their own - with shovels and branches. Only the Kremlin TV prefers to keep silent about it. So the next time you hear another -sensational- Russian hoax, just laugh. Because this is the only reaction they deserve.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/10/zamist-ryatuvalnykiv-vidra-z-vodoyu-nova-sensacziya-vid-rospropagandy/	2025-02-09T20:02:13-08:00
-One summer in Ukraine-: a film about volunteers that will not leave you indifferent	This was reported by the representative of the International Legion of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine Volodymyr in a conversation with Jenny Klochko for the podcast -Ukrainian Jenny meets&#8230;-. Volodymyr spoke about how the Ukrainian audience received the film about foreign volunteers. According to him, the tape does not get boring even after multiple viewings, because each time you discover new details for yourself. The audience is especially captivated by the humor, which is organically woven into the story of military everyday life. -I watched this movie in every new city. Every time I looked, I saw specific micro-details that I had not noticed before. And somehow I caught myself feeling that this film does not bore. [&#8230;] And one lady wrote on Instagram: -Why do I want to watch the movie again? The first is because all profits from the film will go to support the unit. The second is because this movie is sexy. The third is because this movie is very sexy,- Volodymyr shared his impressions. The representative of the Legion also noted that the audience's expectations may not always coincide with the reality depicted in the film. -Maybe some viewers expect more action scenes, you know, in the style of -John Wick- or -Black Hawk Down- - shooting, explosions. But we filmed the usual routine of Ukrainian fighters. It's a job. [&#8230;] Most of this film was shot in a fairly safe place, when the guys are training, eating, arguing, joking, cursing in Ukrainian - as we can see now, this is one of the funniest parts of the film,- he said. It is the depiction of ordinary, everyday moments from the life of fighters that makes this film particularly valuable and close to the viewer. It shows the war without embellishment, but also without excessive drama, with humor and optimism characteristic of Ukrainian defenders. Currently, work is underway to present the film -One Summer in Ukraine- at international film festivals for an English-speaking audience. This will be an important event for popularizing Ukrainian cinema and telling the truth about the war in Ukraine to the world community. As reported by ArmyInform, the premiere of the documentary film -One Summer in Ukraine- took place in cinemas of Ukraine fighters of the International Legion of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/09/odnogo-lita-v-ukrayini-film-pro-dobrovolcziv-yakyj-ne-zalyshyt-vas-bajduzhymy/	2025-02-09T10:53:00-08:00
Relieving stress through virtual reality: new methods of psychological support for fighters	This is discussed in a post on the brigade page. -Now you are watching our soldier go through this meditative technique with the help of VR glasses to switch, firstly, because our psyche is a little overloaded after combat. And in order to remove this burden, we use VR glasses. With their help, we can transfer the consciousness of servicemen to different places,- says a serviceman of the 61st OMBr. With the help of special virtual reality glasses, fighters can -meditate- in the mountains or near the lake, or -let out emotions- in active interactive games. This approach allows the fighters to distract themselves from the war and experience positive emotions. -We owe the VR glasses and the development of the software for them to the Ukrainian technology company Asichi, which helps to make it available to all servicemen and to work with their emotions, fears, anxiety, and also to relieve stress,- the 61st OMBr states. As reported by ArmyInform, the operators of the unmanned systems battalion of the 61st Mechanized Steppe Brigade eliminated the enemy's attempt to cut one of our logistics routes.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/09/zvilnennya-vid-stresu-cherez-virtualnu-realnist-novi-metody-psyhologichnoyi-pidtrymky-bijcziv/	2025-02-09T10:34:58-08:00

We are launching a revolutionary project that will radically strengthen our brigades and scale up the experience of effectively destroying the enemy - the Line of Drones,- said Rustem Umyerov. This project envisages the creation of a new standard of war, where unmanned systems become a key element of combat operations, helping defenders to carry out the most difficult tasks. At the first stage, the -Drone Line- will cover five elite regiments and brigades: According to the Minister of Defense, the project combines infantry and UAVs into a single strike system, which will allow: -This will radically change the battle tactics, giving our soldiers a decisive advantage,- Rustem Umerov emphasized. The Minister of Defense thanked the President of Ukraine for the initiative and the entire defense-industrial complex, which develops unmanned technologies 24/7. -We are scaling the technological advantage. We are changing the course of the war. We are destroying the enemy,- Rustem Umyerov concluded. The launch of the -Drone Line- project is an important step in the development of modern military technologies in Ukraine and should significantly strengthen the country's defense capabilities. As reported by ArmyInform, on the website of the Land Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine information appeared on the website of the -Drone Line- - initiative aimed at developing and scaling effective units of unmanned systems.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/09/ministr-oborony-prokomentuvav-zapusk-liniyi-droniv-cze-kardynalno-zminyt-taktyku-boyu/	2025-02-09T10:24:36-08:00
Volodymyr Zelenskyi: The Baltic countries have finally disconnected from Russia's energy grid	President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated this in his evening address, emphasizing the importance of this step. -Ukraine carried out such a separation back in 2022, and today the Baltic states also got rid of their dependence. Moscow will no longer be able to use energy as a weapon against them. This also means that Europe has become even more integrated,- the President emphasized. The disconnection from the Russian energy grid became part of the EU's strategy to strengthen energy security and diversify the supply of energy resources. The Baltic countries, which were previously part of the Soviet energy system, depended on Russian power grids for a long time. Now they have become part of a single European system that guarantees stability and security of energy supply. Volodymyr Zelenskyi also emphasized the importance of further reducing the energy dependence of Central European countries on Russia. He called for strengthening cooperation with the United States in the supply of LNG gas, as well as expanding the import of energy carriers from the Caucasus, the Middle East and North Africa. -The less Europeans depend on Russia, the sooner it will be possible to guarantee reliable security for everyone in Europe,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy emphasized. Separately, the President noted the role of Poland, which helped implement this step, stressing that cooperation between European countries is a guarantee of their independence. The move by Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia is yet another blow to the Kremlin's ability to use energy as a means of political pressure. Europe continues the course of strengthening its energy security and phasing out Russian energy resources, which is a key element in countering Russian aggression. As reported by ArmyInform, President Volodymyr Zelenskyi emphasized that the Russian army, starting with a full-scale invasion, is being replenished not by personnel officers and trained people, but by a large number of mobilized, who are used as -meat-.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/09/volodymyr-zelenskyj-baltijski-krayiny-ostatochno-vidyednalysya-vid-energomerezhi-rosiyi/	2025-02-09T10:12:58-08:00

-Royal Infantry- in action: how our soldiers prepare for battles during the Yar Times	Photos of combat training were published on the website of the Land Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Recruits of the 24th OMbr go through a young fighter course, where they practice the skills necessary for survival and successful performance of tasks in the conditions of modern combat. Special attention is paid to tactical training, because battles in urban areas have their own specifics. Fighters learn to navigate the terrain, move stealthily, use cover and hit the enemy effectively. An important element of training is fire practice. Recruits master different types of weapons, learn to shoot accurately and reload quickly. They also get knowledge of medical training, because on the battlefield every second can decide a life. In addition to physical and tactical training, fighters undergo psychological hardening. They are taught to cope with stress, keep calm and make decisions under high pressure. After all, success on the battlefield depends not only on physical strength, but also on psychological stability. As reported by ArmyInform, in Chasovo Yaru the enemy is actively using combined assault tactics. However, it advances into the city only when it completely wipes out the Defense Force fortifications from the ground.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/09/korolivska-pihota-v-diyi-yak-nashi-bijczi-gotuyutsya-do-boyiv-za-chasiv-yar/	2025-02-09T09:52:51-08:00
-If he does not want to fight, then they will have to-: the story of the platoon sergeant major with...	The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. As soon as the full-scale Russian invasion began, 30-year-old Ivan from Stryi, together with his father and brother, immediately appeared at the military commissariat. However, only the older brother was mobilized, the father was already over 60, and Ivan was told to wait a little. A year and a half later, he received a summons. After the training center in the Rivne region, Ivan got into the 128th separate Transcarpathian mountain assault brigade. He is now a platoon sergeant major, a sergeant with the call sign Fox. -At the training center, I met Roman from Khmelnytskyi (call sign Elephant), we became close friends, and we both decided that we would join the stormtroopers,- says Fox. — That is why, during the distribution, they asked for the 128th OGSHBr, about which we heard a lot. Do I have any regrets? No. After the training center, we had very good training already in the brigade, including with foreign instructors. There are some pluses,- the fighter jokes. After training, Fox, along with his brothers, began to perform complex combat tasks, which included assaults on enemy positions, mopping up and heavy defense. -Of course, it was scary. This feeling is always present during combat sorties. Everyone is afraid, and that's okay. Fear is one of the basic instincts for self-preservation. He who is not afraid does not live long. But fear must be overcome, especially when you are responsible not only for yourself, but also for your comrades. I went on a mission as a unit commander, and the biggest worries were for people. You need to talk to everyone, explain the combat mission, show routes, listen to questions, help, become a support. The most difficult and cruelest battles Fox experienced in Robotyn. -At first we stormed and cleared enemy trenches, and then we had to entrench and hold the defense. The Russians retreated to a neighboring position 70 meters from us and from there tried to regain what they had lost. But we didn't invite the -guests-, so we didn't let them in. Different fighters stood against us - pros, convicts&#8230; I saw enemy bodies with Wagner chevrons. Rats were gnawing at them, they had been lying there for so long. Many times I observed inappropriate behavior of Russians. They could go on the offensive, bypassing forest strips, at full height with minimal equipment. We mow them, and they still stick. One was wounded, you can see how a bullet pierced his leg, in a few seconds a vog exploded near his feet (a grenade from an underbarrel or an automatic grenade launcher), and he got up and walked on. He was definitely under the influence of some drugs.- During the defense of captured enemy positions, Fox and his comrades took a prisoner. -Aerial scouts reported that a Russian was walking nearby without a machine gun, and we decided to take him. He did not even resist, he began to explain that he was looking for the body of the commander in order to take the walkie-talkie. He is 40 years old, from the Russian hinterland. When we took him, I warned - if you say that you have a weapon, we will pass it on as it is, just tied up. He replied that he had nothing, but during the search I found a knife in his pocket. The prisoner received a light blow to the back of the head for lying, and then we transferred him to the rear. During the fighting, Fox was wounded several times in the back, shoulder and head. -The most dangerous wound was in the head, most likely from a mortar mine. One shrapnel hit the helmet, and the second (about the size of a thumb) flew under the helmet, grazed the head and lodged in the helmet on the inside. You could say I'm very lucky. When they brought me to the headquarters and took off the helmet, everything was covered in blood, although a hot piece of metal cauterized the wound, so the bleeding was not intense. I kept that shard, I even wanted to remelt it into some kind of symbolic decoration. In the war, unfortunately, not everyone is lucky, many of Fox's comrades died in the battles. -Our group went on an assault, and the Russians met us harshly - they fired at us with everything they could. A comrade was wounded in the arm, so I ordered him to retreat and wait for evacuation, accompanied by a soldier. A minute later, the wounded man came under the fire of a tank gun&#8230; The assault did not succeed, we were ordered to withdraw to the nearby positions where my friend Slon was standing. And the three of us with the Elephant and one more soldier dragged the deceased under fire to a trench where he could hide. He was heavy, about 120 kilograms, and when we dragged him 300 meters, I felt like I broke my back. That's why other boys took the deceased, in general, they had to drag him for about two kilometers. Recently, Fox's unit has been holding a defense in the Zaporozhye direction in one of the villages recaptured from the enemy. Due to the danger of drones, combat exits to -zero- have to be delayed, sometimes they last for several months. -We are in a confined space for a long time and in constant danger. From time to time I question my fighters - ask about peaceful life, relatives, hobbies&#8230; It is necessary for a person to speak out, then it becomes a little easier for him. When there is an opportunity, I do light physical education, I do exercises with a bra, so that the muscles do not atrophy. What is the most difficult position? One is superimposed on the other - a closed space, constant danger, lack of contact with relatives, concern for people. During vacations and rehabilitation after his injury, Fox made several visits to the home. I have seen healthy men who do not want to join the Armed Forces and are hiding. -One of them is my neighbor. Having met him once, he began to ask when all this would end. I replied that the war would not end without his participation. And he gave advice to teach his children how to handle weapons. Because if he doesn't want to fight, he will have to.- As reported by ArmyInform, 28-year-old Alexander with the call sign -German- is the operator of a drone-bomber 128 separate mountain-assault Transcarpathian Brigade.

-Drone Line-: The best unmanned units of the Ground Forces unite to strengthen the defense	The Land Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine inform you about this. This project is extremely important for ensuring superiority on the battlefield and saving the lives of Ukrainian soldiers. As noted in the message of the Ground Forces, the best unmanned units, such as -K-2-, -Achilles-, -RAROG- and -Birds of Magyar-, together with other UAV units, create a permanent line of drones that will strengthen our soldiers to zero, ensure total control over all enemy actions and their destruction. -Drone Line- is not about creating new combat units. It is about the development of the best and scaling of effective units of unmanned systems in various branches and types of troops. Also a member of the -Line of Drones- is a division of the State Border Service - -Phoenix-. The commanders of these units — Magyar, a system commander and an example for fellow soldiers, Achilles, a fearless tactician and master of lightning strikes, Veres, a charismatic and indomitable strategist, Hasan, an aggressive and unpredictable leader for the enemy — know their business, take care of the safety of the soldiers, destroy the invaders en masse, and master new technologies and tactics. The Drone Line project is an initiative of the President of Ukraine, coordinated by the Ground Forces Command, the State Border Guard Service, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, and the Ministry of Digital Transformation. We will remind you that earlier the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskiy announced this initiative, by publishing a corresponding video. This project is another step towards strengthening Ukraine's defense capabilities and ensuring victory over the Russian invaders. As reported by ArmiyaInform, the commanders of the -Phoenix-, K-2, -Achilles-, RAROG and -Birds of Magyar- united in the joint project -Drone Power- and invite you to join their units.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/09/liniya-droniv-najkrashhi-bezpilotni-pidrozdily-suhoputnyh-vijsk-obyednalysya-dlya-posylennya-oborony/	2025-02-09T09:33:45-08:00
Only paint and patches: the occupiers limited -repair- destroyed Severodonetsk	notifies the head of the Luhansk OVA, Artem Lysogor. The occupiers admit that their -Country Doctor- program, which provided cash payments to doctors, has failed. The lack of doctors is especially felt in front-line cities and small settlements, where doctors refuse to go. If the corresponding law is adopted, then already from September 1, 2026, those who refuse the mandatory training will have to pay a fine that will exceed twice the cost of education. In addition, Russia is reducing funding for the pseudo-reconstruction of occupied Severodonetsk. So, in 2025, the occupiers plan to repair only 12 objects instead of 15, as promised last year. These are only cosmetic repairs - replacing windows, radiators and re-roofing. Full restoration or capital repairs are not foreseen. As ArmyInform reported, in the temporarily occupied territories of Luhansk Russians continue to implement their best corruption traditions. Now they have officially legalized the robbery of housing, handing over -ownerless- property to themselves, and at the same time, they have been -forgetting- to pay their debts to public officials for ten years.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/09/lyshe-farba-i-latky-okupanty-obmezhyly-remont-znyshhenogo-syevyerodoneczka/	2025-02-09T09:07:34-08:00
The occupier ran into a Ukrainian drone: a walk through someone else's yard did not go unpunished	The video of combat work was published on the brigade's page. The published footage shows Ukrainian drones carrying out targeted strikes on enemy fortifications and enemy manpower. These are not just attacks - these are carefully planned operations that step by step bring Ukraine closer to victory. -Fight and win!- — under this slogan, the fighters of the 32nd OMBr continue their mission, not leaving the enemy a single chance. As reported by ArmyInform, the Defense Forces caught the Russian invaders when they tried to fix their logistics with the help of a conventional walk-behind tractor.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/09/okupant-narvavsya-na-ukrayinskyj-dron-progulyanka-chuzhym-dvorom-ne-zalyshylasya-bezkarnoyu/	2025-02-09T08:53:15-08:00
-Blondie- on armor: the woman who tamed the tank	The defender's story was made public on the brigade's page. -Blondie- does not just support the fighting spirit of her siblings - she considers them superheroes, protects them like a real team mother, and also&#8230; drives the tank herself! -It's easy to start a tank and go. It's like riding a bicycle,- she says with a smile. Her path to the army began by accident, with a joke in the store: customers said that if she did not make a discount, they would take her to the army. Svetlana was not at a loss - and still kept her promise. There were fewer jokes on the battlefield. One day she decided to see how their tank worked, and at that moment an enemy shell flew nearby. -Looked up&#8230; I don't want anymore,- she recalls that moment. From communications to UAV operatorship, from psychological support to a tank mechanic, Blondie breaks all stereotypes about women in the military. -I would like to appeal to women who are thinking about military service: do not be afraid! If you set your priorities right, there is nothing to be afraid of,- she says, appealing to the ranks of the Armed Forces. And men are advised to treat women in the army with respect - because they stand side by side with dignity. Her son Konstantin, who is 10 years old, is waiting for his mother at home. But he knows: his mother is a real hero, and he is as proud of her as all of Ukraine. As reported by ArmyInform, Oleksandr Maslyuk, military serviceman of the 67th separate mechanized brigade, known among his comrades by the call sign -Fedorovych-. Before the start of the full-scale invasion, he worked as a deputy director of one of the largest Internet companies in Kyiv region, providing people with high-quality communication. But on February 24, 2022, his life changed dramatically.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/09/blondi-na-broni-zhinka-yaka-pryruchyla-tank/	2025-02-09T08:32:25-08:00
Volodymyr Zelenskyi: the Russian army uses the mobilized as -cannon fodder-	He said this in an interview with ITV News. -Even in Kurshchyna, these 60,000 plus were not enough to push out our brigades, which were much smaller. Because their people are not so combat-ready,- Volodymyr Zelenskyi noted. The president emphasized that it was important to show the whole world that the Russian army is not as strong as it seems. According to him, Ukraine feels sorry for its people, while Russia does not feel sorry for anyone. Volodymyr Zelenskyi also emphasized the need for unity with America and Europe in confronting Russian aggression. -You can't lose Europe. This is Putin, and this is a risk for all of Europe. I think that we should unite around this risk for our population, our states,- he said. The President of Ukraine emphasized that the frozen conflict will lead to the fact that Putin will return again with his aggression. -Then who will receive the awards? Who will then go down in history as the winner? But no one. And it will be an absolute defeat for everyone,- he noted. Volodymyr Zelenskyi emphasized the importance of the war not just ending, but also making it impossible for Putin to start a war against Ukraine again. -Putin's victory is the loss of the Western world: both Europe and America. And it will never stop. And as long as he lives, he will take the lives of others, because he will continue to fight,- concluded the President of Ukraine. As reported by ArmyInform, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky believes that the unique experience of the Defense Forces in the fight against Iranian drones is extremely valuable to its Western partners, including the United States.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/09/volodymyr-zelenskyj-rosijska-armiya-vykorystovuye-mobilizovanyh-yak-garmatne-myaso/	2025-02-09T08:14:32-08:00
The rag did not pass: how the Predators thwarted the Russians' attempt to hang the tricolor over Tor...	The video of the combat operation was published on the brigade's page. The first group of occupiers tried to plant a flag on the copper mine. However, the -Predators- struck with a drop shot from a drone, and adjacent units covered the enemy with artillery fire. As a result, the Russian invaders did not even have time to unfurl their flag. Another group of occupiers, looking for an easier way, simply threw the tricolor on one of the buildings in the city. However, here too they were met with failure. The bomber of the -Predator- brigade demonstrated high skill by knocking down the -rag- by dropping the VOG from the drone. This incident once again emphasizes the indomitability of the Ukrainian spirit and the determination of the defenders of Toretsk. The Russian occupiers are defeated not only on the battlefield, but also in their propaganda efforts. Toretsk is Ukraine! As reported by ArmyInform, is there a place for magic on the front? Fighters of the Defence Forces from the patrol police give an affirmative answer to this question and even demonstrate it in action.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/09/ganchirka-ne-projshla-yak-hyzhaky-zirvaly-sprobu-rosiyan-povisyty-trykolor-nad-toreczkom/	2025-02-09T08:06:48-08:00

The former head of the workshop is today the commander of the group: the transformation of the Vikin...	The story of the fighter published on the page brigades Stocky and handsome, a real goatherd - that's what they say about Roman. From the outside, he may seem strict and unspeakable, but behind this exterior hides a person who does not care. His work requires calculation, precision and poise in every movement, and the nickname -Viking- best reflects his appearance and worldview. The former head of the workshop for the production of metal-plastic structures, during the three years of the war, Roman has come a long way - from ground defense to the commander of the engineering support group. The war and army positions shaped his attitude in life: he doesn't care! -The imprint on the personality and worldview postpones every exit to the position, every successful demining or demining. After all, this is a responsibility for completing the task and for one's people. That's why I experience the loss of siblings the hardest, Roman admits thoughtfully. -Every time it makes corrections to the worldview, sharpens the sense of justice, which sometimes covers up to madness, because you pass everything through the heart.- In 2022, when thousands of motivated men and women were standing in line for the TCC, Roman was among them. He knew where he was going and why. With each wave of mobilization, the need for explanations and work with people increased, but this has its positive results. In particular, in this unit, a wonderful team has been created, where brothers stand firmly for each other. The war made adjustments in the lives of many people. Someone decided to defend the country, and someone decided to sit back. -I decided to go to war to protect my family and friends. Someone, on the contrary, decided to sit down. This is everyone's personal matter, says Roman. — But they try not to communicate with me, because they have nothing to talk about. And for my part, I think so: you weren't there when I was bad, so why are you here now, when I'm fine?-. As reported by ArmyInform, a resident of Volyn, Lyudmila Kostyuk, has been serving in the Armed Forces of Ukraine for the third year with her cat No Nickname Grigio.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/09/kolyshnij-nachalnyk-czehu-sogodni-komandyr-grupy-transformacziya-vikinga-na-vijni/	2025-02-09T07:32:25-08:00

The Ground Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces are the leaders in the use of electronic reports in ...	This is reported by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Over the past month, 100 military units of the Ground Forces submitted and successfully processed at least one electronic report for the first time. This indicates significant progress in the digitization of military documentation and the simplification of reporting procedures for servicemen. The Operational Command -West- of the Ground Forces was especially noted, which became the undisputed leader in terms of the number of reports submitted to the Armed Forces - more than 12,500! It is important to note that 100% of the military units that are part of this command already actively use -Army+- to process reports. Among all military units of the Ground Forces that actively use -Army+-, it is worth noting the top 5 brigades in terms of the number of fully processed reports: 23rd separate mechanized brigade - 1,347 reports; 44th separate artillery brigade named after Hetman Danylo Apostol - 1,113 reports; 15th Separate Black Forest Artillery Reconnaissance Brigade - 1,073 reports; 159th Separate Mechanized Brigade - 692 reports; 47th Separate Artillery Brigade - 677 reports. These figures testify to the high efficiency of using the -Armiya+- application and the active participation of servicemen in the process of digitalization of the Armed Forces. The introduction of electronic reports through -Army+- is an important step on the way to creating a modern, technologically advanced army. This application not only simplifies the procedure for submitting reports, but also contributes to increasing the efficiency of military management and reducing the bureaucratic burden on military personnel. The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine continues to work on expanding the functionality of -Army+- and implementing new digital services to meet the needs of servicemen and increase the country's defense capabilities. As reported by ArmyInform, a meeting was held in the Republic of Poland to discuss changes and coordinate further joint actions within the framework of the Main Planning Conference Framework Program for the Development of Operational Forces (OFDeF).	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/09/suhoputni-vijska-zsu-lidery-z-vykorystannya-elektronnyh-raportiv-u-sichni/	2025-02-09T06:26:44-08:00
Ukraine increased drone production tenfold: 200,000 FPVs per month	told First Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine, Lieutenant General Ivan Havryliuk. Separately, Ivan Havrylyuk noted the development of unmanned systems. If at the beginning of 2024, the number of FPV attack drones used to attack the enemy was about 20,000 per month, now this figure has increased to 200,000. This indicates a significant increase in the technological potential of the Ukrainian army. In 2025, the supply level of unmanned systems, especially FPV drones, is about 200 thousand per month and continues to grow. -This applies not only to FPV drones, but also to other unmanned systems used by the Defense Forces. In particular, work is actively underway on the introduction of ground robotic complexes. Special attention is paid to their use for logistical tasks, demining and demining operations, as well as the evacuation of the wounded,- said the lieutenant general. According to him, performing these tasks is particularly dangerous for servicemen because they are in open terrain and are at the highest risk of injury. That is why these functions are planned to be transferred to ground-based robotic complexes so that operators can control them from safe places. As reported by ArmyInform, Ukraine surpasses Russia in the production of FPV drones.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/09/ukrayina-zbilshyla-vyrobnycztvo-droniv-u-desyat-raziv-200-tysyach-fpv-na-misyacz/	2025-02-09T06:11:08-08:00

Thanks to the joint work of mine action operators and demining units, this figure was reduced to 139 thousand square kilometers, and the work continues. -The goal is to clear the territory of explosive objects as soon as possible to ensure the safety of citizens and to restore the full activity of the agricultural sector and other enterprises. However, complete demining of Ukraine may take tens of years,- Ivan Havryliuk emphasized. According to the First Deputy Minister of Defense, Ukraine is working together with international partners to speed up this process.

Here, the depth of the front is quite large, and since the forest strips have already virtually disappeared from the expanses of the Taurian steppes, we have all the occupiers in the palm of our hands. And we have the opportunity to impress them even at the moment of nomination. But at the same time, they release a large number of drones on our positions. FPV drones. Including on optical fiber,- said Dmytro Pelikh. As for the accumulation of forces by the enemy, according to him, it is insignificant.

Thus, according to the data of the Kharkiv Institute of Social Research and the -Voices of Children- foundation, as early as 2021, 29,000 children joined the ranks of the Russian -children's and youth military-patriotic- organization -Yunarmiya- in Crimea alone, that is, every tenth student of the peninsula. And in the territory of the so-called -LDNR- there were about 7,500 children in the -Yunarmy- at the end of 2021. In particular, students of the eleventh grade who study on the territory of the TOT of Ukraine are offered training at the faculty of the rear of the Russian Federation of the state-owned educational institution -Perm Military Institute of the National Guard of the Russian Federation-. It is also known about cases when policemen at the TOT of Ukraine campaigned for children from boarding schools to enter specialized educational institutions of the Ministry of Education in the future or, even simpler, to go serve as policemen in occupation administrations without special education immediately after finishing school. The Russian Federation also plans to double the number of students in schools with military training in the occupied territories of Ukraine. In particular, on the base of the Nakhimovsky school in the occupied city of Mariupol, as of September 2, 2024, 240 children between the ages of 10 and 13 lived in the barracks of the military institution, in 2025 there should already be 560 such children. -It is important to note that militarization is one of the main directions of the youth policy of the Russian Federation. In 2023, the -Avangard- year-round training and methodical center for military-patriotic education was opened, on the basis of which 3 patriotic changes were carried out for 300 children and young citizens of pre-conscription age, i.e. high school students,- the ombudsman's office emphasizes. During these shifts, pre-conscription training was conducted for Crimean schoolchildren, they were told about -Novorossiya- as originally Russian lands, including with the participation of the -junarmy-. The Russian occupation authorities are not only militarizing schoolchildren. So, for example, in the sports complex of the Mariupol State University named after O. AND. Kunji- (created by the occupation administration of Mariupol), a master class on drone racing was organized within the framework of the project -All-Russian Student League on Drone Racing (unmanned aerial vehicles)-. -Regarding the fact that Ukrainian children, who by force of circumstances ended up in the Armed Forces of Ukraine, automatically become the -military reserve- of the Russian army, it is important to note that during the survey of children at the Center for the Protection of Children's Rights who returned from the Armed Forces of Ukraine, from deportation from the Russian Federation or forced transfer from the Armed Forces of Ukraine, there are facts of popularization of joining the Russian army. It is a well-known fact that a child who has reached the age of majority in the Ukrainian Armed Forces signed a contract for military service in the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation during his stay in the Ukrainian Armed Forces,- the Secretariat replied. The available facts testify to the targeted policy of the Russian Federation in the temporarily occupied territory of Ukraine aimed at eradicating Ukrainian identity and imposing Russian militarized patriotism, they added. Representatives of the occupation authorities, as part of the project -Patriotic Education of Citizens of the Russian Federation-, -initiate- Ukrainian schoolchildren from the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine into the -Eagles of Russia-. In addition, every Monday in all institutions of the Russian Federation and schools on TOT, the so-called -Conversations about the important- take place, during which children are taught -key aspects of a person's life in modern Russia.- -This program has been in effect since September 2022, it was introduced by the Ministry of Education of the Russian Federation (Russian: Минпросвещения-) for all schools in Russia and in the occupied territories of Ukraine. Classes are held every Monday, the first lesson after the mandatory lineup with the performance of the Russian national anthem and the raising of the Russian flag. Such -conversations- are part of the -patriotic education- of the aggressor country. At the same time, children participate in writing letters of support to the military, which forms psychological loyalty to the armed forces of the occupying country,- the ombudsman's office reports. They emphasize that such actions violate international norms, including Article 38 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. And since the beginning of the full-scale armed conflict and the occupation of the territories of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, as well as Donetsk and Luhansk regions in 2022, Ukrainian studies subjects and the Ukrainian language have been reduced, stopped or banned in schools, the educational process has been militarized, and out-of-school youth movements of -patriotic education- have started to work. Starting in September 2023, schools in the occupied territories of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, as well as in Crimea, will be conducting the -cadet classes- program. Such paramilitary classes are opened on the basis of an agreement between the educational institution or the -ministries of education- of the regions of Ukraine occupied by Russia and the specialized bodies of the Russian Federation, often with the support of the regional office of the United Russia party. In the Zaporizhzhia region, the Russian Guard conducts military training for children, and in the Kherson region, the -cadet class- is opened by the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation. There are currently 128 such classes on the territory of the temporarily occupied Crimea. Militarization of children is a policy of the Russian Federation aimed at forming the loyalty of minors to the use of force methods in the regulation of interstate relations, the ombudsman's team emphasizes. -It involves in-depth military training, including training with the use of weapons, additional lessons or extracurricular activities, participation in military sports, membership in military-patriotic organizations,- the response to the request states. According to the data of the law enforcement agencies of Ukraine, the Russian Federation actively involves minors in the armed conflict in the role of spies and correctors of shelling, as well as in the campaign of forced mobilization of Ukrainian citizens in the temporarily occupied territories. A number of tools are used to recruit children: from video games to the militarization of education, recreation in military-patriotic camps, membership in the -youth army- and other military-patriotic movements. Such actions violate international law, including the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which prohibits the involvement of persons under the age of 18 in hostilities, and the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, which recognizes the involvement of children in hostilities as a war crime.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/09/kadetski-klasy-orlyata-rosiyi-i-liga-z-peregoniv-droniv-dity-v-okupacziyi-stayut-potenczijnym-vijskovym-rezervom-armiyi-rf/	2025-02-08T21:03:22-08:00
-Blockade of Leningrad 2.0-: Russia is again at war with imaginary enemies	But it doesn't matter - the main thing is that the audience grabs their hearts and shouts: -The fascists are coming again!- Propaganda media and Russian -militarists- are actively dispersing the news that -Czech politicians are calling for a new blockade of Leningrad- in view of the strengthening of sanctions against the Russian Federation. For confirmation, there is no official statement, only the twisted words of Czech officials and a little fantasy in the spirit of the Soviet historical drama. The reality, as always, is much less dramatic. The Czech Republic, together with the EU, really supports sanctions against Russia for its war against Ukraine. But no one proposed to repeat the blockade of Leningrad, because: First, to again exploit the theme of the -Great Patriotic War- - after all, in Putin's Russia, the past has long been more important than the present. Secondly, to put yourself in the role of -victim- - they say, -they want to destroy us again.- Third, to divert attention from their own problems - from mobilization, economic decline and total isolation. And if we talk about blockades, the real humanitarian catastrophe is not being arranged by the Czech Republic, but by Russia in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine. But you will not be told about this on Kremlin TV.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/09/blokada-leningrada-2-0-rosiya-znovu-voyuye-z-vygadanymy-vorogamy/	2025-02-08T20:51:38-08:00
Integration of combat missions: Australian aeronautical engineers have created a long-range UAV comp...	As stated in the official release posted on the Innovaero portal, the combination of Insitu Pacific's Integrator reconnaissance drone and Innovaero's One-Way Loitering (OWL) barrage munition promises to significantly increase the effectiveness of military operations, providing flexibility and accuracy on the battlefield, ArmyInform notes. As Insitu Pacific Managing Director Andrew Duggan assures, such a tandem will provide the military with both wide opportunities for intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and direct strikes at a long distance, without at the same time risking the lives of the crews of larger aircraft. Simon Grosser, CEO of Innovaero Group, explained that the Integrator/OWL pair will enable the military to detect targets at a long distance and immediately direct a kamikaze drone to them for effective destruction. -The versatility of the proposed combined ISR and strike solution will significantly shorten the sensor-shooter cycle to combat threats,- he emphasized. The basic concept of the system is to use the Integrator drone for reconnaissance, surveillance and transmission of target data. Equipped with modern optical and infrared sensors, it effectively monitors enemy activity, even in difficult weather conditions and at night. SATCOM BLOS (Beyond Line of Sight) provides control over hundreds of kilometers, making the system ideal for use in restricted access areas. Once the target is identified, the OWL kamikaze drone is launched from a ground catapult. Thanks to its folding wings, it is easily transported and deployed in combat conditions. Using built-in electro-optical and infrared cameras, the OWL is able to accurately target even moving targets. A variety of warheads, including armor-piercing and fragmentation warheads, make it a versatile tool for destroying equipment and fortifications. As reports Insitu Pacific (IPL) on its website, the Integrator is a modern device that provides UAV capabilities of groups 4 and 5 in a drone of group 3. To understand the picture, it is worth telling which means belong to these groups according to the classification of the US Federal Aviation Administration: - Group 3. Weight - more than 25 kg and less than 598 kg, flight height - up to 5.5 km, maximum speed - 463 km/h. - Group 4. Weight - more than 598 kg, flight height - up to 5.5 km, speed - no restrictions. - Group 5. Weight - more than 598 kg, flight height - more than 5.5 km, maximum speed - unlimited. The company emphasizes that it is thanks to the SATCOM satellite communication system that BLOS Integrator is able to operate at a great distance from the operator. The basic version is equipped with an electro-optical thermal imager, a medium-wave infrared camera, as well as an infrared marker for illuminating targets. As IPL representatives assure, the experience of such drones already includes more than a million hours, which makes these drones one of the most innovative and reliable unmanned aerial systems in the world. Integrator Specifications: OWL Specifications: A key element in the successful implementation of the new system will be the integration of a single Insitu Pacific ground control station and INEXA software. This solution will allow both drones to be used within a single operational network, minimizing management complexity and speeding up decision-making. Prospects for the application of this technology include border protection, suppression of key adversary nodes, and prompt response to threats. The developers' long-term plans include improving the autonomy characteristics and introducing artificial intelligence to increase the system's independence in combat conditions. The combination of Integrator and OWL drones reflects a modern approach to warfare where mobility, precision and speed are key. Australian engineers have created a long-range UAV complex for reconnaissance and strikes.

-Registration- at the position, exits -in gray- and Russians-zombaks: an infantryman of the 141st br...	Why is it better for a position to take more BC and less food? But how many times a day did you have to repel enemy assaults? The soldier told our correspondent about it. -In 2023, I was walking around the city, I was met by the military TCC. They offered to go serve. I say: -That's not a question!-. He got into the car with them and drove off. Later he ended up in the 141st brigade. During my term, I had the profession of a signalman. And already after the beginning of a large-scale invasion in his brigade, he learned what it is to be a real infantryman. Well, recently I started learning to fly a UAV for myself. Modern warfare demands it. First, in the year 2023, I performed a task on one of the southern directions. There, by the way, he was wounded and contused. So, in the south, the enemy stormed us in twos, as a rule. And I did not let their infantry closer than 100 meters to my positions. I was pretty pumped up at the time, let's just say. I had everything: I took 10 grenades with me, I had a receiver, and I took grenades on the receiver. I hardly took water with food, but I took a lot of BC (ammunition - ed.). We held our positions, but sometimes in the evening we went out -gray-, we could still storm something there. That is, if you spot an enemy somewhere, you need to go there, throw a grenade there, for example. And back then come back. There was a situation that we also went out into the field to storm. It was in the afternoon. And we had to jump into the hole to hide from the enemy. And there were many of their corpses in the pit. We hid under them for some time, covered ourselves so that we would not be noticed from the sky. Once I entered a position for three days and exited on the twelfth day. It's just that then the situation developed like this&#8230; Someone had to do the job. The guys who changed me joked then: -Did you register here?-. So, in the south, the enemy infantry came at us like zombies. You beat them, but they still go and go. As the rule of twos. It happened that they also drove in our direction on motorcycles. Enemy attacks were about six times a day. At first, their artillery fired for an hour. And then there was an assault. They crawled out of all the holes. And we kept it all. -Sontsepok- even beat us. Then I got out, looked, thought -Well, thank God I'm not there.- It hit 600 meters from us. There was also a case when I hit an enemy soldier three times with a machine gun: two in the armor and one in the body. He frowned, but went on. It felt like he was under the influence of some substances. Next to him, the discharge broke, this soldier first fell, and then got up and went on. But he reached the wood and fell down, began to wave a white handkerchief, saying that he was giving up. Each of them had such a white handkerchief. &#8230;And here, where we are standing now, on one of the eastern directions, about seventy percent are trained enemy attack aircraft, they clearly know what to do. Able to storm and take a stand. And here they don't go in twos, here around four people go with them. And if they get to the landing, then they continue to do their business. And here they hit more KABs, and after them their attack planes come. And they go almost 24/7. I don't know where they get people for this. All we do is bring a new BC to our positions. As soon as someone is injured, no one evacuates him. And they are there on the field and -come- by themselves.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/09/propyska-na-pozycziyi-vyhody-po-siromu-ta-rosiyany-zombaky-pihotynecz-141-yi-brygady-rozpoviv-pro-vorozhi-shturmy/	2025-02-08T20:34:50-08:00

According to the head of state, if now the Iranian -Shahedy- launched by the Russian Federation are flying to Ukraine, then in the future they will be able to cover much greater distances. -Iran with its drones is a threat to everyone. If their drones fly thousands of kilometers, what prevents them from flying 10,000 kilometers? Nothing. It's only time. A little time will pass - and they will have all this. And you must have protection: America needs protection, other countries, the Middle East — they need peace. Fact. Europe too. And where can you get this experience today? You can take it only from us. I think that we are here, if not strong partners, - we are the only partners for America in these modern technologies of anti-war, anti-attacks, anti-Iranians,- the President emphasized.

From the driver of Ukrzaliznytsia to the commander of IRIS-T: the story of a Ukrainian warrior who d...	The story of the fighter was made public on the page of the Air Force Command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. -We received information about the air situation and knew that Russian missiles would enter the zone of damage to our complex. On command, we brought the IRIS-T launcher into combat readiness and destroyed the enemy target in a timely manner,- says Roman. — -Already after the completion of the combat work, they were happy that the Russian deadly iron did not cause any harm.- Before the war, Roman worked as a machinist at Ukrzaliznytsia. On February 28, 2022, he voluntarily joined the TCC and joined the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. He was the commander of the reconnaissance battalion branch of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. As part of this unit, he fought in Kharkiv region and Donetsk region. -Our equipment intercepted hostile conversations on the radio. This information was essential for further planning of operations. It was useful and interesting combat work,- recalls Roman. Subsequently, he served in a separate battalion in the amphibious assault brigade as deputy commander of a platoon of anti-tank guided missiles. Took part in the liberation of Kharkiv region. -Our task was to destroy enemy armored vehicles. We went in groups to positions with anti-tank missile systems and destroyed Russian combat vehicles and tanks. Sometimes they sat in an ambush for hours to get a good shot,- says the junior sergeant. Once a cluster munition fell a meter away from Roman and did not explode. -I am a person of faith. I think the fact that I once served children in the temple saved me. My church service lasted ten years,- shares Roman. During the three years of the full-scale invasion, Roman destroyed the occupiers and enemy equipment both on the ground and in the air. The military man was awarded the award of the President of Ukraine -For the Defense of Ukraine-. Roman continues to defend his native land from enemy strikes from the air. -We have a modern and effective weapon in our hands. -I have enough strength to destroy the enemy and win,- the defender claims. As reported by ArmyInform, August 11 for paratroopers of the 82nd separate airborne assault brigade began with a task that was supposed to be another bold raid behind enemy lines. But a well-organized trap awaited them near the village of Safonivka, Kursk region. Enemy units, already ready for the Ukrainian offensive, deployed fire ambushes, threatening the complete destruction of two airborne assault companies. And it was at this moment that -Jack- - the commander of the 6th company - came to the front.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/08/vid-mashynista-ukrzaliznyczi-do-komandyra-iris-t-istoriya-ukrayinskogo-voyina-yakyj-nyshhyt-voroga-na-zemli-j-u-povitri/	2025-02-08T10:12:53-08:00

About this in the broadcast of the telethon -Edyny Novyny- the commander of the 429th separate regiment of unmanned systems -Achilles- Yury Fedorenko told. For him in other words, it is possible to restrain the -rolling- despite the enemy's efforts to keep the momentum. Enemy armored vehicles end, then two-wheeled motorcycles and buggies drive. They are running out — manpower is leaving. Then they all renew their abilities and again repeat a kind of -carousel-. They stop the Russians by all possible means. For example, by mining. -Mines do not appear by themselves on the enemy's advance routes. In order for this mine to appear, the command post must plan where specifically to place the mine barrier. Night crews should use heavy bombers to install mine barriers. As a result, a significant amount of the enemy's equipment does not reach specified boundaries precisely because of remote mine-mining,- - noted the commander of the 429th separate regiment of unmanned systems -Achilles- Yury Fedorenko. How reported ArmyInform, in Chasovo Yaru, the enemy is actively using combined assault tactics. However, it advances into the city only when it completely wipes out the Defense Forces' fortifications from the land.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/08/atrakczion-vgamuvaly-minamy-prosuvannya-voroga-na-kupyanskomu-napryamku-suttyevo-pryzupynyly/	2025-02-08T09:53:34-08:00
-Melman- is a combat medic who saves lives in Donetsk region	The story of the fighter was made public on the page of the National Guard of Ukraine. Together with his brothers, Danylo performed combat missions in the hottest points of the front, in particular, in Donetsk region, providing assistance and saving the lives of guardsmen. More often he succeeds, but there are situations in which doctors are powerless. The most difficult thing, as Danylo says, is when wounded and dead people appear on your shift. -The most difficult period during my entire time in the military was when we moved from the Serebryansky Forest to the village of Nelipivka, where I stayed with my brothers from Azov for a week. I stepped into the ambulance at about 10:00 p.m., and in about an hour and a half I left for the first wounded man. We took him and handed him over to the doctors from Azov, after which we returned and went to rest. But in two hours I was woken up and told that I had to go for two more wounded. Fortunately, everything ended well this time. The most terrible thing happened on the second day of my duty, when we were informed about the death of the platoon chief sergeant named Petrovych. When I dragged Petrovych into the car, I could not believe that he was no longer alive. I realized this only when we brought him and handed him to the medical girls in the evacuation vehicle. -Unfortunately, every day I only heard the callsigns of my brothers: one is 200, the other is 300. It's very difficult,- Melman recalls. This story is just one episode of the difficult and dangerous work of a combat medic on the front lines. Every day, Danylo and his brothers risk their lives to save others. Their courage and dedication to their work deserve respect and gratitude. As reported by ArmyInform, the war has become a part of life for many, but for one man it has become a multi-year ordeal that stretches across different conflicts and continents. His call sign is -The Enemy-. This is not just a name on the front, but the result of many years of struggle, which began in Ichkeria, then continued in Afghanistan, and now he is defending Ukraine from invaders.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/08/melman-bojovyj-medyk-yakyj-ryatuye-zhyttya-na-donechchyni/	2025-02-08T09:38:40-08:00

- There were no provisions, water was drawn from puddles - the Russians are driven to storm Pokrovsk...	About this in the broadcast of -Social News- Denys Votsko, chief of staff of the 3rd battalion of the NSU -Spartan- brigade, told For According to him, from time to time the soldiers of the Defense Forces take prisoners. Enemy attack aircraft tell a lot of interesting things about their attacks. Yes, one of groups attacked Ukrainian positions on foot for 14 kilometers. They had no provisions, so the Russians drew water from puddles, and looked for food wherever they could. -It is said that there were 10 groups of 6 servicemen, of which were only 4 servicemen. But three of them were also killed later, and he was left alone,- - said the chief of staff of the 3rd battalion of the NGU -Spartan- brigade. How reported ArmyInform, in Chasovo Yaru, the enemy is actively using combined assault tactics. However, it advances into the city only when it completely wipes out the Defense Forces' fortifications from the land.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/08/proviziyi-ne-bulo-vodu-cherpaly-z-kalyuzh-rosiyan-zhenut-shturmuvaty-pokrovsk-nache-rabiv/	2025-02-08T08:57:46-08:00

- Putin is not preparing for negotiations at all - — The President met with the new head of the NATO...	The President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, announced this on Saturday, February 8. According to him, one of the main topics during the meeting was the preparation for -Ramstein- and -the needs of our defense - our common defense.- -Now we know - our intelligence reports to us - that the Russians are creating new divisions, developing new military industries. Obviously, their cooperation with North Korea will continue to expand. -Unfortunately, Moscow is spreading modern war technologies to that region, in particular drone technologies,- the head of state noted. In his opinion, this can mean only one thing: -Putin is not preparing for negotiations, not for the coming of peace, but for the continuation of the war,- and not only against Ukraine. -They are now increasing their army by more than 100,000 soldiers. All partners must know about it and must see it. We are ready to pass on relevant information, and relevant communication is already taking place along the line of intelligence. We must see together what the threats are and what our countermeasures are. A clear understanding is needed: here, in Europe, every country will have to strengthen its defense, and the goal of 5% of GDP for defense will not disappear from the agenda,- emphasized Volodymyr Zelenskyy. As reported by ArmyInform, the Ukrainian President told journalists the main goals of the Kursk operation.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/08/putin-gotuyetsya-zovsim-ne-do-peremovyn-prezydent-zustrivsya-z-novym-glavoyu-vijskovogo-komitetu-nato/	2025-02-08T07:54:06-08:00

Oleksandr Syrsky summed up the results of the year of work as the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Fo...	On this occasion, he decided to sum up his work during this time. -The composition of the military leadership of the Armed Forces was updated, new commanders were appointed. During the year, my deputies, the General Staff team, commanders and our soldiers and sailors, sergeants and foremen, officers and generals are in the ranks with me. Together, we stopped the enemy's offensive in Kharkiv Oblast, prevented the offensive in Sumy Oblast, and transferred the war to the enemy's territory. Together we restrain the ongoing offensive of the aggressor in the east. Together, during the year, we destroyed more enemy manpower, military equipment and military facilities than in the previous years of the war combined. Thank you to each and every one who loyally and courageously fights for our Motherland,- he wrote on Facebook. The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces also recalled that a year ago, the heavy defense of Avdiivka continued. -Our units were semi-surrounded. One of my first decisions as the Central Committee was to order an organized withdrawal from the city destroyed by artillery and anti-aircraft guns. This is our key priority: saving people's lives. Therefore, the Armed Forces have developed and implemented a comprehensive program -Saving the lives of servicemen-. The key directions of the program are: technologicalization of the army, improvement of training of Ukrainian defenders, improvement of medical assistance at all stages,- the general explained. Another priority for him was the principle of -fight from afar-. -During 2024, the state has deployed more than 1.3 million drones to the front. We were the first in the world to create the Forces of Unmanned Systems, scaled the already existing legendary units -Birds of Magyar-, -Achilles-, -K-2- and others. We are developing directions of robotic platforms, land and sea drones. Over the course of a year, the number of targets hit by UAVs of various types exceeded 461,000,- Oleksandr Syrsky states. In addition, a year ago the advantage of Russian troops in artillery ammunition was about 1:10, while today this ratio has decreased to almost 1:2. According to the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Ukraine owes this to its Western partners, domestic gunsmiths and counter-battery warfare (13,050 enemy artillery systems in 2024 compared to 8,400 in the two previous years. However, the achievements of the Armed Forces of Ukraine over the past year do not end there: Priority 3: to win, prepare. Despite the continuous pressure of the aggressor on the battlefield, we maximum effort to improve the training of Ukrainian military personnel. This made it possible to increase the training program, in particular, to extend the basic training to 2 months. In addition, I insist on providing 14-day adaptation course in military units after BZVP even before combat work.The more prepared and psychologically stable a soldier is, the stronger our positions will be at the front. This year, for the first time, training on foreign models of weapons and military equipment is carried out not abroad, but in Ukraine, which significantly optimizes costs and time. This became possible due to an increase in the number of instructors trained abroad. The share of sergeants and key specialists — snipers, sappers, combat medics — trained in Ukraine has also increased relative to foreign countries. Priority 4: Russia on fire. The escalation of strikes against military facilities on enemy territory continues. Military units, arsenals, storage warehouses, workshops of military-industrial complex enterprises, oil refineries that provide fuel for the Russian army, and other objects will be attacked as long as Moscow's aggression against our country continues. The DeepStrike strike distance deep into the territory of the Russian Federation has already reached 1.7 thousand. km We are preparing new long-range means, and they will be used. During this year, 377 military objects were the targets of successful complex fire damage on the territory of the Russian Federation. During the year, the Air Force and other components of the defense forces destroyed 9,200 air targets of various types, which is 2.4 times more than in 2023 (3,798). Priority 5: non-standard actions. Not only defense. Ukraine is capable of counterattacking, beating and chasing the enemy. This was proven by the defense of Kyiv, the Kharkiv offensive operation, and the liberation of the right-bank Kherson region. This was also demonstrated by the Kursk operation. We created a buffer zone in Kurshchyna, destroying the enemy's plan to launch a new offensive on Sumy and Kharkiv. This operation also eased the pressure on some areas of the front. During 6 months of active hostilities on the territory of the Russian Federation, the total losses of Russian troops in manpower amounted to more than 47 thousand people, of which more than 19 thousand were killed. Moreover, these are the most prepared Russian troops. A group of North Korean mercenaries was also defeated. During the operation, 924 soldiers of the Russian army were captured. Replenishment of the exchange fund made it possible to liberate some of our servicemen, in particular those who had been in captivity since the spring of 2022. The creation of new mechanized brigades helped to attract fresh units to the Kursk offensive. Thanks to this, we were able to withdraw three brigades of Airborne Assault Troops from Donetsk region to restore combat capability, re-equip and re-arm them, which gave the result: we have been holding hundreds of square kilometers of the territory of the aggressor country for more than 6 months. Priority 6: change to win. A year ago, we started auditing military units and military administration bodies, including the General Staff. According to the results of the audit, a number of military structures and institutions were disbanded or reduced, which made it possible to eliminate duplication of functions, remove extraneous functions and reduce unnecessarily bloated staff. The General Staff became an effective body of military management. At the expense of the released personnel, we completed the management of operational and tactical levels and combat military units. About 70,000 servicemen have been deployed to the combat zone as a result of the reduction (decrease) in the number of security, maintenance and support units. We introduced a system of promotion and appointment of officers for service in the military administration bodies, subject to the participation (experience) of servicemen in combat operations in the course of repelling the large-scale invasion of the Russian Federation. Intermediate management links were shortened and new military management bodies were formed. The personnel of the General Staff and the staff of the Commander-in-Chief were strengthened with experienced combat generals and officers. Significantly updated the command composition of compounds and units. The main criterion for appointment to positions is the ability to effectively perform combat tasks while preserving the life and health of subordinates. This year, the Armed Forces completely switched to NATO standards and principles in the training and management of troops. Priority 7: capacity building. During the year, the Armed Forces increased their combat potential, which allowed us to prevent the enemy's breakthrough and deter his offensive, despite the increase in the number of enemy troops by another 140,000. persons We created assault units (companies, battalions), which showed their effectiveness during active military operations (offensive), including in the Kursk region. Today, we are forming assault regiments on their basis. We also managed to significantly increase the capabilities of the Armed Forces to fight in the electromagnetic spectrum. In addition, a radio-electronic warfare battalion, more than a hundred EW companies in brigades and EW units in line battalions of brigades were formed. The formation of a separate educational Center for the training of radio electronic warfare specialists has begun. The -Aisberg- EW equipment management system has been developed and implemented in the troops. The codification of 83 latest EW devices was carried out and tens of thousands of devices were delivered to the troops. Capacity building of the -Pokrova- REB subsystem was carried out. We have increased our fighter air cover capabilities through the deployment of F-16s. We are also strengthening our air defense with Mirage 2000 multi-role fighters, which have already been provided by our French partners. Countermeasures and destruction of UAVs have been improved due to the involvement of combined aircraft and helicopter detachments, crews of UAV interceptors. Countermeasures against guided aerial bombs and the destruction of air defense systems were strengthened by additional deployment of modern hardware and software complexes and EW means. Direct coverage of priority objects of critical infrastructure of the fuel and energy sector and industry was carried out. We ensured a ban on the actions of the enemy's surface forces in the western part of the Black Sea, thus creating the conditions for launching a sea corridor and exports from/to the ports of Ukraine. The Russian Black Sea Fleet was forced to withdraw virtually all warships, including the Caliber carriers, from Sevastopol and Feodosia to Novorossiysk. The experience of three years of combat operations against the overwhelming forces of the enemy dictates the need for changes in the formation of groups and the structure of the troops to a more stable and manageable one. We see it and understand it. Therefore, these changes will take place soon. In particular, I initiated the transition to the corpus system. We conducted a thorough analysis of the effectiveness of the existing management system of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Based on its results, the NSDC decision put into effect the Concept of the reorganization of the Armed Forces in war conditions, developed by us with the aim of maximally realizing the combat potential of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. We have practically already begun the formation of army corps, as the first step on the way to improving our army. Despite the fact that the reform has to be implemented simply on the march, we are consistently and confidently moving along this path. In the future, we will build a clear body structure. At the end of the third year of a full-scale war, we continue to fight, however difficult it is. We are streamlining mobilization, strengthening recruiting. At the same time, in the current conditions, we cannot do without the transfer and secondment of servicemen from non-combat military units to combat units. This process is currently ongoing. After all, if the front, as they say, -falls apart-, then all our plans will not be worth a broken egg. Priority 8: unity is the key to our stability. I spent this year with our soldiers. I regularly meet with them on the front lines, hear their suggestions and wishes, work together with them at control points on new solutions for the front. I know they are tired. For many, this war has been going on for almost 11 years. The last three years — without rest, in constant struggle. Are there any problems? Yes, there is. But we are aware of these challenges and are doing our best to overcome them. History proves that Ukraine will exist as long as its Armed Forces exist. And the Armed Forces will fight as long as the Ukrainian people stand side by side with them. Let us remember that unity is what got us through 2022 and what should lead us to victory now. I see this as my mission and fulfill it. And finally, but most importantly. When you see a tired Ukrainian soldier who has come from the front for a few days to see his family, approach him and say thank you. Because we are all family. Because this soldier is the only one standing between you and the ruthless Russian invader.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/08/oleksandr-syrskyj-pidbyv-pidsumky-svoyeyi-roboty-za-rik-na-posadi-golovnokomanduvacha-zsu/	2025-02-08T05:51:14-08:00
- We expect to ride on horses and donkeys - - the fighters of the 3rd OSH defeated the Russian elite...	This was reported by the 3rd separate assault brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on Saturday, February 8. According to reports, the so-called -elite- Kantemyrivsk 4th Tank Division of the USSR attempted to break through with a column of armored vehicles with the participation of buggies. -Having come under artillery fire, the enemy lost the first two BMPs already at the crossing - the equipment simply drowned. The forces of the FPV brigade entered the work, which struck during the movement of the enemy column. The infantry disembarked from the vehicles unscheduled and were finished off with skirmishes and artillery. The epic assault of the Russians ended with the destruction of the BREM, which was driven to evacuate the -sunkers-, the report says. As a result, Ukrainian defenders destroyed 10 units of enemy tanks, BMPs and other vehicles. In addition, 10 occupiers were eliminated, and about 30 more were injured. -We are watching how the First Tank Army of the Russian Federation is confidently turning into the First Cavalry Army. And we expect new rides on horses and donkeys,- jokes the commander of the 3rd OSHB Andriy Biletskyi on this occasion. As ArmiyaInform reported, the fighters of the Defense Forces managed to stop the enemy assault on their positions before it started.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/08/ochikuyemo-nakaty-na-konyah-i-vislyukah-bijczi-3-oshb-rozgromyly-na-harkivshhyni-tankovu-elitu-zs-rf/	2025-02-08T05:37:39-08:00
-Youtube-, -Pastet- and -Zidan-: the story of three Ukrainian soldiers who destroyed the enemy in hi...	This is discussed in a post on the brigade page. They were tasked with occupying an observation post recently vacated by Ukrainian troops and replacing their comrades. Six kilometers on foot in full gear, trying to remain undetected, an extremely difficult task, but they made it. They equipped a -point- and spent a week there, watching everything fly over their heads that can only fly in such conditions. And then the assaults began. Armored vehicles of the occupiers moved forward. Our heroes remained in shelter, passing important information to the commander -Cat-. Meanwhile, Ukrainian artillery, together with drones, methodically destroyed the enemy. And what is interesting: the occupiers, despite the losses, repeated the same maneuvers again and again during the following days - and each time received a crushing blow. They did not even suspect that invisible -ghosts- were watching literally a few tens of meters from them. And our boys had a hard time. The enemy came upon them again and again, and they had to fight close quarters, repelling attacks. At one of these moments, YouTube, who went on a mission for the first time, fell into a trap: he believed that the occupiers wanted to surrender and was seriously wounded. And all the responsibility for the further battle fell on -Pate-. However, even after that, our scouts did not give up. They survived, fought, held on as best they could. They were constantly helped by drone pilots - they dropped water, food, BC, cigarettes and painkillers and antibiotics for the wounded. And when the first opportunity appeared, the command conducted an evacuation operation, and all three were able to get out. They killed at least ten occupiers, helped burn more enemy equipment and manpower, and, most importantly, returned alive. But there is one more important point. -Youtube- and -Pastet- are fighters who previously voluntarily left another unit (SZCH). But they returned. They understood: fighting is not just a duty, it is the only choice. Because someone has to defend Ukraine. Now they are serving in the 23rd separate mechanized brigade, treating their injuries and preparing for new tasks. As reported by ArmyInform, Yevgeny, known among his peers by the nickname -Instructor-, recently taught children at school in Kyiv Oblast.

However, as you know, for the spell to work, a falling star is necessary, and the -Predator- brigade has plenty of them for the Russian occupiers. To confirm this, the patrol officers shared a corresponding video on their social networks, in which the invaders have a unique opportunity to use the magic of Ukrainian defenders to make their last wish. -FPVs fall, we make a wish. Predators have their own magic: one click - and the enemy's body is on fire. One more click and the occupier misses the head. Sometimes there are -talented- actors - they fall even before the impact,- law enforcement officers comment on the released footage. Moreover, as ArmyInform reported, Ukrainian drones are able not only to fulfill wishes, but also even resurrect the dead occupiers, though, not for long.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/08/u-hyzhakiv-svoya-magiya-patrulni-skydayut-na-okupantiv-fpv-zirky-a-ti-zagaduyut-ostannye-bazhannya/	2025-02-08T04:57:25-08:00
-Athena- in the service of the Defense Forces: a four-legged helper of heavy bomber drones	About the four-legged assistant it was told on the brigade page. Its owner Igor, alias -Rama-, says that he got the dog when he was still serving in the infantry, he wanted to go on assaults with it, taught him to jump into enemy trenches. But later the boy transferred to the UAV unit, and these skills acquired during the training of -Athena- were never needed. Instead, others came to the rescue - by delivering the necessary items to the position of the unit. -It happens that we are at a point, we are working, and we suddenly need something - you don't want to call a car for this and -burn- your position. — Narrated by -Rama-. — I communicate by radio with the guys who are on the spot, they attach a first aid kit, or batteries, or something else to Athena, then raise the radio to her, I give the command, and my little one flies to us like an arrow. In general, the Malinois breed is ideal for use in the military, for example they serve in the Israeli army. These dogs are easy to learn, clearly follow commands, are not demanding in care. -Athena- in me is generally smart: she does what she has to do without being distracted by any stimuli - be it gunshots, explosions, or just other dogs or cats. A true fighter will always follow the orders of the commander. And she is the best friend, faithful and reliable.- As reported by ArmyInform, senior driver of the mortar battery of the 32nd OMBr Viktor, a 46-year-old father of three children from Cherkassy, ​​is one of those humble heroes whose exploits are not always visible.

And our brigades took successful steps. They did everything beautifully. It was very dangerous,- the head of state explained. At the same time, he noted that it will be possible to fully assess the results of the Kursk operation only later. -Everything that the Kursk operation did, we will be able to properly evaluate only after analysis, probably after the end of the war, analyzing certain military, political, military-political steps,- Volodymyr Zelenskyi said.

-Even trepanation didn't help-: the Russian rocket-killer -killed himself-	This was reported by the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. The explosion that killed him did not go off in Ukraine, but in the rear of Shuya, Ivanovo region of the Russian Federation, where he was serving. On 3 January 2025, the captain sustained multiple injuries. Russian medicine tried to do the impossible, but even trepanation of the skull did not save him from his just fate.

From Ichkeria to Ukraine: The border guard's path to the pseudo-Enemy-	The story of the fighter was made public on the DPSU page. Since 2019, he has been serving in the ranks of the State Border Service of Ukraine, becoming a contractor, and has chosen for himself the difficult but critically important role of an explosives engineer. For him, war is a reality with which he lives not for the first time. From Ichkeria to the current front in Ukraine, his path was not easy, but he continues to stand in defense of his native land, because this is his mission. The video posted on the DPSU page reveals his thoughts and experiences. Dushman says that the destruction he saw in Ichkeria is now being repeated in Ukraine. According to him, the enemy has not changed: -They must be destroyed.- It was this that became his driving force when he learned of the death of his family during the war. -I don't care, I'm not afraid of anything,- he says. It became a moment when he had nothing to lose and decided to do what others could not. As an explosives engineer, he deals with high explosives, explosives and other explosive objects, creating means to destroy the enemy. He does not just perform the task, but also makes special means with the maximum effect himself. -We've already shown what we do ourselves, we crush ourselves,- he says. As he notes, the State Border Service of Ukraine is the -shield of the country-, and every soldier here is an important link in its protection. -We need you,- he tells the new recruits, to whom he imparts his knowledge and experience. For Dushman, the main goal is not only to neutralize the enemy, but also to return to his native Mariupol to be near those he loves. The war changed him, but it also imprinted in him an unshakable determination and belief in victory. As reported by ArmiyaInform, Viktor, a 46-year-old father of three from Cherkaschyna, a senior driver of a mortar battery platoon of the 32nd OMBr, is one of those humble heroes whose exploits are not always visible.

Within the scope of the project, the training of future social support officers for representatives of combat units took place at the base of the patronage service of the Third Separate Assault Brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. -The task of the project is to make the support of our military systematic and effective. From the moment of injury to full recovery and return to duty, a fighter should know that he will not be left alone with his problems. Help and support will also be provided to the families of the dead and the missing,- noted the Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine, Brigadier General of Justice Serhiy Melnyk. The event, which was held in a mixed format (online and offline), was attended by representatives of the military units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection of Ukraine.

Ivan Petrychak, a representative of the press service of the 24th separate mechanized brigade named after King Danylo, told about this on the air of the Yedyni Novyny telethon. According to him, the enemy's tactics are now mixed. If earlier the enemy came in small groups of attack aircraft that literally walked kilometers to Ukrainian positions, now that has changed. Apparently, the enemy wants to save time, so they throw assault groups using large numbers of BMDs - amphibious assault vehicles. The -Royal Infantry- take turns burning these armored vehicles with infantry. -This infantry is hurrying, dispersing. Unfinished ones are then regrouped. And from the basements - we are fighting in the buildings - from the bushes and forests, they are trying to unite again. Renew your strength and attack,- Ivan Petrychak said. As ArmyInform reported, enemy attacks on the Seversky direction depend on the weather - during cold weather, equipment is actively involved, including tanks, BMPs, buggies, motorcycles and ATVs. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/08/bojova-mashyna-domovyna-v-chasovomu-yaru-rosijskyh-desantnykiv-aktyvno-palyat-razom-z-yihnoyu-broneyu/	2025-02-08T03:02:17-08:00
Fake from the enemy: Russia is preparing a provocation against the Coordination Staff on the Treatme...	They reported this on their page. The enemy plans to distribute forged documents with the emblems of the Coordination Headquarters, which will contain false information. These papers do not meet the standards of document circulation, contain fictitious names of officials and names of regional units. The purpose of such forgeries is to discredit the work of state institutions and to sow distrust among the population. The occupiers do not stop trying to manipulate the families of captured, missing and enslaved civilians. To do this, they use lies and substitution. In this regard, GUR urges citizens to be attentive and vigilant, not to spread misinformation on social networks and not to trust unverified persons and organizations that may offer assistance. Please report any attempt to demand money for -services- related to enslaved Ukrainians to the law enforcement authorities immediately. We emphasize that all the assistance of the Coordinating Headquarters specialists is free of charge. This incident is another example of how the Russian occupiers use dirty methods of information warfare to achieve their goals. It is important to remain calm and be critical of any information, especially if it concerns the sensitive topic of prisoners of war. As reported by ArmyInform, the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine addressed to the military personnel with an important appeal. Intelligencers ask to hand over samples of Russian scientific and technical products for detailed analysis.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/08/fejk-vid-voroga-rosiya-gotuye-provokacziyu-proty-koordynaczijnogo-shtabu-z-pytan-povodzhennya-z-vijskovopolonenymy/	2025-02-08T02:47:13-08:00

According to them, thermal imaging cameras helped them destroy the Russian invaders so effectively. -Thanks to the coordinated work of the crews on night cameras that tracked the targets' signatures, we accurately hit and eliminated the enemy's assault unit.

According to him, now the enemy is throwing the maximum number of his troops there. The goal is to reach the Pokrovsk-Pavlograd route, gain a foothold there, and cut off the logistics of the Defense Forces. However, so far the enemy's achievements are such that hundreds of their fighters are dying in this direction. -Foot assaults mainly. They drive cars - Nivas, UAZs, buggies, motorcycles. 2-3 cars each. A goal is given - to one of our positions. They approach on these machines at maximum speed, land, and then they already have the goal of gaining a foothold somewhere in our already abandoned dugouts. And then we have to smoke them all night until the morning,- said Serhii Tsehotskyi. As reported by ArmyInform, in the Pokrovsky direction, in the zone of responsibility of the Kara-Dag brigade, the situation remains extremely tense and complicated. The enemy relentlessly continues to storm positions along the entire front line, using the tactics of small groups of infantry. There are fewer mechanized assaults due to the fog.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/08/pihota-yide-na-legkovyh-avtomobilyah-u-sylah-oborony-rozpovily-kudy-rvetsya-vorog-na-pokrovskomu-napryamku/	2025-02-08T02:26:26-08:00

-The main thing is to deliver BC-: how a driver with the call sign -Zhyvyy- risks his life every day...	The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. -It's hard, but it's stimulating joy that we have something to shoot, which is to destroy the occupiers,- Victor says, calmly speaking of the constant risk and danger that accompany his missions. However, his biggest fear is not getting ammunition to the positions or getting his comrades off the battlefield. Called up for service back in 2014, Viktor received the call sign -Live- and since then has become an integral part of the 32nd Brigade. For his courage and bravery, he was awarded the Order of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine - the Golden Cross. Despite this, he remained humble and noted that the real heroes are those on the front lines, and his role is only to help. To save life in conditions of constant danger, Viktor shares his advice for military drivers: before leaving, the car must be carefully prepared and refueled, it is important to have a charged EW to protect against drones. Helmet and bulletproof vest are a must. His secrets are maneuvering, being fast and always changing routes, as well as acting on intuition at night, when the effectiveness of aerial reconnaissance is reduced. The main talisman for Victor is the prayers of his mother and wife, and his motivation is the desire to return to his children. There is calmness in his words, but also the strength he draws from every road traveled and every shipment delivered. Victor is another one of the many who actually hold the front, risking their lives for the future of their country. As reported by ArmyInform, at this moment -Jack- - the commander of the 6th company - came to the front.

- The law is like a bridle: where you turn, that's where it turned out - - the occupiers continue to...	This was reported by the head of the Luhansk OVA, Artem Lysogor. The so-called -People's Council of the People's Republic of China- adopted changes to the regional law regulating the use of real estate. According to the new rules, up to 35% of residential premises, which the court recognizes as municipal property, can be transferred to the federal property of Russia. Another 30% will be owned by -LNR-. And in order for everything to go smoothly, among those who will receive these apartments in priority order will be&#8230; judges The same ones who will decide on nationalization. While the occupiers are legalizing apartment raids, about 60,000 public sector workers in the occupied Luhansk region are still without salaries for 2014-2015. The total debt already exceeds a billion rubles, and the collection of documents continues. It is obvious that no one will see the money, because the occupiers have other priorities - the razing of real estate. Thus, the residents of the temporarily occupied Luhansk region received another -gift- from the Russian authorities: their apartments are taken, and their debts are not returned. But -Russian peace- promised something completely different, didn't it? As reported by ArmyInform, the occupiers gave exactly three weeks to the residents of a high-rise building in the new districts of Severodonetsk, which is in the temporarily occupied territory. href=-https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/pakujte-valizy-ta-gotujte-gamanczi-okupanty-stavlyat-ultymatumy-zhytelyam-tot-luganshhyny/->for resettlement and removal of property.

The tactics of using drones allow Ukrainian fighters to effectively track enemy movements, adjust artillery strikes, and inflict point damage. In the steppe area, where the enemy is trying to gain a foothold, drones become a key tool in the fight. They make it possible to detect invaders even in camouflaged positions, and then to eliminate them in a timely manner. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the 1st battalion of the 37th Marine Brigade conducted a successful operation to clear and destroy the enemy position.

-Opto-fiber vs. REB-: how the drones of the Defense Forces are using a new type of drones	For more details on the advantages and features of using this type of drones, see report of Lieutenant Serhiy Lipko on Army TV. The commander of the unmanned systems platoon of the 63rd separate mechanized brigade with the call sign -King- said that the main advantages of fiber-optic drones are an uninterrupted picture for the operator and immunity to the enemy's electronic warfare (EW) equipment. -A drone is not really that complicated,- says King. — That is, it could be produced even earlier. And it solves two very serious problems for us: the first is the REE, and the second is that our area has very rugged terrain. That is, you need to fly into hollows, you need to fly into the forest, you need to bypass several obstacles on the way to the dugout, and many of our drones were lost due to the fact that the analog video signal simply disappears due to a bad radio horizon. And here there is no radio horizon - everything is transmitted by optical fiber.- According to King, the signal is transmitted via optical fiber, which ensures a perfect picture even when flying directly over the enemy's trenches. He also noted that the drone can be used in the forest without fear of getting caught in tree branches. However, fiber-optic drones also have their drawbacks. They are larger and less maneuverable, making them easier targets for the enemy. The only way to deal with such drones is to physically destroy them with small arms or other ammunition. -If he slows down, starts to get on target, there's a very good chance he's going to get hit,- King says. As reported by ArmiyaInform, correspondents of ArmyInform visited the testing of drones flying on optical fiber and learned about the advantages they will have these UAVs on the battlefield.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/08/optovolokno-proty-rebu-yak-dronari-syl-oborony-vykorystovuyut-drony-novogo-typu/	2025-02-07T23:41:06-08:00

-Jack- Who Defied Death: How One Commander Saved Two Companies of Paratroopers and Changed the Battl...	The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. In a situation where the enemy had an advantage in numbers and fortified positions, -Jack- managed not only to knock the enemy out of an ambush, but also to occupy a strategically important line. At that moment, the fate of two Ukrainian companies literally hung in the balance. When the commander of the 7th company was wounded, -Jack- took command, uniting the two companies into a single fist. The enemy, not knowing their exact location, recklessly continued to move, which allowed the paratroopers to deliver a devastating blow. Two enemy attacks were repulsed, and as a result of well-organized fire, the enemy lost up to a company of personnel and a significant amount of equipment. After a series of successful battles, it became clear: the equipment is knocked out, the enemy knows the location of Ukrainian soldiers, and the transport and evacuation routes are blocked. But for -Jack-, there was no -surrender- option - only breakthrough. The only surviving armored personnel carrier, he organized the evacuation of the wounded commander of the 7th company and part of the soldiers, while the rest had to break through swamps, rivers and enemy barricades on foot. — -I indicated people only the end point, not the route itself. By that time, we already knew we were being tapped,- recalls -Jack.- Two days of hell. Two days without sleep or rest, with constant battles and pursuit of the enemy. But thanks to the clear coordination of actions and indomitable spirit, the Ukrainian soldiers came to their own. They came out alive. During this operation, Jack's unit destroyed about three platoons of the invaders, four units of armored vehicles and a dozen vehicles. But the main thing is that he saved more than a hundred Ukrainian soldiers who could have become victims of an enemy trap. For this feat, the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy awarded -Jack- with the highest state honor - the -Golden Star- Order of the Hero of Ukraine. As reported by ArmyInform, the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky awarded state awards to Ukrainian soldiers who are participating in the operation in the Kursk region.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/08/dzhek-yakyj-peregrav-smert-yak-odyn-komandyr-vryatuvav-dvi-roty-desantnykiv-i-zminyv-hid-boyu/	2025-02-07T22:44:22-08:00

They saved -Bogdan- under fire: -Sultan- spoke about the evacuation and repair of equipment at the f...	-Sultan- is a professional lawyer from Kyiv. Before the large-scale invasion of the Russian Federation, he worked as the deputy director of the legal department of the Tax Administration of Ukraine, the director of the legal department of the State Commission for the Regulation of Financial Services Markets and the head of the legal department at the Deposit Guarantee Fund of Individuals. He has two years of experience in military service. As part of the 53rd separate mechanized brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, he participated in the anti-terrorist operation in the Luhansk region near the settlements of Shchastya, Stanytsia Luhanska, and Krymske. Resigned from the service. From February 24, 2022, together with his eldest son, he took up the defense of the capital and Kyiv region. It was the 66th rifle battalion, formed on the basis of one of the TKC and SP Kyiv. After the liberation of Kyiv region, the unit was transferred to the Bakhmut direction. When the formation of the 48th artillery brigade began, he was offered to head the repair unit. -I have three platoons in my unit that are engaged in repair and technical recovery in their respective directions. The first platoon is engaged in the repair and maintenance of weapons. These are conventional small arms as well as artillery, except for the Bohdan self-propelled guns. Why don't we touch this art installation? Self-propelled guns are under the manufacturer's certification guarantee. Therefore, we do not have the right to do any repair and restoration work. All -repair manipulations- are carried out by the manufacturer's representatives in a safe and designated place. The -Bogdana- calculation only delivers or evacuates the car from the positions, if it is not technically sound and cannot reach the specified point on its own. In general, two enterprises of Ukraine are engaged in the repair and maintenance of the -Bohdan- self-propelled guns, while one restores the artillery part of the installation, the other - the undercarriage of the machine. Our specialists can do only minor repairs on -Bohdans-, without getting into the -guts and brains- of the machine, so to speak. What is it about? An easy repair is to get a fragment, for example, into the fuel tank of a self-propelled gun. By the way, we recently had such a case. The enemy wanted to destroy -Bogdana- with artillery strikes, fortunately, shrapnel from shells fell nearby. Then you need to quickly -fix- the problem. This is a fairly simple repair, but it must be carried out promptly so that the vehicle can leave the firing positions and leave the mission area before the arrival of a certified service, which will continue to service the vehicle in safe conditions. Thank God, this -Bohdana- is still -alive- and swarming with rasists. If the engine, gearbox, or something else in the undercarriage breaks down, or there are some deficiencies in the operation of the artillery on the -Bogdan-, you cannot climb there. There are guarantees from the factory workers, and if they -climb- there, there will be claims from the manufacturer and the repair will no longer be free. The second platoon is engaged in the repair and maintenance of automotive equipment, which is in the brigade's arsenal. There are different situations. Damaged equipment is located relatively close to the contact line or in more secure areas. It's not important. We are evacuating equipment from the dangerous zone. This is exactly the work of the third platoon, which performs the task of evacuation. If it is not possible to quickly evacuate the equipment or there is intense enemy shelling, in some places it is necessary to repair the equipment even in such difficult conditions. How our work is organized in general. The simplest example, a wheel shot out on the road or a pipe burst in the car. The repair team leaves. We have a specialized machine-workshop on wheels, with everything you need to carry out repairs in the field: tools, generator, jacks, spare parts for mechanisms that often break, welding machine and, most importantly, repair specialists, etc. That is, our task in such emergency cases is to provide quick assistance so that the car with the crew does not stay in the dangerous zone for a long time. Unfortunately, today we don't have special equipment that can pull out large and heavy cars, but we can evacuate small cars anywhere: whether it's a swamp or a reservoir, it's not important. The armed forces of the brigade have BM-27 -Hurricane- multiple rocket systems. We also repair them. Again, if it's some simple repair. More complex repairs, for example, overhauling the engine in the field, are simply impossible to do. The same applies to the armament of this installation. We send equipment to repair plants. But if, relatively speaking, candles or filters need to be replaced on the -Hurricanes-, then, of course, we restore them on the spot, in the area of ​​hostilities, in -waiting points- or areas where our artillery units are deployed. We can also solve the electronics issues of these RSZVs, we have a professional electrician who can do it. For example, some switch in a combat vehicle burned out. The repairmen of the unit risk their lives as much as the arthrocalculations of combat vehicles. The enemy conducts work within the limits of counter-battery combat, makes -marches-, calculates from where our -Bohdana- self-propelled guns will strike at the enemy. And sometimes he manages to detect the works of our gunners. the Rashists strike at the -Saushok- firing positions. We once had a case where the occupiers cut the installation with shrapnel, the machine caught fire. Our repair team needed to react quickly. After all, it was possible to save the valuable equipment, parts and mechanisms of the -Bohdana-. And the enemy continued to shell. The boys were working nearby that day and arrived quickly. Together with the crew, they saved everything that could be saved in this car. Then the specialist of the repair company was seriously injured. Combat work in our country continues around the clock and at risk to health and own life. &nbsp; The unit is made up of pros. Mechanics, auto fitters, electricians, welders, in short, people with experience in technology. There are people who, before the Great War, had never, so to speak, held tools in their hands. We have a guy in civilian life who worked in the regular department of -New Post-, now he is a good tire fitter, and the best at that. Another guy, who now mainly repairs car engines, before the invasion of the Russian Federation, worked as a loader in a private company in the Poltava region. Called up for mobilization about a year and a half ago. And now he is one of the best mechanics in my company. People do not sleep at night, repairing equipment so that it can return to the units in the combat zone as soon as possible. We try to -pump up- people who are drafted into the unit, except for the BZVP, with professional training. The other day, two boys were sent for professional training at the Armed Forces Educational Center. There they will master the repair of artillery weapons. Although in civilian life they were in no way tangential to repairs. Regarding recruiting issues. There are always not enough people. We are at war with Russia, not with some Shantrapa. We also urgently need repair specialists. The more professional specialists, the better the combat readiness of the units. This is an axiom. It is good that changes were made to the legislation of Ukraine in the fall. Now conscripts and volunteer reservists can choose a military unit for service without going to territorial recruitment and social support centers. A person can come to us directly, get the necessary information about vacancies. If everything is in order, the unit commander gives a referral to pass the VLK and that's it - the matter went further. Each conscript will be able to enter the service in the military unit to which he actually wanted to enter. This is the main thing. Our crew belongs to the priority equipment parts, so there should be no problems at all.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/08/ryatuvaly-bogdanu-pid-obstrilamy-sultan-rozpoviv-pro-evakuacziyu-ta-remont-tehniky-na-fronti-reportazh-armiyainform/	2025-02-07T20:55:02-08:00
Burnt Tambovshchyna: how an attempt to get rid of the Moscow occupation led to three famines and dep...	Today, the Kremlin in Russia's Kursk region is destroying villages with the help of aviation and artillery, purposefully dropping guided aerial bombs on civilian shelters. ArmyInform wants to remind you how back in the spring of 1921, the Red Army under the command of Tukhachevsky destroyed villages and towns in its own Tambov province using artillery, armored vehicles and chemical weapons with no less brutality. Seizing power in Russia at the end of 1917, the Bolsheviks began to carry out the so-called -military-communist- policy of pro-distribution in the villages, that is, by force, with the help of armed -pro-departments-, they took away from the peasants bread and other food necessary for the existence of the Red Army and the urban population. This policy was accompanied by the mobilization of peasants for military service, various types of duties (labor, labor, etc.). Rich in chernozem, the Tambov province was the first to feel the full burden of food distribution. Already by October 1918 there were 50 sub-units from Petrograd, Moscow and other cities with a population of up to 5,000. persons No other province of the former empire had known such plunder. After the Bolshevik marauders raked the clean grain from the peasants, it often rotted at the nearest railway stations, the advance teams drank the grain, distilled it into moonshine. To this can be added the looting and closing of churches and other atrocities committed by the Moscow horde to this day. The first form of resistance to prodrazverstka was the -quiet protest- typical of the Russian population - the reduction of the peasant's own farm. If in 1918 in the black-earth Tambov province, one peasant farm cultivated an average of 4.3 tens of acres of land, then in 1920 - 2.8 tens of acres. Fields were sown in sizes needed only for personal consumption. But soon the peasants were forced to choose between starvation and armed resistance to the new government. The situation of the peasants worsened especially sharply in 1920, when Tambov Oblast was hit by a drought, and the level of poverty remained extremely high. In a number of counties of the Tambov province, residents were forced to eat quinoa, tree bark, and nettles. The uprising broke out spontaneously in mid-August 1920. in the villages of Khitrovo and Kamianka of the Tambov district, where the villagers refused to hand over bread and disarmed the prodzach. Within a month, popular indignation spread to several districts of the province, the number of insurgents reached 4,000 armed men and about 10,000 with pitchforks and scythes. A kind of -peasant republic- was formed on the territory of Kirsanovsky, Borysoglib and Tambov counties, with its center in the village of Kamyanka. At the head of the uprising was a burgher of the city of Kirsanova, a former parish clerk and a public teacher, the Left Socialist-Revolutionary Oleksandr Antonov (1889–1922). His biography included a combative SR past, imprisonment during the tsarist years, command of the Kirsanovsky District militia after the February Revolution. He left the post of the head of the district police voluntarily due to his rejection of the Bolshevik dictatorship and the policy pursued by the new government towards the peasants. Since the autumn of 1918. Antonov formed a -combat wife- and began an armed struggle against the Bolsheviks. His unit became the organizational core of the partisan army. Under the command of Antonov, the forces of the rebels grew rapidly. This was facilitated by the clarity of the goals of the uprising (slogans -death to communists- and -for a free peasant republic-), successful military operations in favorable geographical conditions (a large number of forests and other natural shelters), flexible partisan tactics of sudden attacks and rapid retreats. In February 1921, when the insurgent movement reached its peak, the number of fighters reached 40 thousand people, the army was divided into 21 regiments and a separate brigade. Rebels ransacked state farms and communes, damaged railways. The uprising began to go beyond the local borders, finding a response in the border districts of the neighboring Voronezh and Saratov provinces. Moscow's reaction did not take long. At the end of February and the beginning of March 1921, an -authoritative commission- headed by V.A. was formed. Antonov-Ovsienko. This is the same red leader who previously commanded the so-called -Ukrainian Soviet Army- that carried out the Bolshevik occupation of Ukraine. It was this -authoritative commission- that concentrated all the power in the Tambov province in its hands. Large military contingents, equipment, including artillery, armored units and aircraft, were removed from the fronts that ended hostilities (in particular, from Ukraine). The entire province was divided into six military districts with field headquarters and emergency authorities - -political commissions-. The number of Red Army soldiers increased to 100,000 within a few months. But before that, on February 2, 1921, the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine (b) instructed M. Bukharin, E. Preobrazhensky and L. Kamenev to -develop and approve the text of the appeal&#8230; to the peasants of the Tambov province in order to distribute it only in this province, without printing it in newspapers.- It was a fake message, which announced the withdrawal of the product distribution and the permission of the local trade exchange of agricultural products. It began to be distributed already on February 9, which brought some confusion to the ranks of the rebels. 27 April 1921 at the suggestion of Lenin, the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party (b) adopted a resolution -On the liquidation of Antonov's gangs in the Tambov province-, according to which M. was appointed as the commander of the operation. Tukhachevsky. Along with him in Tambov region, the famous red punishers I. Uborevich, G. Kotovskyi, G. Yagoda, V. Ulrich, A. Levin (L. Bielskyi), Ukrainian collaborator M. Kakurin et al. A brutal military occupation of the areas controlled by the rebels began. The Red Army completely destroyed their farms and destroyed their houses, took hostages, including children, created concentration camps where the necessary information was extracted under torture, shot for disobedience, for hiding -bandits- and weapons, etc. It is estimated that during the so-called -repression of the rebellion- about 100,000 people were imprisoned and about 15,000 were shot, several dozen rural settlements were completely destroyed. In the summer of 1921, the main forces of Antonov were defeated. At the end of June and at the beginning of July, a final order was issued to them, according to which the fighting units were asked to split into groups and flee into the forests. The rebellion broke up into isolated foci, which continued to put up a desperate resistance until the end of the year. Antonov and his group were destroyed in June 1922. After that, Black Earth Tambovshchyna turned into a depopulated desert. As of 1922, 37% of the inhabitants did not have a roof over their heads, 54% did not have anything to cultivate the land, and in those farms that still held, compared to 1916, the number of working cattle decreased by 40%, sheep - by 63%, pigs - by 76%. As a result, at the beginning of 1925, Tambov region experienced a severe famine, as a result of which several thousand residents died. And then - even stronger, in 1932-1933. Despite the scale of famine and repression, the insurgent movement in Tambov region did not stop. In July 1942, during the Second World War, a partisan unit named after Antonov was formed. In Tambov, leaflets were scattered with a call to fight against the Stalinist government, and on July 26, investigator NKV Gershun was killed and a train with aviation fuel was blown up. After the Soviet government forcibly deported entire peoples from the lands where they had lived for centuries after the war, it settled in the vacated areas, just as forcibly, the so-called -legal population.- A significant number of them were -problem- residents of Tambov Oblast. In particular, about 2,000 farms were resettled from Tambov region to Crimea, in the Crimean Tatar settlement, another 2,000 to the Volga region, where Germans used to live, and 400 to Kaliningrad region. This deportation, which almost no one talks about, became the final punitive action for the population of the long-suffering region.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/08/vypalena-tambovshhyna-yak-sproba-pozbavytys-moskovskoyi-okupacziyi-pryzvela-do-troh-golodomoriv-ta-deportacziyi/	2025-02-07T20:42:22-08:00
- By subletting - in 2025: how much will military personnel be compensated for renting housing	According to the decision of the Minister of Defense, from January 1, 2025, the amount of compensation is: For servicemen who have three or more family members, the amount of compensation increases by one and a half times. This is, in fact, compensation for housing rent at the place of service. It is paid if the serviceman does not have his own housing in this territory. We note right away that the procedure for issuing compensation is not very simple and fast. And it may also require certain expenses, in particular for obtaining certificates. The basis for payment is a serviceman's report, as well as list of documents, determined by Cabinet Resolution No. 450. But if you go this way and arrange everything, you can get quite a good compensation. Currently, this applies to servicemen serving under a contract or under the draft of officers. Mobilized servicemen do not have this opportunity.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/08/pidnajom-u-2025-roczi-skilky-kompensuyut-vijskovym-za-orendu-zhytla/	2025-02-07T20:34:34-08:00
Modularity and adaptability: how the Swedish CV90 armored vehicle platform, known on the battlefield...	The topic of conversation about this tank, which is not too -hyped- in NATO countries, was the news that the defense department of Slovakia, as part of the modernization of its tank fleet, may choose a vehicle from BAE Systems when replacing the old Soviet T-72 tanks as an alternative to the more expensive American Abrams. At least this was recently reported by the Minister of Defense of Slovakia, Robert Kalinak, who was quoted by the Bratislava publication Denník N. This model is based on the CV90 platform, known for its modularity and adaptability, which allows the integration of various combat and technological systems, ArmiyaInform reports. As noted the experts of the Dutch defense technology research portal Army Recognition (AR), the aspect of budget savings may play not the last role in Slovakia's decision to purchase Swedish tanks. The CV90120-T has undergone several upgrades and the latest version is priced at €11.5 million per unit, roughly half the price of the Leopard 2A8. -While its competitive price and capabilities make it an attractive choice, the CV90120-T has yet to receive significant orders, but its affordability makes it an attractive choice for Slovakia's military modernization efforts,- AR said. Aside from the financial aspect, the CV90120-T offers additional benefits. Its integration into Slovakia's armored fleet could lead to increased industrial cooperation and standardization of the CV9035 infantry fighting vehicles already ordered by Bratislava. These potential synergies will not only improve operational efficiency, but also strengthen Slovakia's domestic defense industry by promoting increased local production. 120 mm gun CTG120/L50 (Compact Tank Gun — a compact tank gun) with a barrel length of 50 calibers was developed by the Swiss company RUAG specially for installation on light armored vehicles. To reduce recoil, the weapon is equipped with a muzzle brake. There is an ejector to blow the barrel after firing. The barrel of the weapon has a heat-insulating casing to increase the accuracy of shooting. The weapon is stabilized in two planes. The main reason for installing a 120-mm gun was the desire to combine the firepower of a tank with the mobility characteristics of a lighter vehicle. The combat weight of the CV90120-T is about 35 tons, while the vast majority of main battle tanks in the arsenal of NATO countries weigh almost twice as much. A 12-shot semi-automatic loader is mounted in the aft part of the tower. When using it, the rate of fire can reach 12-14 shots per minute. The rest of the ammunition (33 rounds) is mixed in the aft part of the hull and can be quickly loaded through the aft door. With this armament, the CV90120-T light tank has firepower similar to the Leopard 2 main battle tank, however, with a combat weight of 35 tons, the vehicle has better strategic and tactical mobility. Full ammunition is designed for 45 shots. The weapon's ammunition includes feathered armor-piercing subcaliber shells with a detachable tray (APFSDS). In addition, they may include high-explosive rounds developed by Bofors and Israel Military Industries for the Leopard-2 main battle tank. Due to the use of a digital fire control system, a high probability of hitting both moving and stationary targets with the first shot is achieved. The gunner is in control of UTAAS (Universal Tank Fire Control System, which provides for the possibility of firing at aerial targets) - a system that includes a stabilized day-night sight and a laser range finder. UTAAS is manufactured by SAAB. This system was also used in other platforms of the CV90 family. A Hagglunds company representative said that with UTAAS, the CV90 series vehicles -have higher fire accuracy than Leopard 2 tanks.- The commander's fire control system DNGS has about the same capabilities as the gunner, but his sight has the ability to change the magnification between 1.5x, 6x and 24x. In addition, there is another targeting system PLSS. It can be used by both the gunner and the commander. Moreover, the commander can search for targets and transfer them to the gunner for destruction. All crew members have monitors connected by a common data network, which increases the operational control of the CV90120-T in battle. The gunner has at his disposal a universal tank/anti-aircraft sight -Celsiustec- with day and night channels and a laser rangefinder, which is also produced for equipping other combat vehicles. The light tank CV90120-T has a layout with a forward engine compartment. This is because its chassis is a variant of the CV9040 infantry fighting vehicle chassis. This chassis was modified to fit aft of the triple turret. In addition, it has received increased booking in the front. CV90120-T frontal arc armor for the hull and turret provides protection against 30 mm armor-piercing shells and all-round protection against 12.7 mm ammunition. In addition to the main armor and the aerosol curtain deployment system, the CV90120-T was tested for the active protection system (active armor concept — AAC), which was developed for the Swedish army by the German company IBD Diesenroth Engineering together with the Swedish company Akers Krutbruk. Outside of Sweden, Diesenroth offers this system as part of its Advanced Modular Protection (AMAP-ADS or simply ADS). In Great Britain, it received the designation Hard-Kill DAS. Active protection of the tank protects against anti-tank guided projectiles. In addition, an improved on-board shield is installed to reduce the machine's signature in the infrared range. The machine has camouflage paint for operations in urban conditions. Active armor, as the developers say, is an -improved active protection system- that -detects, identifies and repels an attack at a short distance.- The system was successfully tested on the CV90 chassis. It covers the car from all sides and increases its mass by 400 kg. Using the AMAP-ADS active protection system and replacing more than 2 tons of passive armor, while maintaining the internal volume, allows you to reduce the weight of the car by 1.6 tons. The crew of the CV90120-T consists of 3 people - a commander, a gunner operator and a driver mechanic. The undercarriage of the CV90120-T (on each side) consists of seven twin support rollers, a forward drive wheel and a guide wheel mounted aft of the hull. The guide wheel has a hydraulic tensioning mechanism controlled from the driver's seat. The track consists of steel tracks with rubber running tracks. Tracks are connected with the help of a rubber-metal joint. Individual torsion roller suspension. Double-action hydraulic shock absorbers are installed on the suspension nodes of the first, second and seventh rollers. The motor-transmission compartment of the tank is located in the front part of the hull near the starboard side. It is equipped with a four-stroke V-8 Scania DI16 liquid-cooled diesel engine with a capacity of 670 hp. It drives the tank through a Perkins Engines Company/Allison X-300 automatic transmission, which has four forward and two reverse gears. CV90120-T light tank.

-We defeated everyone, but nothing happened-: how the Russian Federation -repelled- the attack of Uk...	Granted, there is no concrete evidence again, but when did that ever stop the fake factory? What was invented this time? According to Russian sources, a -massive attack by Ukrainian drones- was allegedly recorded over the Krasnodar Territory at night. The enemy seemed to be trying to strike at important targets, but the Russian air defense system did a brilliant job: all the drones were -shot down- or they -crashed against the rocks out of fear.- However, in the videos shared by the locals, instead of the wreckage of the Ukrainian drones, there is only a dark sky and cries of -bang, but we don't know what it is.- There is no confirmation from independent sources either. The facts speak for themselves: Everything is simple here: propaganda cannot show the real picture of what is happening, so it invents heroic victories. it is important for Russians to hear that they are -protected- and that -the enemy is powerless.- And if suddenly after a few days it becomes known about the destroyed ammunition depot or oil base, it will be possible to say: -This is not our base at all!- or -It was a planned explosion.- So the next time the Russians say they've -repelled a Ukrainian drone attack,- check the news in a day or two. Because it is quite likely that the -downed drones- somehow strangely got into their regular supply of ammunition.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/08/my-vsih-peremogly-ale-nichogo-ne-stalosya-yak-rf-vidbyla-ataku-ukrayinskyh-droniv-u-krasnodarskomu-krayi/	2025-02-07T20:05:17-08:00

According to him, -waves- of shelling occur according to a clear algorithm - they increase for three to four days, then decrease several times for the same period of time. This, Vadym Mysnyk is convinced, indicates the effectiveness of Ukrainian strikes deep into Russian territory. Long-range drones hit warehouses with ammunition, logistics and equipment. -But the enemy also accumulates, regroups, and then tries again. They practically use the existing arsenal of weapons. But, for example, unguided aircraft missiles from helicopters or multiple rocket launcher systems — we record individual cases. That is, they are very limited in such combat equipment,- said the spokesman of OTU -Siversk-. As reported ArmyInform, in the Lyman direction the enemy continues to use tactics of assaults in small groups, as well as enemy artillery and aviation are actively working against the Defense Forces.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/07/obstrily-vidbuvayutsya-hvylyamy-v-sylah-oborony-rozpovily-koly-vony-zmenshuyutsya-a-koly-zrostayut/	2025-02-07T09:12:08-08:00

Civil aviation of the Russian Federation is on the verge of collapse: technical problems with planes...	Such data are provided in the GUR of the Ministry of Education and Culture. Only at the beginning of December, three Superjet 100 aircraft experienced technical malfunctions during flights. The beginning of 2025 was no less -productive-: in two weeks of January, there were five emergency landings due to equipment failures. On January 4, two planes encountered technical problems at the same time: Airbus-A321neo of Ural Airlines flying from Sharm el-Sheikh to Yekaterinburg had to return to the airport of departure. And the Boeing-737 of the NordStar airline interrupted the flight on the flight Volgograd — Yekaterinburg. On January 7, a Boeing-737 of the UTair airline company, which was traveling from St. Petersburg to Samarkand, was forced to land at the Vnukovo airport due to a technical malfunction.

According to the GUR of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, among the data obtained as a result of the hack was a complete list of daily reports of -Rosaviation- regarding non-statutory situations with Russian aircraft for more than a year and a half. -Moscow, exposing its population to mortal danger, is trying by all means to hide an endless pile of problems with civil aviation,- the intelligence said. Before the start of the large-scale invasion of Ukraine, the Russian aircraft fleet numbered 1,031 aircraft. Aircraft produced by Boeing and Airbus accounted for about 67% of Russian aviation. US and EU sanctions banned the maintenance of these aircraft, as well as the supply of new liners.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/07/czyvilna-aviacziya-rf-na-mezhi-krahu-tehnichni-problemy-z-litakamy-pryzvodyat-do-ekstrenyh-posadok/	2025-02-07T07:01:09-08:00

The Ministry of Defense said who should be responsible for mobilization	first deputy defense minister of Ukraine Lieutenant General Ivan Gavriluk told about this in an interview for Ukrinform. -The issue of mobilization is based on the realities in which Ukrainian society as a whole lives. Our information space is focused on the negative, narratives about -Busification- and bad -TCKashniks- are imposed on society. We see more negatives than positives about the need to protect the country and the state,- he said. As he noted, a significant number of Ukrainians are sure that the territorial recruitment and social support centers are solely responsible for mobilization, but this is not the case. -The Law of Ukraine -On Mobilization Training and Mobilization- clearly defines all participants in the process, their tasks and area of ​​responsibility. Most of the tasks of mobilization measures are assigned to the authorities and the police,- Ivan Gavryliuk emphasized. According to him, if conscripted citizens of Ukraine during the legal regime of martial law do not appear at the TCC, then local authorities and the police must ensure their delivery. -It is also important to carry out appropriate information work in communities to convey to people the importance of protecting the country. You understand that without mobilization we will lose the country. -No matter how many robotic complexes, weapons, weapons and military equipment we have, all this is controlled by a person,- he summarized. As reported by ArmyInform, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine plans to reform territorial centers of recruitment and social support, in particular, to divide the functions and tasks assigned to them rely on	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/07/u-minoborony-rozpovily-hto-maye-vidpovidaty-za-mobilizacziyu/	2025-02-07T04:58:16-08:00
Reforming TCC and JV: the MOU explained how their functions will be divided	first deputy defense minister of Ukraine Lieutenant General Ivan Gavriluk told about this in an interview for Ukrinform. -For example, the first component – ​​social issues – should be separated. The second component is TCC itself. They will continue to keep track of reservists and all conscripts, call them to retraining courses, send them to the relevant meetings,- he said. According to him, the third component is the issue of preparing the population for service in the Armed Forces or units of the Security and Defense Forces. This feature is also planned to be spun off. As reported by ArmyInform, conscripts will be able to receive electronic direction for passing VLK through the Rezerv+ application without the need to visit territorial recruiting centers. The Ministry of Defense plans to have the corresponding mechanism up and running by the end of February 2025. In order to undergo an examination to determine fitness for military service, it will no longer be necessary to go to the TCC and SP for a paper referral.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/07/reformuvannya-tczk-ta-sp-u-mou-poyasnyly-yak-rozdilyat-yihni-funkcziyi/	2025-02-07T04:34:11-08:00

Maksym Bilousov, head of the communications department of the 60th separate mechanized brigade, told about this on the air of -Suspilne Novosti-. According to him, infantry attacks continue around the clock. The enemy in the conveyor mode launches groups of 2-3 people, the purpose of which is to get closer to the positions of the Defense Forces. Stormtroopers are of two types - well trained and poorly trained. -Poorly educated people are usually ex-convicts or from disadvantaged families. And they -open up- our firing positions, after which well-trained personnel join in, seeing where the attack began to repel. The attack on our positions begins. Live fishing. That's how they catch our guys on their baits,- said the head of the communications department of the 60th separate mechanized brigade. As he noted, there have been fewer mechanized assaults because they constantly fail. Recently there was an example of one of these rare attacks. -A single tank that left to strike our positions. It was neutralized with the help of FPV drones. It cannot be called a mechanized assault. Semi-mechanized assault. Who choked,- said Maksym Bilousov.

Already 100 units are reporting through Army+ about enemy damage — how it works	As reported by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, confirmation of damage or destruction of targets takes place in the DELTA combat system. At the same time, it is noted that the first 100 units began to report in this way. Commanders or their subordinates submit the damage report for the past day to Army+ once a day, after which the data is checked by analysts of the Situation Center of the Ministry of Defense. -The digitized analytical report will be available to the military high command. Paper reporting still remains. However, on the basis of the digital report on the damage, it is planned to implement in Army+ the submission of a report for receiving a reward for destroyed equipment quickly and conveniently,- the message reads. Units record destroyed or damaged objects on their own secure layers in the DELTA system, which has been put into operation in the Defense Forces and has successfully passed the information security check according to NATO standards. With DELTA, damage objects are added to Army+ automatically. -Information about the type of equipment and other parameters are pulled automatically using a QR code generated in DELTA. You can add a single object or a group at once. This speeds up the process and makes it more convenient. At the same time, Army+ does not store data about objects, and the generated report is deleted after signing and sent in encrypted form to the Situation Center of the Ministry of Defense,- the Ministry of Defense explains. They also added that the units that were not included in the list of the first to report to Armiya+, but wish to join, can contact the support service in the DELTA system or Army+. -This is a big step in creating relevant and transparent analytics of military operations. The launch of digital damage reports allows units of the Armed Forces and the National Guard to transmit objective information about enemy losses without delay. Thanks to the interaction of Armiya+ and DELTA, we ensure accurate accounting and reliability of information. The transparency of data will allow decisions to be made based on facts, not assumptions,- emphasized Kateryna Chernogorenko, deputy minister for digitalization. As reported by ArmyInform, The ground forces have become the best in implementing electronic reports in the Army+ application.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/07/vzhe-100-pidrozdiliv-zvituyut-cherez-armiya-pro-urazhennya-voroga-yak-cze-praczyuye/	2025-02-07T03:34:20-08:00

The corresponding entry was published on Friday, February 7, by the 63rd Separate Mechanized Brigade. Judging by its content, another meat assault of the occupiers failed, which led to panic among the personnel. In turn, the Russian commanders, realizing that the offensive was stalled, and their subordinates had also lost their equipment, began to get mad, threatening them with punishment if they -mowed down- even more. -The occupiers can retreat when it gets hot (run out or something?), but when they -move down-, they will stay in position for a while for 20 days. The spectacular work of our artillery and our drones adds to the local flavor,- the 63rd OMbr noted, commenting on the radio interception released to the public. As reported by ArmiyaInform, Russians complain about the commanders of the USSR, who ignore all their attempts to find out the fate of their missing relatives missing in the war against Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/07/okupanty-panikuyut-yihni-komandyry-skazheniyut-radioperehoplennya-na-lymanskomu-napryamku/	2025-02-07T03:13:37-08:00
Ukraine surpasses Russia in the production of FPV drones — Ivan Gavrylyuk	first deputy defense minister of Ukraine Lieutenant General Ivan Gavriluk told about this in an interview for Ukrinform. -If we talk about the production of FPV drones, Ukraine is currently ahead of the Russian Federation. The field of drones in Ukraine is developing at a breakneck pace. Both development and production,- he said. Since February 24, 2022, more than 1,300 new samples of weapons and military equipment produced by Ukrainian enterprises have been codified for the needs of the Defense Forces. Among them, the largest group is BpAK and ammunition for them. Only last year, more than 250 new models of UAVs of various types and purposes were approved for use in units of the Defense Forces. -But one must understand that the determining factor is not only the number of developed and manufactured drones. The most important thing is the efficiency of their application and the speed with which developers can react to changes,- noted Ivan Gavrilyuk. According to him, you can have hundreds of thousands of drones, but they will be powerless against enemy countermeasures. -In a cluster of drones - a month or three, and the effectiveness of one or another sample decreases. It is necessary to look for new ways to maintain efficiency. The technological -duel- between manufacturers of drones and EW tools clearly illustrates this. And here the advantage is on the side of the one whose engineers will sooner offer a technological solution to which the adversary will not have a ready answer,- he explained. The First Deputy Minister of Defense added that Ukraine currently needs help from partners, especially in supplying those types of weapons that it does not produce itself or produces in insufficient quantities. For example, air defense systems, heavy armored vehicles, NATO caliber ammunition, etc. -But at the same time, our domestic manufacturers of anti-aircraft guns are also increasing production volumes, mastering the production of new types of weapons and equipment. The government order is increasingly oriented towards the domestic manufacturer,- he noted. For example, last year almost 2/3 of the contracts for the purchase of anti-aircraft guns for the Armed Forces were signed with Ukrainian gunsmiths. -We managed to reduce dependence on imports, in particular special armored vehicles, and Ukraine is approaching self-sufficiency in the production of drones. I really want to note the production of long-range drones. Long-range strike drones today are a substitute for long-range missiles,- he summarized. As ArmiyaInform reported, the Ministry of Defense codified and allowed for operation in the Armed Forces of Ukraine a new modification of the domestically produced mobile washing-bath complex.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/07/ukrayina-perevazhaye-rosiyu-u-vygotovlenni-fpv-droniv-ivan-gavrylyuk/	2025-02-07T03:09:41-08:00

He was looking for places to install explosives near the units of the Defense Forces: a resident of ...	This is reported by the SBU on February 7. -He received the corresponding task remotely from his curator from the Russian Federation at the beginning of this year. Among the priority targets of the enemy were spare command posts and places of permanent deployment of units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the National Guard of Ukraine,- the report says. In order to find a place for the hidden installation of explosives, the man went around the area and fixed geolocations with the highest concentration of Ukrainian military. As stated in the SBU, in the case of detection of such objects, the suspect studied its perimeter for the presence of -convenient- places for planting an improvised explosive device (IED). -Subsequently, the agent gave the appropriate coordinates to the curator from the Russian Federation for -approval- in order to then receive instructions on how to make a SVP with a remote activation mechanism via phone,- the SBU reported. The Security Service of Ukraine acted in advance and detained the agent when he was conducting reconnaissance near a military facility where the occupiers were planning a terrorist attack. At the place of detention, a mobile phone with an anonymous chat in the messenger, where he communicated with a Russian special agent, was seized from the suspect. According to the investigation, the agent turned out to be a 32-year-old drug addict from the regional center. He came to the attention of the occupiers during a search on Telegram channels for quick earnings on a -dose-. Currently, the investigators of the Security Service informed him of the suspicion under two articles of the Criminal Code of Ukraine: The perpetrator is in custody. He faces life imprisonment with confiscation of property. As reported by ArmyInform, the SBU warns about new tactics of Russian special services. They recruit citizens of Ukraine to carry out sabotage, in particular to blow up territorial assembly centers, and then destroy the executors to cover their tracks.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/07/shukav-misczya-dlya-vstanovlennya-vybuhivky-poblyzu-pidrozdiliv-syl-oborony-pidozryuyut-zhytelya-hmelnychchyny/	2025-02-07T01:24:37-08:00
Forcing - for forcing - the Russians are constantly creating bridgeheads on the banks of the Oskol, ...	Major Viktor Tregubov, the spokesman of the Khortytsia operational-strategic group of troops, told about this on the broadcast of the Yedyni Novyni telethon. He assumed it was such a show of force. According to him, attempts to create a bridgehead have been going on for months. A group of two to eight people crosses Oskil on a rubber boat. The invaders hide in the local forests, and when a certain number of them accumulates, they try to storm. Often — in the direction of a nearby settlement. -What are the actions from the Ukrainian side? First, destroy their watercraft with FPV drones. Secondly, when they are unloaded, throw -discounts- at them. But if they have already accumulated in some proportion there, some small branch there, then they should be kicked out of there,- said the spokesman of the Khortytsia operational-strategic group of troops. As ArmyInform reported, more Russians died near Pokrovsk in one month than during the Second Chechen War.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/07/forsuvannya-dlya-forsu-rosiyany-postijno-stvoryuyut-placzdarmy-na-berezi-oskolu-ale-zhyvut-vony-nedovgo/	2025-02-07T01:03:17-08:00
-Higher competition — lower cost-: DOT is improving the procurement of fuel for the military	This is reported by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine on February 7. The next step in the development of the regional model was its deepening by increasing the number of lots. This decision is aimed at attracting more participants and improving the efficiency of fuel procurement for the military. -The state directs significant funds to supply the Armed Forces with fuel and lubricants. In particular, for 2024, the DOT purchased PMM for UAH 28.2 billion. The deepening of the regional model makes it possible to ensure the uninterrupted supply of fuel to the troops,- said Hleb Kanevskyi, director of the procurement policy department of the Ministry of Defense. In the MOU, it was noted that last year DOT introduced a fuel procurement model based on a regional principle, expecting greater interest from market participants, taking into account the specifics of logistics chains depending on the region. This model provided for the division of supply into four regions: Eastern, Southern, Central and Western. Each region is divided into the following areas: -The number of bidders and the level of savings at auctions (reductions) confirmed the effectiveness of this procurement model. That is why, in order to increase competition and optimize the logistics processes of potential suppliers, the State operator of the rear is deepening the regional model,- the MOU said. Previously, the region covered 4 to 6 supply points. From now on, the number of lots will be doubled: instead of four large regional lots, there will be eight smaller ones with fewer supply points (from 1 to 2). Director of the fuel and lubricants program of the DOT, Maryna Yeremeyeva, noted that the fuel market in Ukraine is marked by significant security risks due to the constant threat from the Russian Federation. Therefore, suppliers do not store large volumes on the territory of Ukraine. -The deepening of the regional model makes it possible to reduce security risks for business, reducing the amount of fuel required to participate in the auction. This opens up opportunities for new market players and increases the level of competition, which, in turn, has a positive effect on the cost of defense products,- she explained. As a result of auctions for the purchase of Arctic diesel, on lots where there was only one bidder, the savings from the expected cost was on average 2.7%, while on lots where there were more than 2 bidders, the savings were on average 7.5%. In monetary terms, this made it possible to save 15.8 million hryvnias. The total savings on Arctic diesel auctions is more than UAH 82 million. -Arctic diesel fuel differs from winter diesel fuel in its higher resistance to low temperatures and is less present on the country's market,- said the MOU. At the same time, from April, DOT will start providing summer fuel, which, according to the Ministry of Defense, should increase the presence of other market participants in the auctions. It is noted that the introduction of an in-depth regional fuel procurement model will contribute to fair competition, better prices for the state and new business opportunities. For the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine and the DOT, it is fundamental to ensure the uninterrupted supply of fuel to the Armed Forces of Ukraine. As reported by ArmyInform, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine in 2024 implemented a large-scale plan to provide servicemen with the necessary footwear by purchasing and supplying various models of footwear for a total amount of over UAH 3.1 billion.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/07/vyshhe-konkurencziya-nyzhche-vartist-dot-udoskonalyuye-zakupivli-palnogo-dlya-vijskovyh/	2025-02-07T00:55:42-08:00

According to him, it is only at first glance that the activity of the Russians has decreased. The occupiers simply concentrated on several directions. They consolidated their forces, creating several assault -fists-. -If you start just counting by heads, it's the same, if not more. If you look at the losses, for example, per month, there is generally an industrial scale. Therefore, to say that the intensity has decreased a little is like the temperature has dropped from 500 to 450 degrees.

A large mobilization in the Russian Federation, an unsuccessful North Korean debut and minus 46,000 ...	How does this relate to a possible peace negotiation process? But how does the current weather affect the enemy's ability to conduct assaults? This was told by military expert Petro Chernyk. -Interesting events are taking place now in the Pokrovsky direction in the part related to enemy losses. If at the beginning of January they were losing 300-360 people per day, now these numbers have decreased. A natural and profound question arises: why so? A few serious points. The first is the really big geopolitics. The enemy is regrouping forces. An active phase has begun - behind the scenes so far - negotiations on how to exit this phase of the war. We have no doubt that the Russians will become active when they understand that they need more serious arguments in the negotiation process. A big negotiation process has been declared: literally from today until the middle of April, when Trump should finally meet with Putin, with President Zelensky in Saudi Arabia. So at least it is declared. The second is purely technical. It's really cold, really damp, even though the Russians never expected it. But from a review of the first position: they still have to be counted, because you need to save strength. And there is one more cut. We have shown fantastic results in the extermination of their personnel in December of last year and in January of this year. This is more than 46-48 thousand per month. This is very serious. And the Russians enlist no more than 42-44 thousand. That is, they really haven't announced a big mobilization yet. I think that it will not be announced until Putin understands in the negotiation process what, how and to what end. Let's not forget the shameful defeat of the North Korean troops in Kurshchyna: more than 4,000 casualties. That's an incredible amount. And the enemy is forced to take all these moments into account. Plus, despite the fact that this infantry is not spared, the weather does not allow the use of heavy armored vehicles, because it gets stuck in the ground. This explains the decrease in enemy losses as such.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/07/velyka-mobilizacziya-v-rf-nevdalyj-pivnichnokorejskyj-debyut-ta-minus-46-000-rosiyan-ekspert-pro-boyi-na-pokrovskomu-napryamku/	2025-02-06T21:41:55-08:00

So far, three clashes are ongoing. The settlement of Novooleksandrivka was hit by an airstrike with two guided bombs. Today in the Novopavlovsk direction the enemy attacked seven times near Lysivka, Konstantinopol and Rozdolny. There was no success. He carried out airstrikes with unguided missiles on the settlement of Novosilka and shot down two anti-aircraft missiles in the Odradny region. The enemy did not carry out offensive operations in the Orikhov, Gulyaipil and Dnieper directions. Since the beginning of the day, there have been five clashes in the Kursk direction. In other areas, the situation has not undergone significant changes. Soldiers of the 118th Separate Mechanized Brigade and the 406th Separate Artillery Brigade were honored at the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, who steadfastly restrained the onslaught of overwhelming enemy forces.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/07/na-lymanskomu-napryamku-okupanty-18-raziv-atakuvaly-ukrayinski-pozycziyi/	2025-02-06T21:09:11-08:00
Why -Mercedes- is better than -Zhiguli-, or How German -Leopards- crush the invaders near Pokrovsk	German -Leopards- are hidden in one of the numerous forest plantations of the Donetsk region. Locations are carefully camouflaged between trees, cars in hoods. Nearby we see the tank crew: the commander, the mechanic-driver, the gunner and the loader. The boys only performed combat missions at night. Currently under recovery. Let's meet: the commander of tank platoon 155 of the separate mechanized brigade of the -Anna Kyivska- ZSU, Dmytro, with the call sign -Green-. From Lviv. In the army since last August. He studied at the National University -Lviv Polytechnic-, majoring in -Automotive Transport-. -At one time, he graduated from the military department of the Lviv Polytechnic and became a reserve officer. When I enlisted, the formation of the 155th -Anna of Kyiv- brigade was just in progress. Therefore, I was immediately appointed to the position of tank platoon commander,- Dmytro says. Special training began at one of the training grounds in Ukraine, then the units of the brigade were sent for 1.5-month training abroad. Crews were formed there, Leopards were mastered and trained there. If the German Leopard tanks are compared with the Soviet T-64, T-72 and the British Challenger and the American Abrams, they are medium in size. Because the Challenger and Abrams are large and massive tanks that are much wider, taller and, accordingly, heavier. The T-64, T-72 are made with a lower landing, but the Leopards are slightly larger than these tanks. But in general, these combat vehicles are distinguished by their high mobility, speed, maneuverability and, most importantly, the accuracy of destroying targets. These advantages are especially felt over Soviet tanks. It's like comparing a German Mercedes with a Soviet Zhiguli. The tank has a fairly powerful diesel engine, so it is easier to maintain and repair, unlike, say, the Abrams. -Leopard- can accelerate up to 80 kilometers per hour, but only on the road. The guys squeezed more out of him. Off-road, of course, the speed will be lower. It can make a full turn on the spot in 10 seconds. Can go up to 30 km/h in reverse when coasting. This is very important when working with direct aim at the enemy, when you need to quickly strike and roll away. For example, in the same T-72, the reverse speed does not exceed 5 km/h. The machine is easy to maintain, the engine runs very quietly. This helps with combat deployments. A hundred meters away, no one will understand that this tank is moving. The roar of the engine, for example, T-64, is not to be confused with anything. In the winter, you can turn on the stove, and in the summer, the air conditioner, in short, everything is made for the crew in the tank, with comfort. Another advantage of this tank is its accuracy of hitting targets, unlike Soviet vehicles. Tanks have powerful weapons - a 120 mm gun manufactured by Rheinmetall, like the Abrams tank. Her ammunition is 27 shells. The effective firing range is up to 4 kilometers. The tanks are equipped with an electronic fire control system. This allows the crew to adjust shots, set ballistic corrections, projectile corrections, select the desired projectile, distance to the target, weather conditions, and the like. This is why the Leopards have such a high hit rate against moving targets. To aim, you simply place the marker on the target. The system also has a thermal sensor that helps detect hidden targets. A thermal imager is installed for shooting at night. In general, -Leopards-, for example, from a distance of 2 km, can easily deliver targeted strikes on enemy infantry, structures, fortifications, shelters, and military equipment. Shooting is conducted both by direct fire and from closed firing positions. Even a helicopter can be shot down from the tank's armament. If the rotorcraft flies at a certain speed and, relatively speaking, hovers, the fire control system selects a target and focuses. The computer calculates the possible distance that the projectile must travel to hit the point where the helicopter is expected to reach after a certain period of time. There is no such possibility in Soviet tanks. The Rashist helicopters have not yet been shot down near Pokrovsk, as the enemy does not use them. But we are always ready. Tankers call this leopard's technical ability dynamic advance. This system allows you to shoot tanks or any other moving armored vehicles with perfect accuracy, no matter at what speed. It all depends on the gunner, if he does everything right, then from the first shot he immediately hits the enemy equipment. Somehow, the command gave us the coordinates of the Russian targets. A column of enemy equipment was moving, the speed was approximately 40-50 km/h. The crew from the -sink- left for the area of ​​combat missions. So, with the first shot, we stopped the BMP. They took the target -point-blank-, a shot, the equipment is on fire. What is interesting, the cannon can aim at individual parts of the target. For example, to stop the movement of an enemy car, you can hit the undercarriage, and to -blow up- the tower - aim at it, hit and all. The accuracy of the gun is simply amazing. In addition to the thermal imager, the gunner uses a laser rangefinder to calculate the range to enemy targets. All this is done automatically and much faster than, again, in Soviet tanks. With its help, you can accurately aim and hit the target at a distance of 3-4 km. A very cool thing is the technical possibility for the tank commander to switch from his own sight to the gunner's sight, that is, to use his fire. There are different situations in battle. If I see a higher priority target or a target that threatens the life of the crew, then I can calmly take control and fire a shot myself. Likewise, I can easily hand control over to the gunner. The charging mode in this tank is manual. That is, how it happens: the gunner measured the target, the loader loaded the projectile and pressed the button - which projectile will be used. Then the on-board computer of the tank works, the -technical moments- of the shot are calculated and -voila- - you shoot and hit. The shells are separated from the crew by an armored partition and are located behind the tank, while in the Soviet ones, on the contrary, they are located in special compartments in the hull and turret of the tank. This increases the chances of survival of the -Leopard- crew in the event of a projectile hitting the tower, unlike the T-72. Tanks have good armor that provides a high level of protection for the crew. For example, a turret armor plate 650 mm thick. In addition, dynamic protection is installed, which covers the frontal part of the machine and the tower, as well as most of the side of the hull. The junction of the tower and the hull is additionally covered. Withstands hits from cluster bombs, grenade launchers and drone drops. The tank is equipped with anti-drone protection and a EW device. In a combat situation, the -barbecue- installed above the car saved the crew from FPV drones. The cumulative burst when it collided with the welded structure, but the tank continued to move. In general, the survivability of the crew in the tank is about 99.9%. Without exaggeration, it feels like you are sitting in an -armored capsule-. Can it withstand the impact of anti-tank guided missiles? I do not know and I hope that I will not find out! Here in the Pokrovsky direction, we work against the enemy mostly with -direct fire-. Just the other day, we received the coordinates of the location of the occupiers from the command. It was a forest plantation, more than 500 meters wide, which had to be cleared urgently. The Rashists had shelters there, preparing for an assault on the positions of our infantry. We quickly left, the target was more than 1 km away, set up and opened fire. They worked very intensively, to put it bluntly, they practically destroyed this forest plantation together with the Russians. There was no living space left there. Almost 70 percent of the perimeter of the hundred was destroyed. They could have done more, but it was necessary to quickly roll back, as enemy FPV drones were flying into the area. We don't get too close to the contact line, but it's not necessary. The combat capabilities of the tank allow you to effectively destroy the enemy at a distance of up to 2 km. We regularly destroy small assault groups, some enemy shelters. We do everything so that the enemy does not advance, grind him in places of concentration. This is our daily combat work, technically we fight much less often.- A few words about the combat situation on the front line important for the Ukrainian Armed Forces. As Yuriy, the head of the communications department of the 155th separate mechanized brigade of the -Anna Kyivska- Armed Forces of Ukraine, told ArmiyaInform, the Pokrovsky direction accounts for almost half of all combats on the front. -The Russians are now not going to the city in the front, but are attacking on the flanks. They are trying to cut the main highways that lead to Pokrovsk from Kostyantynivka and Pavlograd. Recently, particularly heavy fighting has been going on in the direction of the administrative borders with the Dnipropetrovsk region. Katsaps advance in infantry groups supported by drones, tactical aircraft, tanks and artillery fire. Units of the 155th -Anna Kyivska- brigade are fighting hard battles with the enemy in their area of ​​responsibility, -unwinding- the enemy, inflicting huge losses in manpower and equipment. Combat work does not stop either day or night,- the officer said.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/07/chomu-mersedes-krashhyj-za-zhyguli-abo-yak-nimeczki-leopardy-troshhat-okupantiv-pid-pokrovskom/	2025-02-06T21:07:02-08:00
Protect your own and attack a stranger: CROWS combat modules have been relevant for more than a deca...	For the first time, according to the authors of the military-historical portal ABN Newswire, the creation of a prototype of a remote-controlled weapons system that would protect the gunners of combat vehicles while moving in a convoy or directly on the battlefield was thought about in the USA back in 1988, ArmyInform notes. Then they began to design a remote control system for small arms fire (JSSAMP) for the Pentagon. The project received acceptable solutions in 1996, when it was possible to achieve the introduction of motorization and stabilization of weapon aiming, after which it was possible to -hide- the gunner directly in the hull of the armored vehicle. And finally, these works were completed before the start of the campaign of the US and coalition forces -Operation Iraqi Freedom- in 2004. In general, CROWS (English - Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station) is the general name for combat modules with remote fire control. As the authors of the defense portal BuildingTECH remind, CROWS is an integrated system consisting of a stabilized weapon mount, a set of advanced sensors, control modules and software for accurate shooting. Stabilization allows you to fire even while the vehicle is moving, which is especially important in dynamic combat conditions. The sensor kit includes a daytime video camera, a thermal imager for night operations and a laser range finder. At the same time, these devices provide the operator with the ability to detect, identify and accurately engage targets at any time, regardless of weather or lighting conditions. The CROWS system was developed to install medium and small-caliber weapons and additional equipment on it. Intended for installation of any existing platforms. The line of sight in use (DLOS) allows the operator to maintain his sight on the selected target regardless of the ballistic characteristics of the weapon in use or its ammunition. The system is fully stabilized, which ensures the possibility of interaction of various weapons and accuracy of targeting. The versatility of the CROWS system is achieved due to its compatibility with a wide range of weapons. She can operate machine guns such as the M2 .50 Cal, M240B, MK19 and M134 Minigun, as well as light machine guns including the M249 SAW. To combat an armored target, integration with the Javelin missile system is provided. Additionally, the CROWS supports grenade launchers such as the M320 and M307, making it an effective tool for close combat and anti-vehicle combat. The CROWS system has an intuitive control interface, which facilitates its operation even for operators with minimal experience. The crew can easily aim weapons on the target, fire accurately and quickly change weapons depending on the mission. This makes the module an essential component of the modern war machine, providing a strategic advantage on the battlefield. One of the legislators of a kind of military fashion for remote modules is the Norwegian company Kongsberg Defense &amp; Aerospace. For more than two decades, KONGSBERG has been the world's leading supplier of remote-controlled combat modules. Their experience is millions of hours of operational use in various conditions on the basis of more than 20,000 delivered systems for almost three dozen countries. In particular, its PROTECTOR module is constantly being improved to meet higher requirements, using technological advances to meet today's threats. With its ability to increase crew situational awareness, minimize risk and reduce reaction time, CROWS is becoming an indispensable tool for armies. The remotely controlled combat module is used not only for defensive tasks, but also for active support of ground operations, patrolling and base protection. In conditions where soldiers' lives depend on precision, speed and safety, technologies such as CROWS are becoming critical elements of military strategy.

Propaganda again -defeated- mercenaries in an empty hotel	Now for some reality. The hotel in question has been empty for years. It had not been used for a long time, everything was falling apart inside, and the windows had been broken during previous shelling of the city. And this abandoned house suddenly became a -military base-! Truly an invisible army that only the best minds of the Kremlin could calculate. If Russian propagandists are to be believed, every building in Ukraine is a headquarters, every apartment is an ammunition depot, and every resident is either a -Nazi- or a -mercenary.- Well, if the evidence does not match, it can simply not be provided. Well, another -grand victory- in the treasury of fakes. the Russians are again at war with their own imaginations, bombing ruins and capturing cities that cannot even be found on the map.

-Yariy-: the marines presented a documentary film about the fierce battles in the Kursk direction	This is discussed in a post on the brigade's page. -Yariy- is not just a movie, it is a reflection of the reality of war, where under continuous enemy fire, our defenders are fighting for every piece of their native land. The film tells about the evacuation of wounded comrades, fire suppression of the enemy and support of assault groups. Viewers will be able to see how the devastating circumstances make adjustments to the planning of operations, but are unable to stop the Marines' will to victory. -Yariy- is a testimony to the indomitable spirit, courage and heroism of Ukrainian soldiers who risk their lives every day for the sake of the freedom and independence of Ukraine. As reported by ArmyInform, aerial reconnaissance of the 36th Marine Infantry Brigade named after Rear Admiral Mykhailo Bilinsky's drops and FPV drones hit the Russians who tried to attack.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/yaryj-morpihy-prezentuvaly-dokumentalnyj-film-pro-zapekli-boyi-na-kurskomu-napryamku/	2025-02-06T11:59:00-08:00
Up to 10 years behind bars: a collaborator who worked in the occupation administration will be tried...	The Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office informs about this. According to the investigation, at the beginning of August 2022, a resident of the village of Rublene assumed the position of -v. at. assistant head of the administration (rural) of the Veliko Burlutsky Territorial Administration- in the pseudo-administration created by the occupiers. While in a -managerial- position, the collaborator followed the instructions of the top leadership of the occupation administration, participated in meetings and collected passport data of local residents, and also held receptions for citizens. Currently, the accused is hiding from Ukrainian law enforcement officers and is wanted. She will be tried in absentia in the Chuguyiv city court of the Kharkiv region. For the crime, the woman faces up to ten years in prison with deprivation of the right to hold certain positions or engage in certain activities for a period of up to fifteen years and confiscation of property. The pre-trial investigation was carried out by department No. 2 of the SV Kupyan RVP of the GUNP in the Kharkiv region under the operational support of the National Police, the Office of the SBU in the Kharkiv region and the main operational and investigative department of the 4th border detachment (Kharkiv) of the State Security Service. As reported by ArmyInform, the court found the 28-year-old man guilty of collaborative activities (Part 5 of Article 111-1 CC of Ukraine).	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/do-10-rokiv-za-gratamy-na-kupyanshhyni-sudytymut-kolaborantku-yaka-praczyuvala-v-okupaczijnij-administracziyi/	2025-02-06T11:44:12-08:00
They burned -Zoopark- - mountain drones left the enemy without a radar	The video of combat work was released on February 6 on the battalion channel. The enemy hid the radar in the landing, where it was found and hit by our pilots. They had to waste several FPV drones to get the radar to finally light up. -This enemy system was a serious threat to our troops, because it allowed the enemy to detect and determine the location of our artillery. Its destruction is a big step towards victory, which will significantly weaken the enemy and strengthen our positions,- the battalion commented on the video.

The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine reported this on Thursday, February 6. According to the plan of the aggressor country, the so-called roskomnadzor should create a new -data processing center- and modernize the existing server facilities in order to increase the effectiveness of monitoring and blocking of -unwanted- content. -As always, Russia seeks to achieve the highest possible level of information isolation and completely cut off the population from the truth. A means of the aggressor's control over the information environment in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine is also the launch of more than 2,500 sites for the occupation administrations and other so-called authorities,- warned the GUR. As reported by ArmiyaInform, Russian propaganda is trying to destabilize the socio-political situation in Ukraine in order to disrupt mobilization and split among citizens.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/nye-boltaj-u-gur-poyasnyly-yak-rf-posylyuye-informaczijnu-izolyacziyu-okupovanyh-terytorij/	2025-02-06T11:31:34-08:00
-We know, we find, we destroy-: exclusive footage of the battle of the special unit -Artan-	The video of combat work was published on the unit's page. The success of the operation is ensured by clear coordination between various units: intelligence, assault groups, artillery units, fire support groups, as well as ARTAN SYNDICATE FPV drone operators.

Two higher educations and two SAMs — how a political scientist and jurist began to shoot down enemy ...	About the fighter told on February 6 Air Command -Center- of the Air Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Denis joined the Air Force in December 2022, inspired by the feat of our defenders. Before his service, he had a civilian job, 2 higher educations in -Political Science- and -Jurisprudence-. All this only strengthened his ability to master both the old Soviet S-300 system and the modern NASAMS anti-aircraft missile complex. Even with the S-300, Denys knows that there is nothing better than seeing the control sign -Miss is normal- on the indicator (the height and speed of the target are falling) and realizing that another enemy threat has been neutralized. The combat work of his team on the S-300 is about 20 destroyed enemy targets, including cruise missiles and drones. Sometimes one shot was enough to shoot down two missiles at the same time - this is the result of the coordination and skill of the combat service. Denis calls to join the Air Force and become a guardian of our sky.

-Doctors recognized the 200th-: Junior Sergeant -Bandera- returned to the front after being mortally...	The story of one of these soldiers was shared on Thursday, February 6, by the Ground Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Meet junior sergeant -Bandera- - senior gunner of the 63rd separate mechanized brigade. -At war from the first days. In the summer of 2022, while defending the village of Blagodatne in the Mykolaiv region, he was fatally wounded in the head by an enemy sniper. The doctors recognized him as -two hundred-, but in a few minutes he regained consciousness and managed to get to the evacuation point with the help of his comrades,- the military said. At the same time, despite such a complex injury, after the recovery of -Bander- he again joined the ranks of the Armed Forces. However, this is far from the only adventure that he remembered during his service. The Ukrainian defender recalls how he and his comrades captured the Russian BMP-2, which the occupiers left in the middle of a reservoir near Torsky in Donetsk region. The armored vehicle was completely under water, but after an enemy shell hit the dam, the water level fell and there was an opportunity to seize it. -As far as I know, they were leaving somewhere in 2022&#8230; They completely left -beha- with BC. Fully charged. We had about six exits. Our role was to swim up and see what condition she was in,- Bandera shared his memories of that operation. But see how it went in the plot. As reported by ArmyInform, Ukrainian sniper under the nickname -Laughter- proved that there is no safe distance for the enemy.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/likari-vyznaly-200-m-molodshyj-serzhant-bandera-povernuvsya-na-front-pislya-smertelnogo-poranennya/	2025-02-06T10:56:49-08:00

Major Anton Zakharchuk, deputy commander of the air mobile battalion of the 95th Separate Airborne Assault Brigade, gave this assessment of the situation in this area on Army TV. -The situation in the brigade lane is difficult, but under control. The enemy is not currently conducting mass and active assaults, but local assaults by small tactical groups are present,- the Ukrainian officer said. Commenting on the information about the withdrawal of the North Korean troops in this direction, he explained that the absence of large-scale assault actions just shows that -some forces and means of the enemy have been withdrawn.- -Now this allows us to better organize our defense system, especially in terms of engineering, conduct retraining and further prepare for future assault operations,- said a representative of the 95th ODSHBr. He also noted that conducting hostilities on -their own land- does not affect the motivation of Russian troops in general, so there is little difference from their approaches on Ukrainian territory. -They act as, for example, in Donbas. The same is true in the Kursk region,- Anton Zakharchuk stated. As ArmyInform reported, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky honored Ukrainian soldiers participating in the operation in the Kursk region with state awards.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/aktyvnosti-rf-zagalom-znyzylas-bijczi-zsu-pidtverdzhuyut-znyknennya-soldativ-kndr-na-kurshhyni/	2025-02-06T10:48:35-08:00
The evaders got stuck in the mud, trying to escape to Moldova	On Thursday, February 6, reported in the DPSU press service. -In order to implement the idea, the men turned to the Telegram channel administrator for help, who for a fee provided advice on crossing the border without hindrance. Without any guarantees of successful remittance, the violators transferred a total of $10,000 to the -advisor's- crypto wallet, the report says. However, their journey turned out to be far from as cloudless as they had hoped. During an attempt to illegally cross the border, the car with dodgers got stuck in the mud, so they -reclassified from passengers to pedestrians.- Meanwhile, the driver himself, having freed himself from his fellow passengers, sped towards the border, but he was also detained in the end. -For an attempt to illegally cross the state border, administrative offenses were filed against five men Article 204-1 of the Code of Administrative Offenses (illegal crossing or attempted illegal crossing of the state border of Ukraine), the case has been sent to court,- the border guards added.

The cultural code of Slobozhanshchyna: how the native land shapes the worldview of fighters -Azov-	This is discussed in posts on the brigade page. The heroine of the second episode was the medical supply officer and head of the escort service of the 12th Azov brigade - -Rina-. She talks about her hometown - Kharkiv, about Slobozhanshchyna and its significant cultural contribution to the formation of the Ukrainian nation. -Rina- was born in Kharkiv, a city that has always been a center of education, culture and intellectual development. It was here in the 19th century that one of the first universities in Ukraine appeared, which became a center of scientific and cultural thought. Kharkiv gave the world unique artistic phenomena. The Kharkiv school of photography, which gained international recognition in the 20th century, deserves special attention. The traditions of this school continue to inspire modern Ukrainian photographers. Theater art also found its way in Kharkiv. The legendary theater -Berezil- under the leadership of Les Kurbas opened new horizons for the Ukrainian stage. Modern Kharkiv directors, in particular Andrii Zholdak, continue to develop this trend at the European level. A separate layer of Kharkiv's cultural life is music. Ukrainian black metal was born in the Northern Saltivka region, and underground clubs became the center of the musical movement. One of the most famous was the Zhivot club, where young people listened to alternative music and experienced their first concert emotions. Today, rock and metal are giving way to the electronic scene. The local cultural platform -Kulturizvuk- has become a hub for fans of modern electronic music and vinyl. While studying in Kyiv, Rina discovered the rich world of ethnic and neofolk music. Ukrainian bands of the late 20th century, in particular -Sugar, White Death-, became part of her cultural self-identification. This process of deeper immersion in one's own roots is a reflection of the common path of Ukrainians — learning about one's history, reviving traditions and realizing the national cultural code. The Genesis project does not just tell stories - it demonstrates how culture becomes a weapon and a source of strength for those who defend Ukraine. After all, we are born, live and die with the cultural code of our native land. As reported by ArmyInform, to the Day of the National Assembly of Ukraine, the 12th special purpose brigade -Azov- in cooperation with the public organization AZOV.ONE and a musical band -DahaBrakha- presented a unique cultural project called -Genesis-.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/kulturnyj-kod-slobozhanshhyny-yak-ridna-zemlya-formuye-svitoglyad-bijcziv-azovu/	2025-02-06T10:31:32-08:00
Once in the Luhansk region, our pilots bombed another enemy city	The video of the defeat was released on February 6 on the regiment channel. The occupiers were moving at high speed, but this did not save them from a precise reset. According to the drone operators, it is not an easy task to hunt down MLRS, because the enemy usually uses the -strike-withdrawal- tactic: the firing positions are located in one place, and the hiding place is in another, at a distance of tens of kilometers. However, high-quality intelligence and careful planning allow our operators to carry out such operations with high efficiency. As reported by ArmyInform, operators of the 412 Nemesis Regiment detected and delivered a precise strike on the Russian Tor anti-aircraft missile system.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/odnogo-razu-na-luganshhyni-nashi-piloty-rozbombyly-chergovyj-vorozhyj-grad/	2025-02-06T10:20:38-08:00
-Soldiers are disposable material- — in Kurshchyna, Russian generals storm - with walkers -	This was told by Stanislav Krasnov, platoon commander of the 95th separate amphibious assault brigade, on the broadcast of the -Edyny Novyni- telethon. According to him, the enemy is constantly changing tactics. This is due to heavy losses in armor and manpower. Some units are completely destroyed by our forces, new ones come. -They recently stormed in large groups of infantry. As it is known from open sources, these were North Korean soldiers. Suffered huge losses. At this moment, the Russians returned to their classic assaults in smaller groups,- Stanislav Krasnov said. Periodically, the Russians still use armored vehicles. The task is simply to get the landing party to our positions. As a rule, in most cases this armored vehicle is burned, and few people are lucky enough to return from an enemy landing. -The losses are really huge. I have not observed such large losses in other directions. They don't spare their life force here at all. Soldiers are used as disposable material, as &#8220;expendables&#8221;. Our team published statistics not so long ago. In the area, 5,000 servicemen were destroyed by our brigade during the Kursk operation,- said the platoon commander of the 95th separate amphibious assault brigade. As reported ArmyInform, in the Lyman direction, the enemy uses a large number of various UAVs, including fiber-optic drones. Attempts to block the logistics routes of the Defense Forces.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/soldaty-cze-odnorazovyj-material-na-kurshhyni-rosijski-generaly-shturmuyut-rozhidnykamy/	2025-02-06T10:12:47-08:00

He told about this on Thursday, February 6, on his page in Facebook. -Sweden has advanced technologies, Ukraine has production capabilities and combat experience. Our joint task is to combine these opportunities,- the minister said. Moreover, the head of the Ministry of Defense noted that there are already -concrete proposals- that will allow launching production projects in the field of defense industry already this year. Among other defense needs, according to Rustem Umerov: As reported by ArmyInform, the Commander of the Naval Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Vice Admiral Oleksiy Neizhpapa discussed with General Mikael Klesson the security situation in the Black Sea.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/vzhe-ye-konkretni-propozycziyi-rustem-umyerov-obgovoryv-z-golovnokomanduvachem-zs-shvecziyi-promyslovu-kooperacziyu/	2025-02-06T10:02:06-08:00
Flight with combustion - a buggy filled with Russian attack aircraft ran into a mine	The video was released on February 6. Two buggies mounted by Russian attack aircraft set out to attack our positions in the Kharkiv region. While moving, the first buggy hit a mine. The explosion was so powerful that the Russians flew dozens of meters up the mountain. They burned at the same time. -This is what the Russian version of -Pavarot ne tuda- looks like. The result: transport to pieces, infantry to pieces. We make sure that the enemy is on fire in the literal sense. Fighters of the 2nd Assault Battalion worked on the final route of the occupiers!-, the brigade commented on the video. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the unmanned systems battalion of the 3rd assault brigade destroyed a lone occupier who teleported to our positions.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/rozlit-zi-zgorannyam-nabytyj-rosijskymy-shturmovykamy-baggi-nayihav-na-minu/	2025-02-06T09:49:59-08:00
A Russian agent who blew up the house of an Armed Forces veteran was detained in Kharkiv	This is reported by the Security Service of Ukraine. For the conspiracy, the agent used wigs, and after committing the crime, she tried to destroy her clothes. However, it did not help her. SBU counter-intelligence quickly identified and detained the perpetrator in her apartment. The investigation established that the unemployed woman from Kharkiv was recruited remotely because of her anti-Ukrainian comments in Telegram channels. The Russian curator gave her instructions: to take an improvised explosive device from a hiding place and plant it in a car tire near a military man's house. The agent also planted a disguised mobile phone across from the victim's yard, through which the enemy monitored the veteran's movements and remotely activated the explosives. During the searches, a mobile phone containing correspondence with a Russian curator in an anonymous messenger chat was seized from the detainee. The investigators of the SBU informed the perpetrator about the suspicion for h. 2 Art. 258 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (terrorist act that led to serious consequences). She faces up to 12 years in prison with confiscation of property. She is currently being held without bail. The operation to expose and detain the Russian agent was carried out by SBU officers in the Kharkiv region together with the National Police under the procedural guidance of the regional prosecutor's office. As reported by ArmyInform, The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) warns of new tactics of Russian special services. They are recruiting citizens of Ukraine to carry out sabotage, in particular, to blow up territorial assembly centers (TCC) and then destroy the performers to cover their tracks.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/u-harkovi-zatrymaly-rosijsku-agentku-yaka-pidirvala-budynok-veterana-zsu/	2025-02-06T09:43:20-08:00
-Here fate brings unexpected people together-: the story of a marine -Kuma-	The story of the fighter was made public on the page of the Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. In the army, -Kum- met people with whom fate would hardly have brought him together in civilian life. -Captains of long-distance sailing, teachers, athletes, entrepreneurs, builders,- lists a serviceman of the 126th separate brigade of the 30th Marine Corps. — Such an interesting circle of communication. And everyone is like one big family. Complex characters, different life experiences, social status&#8230; They can be harsh and do not always express themselves culturally. But these are just, honest people who you can rely on and who will cover your back in a critical situation.- Before the large-scale invasion, the Odessa man -Kum- worked as a private security guard. On March 25, 2022, he went to the TCC and mobilized. He says that he was prompted by the atrocities committed by the Russians in Mariupol, Buchi, Irpen, and other cities and villages of Ukraine. -It really shocked me. I love my family, my daughter, my country. -I love people, that's why I joined the army to protect them from the arbitrariness and cruelty of the occupiers,- says -Kum-. He held the defense of the right bank of the Kherson region, carried out combat missions on the Dnieper islands. This is a very specific area - a swampy area where it is difficult to dig in. The enemy actively uses all possible weapons here, especially unmanned systems and artillery. -There are an extremely large number of drones - they are scouts, FPV, and -maviks- with resets,- says Kum. - They work around the clock, so first of all we have to arrange a shelter so that the enemy cannot see us from above. This is a very difficult task. However, we must carry it out in order to hold our positions, prevent the Russians from occupying them and cross over to the right bank of the Dnieper.- The most emotional moment is, of course, returning from a combat exit. -I haven't been in touch for three weeks. My youngest daughter was the first person I called. Her words -I love you, daddy- are probably the most expensive gift,- says the soldier. According to -The Godfather-, no matter how strict, unmovable and iron-clad the warriors may be on the outside, they remain ordinary people. -We get tired, it hurts, it's uncomfortable, it's physically and emotionally unbearable. And it's scary. Even if we don't admit it. But I don't think it's a bad thing. Everyone has their own fears that need to be overcome. You don't always do what you want. Sometimes you have to do what you have to do. In the case of the military, it is the execution of an order. This is our job, we joined the army for this,- he is convinced. Recently, -Kum- was seriously injured and is currently in the hospital. However, his comrades wish him a speedy recovery and remind him that he can always count on the support and help of his large military family. As reported by ArmyInform, -Viking- is a fighter of the International Legion of the Ground Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, who has been fighting for Ukraine against the Russians for three years occupiers. He went through a difficult battle path, destroying many enemies, and became a true professional in his field.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/tut-dolya-zvodyt-z-nespodivanymy-lyudmy-istoriya-morskogo-pihotynczya-kuma/	2025-02-06T09:32:14-08:00
We brought the war home to Russia — the President on the Kursk operation	This was announced by the President on February 6 in his evening address. -Today, I awarded the participants of the Kursk operation: two boys - Heroes of Ukraine, I also presented -Crosses of Combat Merit-, orders of Ukraine. I want to thank every Ukrainian soldier, all our units, which are involved in the Kursk region and which have shown the whole world that we can act actively, unexpectedly and effectively, even in conditions of limited resources. We detect a Russian bluff as a bluff. We protect our cities — Sumy and Kharkiv. We have significantly replenished the exchange fund — these are hundreds and hundreds of Russian soldiers, whom we are exchanging in order to return Ukrainians from captivity. We also have North Korean soldiers in captivity - now they are undergoing treatment, they were wounded in battles. Serious injuries. But they are proof that Putin has drawn another state into this war — North Korea — and is teaching that state to wage modern warfare. This is a threat to everyone, to every country in East Asia. And I am grateful to all partners who understand how important it is to stop Russia now — now, so that we don't have to fight years from now,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. He noted the brigades of the Armed Forces of Ukraine that are involved in Kurshchyna: soldiers of the 80th, 82nd, 95th, 22nd, 61st brigades, 36th marine brigades, 17th tank, 47th mechanized, 129th infantry brigade, soldiers of the Special Operations Forces, soldiers of the Security Service of Ukraine, all the involved forces of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine. -I also want to thank Chief of Staff General Sirsky for planning the Kursk operation. The significance of the Kursk operation will be reflected both in the diplomacy that will take place and in the history that will be written by Ukrainians — our people, not the occupiers.- Volodymyr Zelensky also thanked France, personally President Emmanuel Macron, for fulfilling the agreements. -Our Air Force is now supplemented with Mirages, French aircraft, and this is another stage in the development of Ukrainian military aviation. We will be able to perform more tasks. I also thank the Netherlands - there is a new supply of F-16, and this is significant,- the President assured. He also talked about the meeting with the president of the EBRD, who is currently visiting Ukraine. -I am grateful for Ukraine's support - the programs of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development are aimed at many important directions. And today, we talked with the EBRD, in particular, about the need to support Ukrainian migrants - our internal migrants, all those who were forced to leave their homes because of the war, who lost their homes. It is necessary to help these people in a new place to get normal apartments or houses: this is the most important issue for millions of Ukrainian migrants - their own home. And our partners definitely have a resource to help with that. Today, he also assigned relevant tasks to Finance Minister Marchenko and Deputy Prime Minister for Reconstruction Kulebi. Within two weeks, there should be a clear program — a program to support internally displaced people that is effective and understandable to people. I thank everyone who is with Ukraine!- Volodymyr Zelenskyi concluded his speech. As reported by ArmyInform, the President awarded the participants of the Kursk operation with state awards.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/my-povernuly-vijnu-dodomu-u-rosiyu-prezydent-pro-kursku-operacziyu/	2025-02-06T09:23:07-08:00
Divers of the TSP -Omega-: how elite fighters are trained for special operations on water	This is is discussed in a post on the unit page. -Divers of the Omega CSP can become a determining factor in the success of combat operations. They are not just ready to work on the water - they change the course of events thanks to their unique skills,- Major General Pavlo Yatsyuk emphasized. Diving groups have been operating as part of -Omega- since the creation of the division in 2003. In 2015, taking into account the needs of combat operations and geographical features, an additional group was created in Odesa, which made it possible to work more effectively in maritime conditions. -We constantly analyze the possibilities of expanding diving groups, optimize their structure and prepare for new challenges. The war forces us to adapt and improve in order to be one step ahead,- noted the head of the Central Security Service. Divers of the TSP -Omega- work in the most difficult areas of the front, performing a wide range of tasks: Personnel operate along the entire front line. Their work is critical, especially given that much of the battle line runs along bodies of water. -Only specialists trained in water warfare are able to effectively perform such tasks. Our divers understand the responsibility assigned to them, and make a significant contribution to the defense of Ukraine,- emphasized Pavlo Yatsyuk. Special forces divers are trained taking into account real combat conditions. Instructors carefully practice all possible scenarios to prepare personnel for the most difficult challenges. -Our fighters train as they will work on the battlefield. Their professionalism and level of training is extremely respectable. I am grateful to everyone for their dedication and willingness to act where it is most dangerous,- added the head of the Omega Central Security Service. As reported by ArmyInform, the special-purpose divers of the Omega Special Operations Center continue to improve their skills even in winter conditions the cold For five days, the fighters practiced difficult tasks in reservoirs adapted for diving and working on water.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/vodolazy-czsp-omega-yak-gotuyut-elitnyh-bijcziv-dlya-speczoperaczij-na-vodi/	2025-02-06T09:17:44-08:00

We destroy the enemy every day!-, the battalion commented on the video. As reported by ArmyInform, in the Kharkiv direction fierce fighting continues. Fighters of the -Hydra- unit from the 2nd mechanized company of the 2nd mechanized battalion of the Third Assault Brigade conducted a successful operation to clear the enemy dugout where the Russian occupiers were holed up.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/geroyizm-ne-propyesh-na-harkivshhyni-rosijskyj-shturmovyk-zagynuv-pry-forsuvanni-kalyuzhi/	2025-02-06T09:03:49-08:00
Shark -ate- -Hyacinth- - a long-range Russian cannon was hit	The video of the defeat was published on the unit's channel. The Russian self-propelled gun can fire effectively at a distance of more than 33 kilometers, so it is usually placed quite far from the front line. This time, the Russians hid their long-range -flower- in the landing, but this did not prevent our aerial scouts, who, with the help of the Shark reconnaissance UAV, spotted the enemy artillery system and transmitted its coordinates. Not long after, Hyacinth-S flew by. Judging by the power of the explosion, the ammunition package also detonated. We hope that the crew also did not leave their combat vehicle in trouble. As reported by ArmyInform, thanks to M777 hit the enemy minus two -Hyacintas- in the Zaporizhzhya direction.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/shark-zyiv-giaczynt-urazheno-dalekobijnu-rosijsku-garmatu/	2025-02-06T08:47:42-08:00
Soledar - his pain, Ukraine - his struggle: the story of a soldier on the call sign -Donbas-	At the age of 18, Vladyslav signed a three-year contract with the ZSU. He knew he wanted to become an artilleryman and chose to serve in the 23rd Separate Mechanized Brigade, which received NATO equipment. First, he was a service number of a self-propelled howitzer, then a — driver-mechanic. He is now a senior gunner in the self-propelled artillery division, working on the M109L. Despite the difficult conditions and constant battles, Vladyslav, who is called -Donbas- by his brothers, knows that the most important thing is the people around him. A real brotherhood prevails in the brigade, which unites them in the struggle for every piece of native land. -Together we are stronger. Everyone has to protect their land and family. Warriors are not born — they become warriors,- — says the fighter. Soledar, Donbas, Ukraine — his pain, his struggle. And he fights for those who remained under occupation and for those who no longer have a home. As ArmiyaInform reported, the role of a psychologist in the war for survival is difficult to overestimate. Not only the body, but also the soul of warriors are wounded. Lieutenant Sergey Rostikov heads the combat stress control group in 21 separate mechanized brigades.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/soledar-jogo-bil-ukrayina-jogo-borotba-istoriya-voyina-donbasa/	2025-02-06T08:32:42-08:00
-Pack your suitcases and prepare your wallets-: the occupiers give ultimatums to the residents of TO...	This was reported by the head of the Luhansk OVA, Artem Lysogor. Residents have to solve the issue of transporting things and finding a new home on their own. Russian contractors are not responsible for the possible disappearance of personal items that may be -found- during the so-called demonstrative repair. While some are forced to look for new housing, others are outraged by new -improvements- from the occupation authorities. In the so-called LNR, since February 1, the cost of travel in city and intercity transport has been significantly increased - the fares have doubled. This also applies to communal transport in Luhansk, where there has been a shortage of drivers for a long time. By raising prices, the occupation administration is trying to make transport companies more attractive for work. However, according to local residents, the quality of transportation remains far from satisfactory. Promises to improve living conditions in the temporarily occupied territories once again turn out to be empty words. People are forced to leave their homes and pay more for the same or even worse services. As reported by ArmyInform, collaborators who went to serve the occupiers found themselves in a difficult situation in the temporarily occupied Luhansk Region. Employees of the so-called state cultural institutions have not received salaries for almost two years.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/pakujte-valizy-ta-gotujte-gamanczi-okupanty-stavlyat-ultymatumy-zhytelyam-tot-luganshhyny/	2025-02-06T08:12:17-08:00

Marines from the 37th brigade cleared and destroyed one of the enemy positions in the Novopavlovsk direction. Under the cover of an Oshkosh M-ATV armored car, our fighters forced the Russians to take cover. Then part of the marines took up positions while other fighters planted explosives and blew up the Russians in their hiding place. A group of four Russians decided to go for a walk to storm our positions. Drone operators from the -Charter- brigade decided to disperse the hostile tourists. It took them only 13 minutes to destroy the entire group of Russians. Another Russian decided to go for a walk without his friends. So our drone went for a walk with him. The occupier did not try to drive away his new friend, or even shoot back, he just calmly accepted his death. These and other topics are discussed by our presenters - Lieutenant Serhii Lipko and Junior Lieutenant Volodymyr Kravchuk.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/okupant-vtratyv-golovu-vid-drona-ukrayina-otrymala-novi-vynyshhuvachi-strim-iz-pryfrontovogo-mista/	2025-02-06T07:54:28-08:00
They crossed the border at the beginning of summer — the special forces told about the secrets of th...	This was reported by the Special Operations Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on February 6. This application led to multi-layered pressure on the Russian troops and created conditions for the rapid advance of the main forces in Kurshchyna. When in June 2024, Russia continued to carry out loud airstrikes in the Sumy region, small CCO groups entered the enemy rear in the Kursk region of the Russian Federation. Two months remained before the start of a large-scale operation in Kurshchyna. SSO operators advanced early through the territory of the Russian Federation as part of preparations for the Kursk operation long before the world learned about the main offensive of the Defense Forces of Ukraine. Through careful reconnaissance and strikes against the enemy's rear structures, they destroyed the key elements of the Russian defense in the border region. Thanks to planning, the destruction of Russian air defense systems and ammunition depots did not leave the enemy the opportunity to react quickly. Point strikes on enemy strategic objects and logistics made it impossible to quickly transfer reinforcements. This performance allowed the SSO to bring the main contingent of Ukrainian troops along the prepared routes. The August offensive in Kurshchyna began with minimal resistance from the Russian army. This is the only time since the Second World War when foreign troops crossed the borders of Russia. And its military-political leadership proved unable to respond promptly to the changing situation and the asymmetry of the war. As the main units of the Ukrainian army advanced deep into Kurshchyna, special purpose groups and the SSO Resistance Movement carried out raid operations, ambushes and sabotage, blew up bridges and crossings in the enemy's rear. Combat work was coordinated with friendly units of the Defense Forces. Swarms of drones also did their thing in a sky clear of enemy air defense and EW. BpAK SSO pilots destroyed Russian logistics convoys, heavy equipment and military personnel. Not only kinetic actions were used. At the same time, units of Psychological Operations of the SSO wreaked havoc among civilians, and the Russian military was disorganized through the operation codenamed -Seneca-. However, the Russians tried to reverse the course of events by involving North Korean troops in the hostilities at the end of autumn. However, the special forces quickly adapted and inflicted some of the biggest losses on North Korean troops since the end of the active phase of the Korean War more than 70 years ago. Repelling another North Korean assault, the SSO unit was the first to capture the documents and weapons of the North Korean troops. The trophies revealed details about the level of their combat, physical and ideological training. Despite good equipment and high morale, North Korean troops were unprepared for modern warfare. FPV drone strikes only confirmed this. The North Korean special agent, who was the first to be captured by SSO operators, is already testifying in the SBU and providing valuable intelligence information. Ultimately, the deep autonomy and high training of the SSO units during the months of work during the Kursk operation allowed the Special Operations Forces to operate without the need for constant support from other units of the Defense Forces of Ukraine. And smart application, mobility, coordination of actions and high-tech equipment of the SSO prove that the defense of the prevailing enemy can be effectively undermined and achieved success. -The Kursk operation continues. We continue to work!-, said the message of the SSO of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. As reported by ArmyInform, half a year after the start of the Kursk operation, President honored its participants with state awards.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/peretnuly-kordon-shhe-na-pochatku-lita-speczpryznachenczi-rozpovily-pro-tayemnyczi-kurskoyi-operacziyi/	2025-02-06T07:46:19-08:00

As noted, the main technical characteristics of the drone are that it easily overcomes a variety of landscape obstacles, so it will pass without much effort even to the most difficult-to-reach places. -Technical characteristics of the Terminator: it will easily overcome various landscape obstacles and pass through difficult terrain without much effort. Invisibly for the enemy, it replaces the terrain and can transport up to 8 anti-tank mines on itself,- the message reads. And a machine gun can be installed on this drone so that it fires from an ambush or during offensive operations destroys enemy infantry and suppresses firing points. In addition, this platform is able to deliver ammunition, provisions, medicines and even carry the wounded. -What is the meaning of his work? After all, such combat tasks can be performed by ordinary infantrymen. Of course they can. But the combat work of one such minefield robot can replace up to four servicemen — and in this case there is an opportunity to perform a combat mission without risking the lives of fellow combatants, whose preservation is a priority,- the military emphasized. As reported by ArmyInform, the 33rd OMBR shared a selection where Ukrainian FPV drones organized a real hunt for the invaders.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/znajomtes-terminator-zsu-rozpovily-pro-nazemnogo-drona-yakyj-mozhe-minuvaty-misczevist-ta-nyshhyty-okupantiv-z-kulemeta/	2025-02-06T07:36:44-08:00

Six months after the beginning of the Kursk operation: the President honored its participants with s...	This was reported by his press service on Thursday, February 6. The head of state noted that thanks to the Kursk operation, which began exactly six months ago, it was possible to prevent a new Russian attack on Sumy and Kharkiv, returning the war to the territory of the aggressor country itself. -Aggressors and criminals can and should be beaten at home. The occupier can and should be surrendered on his territory. And it is not only fair, it is also effective — for the protection of life in our country and in Europe in general. The Kursk operation clearly explains the meaning of the principle -peace through strength,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy emphasized. According to him, the Kursk operation gave Ukraine a significant replenishment of the exchange fund and drew strong Russian units to the territory of the Russian Federation. In addition, the President thanked the soldiers and commanders who ensure the effectiveness of the operation in Kurshchyna, namely: the 80th separate amphibious assault Halytsia brigade, the 82nd separate amphibious assault Bukovina brigade, the 95th separate amphibious assault Polish brigade, the 22nd separate mechanized brigade, the 61st separate mechanized Steppe brigade, the 36th separate marine infantry brigade named after Rear Admiral Mykhailo Bilinskyi, the 17th separate Kryvyi Rih tank brigade named after Kostyantyn Pestushka, the 47th separate mechanized brigade and the 129th separate brigade of the Territorial Defense Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, as well as the SSO, SBU and the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Volodymyr Zelenskyy awarded Hero of Ukraine Lt. Col. Oleksandr Bohonchyk (SBU) and Captain Pavlo Yazlovetskyi with the -Golden Star- orders. Olexandr Bohonchyk participated in the development of an aircraft-type drone, which has already proven its effectiveness in destroying Russian UAVs and contributed to the development of a new direction of countering drones. On the night of August 6, Oleksandr Bohonchyk's group eliminated all six enemy anti-aircraft missiles in the area of ​​responsibility. Thanks to this, units of the Defense Forces entered the territory of the Russian Federation virtually unnoticed. In total, 169 drones were destroyed in the Kursk area under the leadership of Oleksandr Bohonchyk. In addition, he trained seven groups that are now independently participating in combat operations and eliminating Russian drones. Pavlo Yazlovetskyi is the commander of the airborne assault company of the 82nd ODSHBr. Last year in August, he conducted raids in the Kursk region, during which his unit was caught in three fire ambushes, but was able to occupy the designated border. Pavlo Yazlovetskyi organized the occupation of the circular defense and set up an ambush for the Russian invaders. 102 soldiers under his command traveled dozens of kilometers through enemy-controlled territories for two days and were able to get out of the encirclement. The unit destroyed about three platoons, four units of combat armored vehicles and about ten units of motor vehicles. The President also awarded four defenders with the -Cross of Combat Merit-. It was received by: Major Ivan Bakrev. As the commander of the artillery division of the 82nd ODSHBr during the offensive and search-and-strike operations last year in August on the territory of Kurshchyna, he prevented shelling by Russian aircraft and artillery, saved the lives of Ukrainian soldiers and inflicted losses on the enemy. During this operation, 17 Russian occupiers were destroyed, MT-LB, automobile equipment, a tank and a mortar were damaged. Colonel Viktor Bilozyorov (SBU).

-Mirages- fly - what will they do: about the Mirage 2000 mission in Ukraine	ArmyInform in October of last year published material on the capabilities of the French multi-purpose jet fighter of the 4th generation. We offer to recall it today. F-16 Fighting Falcon is currently the most famous Western fighter in Ukraine. However, it is not the only one, the transfer of which is discussed during the dialogue with partner countries. The list of aerial fighters also includes the Dassault Mirage 2000, a fourth-generation multi-purpose jet fighter. Developed in the 1970s by Dassault Aviation, it became the main combat aircraft of the French Air Force in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. As the French like to remind, it was their Mirage that became the only plane in the world that was confirmed to have shot down the invincible F-16 in air combat. ArmyInform already wrote about this unique historical battle. Back in June 2024, the transfer of Dassault Mirage 2000 fighters to Ukraine was announced by French President Emmanuel Macron. Later, this was also announced by the French Minister of Defense Sebastien Lecornu, informing about the time of the handover of the fighters — already in the first quarter of 2025. The head of the French defense ministry did not specify the number and modification of the aircraft, but noted that the transferred fighters will be equipped with new technical means for air-to-ground combat and electronic warfare protection. However, in the short post of the Minister of Defense of France, there is still information that allows us to reasonably assume what tasks the French Mirage 2000 will perform when repelling the aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine. The phrase -combat air-sol- used by the head of the French defense department suggests that the main task of the Mirage 2000 multi-purpose fighters will be striking ground targets. In view of the noted mention of new technical equipment specifically for delivering strikes from the air on the earth's surface, it can also be assumed which modification of the fighter-bomber will be transferred to Ukraine. Previously, the media, based on the statement of French President Emmanuel Macron, talked about the Mirage 2000-5 — a modernized export version of the aircraft. It is also possible that, in addition to it, Ukraine will receive an attack fighter-bomber of the Mirage 2000D modification, for which striking ground targets is the main purpose. Taking into account these assumptions, it is worth taking a closer look at what kind of ammunition and how the -Frenchman- in the Ukrainian sky will be able to beat the Russian invaders on Ukrainian and Russian land. The use of the Mirage 2000 as a close air support aircraft, that is, as an attack aircraft directly above the battlefield, should be immediately rejected due to the high saturation of the theater of operations with enemy air defense (APD), in particular, man-portable anti-aircraft missile systems (MANPADS). For the same reasons, the possibility of using the Mirage 2000 to drop aerial bombs in free fall should be ruled out. After all, in the event of an aircraft appearing directly above the line of battle or, even more so, in the enemy's rear at any depth, it will be a priority target for damage, which will be very difficult to avoid. Therefore, air-to-surface missiles and guided (adjusted) gliding aerial bombs remain suitable for active use. The same goes for the F-16 Fighting Falcon, so all the considerations made for the Fighting Falcons are quite valid for the Mirages as well. However, with an important amendment on what kind of ammunition the Mirage 2000 will be able to use to strike ground targets. For the F-16, as of today, it may be primarily about the AGM-154 JSOW high-precision, medium-range glider guided bombs. In the case of the Mirage 2000, it is not known for sure what -standard- ammunition Ukraine will be able to get for it, or what air-to-ground missiles or aviation bombs the aircraft can be equipped with. Most likely, the plane can be -armed- with SCALP-EG cruise missiles and Hammer cruise bombs, which are already used by the Ukrainian military aviation. However, given the high compatibility of weapons, military equipment and ammunition of NATO member states, there may be other interesting options.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/mirazhi-letyat-shho-budut-robyt-pro-zavdannya-mirage-2000-v-ukrayini/	2025-02-06T06:42:15-08:00

For almost half a century, three railway arsonists were convicted in Bukovina	This was reported on February 6 by the Security Service of Ukraine. Law enforcement officers arrested the perpetrators in September 2024 -on hot pursuit-, when they set fire to a relay box on the railway line of the western region. According to the case file, the perpetrators are two brothers and their acquaintance from the regional center, who were looking for -quick- earnings on Telegram channels. There, they were recruited remotely by a representative of the Russian special services and initially given a -test- task - to paint provocative graffiti on the walls of city buildings. The agents then received hostile instructions to set fire to energy facilities that ensure the uninterrupted movement of trains, including military echelons of the Defense Forces. In this way, the enemy hoped to disrupt the transport logistics of supplying weapons and ammunition to the Ukrainian troops at the front. During the searches of the residences of the persons involved, mobile phones with evidence of subversive activities in favor of the Russian Federation were seized.

The story of the fighters was published on the brigade's page. 28-year-old Oleg from Ternopil Oblast worked as a craftsman in furniture production before the war. In 2023, he entered the army, where after a short training he was sent to the 58th brigade as a machine gunner. One of the first combat tasks for Oleg and his comrades turned out to be a real test of strength. -We thought that it would be a normal exit to the position,- says -Student-. -But everything went wrong from the very beginning.- Approaching the position, the fighters came under fire from enemy drones. Two siblings were injured, but refused hospitalization. As it turned out later, this decision saved their lives, because the evacuation site was soon fired upon by the enemy. Having taken a position, the fighters found themselves in a difficult situation. The dugout was empty, without sleeping bags and a small bag. It was the middle of November. In addition, enemy drones mined the escape route with -petal- mines. -We got stuck in the forest,- Oleg recalls. -The enemy was no more than 500 meters away, we even heard their voices.- The situation was complicated by the fact that four of the five fighters had no combat experience. However, they were lucky with a combat medic who took command. -Our doctor organized everything,- says -Student-. -He appointed those responsible, showed what to do during an assault or a drone attack.- Under the leadership of the medic, the fighters repelled several enemy assaults. However, the main enemy for them became drones, which dropped explosives every 15-20 minutes. -They terrorized us constantly,- says Oleg. -Only at night we could rest a little.- In addition to enemy attacks, the fighters struggled with hunger, cold and thirst. -The dugout was bare,- recalls -Student-. -We took turns sleeping on boards, eating crumbs from galettes, and drinking water from puddles.- For three weeks, the fighters held the position, waiting for an opportunity to withdraw safely. And finally, after waiting for the fog, they were able to get out of the environment. -No one wanted to take risks,- says Oleg. — We knew that all the groups that came out of the neighboring positions were defeated. So we decided to wait. And finally the route was laid out, we waited for the fog and left. Fortunately, everyone came out. Thanks to our doctor.- According to the -Student-, this difficult experience made him stronger and taught him to appreciate the fighting brotherhood. -I realized that I can fully count on my brothers,- says Oleg. -Now I know that martial brotherhood is not just words.- As reported by ArmyInform, to survive in the besieged Mariupol, to walk 300 kilometers through enemy lines, to endure 14 days of exhausting journey and saving your fellows is a task that seems almost impossible. But for senior sergeant Vladyslav, call sign -Fanya-, it became a reality.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/try-tyzhni-v-oblozi-droniv-yak-student-razom-iz-chotyrma-pobratymamy-vyzhyly-v-pekli-vijny/	2025-02-06T03:01:16-08:00
Frightened by explosive branders: how the Russians are trying to counter Ukrainian naval drones	Dmytro Pletenchuk, the spokesman of the Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, told about this in the broadcast of the -Yedini Novyni- telethon. According to him, mostly such patrols fly over the eastern part of the Black Sea. Thanks to helicopters, tasks can be performed more conveniently, because their speed is comparable to the speed of a sea drone. The AN-26 propeller and the Be-12 and Be-200 amphibious aircraft are also suitable for this tactic. -The old park. They have a low speed, a low flight height. And it allows you to observe and search directly from the plane. Remember when the helicopters were shot down last time? How many crew members were there? In addition to the pilots with the navigator, there were also additional shooters and observers. They use all available models of aviation equipment,- noted Dmytro Pletenchuk. As ArmiyaInform reported, the traffic regime through the so-called Crimean Bridge is stricter than when crossing the border. The occupiers are trying to protect the object as much as possible.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/perelyak-vid-vybuhovyh-branderiv-yak-rosiyany-namagayutsya-protydiyaty-ukrayinskym-morskym-dronam/	2025-02-06T02:49:24-08:00

In a conversation with his Swedish colleague, the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine shared his vision of the situation on the battle line, which stretched for almost 1,200 km. The aggressor has an advantage in personnel, certain types of weapons and military equipment and carries out daily attacks with drones and missiles. However, Russia is paying a high price for advancing on every meter of Ukrainian land — about 1,500 people are killed and wounded every day. Lieutenant General Mikael Klasson assured that Swedish aid to Ukraine is steadfast and will continue, despite challenges, to strengthen Ukraine's defense capabilities and develop our military industry. -He conveyed his sincere gratitude to the Swedish people for consistent support of Ukraine, its increase and acceleration according to the plan for 2024-2026.

Our soldiers highly appreciate the qualities of the Archer self-propelled guns and call it an -offensive cannon-. The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Sweden thanked for the opportunity to take over the experience of our army in repelling Russian aggression. He also assured that he received good feedback, which will help to improve samples of Swedish weapons and improve military equipment. In the conversation, the topic of international support for Ukraine, cooperation with NATO and European allies, including Sweden, a new member of the Alliance, was raised. -We agreed to continue the dialogue regarding the fulfillment of the requests of the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, in particular regarding the provision of Swedish-made aircraft. We have a tough job ahead of us, but we have to go this way and win. With us is the stability and unity of the people and the support of allies, among whom is our loyal and reliable friend - the Kingdom of Sweden!- Oleksandr Syrsky concluded.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/golovnokomanduvachi-zs-ukrayiny-ta-shvecziyi-obgovoryly-sytuacziyu-na-fronti-ta-pidtrymku-syl-oborony/	2025-02-06T01:46:54-08:00

300 kilometers to freedom: how Fanya escaped from the hell of Mariupol	The soldier's story was published on page 38 of the Marine Corps Brigade. Vladyslav started his military career back in 2018, joining the ranks of the marines. Took part in hostilities in Donetsk region, and with the start of a full-scale invasion on February 24, 2022, defended Chermalyk. But the real test was waiting for him in Mariupol. Together with his brothers, -Fanya- held the defense of the city, in particular, he participated in fierce battles for the Ilyich plant. The enemy attacked from all sides, resources were exhausted, but the Marines did not give up. When the situation became critical, a group of defenders decided to break through. — We covered about 300 kilometers, walked for 14 days. One of my comrades was wounded, but did not leave the group, - recalls -Fanya-. This path required not only physical endurance, but also an indomitable will. Without food, under the constant threat of being discovered, Ukrainian soldiers broke through enemy lines. They left the environment - wounded, exhausted, but alive. After leaving Mariupol, -Fanya- continued the struggle. In May 2022, together with 1 separate battalion of marines, he participated in counteroffensive actions in the Kherson direction. And now he is fighting as part of the 38th separate brigade of marines in the Pokrovsky direction. Vladyslav remains loyal to Ukraine and the brotherhood of marines. His story is a reminder of the indomitability of Ukrainian soldiers, the strength of spirit and true fighting brotherhood. Heroes among us. The story of -Fani- is proof that there is no such thing as impossible for Ukrainian soldiers.

According to him, now in Chasovoy Yar, the Siverskyi Donets - Donbas channel, around which fierce battles continued some time ago, has lost its significance. The enemy then tried to attack using the concrete pipes of the canal. Now the enemy is concentrating troops in the Northern region. -Now we can say that moving through canal pipes is no longer relevant. The enemy made three passes in the Siverskyi Donetsk channel in order to distract our attention. We must attract an additional resource to control these passages with the help of drones, as well as remote mining,- said Dmytro Zaporozhets. According to him, during the past month, the Russians actively threw armored vehicles into battle. It was on it that the landing party was sent to the southern part of the city, to the area of ​​the -Avangard- stadium. -In January, at least 10 units of armored vehicles were destroyed.

€597 million of investments: how - the Danish model - strengthens Ukraine's defense industry and wha...	This is reported by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. It is noted that the so-called -Danish model- became one of these tools. This mechanism allows the funds of partner states to be channeled into the production of Ukrainian weapons to ensure the priority needs of the Ukrainian army. The Ministry of Defense talked about the specifics of this format of cooperation, its participants and other similar mechanisms of support for the Ukrainian army. In 2024, Ukraine and Denmark introduced a new mechanism for financing arms purchases for the Armed Forces through reimbursement of contracts with Ukrainian manufacturers. According to this scheme, the Ukrainian side forms a detailed list of projects that need financing, and Danish experts conduct a detailed assessment of the capabilities of the recommended companies and analyze their previous experience in executing contracts. Back in 2023, the Ukrainian defense industry significantly increased its production capacity. However, the country faced two significant challenges: limited government spending on arms procurement and a gradual decline in international military aid. By that time, the partner countries had already transferred a significant part of the existing reserves, but their production capacities did not have time to adapt to the new needs. In this context, the -Danish model- offered an effective solution: channeling financial resources of the allies directly into the Ukrainian defense industry, which quickly proved its effectiveness. As stated in the MoU, the uniqueness of this approach lies in the fact that it not only ensures the prompt supply of the necessary weapons to the Ukrainian military, but also creates a powerful incentive for the development of the domestic defense-industrial complex. This, in turn, significantly strengthens the economic stability of Ukraine in the conditions of martial law and forms a solid base for the further development of the defense industry. The name of this mechanism is directly related to Denmark's decisive role in its development and implementation. It was this country that became a pioneer in introducing a system of direct financing of Ukrainian defense enterprises, establishing a fundamentally new format of cooperation between partners and Ukraine in the field of defense. The decision to launch such a mechanism was made after the Danish stockpile of weapons available for transfer to the Ukrainian military was exhausted. At the first stage, Denmark allocated a tranche in the amount of 50 million euros, which was aimed at the production of 18 self-propelled -Bohdan- artillery installations. The result was not long in coming: two months after the conclusion of the implementation agreement, the equipment arrived at the combat units of the Defense Forces. Subsequently, the funding was expanded to establish the production of other strategically important types of weapons: long-range drones, anti-tank and anti-ship missile systems. In general, thanks to the coordinated work of all participants of the initiative, the Armed Forces of Ukraine have already received weapons for a total amount of almost 597 million euros. Of these, 175 million euros came directly from Denmark. The MOU said that the successful implementation of the -Danish model- contributed to the expansion of financing of the Ukrainian defense industry by other countries. In 2024, Sweden and Iceland joined the mechanism. The parties provided financial support to the initiative in the amount of 20 million euros and 2.7 million euros, respectively — directly through Denmark. An additional result was the decision to finance the production of Ukrainian weapons at the expense of interest from frozen Russian assets. In 2024, 390 million euros were allocated to these needs. This was made possible thanks to the active diplomatic support and assistance of the Danish government, which once again underlines the strategic importance of this partnership. For 2025, the EU allocated 1 billion euros from the revenues from frozen Russian assets, and Canada - about 67 million euros. Denmark has also reserved 130 million euros for further investments in the Ukrainian defense industry. In addition, Norway is expected to provide about 43 million euros for the implementation of projects within the initiative, and Sweden announced the allocation of $178 million. Within the framework of the -Danish model-, it is planned to focus on expanding the range of manufactured weapons. Special attention will be paid to the production of high-tech long-range UAVs, modern missile systems and artillery installations. The MOU noted that the -Danish model- will benefit not only individual manufacturers, but the market as a whole. After all, the financing of one enterprise allows the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine to direct the released funds to the purchase of other weapons. At the same time, the Ministry of Defense is working on scaling the -Danish model- for the production of rear-end products. The implementation of this initiative can significantly accelerate the provision of the necessary assets to the Defense Forces. Along with the -Danish model-, other mechanisms of support for the Armed Forces are also actively functioning. Traditionally, partner countries provide weapons directly from their arsenals, and also participate in joint military equipment maintenance programs and conduct comprehensive training for Ukrainian servicemen. As noted in the MOU, an equally important form of cooperation is the creation of joint defense enterprises on the territory of Ukraine, the number of which is about 40. Among the partners are world leaders such as the German Rheinmetall AG, the Franco-German KNDS and the American Boeing. Such enterprises not only provide production and maintenance of advanced equipment and ammunition directly in Ukraine, but also contribute to the attraction of significant investments in the state's economy.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/e597-mln-investyczij-yak-danska-model-zmicznyuye-opk-ukrayiny-j-chogo-ochikuvaty/	2025-02-06T00:31:41-08:00

So that there was no supply, and it was extremely difficult to carry out any evacuations,- said an officer of the 115th separate mechanized brigade. As ArmyInform reported, in the Lyman direction, the Russian occupiers seem to have lost most of their armored vehicles, and are now storming the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on everything that starts and has wheels. However, the 63rd brigade not only effectively destroys this junk, but also, it seems, organized a real -car show- - in just a few days, an entire fleet of occupiers was neutralized.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/zayihav-czikavishyj-pidrozdil-na-lymanskomu-napryamku-protyvnyk-rizhe-logistychni-arteriyi/	2025-02-05T23:42:45-08:00

The 225th assault battalion became a regiment: three years of struggle and victories	This was notified on the unit page. In less than a year, the unit was battle-hardened, becoming a separate assault battalion of the Ground Forces. On their way are the fierce battles near Bakhmut, the defense of Chasovoy Yar, the maintenance of the Avdiyivka -road of life- and the Kursk operation. On February 4, 2025, the 225th assault battalion was officially reformed into the 225th separate assault regiment. During the three years of full-scale war, they grew from a volunteer unit of Kharkiv to a combat formation, which for six months held positions on the territory of the nuclear aggressor, restraining its elite units. -We did not choose this war. But we chose who to be in it,- say the fighters of 225 OSHP. As reported by ArmiyaInform, fighters of the 225th assault battalion of the Armed Forces drew attention to the video appeal of the soldiers of the 119 parachute regiment of the army of the Russian Federation, who complain that their regiment is no longer capable of fighting, and the river bank is littered with the corpses of their comrades.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/225-j-shturmovyj-bataljon-stav-polkom-try-roky-borotby-ta-zvytyagy/	2025-02-05T23:23:03-08:00

Half a year of the Kursk operation: the enemy lost almost 40,000 soldiers and hundreds of pieces of ...	The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine informs about this. The task of the Kursk offensive operation was to prevent a new offensive of the enemy in the Sumy and Kharkiv regions. And during these six months, the operation successfully fulfills this function. Thanks to it, the Russian occupiers were forced to transfer significant resources to the Kursk region, which weakened their position in other areas of the front. Russia even asked for help from North Korea, which sent 12,000 of its servicemen to Kurshchyna. However, the losses of the North Korean contingent amounted to about 4,000 people, which led to the destruction of one of the three conditional brigades and the incapacitation of the other two. Currently, units from the DPRK have been withdrawn from the front line. In general, during 6 months of active hostilities in the Kursk region, the Russian occupiers lost approximately 39,900 lives, of which about 16,100 were killed. In addition, the enemy lost a significant amount of equipment, in particular: During the operation, Ukrainian forces captured 909 Russian soldiers, which significantly replenished the exchange fund and allowed hundreds of Ukrainian defenders to return home. The Kursk offensive operation is an example of sudden, asymmetric and successful actions of the Defense Forces of Ukraine, which make it possible to inflict significant losses on the overwhelming enemy and seize the initiative on the battlefield.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/piv-roku-kurskoyi-operacziyi-vorog-vtratyv-majzhe-40-tysyach-vijskovyh-ta-sotni-odynycz-tehniky/	2025-02-05T22:35:00-08:00

-Barabashovo- under attack again: the Russian occupiers do not stop trying to destroy the largest ma...	The Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office informs about this. According to preliminary data, the attack took place around 11:30 p.m. on February 5. As a result of the hit, trade pavilions caught fire. This is not the first time that the Russian invaders have tried to destroy Barabashovo. In March 2022, the market was already subjected to severe shelling from -Hrads-, which led to a large-scale fire and turned it into a charred place. Then, while the fire was being extinguished, Russian troops fired at the market again, injuring the rescuers. This time, in 2025, Russian terrorists used Geran-2 drones to attack. As a result of the explosion, dozens of trade pavilions were damaged. Fortunately, there were no victims, but the security guards who were at the scene — were injured. The consequences of the attack are still being determined. However, it is already clear that the Russian occupiers continue to purposefully destroy Kharkiv's civilian infrastructure, causing significant damage to local entrepreneurs and city residents. We remind you that the Barabashovo market is not only the largest market in Eastern Europe, but also an important economic center of Kharkiv.

The Armed Forces are switching to a corps system: the expert named the pros and cons of such a step	How will such a step be useful for our Armed Forces, ArmyInform asked a lawyer, a serviceman of the Armed Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Oleksandr Musienko. The interlocutor reminded that the Ukrainian army is going through the path of reforms not only taking into account NATO standards, but also based on how the combat situation is formed, what experience is gained and, accordingly, what conclusions are drawn. -Based on this, assessing the state of the troop management system during a large-scale invasion, an in-depth analysis of the system that exists and how it can be improved to make it even more efficient, better and more effective. Accordingly, a decision was made and a system was developed by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine under the command of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, General Oleksandr Syrskyi, which provides for the transition to corps in the Armed Forces of Ukraine. It was proposed to the Supreme Commander-in-Chief to the President of Ukraine with explanations and justifications,- says Oleksandr Musienko. Yes, the transition to a corpus system is dictated, in fact, by the experience of the Defense Forces. -First, it is necessary to improve the efficiency, manageability and organization of processes. Accordingly, in order to take into account the experience that was in both OTU and OSUV, it is the army corps that can improve their work, where there will be an appropriate number of brigades that will be combined into corps; there will be a command, a clear hierarchy, there will be a corps area of ​​responsibility, and the corps will serve and repel Russian aggression,- the expert says. And he continues: -Secondly, it can solve the issue of so-called seconded units: when in fact we have units from different brigades and they can work in different directions of the front. Accordingly, this will improve the situation. In addition, the corps system will allow commanders on the ground to understand and calculate the number of forces and assets and a clear area of ​​responsibility that they will cover.- In addition, according to Oleksandr Musienko, it will improve the efficiency of management and organization. -Another point to consider: the size of the Defense Forces increased under a full-scale Russian invasion. Therefore, the corps system was chosen for the Armed Forces as a system that exists in many partner countries of Ukraine in NATO. Such systems exist in the USA, Great Britain, France, Australia, and New Zealand. Even China has such a system. She justified herself, proved herself well. And it must respond to the challenges facing the Armed Forces of Ukraine today,- Oleksandr Musienko summarized.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/zsu-perehodyat-na-korpusnu-systemu-ekspert-nazvav-plyusy-i-perevagy-takogo-kroku/	2025-02-05T21:03:58-08:00
Creeping -Cockroach- with striking -Saber-: what ground robotic complexes are capable of at the fron...	Andriy with the call sign -Dais- told ArmiyaInform about how ground drones work instead of people and help people at the front. Cockroach ground drones are Andrii's favorites. Like the insects that give them their name, these drones are hardy, durable, highly maneuverable, and can become virtually omnipresent when needed. And they are also versatile and perform a wide variety of functions. - These are our most favorite universal ground robotic complexes. Passability, price, a very simple design that can be modified, a very versatile base, emphasizes the military. The easiest way to use -Targan- is to deliver cargo to the front line. Where it is dangerous to use other equipment or, even more so, to go to the fighters, the -Targan- can become irreplaceable. — They can carry up to 200 kilograms. We use precisely such -Cockroaches- to perform logistical tasks. And there is also -Targan 3K- - it is much larger and can cover a greater distance, work in worse conditions. For example, it can even evacuate some ground units or aerial drones that have fallen, Dice says. In general, Andrii emphasizes, the use of a ground drone is limited only by the imagination of developers and operators. For example, in the near future, it is planned to use -Cockroaches- as a platform for the delivery of FPV drones, which will be able to launch as close as possible to enemy positions without any risk to the pilot. On the -Targan- you can also install a remote-controlled Saber combat module, with the help of which fire suppression of the enemy is carried out. — Here you can see drones with different modifications, including turrets installed on them, called Saber. They can be used in different ways right on the battle line, says Dice. To control such a complex, which is called -Thermite-, two operators are needed. One of them controls the movement of the drone, the other fires. — One controls the Saber itself from the steam deck of the controller, i.e. fire and guidance, and the other operator controls the drone itself, Andrii explains. These systems have already managed to be tested in combat conditions, but it is not yet possible to tell about all the details of their application. In addition, a confident military man, the most daring operations of the -Cockroaches- with the -Sabres- are still ahead. Another possible way of using the ground robotic complex is to blow up enemy fortifications with the help of an explosive charge mounted on a drone. — We also used drones as kamikaze. If we needed to completely demolish some enemy fortifications, then we used one of the drones, which was called -Ratel,- says Andriy. Now drones of this modification are no longer being made. Although they performed quite well, those ground robotic platforms needed improvement. — Each model is created for its own separate task. For example, if it is a kamikaze drone, you need to reduce the weight of the drone itself and increase the mass of explosives it can carry. That is why we, as military personnel who already have experience in this field, need to constantly complete, rework, and modify ground robotic complexes, - explains Andriy. On the basis of the -Targan- base, it is also possible to create a robotic complex designed to evacuate wounded fighters. Such drones can also take out their damaged mechanical -brothers- - both ground and air - from the -gray zone-. - We try to save our drones from damage. For this, we use a modified platform that has the ability to pull the drone to itself or somehow grab it, says Dice. In this way, -Targan- was able to save the heavy Vampire hexacopter, which the Russian occupiers call -Baba Yaga- out of fear. The video with the rescue of a heavy night air bomber has gone viral on the Internet. Such an evacuation, the military emphasizes, is a real special operation that requires accurate calculations and the work of experienced engineers and drone operators. After all, only qualified specialists are able to take into account all the nuances and make accurate calculations, and then do what no one anywhere has ever done before them. A special mining system is installed on one of the -Targans-, which allows the transportation and installation of anti-tank mines. - Mines are installed from it, after which the drone leaves the place of the task - -Dice- explains the principle of operation of the -Targan- miner. In this way, the drone sapper allows not to expose military personnel to danger, taking upon itself not only the delivery, but also the installation of mines. - The developers of -Targan- assure that it can drive 20 kilometers, but we drove much more. It all depends on the modification of the drone, the weight it carries and the quality of the batteries. We can install better batteries on it, and it will -live- longer, go further and perform more combat missions, -Dice- explains. For the further development of ground-based robotic complexes, there is currently a shortage of qualified specialists. -If you really have skills, just come to us, we will find you a place where you can realize all your technical fantasies and do things that are very unpleasant for Russians,- jokes -Andriy-. He assures that, with the desire and ability to learn, anyone who makes the necessary efforts can master the profession of a ground drone operator. He himself transferred to the engineering and sapper division, which had ground robotic complexes, from the infantry. Having learned how to fly the -Cockroaches- and gained experience using ground-based drones on the front line, he now imparts his knowledge, skills and expertise to other fighters.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/povzuchyj-targan-z-razyuchoyu-shableyu-na-shho-zdatni-nazemni-robotyzovani-kompleksy-na-fronti/	2025-02-05T20:41:24-08:00
700,000 hours of testing: the US Army received the latest unmanned aerial reconnaissance system	As noted in a release posted on the official portal of the US Army, the MK 4.8 HQ airborne sounding system from its developer, Textron Systems, is an important milestone in the rapid prototyping program, ArmyInform reports. -This achievement was the result of a complex two-year development and testing process, which included extensive technical research, acceptance tests on the ground and in flight, as well as the joint efforts of the supplier and the United States government,- the US Army emphasizes. In turn, Textron Systems, known worldwide for its powerful brands such as Bell, Cessna, Beechcraft, Pipistrel and a number of others, revealed that the MK 4.8 Hybrid Quad (HQ) drone is now part of the US Army's Future Tactical Unmanned Aircraft Systems (FTUAS) program. -The Aerosonde® family of unmanned aerial vehicles from Textron Systems has been developed for complex missions both on land and at sea, and has been proven by more than 700,000 hours of test flights in the harshest environmental conditions, including desert heat and arctic cold,- the UAV manufacturers emphasized. The two-beam Aerosonde Mk 4.8 UAV is designed according to a hybrid scheme with a straight wing, four lifting screws with an electric drive and one screw with a drive from an internal combustion engine of the company -Lycoming-. Maximum take-off weight 93 kg, payload weight 14 kg, flight duration up to 14 hours. This drone is equipped with Hybrid Quadrotor technology that provides vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL), making it independent of traditional runways. Designed specifically to operate in challenging environments and austere areas, Aerosonde HQ offers increased flexibility for military missions with its ability to rapidly deploy and be operated by just two operators, making it easy to transport by UH-60 helicopters or tactical vehicles. The system has a flight endurance of 14 hours and can reach altitudes of more than 15,000 feet (4,572 meters) above sea level. The use of a heavy fuel engine (JP-8) which is widely used in the army for both land and air vehicles in all NATO countries. This simplifies logistics on the ground and reduces the need for additional support equipment. Aerosonde Mk. 4.8 HQ is also designed on the basis of a modular open system approach (MOSA), which allows easy integration of new technologies and innovations, while optimizing needs and avoiding unnecessary costs. This combination of features makes Aerosonde HQ a reliable and adaptable solution for the reconnaissance and surveillance missions required by modern military operations. Specialists of the development company claim that the drone can be deployed and launched in less than 30 minutes of preparatory work. It is capable of carrying electro-optical and infrared (EO/IR) cameras, radar systems and signals intelligence (SIGINT) assets, providing operators with real-time intelligence both day and night. The FTUAS project team will now continue to train Army personnel on the new equipment so they can qualify as instructors and operators at Redstone Test Center on the MK 4.8 HQ Aerosonde system. This training is expected to be completed by early February 2025. The U.S. Army said the FTUAS program will provide brigade combat teams with organic capabilities for intelligence and surveillance operations that will allow them to gather, develop and communicate operational intelligence. This will allow BCT commanders to maintain dominance during multi-domain operations. In the draft budget for 2025 The Pentagon has requested funding in the form of $129 million for the construction of seven FTUAS devices. The start of re-equipment of combat units of the US Army with FTUAS devices is expected in 2026. It is difficult to call FTUAS massive, since one ground forces brigade will have only 20 such devices.

the Russian Federation is dispelling the fake that the Armed Forces of Ukraine en masse catch and ea...	Propaganda resources launched this -information release- in the spirit of Russian fiction: they say that there is a lack of food at the front, so the Armed Forces decided to switch to a four-legged diet. It is clear that for people who believe in a -crucified boy-, -NATO combat mosquitoes- and -biolaboratories in Ukrainian pigeon houses-, such a story sounds quite plausible. However, there is a small problem: there is no shortage of food in Ukraine, the military is provided with rations, and volunteers regularly deliver everything from stew to fresh baked goods to the front. Ukrainian military personnel often rescue animals themselves during the war. The front line is not the best place for defenseless dogs and cats, so they are taken to the rear, given to volunteers or simply taken into care. Each unit has its own -mascot- - a cat, a dog, and sometimes even a crow or a raccoon. Unlike the Russian army, which even steals toilets in the occupied territories, the Ukrainian military is not looking for -alternative sources of protein.- This is a classic scheme of Russian propaganda: to dehumanize the Ukrainian military, to show them as subhuman in order to justify aggression. If Ukrainians -eat dogs- in their imagination, then perhaps they deserve to be -denazified-? This is how the Russian machine of lies works. The next time you hear about -bloody Ukro carnivores-, remember that this is the same propaganda that once talked about the -crucified boy- and -baby organs in jars-. Russian media turned into a cheap circus a long time ago. So don't be surprised if their next -sensational report- is about the fact that Ukrainians feed exclusively on unicorns and ghosts.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/rf-rozganyaye-fejk-shho-zsu-masovo-vidlovlyuyut-i-yidyat-bezprytulnyh-sobak/	2025-02-05T20:03:54-08:00
Rustem Umyerov discussed with John Gilly the preparation for the meeting of the Ukraine-NATO Council	About this he told on his Facebook page. -We discussed the current situation at the front and the top defense priorities of Ukraine. Particular attention was paid to the preparation for the meeting of the Ukraine-NATO Council, which will take place in the near future. This is a key format for strengthening our cooperation with allies and coordinating further steps in the field of security,- said the head of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. He also expressed his gratitude to Great Britain for its steadfast support of our country and effective dialogue. -Together we are working to strengthen Ukraine's defense capabilities and security,- added Rustem Umyerov. As reported by ArmyInform, earlier the Minister of Defense of Ukraine spoke about the strengthening of defense cooperation with the Czech Republic in several directions at once.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/05/rustem-umyerov-obgovoryv-z-dzhonom-gili-pidgotovku-do-zasidannya-rady-ukrayina-nato/	2025-02-05T12:08:32-08:00
Military psychologist Serhii Rostikov: -Next to some stories, cinema seems uninteresting-	The story of the fighter was made public on the page of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. In civilian life, he ran a small business and was a public activist. He has economic and technical education, and now he is studying psychology. Completed training courses in Great Britain. He has experience of fixed-term and contract service, in particular in the Ukrainian peacekeeping contingent in Iraq. In the first days of the full-scale invasion, Rostikov, then still a sergeant, returned to the army. -I was a deputy platoon commander, I commanded people, I saw how differently they react to circumstances, and how some need support. At the end of 2022, I was offered to take an officer's course in military psychology, and I immediately agreed. Even in civilian life, I was always interested in psychology, and already during the war I saw from my own experience how its understanding is important for the effective management of a unit,- says Serhiy. The officer considers communication with people to be the most interesting aspect of his work. He says that there are such human stories next to which cinema seems uninteresting. -The strength of spirit of some people is impressive, despite the enormous fatigue and sometimes inhuman workload on the battlefield, they still maintain peace of mind and a sense of humor,- Serhii says. Arriving at positions, a training ground or a medical facility, a psychologist helps soldiers find peace of mind, accept the circumstances of war, and teaches soldiers how to provide psychological first aid to each other. In the Main Department of Psychological Support of the Armed Forces personnel, they carefully study the work of psychologists in the field, generalize best practices and disseminate them among colleagues. But they also see problems and look for ways to solve them. Today, there is a need for qualified military psychologists in the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Civilian psychologists who are called up for military service do not always have experience with combat psychotrauma, which causes them confusion and uncertainty when providing psychological help to military personnel. At the same time, civilian experience and a fresh perspective sometimes become a significant factor in the development of effective changes in the training and work of military psychologists. The main administration introduced advanced training courses on the funds of the Military Institute of Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv, where psychological officers of personnel psychological support structures acquire the necessary knowledge, exchange experience and develop creative ideas in the field of military psychology. In the conditions of the shortage of psychologists in the units, the workload of the psychologist himself and an adequate understanding of his work in the war acquire special meaning. In a subdivision, you can't say, -I'll listen to six, and the others next time.- Sometimes you have to work as much as the circumstances require. Of course, such a load is difficult to compare with constant stay in positions during shelling, however, the work of psychologists in war is quite difficult and exhausting. Stress, like general fatigue, has the ability to accumulate, and many people simply do not know what to do with it all. Stereotypes also add pressure: they say that men should not complain, men should not ask for help, crying is a sign of weakness, and much more. The task of a military psychologist is not only to stabilize the psycho-emotional state of a serviceman, but also to help him find internal and external resources necessary for quality recovery, to find his own purpose of being in the war, to understand the basics of communication with relatives, with the family, etc. Each new day brings new challenges for the military psychologist, and he must be ready for them. For some people, a psychologist is a hidden hope that they will be heard, that they are not alone with their problems, that there is always a way out, even in the most difficult life situations. This is how Serhiy Rostikov sees his work. And people trust him. As reported by ArmyInform, -Viking- is a fighter of the International Legion of the Ground Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, who has been fighting for Ukraine against the Russians for three years occupiers. He went through a difficult battle path, destroying many enemies, and became a true professional in his field.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/05/vijskovyj-psyholog-sergij-rostikov-poruch-z-deyakymy-istoriyamy-kino-zdayetsya-neczikavym/	2025-02-05T11:58:36-08:00
Mountain race: border guards caught a group of people at the border	The State Border Service of Ukraine informs about this on February 5. -However, on the approach to the state border, the group was discovered by the border guard. The UAV operator monitored the movement of violators and coordinated the actions of the border guards,- the statement said. Seeing the border guards, the violators tried to escape, but they failed. The conductor found his way faster than the others and even managed to break away, but not for long. During further work, the officers of the operative and investigative unit learned that residents of the Chernivtsi and Kyiv regions, independently of each other, attacked the organizer of the illegal scheme and paid him 9,000 USD each for transportation to Romania bypassing the checkpoints. -Regarding illegal tourists, protocols have been drawn up according to 2 Art. 204-1 and Art. 185-10 of the Code of Administrative Offenses. Regarding the conductor, a notification was sent to the law enforcement agencies under Article 332 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine. Measures to establish the location of the main organizer of illegal equipment are underway,- the State Security Service of Ukraine said. ArmyInform reminds that it is better not to break the law or risk your life, but to use the aggregator of vacancies in the Armed Forces and recruiting centers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/05/girski-peregony-na-kordoni-prykordonnyky-spijmaly-grupu-osib/	2025-02-05T11:44:21-08:00
Instead of a ball - a machine gun: how -Footballist- changed the football field to the battlefield	The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. On February 9, 2023, Andrii voluntarily joined -Staleva Sotka-. At that time, he already had the experience of military service, so he quickly mastered military affairs. -I had the title of senior soldier since I was drafted. He became a junior sergeant quite quickly, but by no means under pleasant circumstances. When the commander of our department died, I had to take his place and, accordingly, receive the rank of junior sergeant. And in a year, another rank of sergeant,- says Andriy. Despite the offer to become an officer, -Footballist- decided to stay in the post of sergeant. He believes that this gives him more opportunities to communicate with the personnel, transfer his knowledge and combat experience to his comrades. -You need to constantly communicate with the boys, take an interest in their problems and look for ways to solve these problems together,- Andrii shares his method of work. -After all, you can go to the range together in your free time from combat missions and just shoot at targets to your heart's content - in many cases, by the way, this helps to relieve internal tension.- The -Footballist- considers trust in fellow players to be the main factor of success in battle. -If you are sure that there is a person standing next to you shoulder to shoulder who will always help, always cover, and if necessary, even take you off the battlefield, your confidence increases many times,- he says. His wife and five-year-old son are waiting for Andrii at home. -With my wife and son, we really like to go on vacation, especially to the Carpathians. But to such places, where there are not many people, - says -Footballist-. — Currently, my family is more than a thousand kilometers away from me. Of course, we miss each other terribly and dream of the time when we will be together again and have the opportunity to go to our beloved Carpathians at any moment!- As reported by ArmyInform, -Viking- is a fighter of the International Legion of the Ground Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, who has been fighting for Ukraine against the Russians for three years occupiers.

10 years behind bars: the court sentenced a collaborator from Kozachai Lopan	The Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office informs about this. The court found him guilty of collaborative activity (Part 5 of Article 111-1 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine) for maintaining a public accusation by the prosecutors of the Dergachy District Prosecutor's Office of the Kharkiv Region. He was sentenced to 10 years of imprisonment with deprivation of the right to hold certain positions in state authorities and/or local self-government bodies or bodies that provide public services, including positions related to the performance of organizational-managerial and administrative-economic functions, for a period of 15 years with confiscation of property. A man who was born in the Smolensk region of the Russian Federation, but long ago moved to the village of Kozacha Lopan, where he was engaged in entrepreneurial activities, during the capture of the settlement by the armed forces of the Russian Federation, deliberately chose for himself the path of cooperation with the enemy. Having assumed the position of -deputy head of the Kharkiv Oblast Central Committee-, he, on the instructions of representatives of the Russian Federation, dealt with -issues of economy and finance-, and also carried out -supervision- of the movement of people in the temporarily occupied territory, issuing -passes for movement-. By abusing his authority, the collaborator did not issue exit permits to persons who did not support the actions of the Russian Federation and those who planned to leave for the territory of Ukraine. The suspect walked around the village in a Russian military uniform and with a weapon. Before the deoccupation of the settlement by the Armed Forces of Ukraine, he fled to the Russian Federation. Court proceedings in criminal proceedings were conducted in the absence of the accused (in absentia). Since the convicted person is hiding from Ukrainian justice on the territory of the Russian Federation, the term of his sentence will begin to be calculated from the moment of actual detention. As long as he avoids serving the sentence imposed by the court, the statute of limitations is suspended. The convict is wanted. The indictment was handed down by the Dergachy District Court of the Kharkiv Region. The period for an appeal continues. As reported by ArmyInform, when the full-scale invasion began, Georgiy, a retired, reservist, did not hesitate. not a minute. He immediately applied for service in the Steel Border border brigade and returned to the fight for Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/05/10-rokiv-za-gratamy-sud-vynis-vyrok-kolaborantu-z-kozachoyi-lopani/	2025-02-05T10:24:50-08:00

Security guarantees and anti-Russian sanctions — the President discussed with the British Foreign Mi...	The President's website reported this on February 5. The head of state thanked Great Britain for all its defense, financial, humanitarian and political support since the first days of full-scale Russian aggression. -Thank you, Prime Minister Starmer and the government. In particular, for his visit to us and the signing of a very important, historic agreement on a hundred-year partnership in various directions,- the President emphasized. Volodymyr Zelenskyi and David Lammy, in particular, discussed the implementation of this agreement, as well as other formats of aid both at the bilateral level and within multilateral mechanisms. -This outlines our obligations to you not only for the period of this war, but also much further, based on our military, humanitarian and economic cooperation for the benefit of our countries,- added the head of the British Foreign Ministry. Separately, the Head of State noted financial assistance for the development of Ukrainian defense production, which is very important for strengthening the position of our country on the way to establishing a just and lasting peace. In particular, Great Britain will allocate 2 billion pounds to strengthen Ukrainian defense capabilities. The relevant agreement between the governments of the states was ratified yesterday by the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine. One of the key topics of the meeting is coordination of steps with partners and security guarantees. The parties also discussed in detail the strengthening of sanctions against the Russian Federation, in particular its oil industry and defense industry, and the use of frozen Russian assets for the benefit of Ukraine.

Recruited and killed — the Russian special services began airdropping their terrorists	reported this on February 5 First Deputy Head of the SBU Serhii Andrushchenko during a joint briefing with the Chief of the National Police Ivan Vyhivskyi. In this way, the Russians actually liquidate the perpetrator of -darkness- in order to remove the witness of the crime and not pay him the promised money. -Russian special services simply use these people for their purposes as consumables. The FSB officer doesn't care what happens to them after the task is completed,- Serhiy Andrushchenko remarked. He said that the executors of the special services of the Russian Federation are recruited through instant messengers and online communities for making quick money. Young people or the unemployed often agree to cooperate, to whom curators will later inform the location for committing a terrorist attack and the storage location of an improvised explosive device prepared by another group of agents. -We establish the entire chain: from recruitment to preparation of the crime. As a rule, we work on prejudice — we detain criminals when they take explosives out of a cache,- Serhiy Andrushchenko said. He emphasized that blowing up buildings of the TCC and other objects are serious crimes, which the Criminal Code of Ukraine classifies as a terrorist act. They are subject to strict criminal liability — 15 years in prison or life imprisonment. In order to counter the recruitment of citizens, in mid-December the SBU launched the official chatbot -Spaly- FSBeshnyk- in Telegram.

Vacation, benefits, legal aid: what the state guarantees to those who have been released from captiv...	ArmyInform tells what rights and opportunities those who have gone through captivity have. Servicemen released from captivity may resign from service. This is provided by Art. 26 of the Law of Ukraine -On Military Duty and Military Service-, amendments to which entered into force on May 18 of this year. At the same time, it does not matter when exactly the serviceman was released from captivity. If a serviceman decides to use the right to discharge, he can also count on upon dismissal. It is 50 percent of the monthly allowance for each full calendar year of service. If a serviceman who has returned from captivity wishes to continue his service, he has the right to 90 days holidays. Such leave is not divided into parts, and during it the allowance continues to be accrued. Such leave can be revoked only with the consent of the serviceman. Those released from captivity are entitled to one-time assistance of 100,000 hryvnias. This applies to both civilians and military personnel. It also provides for the payment of anannualfinancial aid for those who were in captivity. This is 100,000 hryvnias for each year of detention. How to get? In order to calculate such payments, it is necessary to establish the fact of deprivation of liberty as a result of armed aggression against Ukraine. The establishment of this fact is handled by a special commission under the Ministry of Reintegration of Temporarily Occupied Territories. One of the mandatory documents that must be provided to the commission is a certificate of being in captivity. It can be obtained from the National Information Bureau. The request should be sent to the e-mail of the bureau: info@nib.gov.ua Citizens released from captivity have the right to legal assistance. And given all the bureaucratic factors that exist in our country, such help will definitely not be superfluous.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/05/vidpustka-vyplaty-pravova-dopomoga-shho-derzhava-garantuye-tym-hto-zvilnyvsya-z-polonu/	2025-02-05T06:48:22-08:00

The Minister of Culture and Strategic Communications of Ukraine Mykola Tochytskyi said about this. -Children will be trained to organize aid to the Russian army, and in the future, to participate in hostilities against Ukraine. On February 3, the Russian president signed a decree strengthening the activities of the Soviet totalitarian remnant called Dosaaf, fully subordinating the organization to his -Ministry of Attack of the Russian Federation-. This is not an ordinary document, but part of the global Russian plan to carry out assimilative genocide of Ukraine and the Ukrainian nation,- the Minister states. Our colleagues from the Center for Journalistic Investigation have drawn attention to the report of the occupying -Ministry of Youth Policy- on the TOT of the Zaporizhia region, in which they boast that they have attracted about 1,000 children to the so-called -youth army-. -The founder of the -junarmy- is the already mentioned -dosaaf-, which was administratively strengthened by Putin's decree. Thus, the program of indoctrinating children into the beliefs of the -Pobedobesiya- sect is a consistently planned Russian policy,- Mykola Tochytskyi emphasizes. ArmyInform reported that due to the Russian propaganda processing in the occupied territories, at least 1.5 million Ukrainian children. -By indoctrinating Ukrainian children in the occupied territories, instilling in them hatred of Ukraine and its people, Putin and his clique are carrying out an assimilative genocide of the Ukrainian nation. We demand that the Russian authorities immediately stop this criminal practice and appeal to the Ukrainian media, public organizations and our foreign partners to pay attention to Russia's war crimes and to take measures to document these activities so that the perpetrators will sooner or later suffer the deserved punishment,- wrote the Minister of Culture and Strategic Communications of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/05/putin-zbyraye-armiyu-ditej-yunarmiyu-pidporyadkuvaly-ministerstvu-napadu-rf/	2025-02-05T06:33:38-08:00

We are dealing with a Russian agency and a targeted destabilizing campaign: an expert on explosions ...	This was told to ArmiyaInform by an expert of the non-governmental analytical center -Ukrainian Studies of Strategic Studies-, a candidate of political sciences and a military serviceman of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Yury Oliynyk. -We are dealing with a clear action of Russian agents and a targeted campaign aimed at discrediting the mobilization in Ukraine and inciting a civil conflict between civilians and the military,- says Yurii Oliynyk. According to him, the explosions are part of a long-term plan that has been in place for several years. -At first, there was informational incitement - the spread of manipulations, fakes about the brutality of TCC employees, their demonization, then - the inciting of enmity between the -evaders- and the military. And now the moment was prepared to demonstrate the supposed civil confrontation. All these explosions in Rivne, Pavlohrad, and Kamianets-Podilskyi had been prepared for a long time. Agents were waiting for the right time to implement them, so that they entered a single information wave. The trigger for this was the events in Poltava - the tragedy when a serviceman died,- the expert noted. Yurii Oliynyk believes that these explosions have one signature and are aimed at inciting hysteria, further demonstrating that the population of Ukraine is allegedly opposing the army, and creating informational chaos. As ArmyInform reported, Russian special services use Ukrainian teenagers and ill-informed youth who crave easy money to carry out sabotage, ultimately eliminating them as extra witnesses. -Recruited saboteurs are simply used and thrown away by the Russians. The Security Service of the Russian Federation and the FSB of the Russian Federation promise money to saboteurs against the military in Ukraine, but they fool the perpetrators of the crimes, do not pay them, and also do not inform the perpetrators that they often plan to activate the explosives they carry, even while the terrorists are performing the task Russian curators,- explains the head of the Center for countering disinformation of the NSDC, Lieutenant Andriy Kovalenko.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/05/mayemo-spravu-z-rosagenturoyu-ta-czilespryamovanoyu-destabilizuyuchoyu-kampaniyeyu-ekspert-pro-vybuhy-v-tczk/	2025-02-05T06:23:51-08:00

He overpaid UAH 12 million for fuel tanks: the commander of the military unit will be tried	This is reported by the State Bureau of Investigation. It is noted that three participants applied for the tender announced by the military for the purchase of fuel tanks. The offer from the private enterprise with the lowest price was selected as the winner. -However, after concluding the contracts, merchants artificially inflated the cost of products in the documentation.

An explosion near the TCC in Kamianets-Podilskyi: one person died, four others were injured	This information was confirmed by the head of Khmelnytska OVA Serhii Tyurin on Wednesday, February 5. -About an hour ago, there was an explosion on the territory of the Kamianets-Podilskyi district territorial center of recruitment and social support. Currently, we know about one dead and four injured people,- he wrote in his Telegram channel.

Charter drones: how the eyes of the Ukrainian army work	The video of the combat operation of the calculation of Ukrainian drones was made public on the channel of the 13th Brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine -Charter-. The drones of the -Charter- brigade perform a mission that the military themselves call -the eyes of the unit.- They transmit real-time images from places where an ordinary soldier cannot reach. This allows receiving critical information about the movement of enemy equipment and manpower. -We convey the picture, show what is not visible from the ground,- the fighters say. They fly around the clock - 24/7, regardless of weather conditions, although even fog can be a serious obstacle to sightings. Operators not only find targets, but also coordinate their destruction. If the drone detects the movement of enemy infantry or equipment, the decision to strike is made literally in a few minutes. If stationary shelters are found, such as dugouts or basements, they can be destroyed by artillery. Russian troops are actively trying to fight Ukrainian UAVs. They use anti-drone guns and electronic warfare devices, try to shoot down or intercept FPV drones. However, Ukrainian operators are also improving their tactics and skills, reducing the risk of equipment losses. -This is a kind of drone-on-drone, bash-on-bash battle,- says the military, explaining that their advantage lies in the speed of response and the accuracy of strikes. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the 13th operational brigade of NSU -Charter- destroyed 15 Russian invaders as well as an ammunition depot, a cannon, and an enemy shelter.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/05/dronari-hartiyi-yak-praczyuyut-ochi-ukrayinskoyi-armiyi/	2025-02-05T04:51:56-08:00

Explosions in the TCC: the Russian special services fool the performers and blow them up themselves ...	This is against the background of undermining of TCC in Rivne, Pavlograd and Kamianets-Podilskyi told the head of the Center for countering disinformation of the NSDC, lieutenant Andrii Kovalenko. According to him, Russian curators promise recruited performers -easy money-, assuring them that they will only be couriers, and then -they just use and throw away-. -GRU of the Russian Federation and the FSB of the Russian Federation promise money to saboteurs against the military in Ukraine, but they fool the perpetrators of crimes, do not pay them, and also do not inform the perpetrators that they often plan to activate the explosives they carry, even while the terrorists are performing the tasks of Russian curators,- he explained Andriy Kovalenko. As ArmiyaInform reported, on Wednesday, February 5, an explosion rang out in the premises of the TCC in Kamyanc-Podilskyi, as a result in which one person died and several others were injured.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/05/vybuhy-u-tczk-speczsluzhby-rf-duryat-vykonavcziv-i-sami-zh-yih-pidryvayut-czpd-rnbo/	2025-02-05T04:36:50-08:00
-Family circumstances- - candid stories of border guards who voluntarily returned from the North-Wes...	Their candid stories were published on Wednesday, February 5, by the State Border Guard Service. So, a fighter of the -Revenge- brigade Maksym under the pseudonym -Suyeta- voluntarily returned to the service after 9 months of military service. -Last year in March, he took part in battles in the Swativ direction, was an anti-drone gun operator. Within a month, his mother fell ill, constant relocations and seven years of service also affected him - Maksym voluntarily left the military unit. However, after solving family problems, he returned — he took advantage of the law, which gives the opportunity to resume his service,- said the DPSU. According to Maksym, in his case, the cause of SZH was a moral and psychological condition. Alexander has a similar story, who volunteered for service with two minor children and a disabled wife, and then left the military unit to help his family. -I asked myself. I went to the Military Commissariat and asked to volunteer. It was in 2023&#8230; I have family circumstances. A disabled woman of the second group, two minor children&#8230; The garden is very big there, someone had to cultivate it,- the man explains. For his part, the head of the legal support department of the -Revenge- brigade, Justice Major Andriy Bakrev, reminds that, according to the law of Ukraine, for military personnel who went to the SZH, there is an opportunity to resume service until March 1, 2025 and avoid criminal liability. -This opportunity is available to those servicemen who voluntarily left the military unit before November 29, 2024. Those who do not take advantage of the law face imprisonment for 5 to 10 years. Returning to the military unit voluntarily is the best way out of the situation. You will be able to return to the service and avoid criminal liability,- the DPSU notes. As reported by ArmyInform, the Main Directorate of Communications of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said, how to quickly return to service after voluntarily leaving the unit without criminal responsibility.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/05/simejni-obstavyny-vidverti-istoriyi-prykordonnykiv-yaki-dobrovilno-povernulysya-z-szch/	2025-02-05T04:22:18-08:00
Street fights and -bandzai-attacks-: how the battle for Chasiv Yar and Toretsk continues	Dmytro Zaporozhets, the spokesman of OTU -Luhansk-, told about this on the air -Suspilne Novosti-. According to him, most of the fighting in Toretsk currently has the character of street fights. -The fighting is taking place mainly in the central part of the city, as well as in the mining areas,- the spokesman said. He emphasized that the Ukrainian defenders were able to hold their positions thanks to the prepared fortifications, but the number of enemy attacks increased significantly. -Relative to December 2024, the number of assaults in the Toretsk direction increased by 30%, and in the Chasovoy Yar direction - by 97%,- Dmytro Zaporozhets reported. At a time when Ukrainian society expected changes in the international arena, Russian troops, on the contrary, increased the pressure. The situation is similar in the city of Chasiv Yar. The enemy became more active in the north of the city, trying to break into the central part, in particular in the area of ​​the -Avangard- stadium. -The adversary is actively deploying smoke screens and using drones to guide units into relatively unscathed buildings to continue the assault,- the spokesman explained. According to him, it is becoming more and more difficult for the defenders of Ukraine to find suitable positions for effective defense. -Unfortunately, both in Toretsk and in Chasovoy Yar, there are few options for building a stable line of defense. At the same time, the enemy is constantly moving from shelter to shelter, which makes it difficult to destroy him,- the spokesman added. Zaporozhets also drew attention to the change in tactics of the occupiers. If earlier they tried to break through the flanks, now they are forced to carry out frontal attacks. -Both in Toretsk and Chasovoy Yar, the fighting is mainly in the central part of the cities,- he said. In the Seversky direction, the enemy somewhat reduced the activity of assault operations, probably due to the need to regroup. -The enemy is most likely preparing for a new wave of attacks. According to intelligence data, the movement of the command staff of the 3rd Army was recorded in this direction,- Dmytro Zaporozhets reported. Despite the difficult weather conditions, the enemy continues to use maneuvering equipment. -Mud does not stop the enemy. They rarely use armored vehicles, instead they actively use ATVs and motorcycles,- the spokesman said. He also said that the Russian military is carrying out desperate -banzai attacks- using civilian vehicles converted to transport infantry. -We watched how the enemy used cars to break into our positions at high speed. However, thanks to the effective actions of the defenders, one of these vehicles blew up on a mine, and the enemy infantry was forced to hurry, after which part of this infantry was destroyed by FPV drones, and one occupant decided to commit suicide, probably because of the fear of being hit by a UAV,- the spokesman said. As reported by ArmyInform, fierce fighting continues on the front line Chasovo Yar. The Russian occupiers changed the assault tactics in Chasovoy Yar, trying to deliver their stormtroopers to Ukrainian positions as quickly as possible. Now, instead of foot attacks, they mass attack infantry on armored vehicles to reduce movement time.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/05/vulychni-boyi-ta-bandzaj-ataky-yak-tryvaye-bytva-za-chasiv-yar-i-toreczk/	2025-02-05T04:11:25-08:00

A Swedish soldier on Ukrainian soil: the story of a fighter of the International Legion	The story of the soldier was made public on the page of the Land Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. This serviceman is from Sweden. Before the full-scale invasion, he had no military experience, working as a cashier and security guard in a store. However, when the great war began, -Viking- decided that his place was next to the Ukrainian people in the fight against the aggressor. -It was natural for me, since two branches of my family equally dislike Russia because of the war in Spain during the Franco period and because of the war in Finland. I understood the actions of the Russians in Ukraine through my own history,- explains the legionnaire. -Viking- began his combat career as a machine gunner, and later moved to reconnaissance units, where he further honed his skills. He took part in fierce battles in the Kharkiv region and Luhansk region, in particular in the Kupyansk region, in Klishchiivka and Petropavlivka. According to him, he had to meet with various units of the enemy - from the -Wagnerians- to paratroopers and special forces. One of Viking's most vivid memories is the mission during which he was wounded. Then he and two other fighters cleared a difficult landing, being under active fire from FPV drones. The clearing was carried out successfully, but during the advance to the enemy trench they were covered by tank fire. -Viking- received a wound in the left hand, but, fortunately, everything went well. Currently, -Viking- is a specialist in the use of FPV drones. He uses his skills and experience to deliver precise strikes on the enemy and help his comrades on the battlefield. -russia is still here. And as long as she's here, until we win the war or I die, I will fight!- - declares the Swedish warrior. -Viking- is an example of courage, dedication and true patriotism. He is one of those who did not stand aside when war came to Ukrainian land. As ArmiyaInform reported, a machine gunner with the call sign -Yankee- is fighting in the 33rd separate mechanized brigade in the Zaporizhzhia direction. He went through a difficult path from a recruit to an experienced commander who skillfully leads his platoon and destroys the enemy.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/05/shvedskyj-voyin-na-ukrayinskij-zemli-istoriya-bijczya-internaczionalnogo-legionu/	2025-02-05T02:51:54-08:00

The Underrated Helper: Why a Weapon Light is a Vital Item in a Special Ops Gear	This is stated in the publication on page 73 of the special-purpose maritime center named after Kosh chieftain Antin Holovaty. According to the fighter with the call sign -Festival-, their unit uses two types of lights: full-fledged lights and built into sighting units. The latter usually have an infrared (IR) spectrum and are intended for use with night vision devices (NVR). -IR lights are used exclusively with PNB. In conditions of complete darkness, these lights provide active illumination of targets,- notes -Festival-. Important characteristics of the flashlight are its compactness, lightness, compatibility with weapons, resistance to shocks and drops, as well as convenient controls that prevent accidental activation. 73 Center fighters receive weapons with standard Inforce lights that have both visible and IR modes of operation, as well as SureFire sighting units with a laser pointer and a plain white light. -I install the light on the right side because I'm right-handed. A flashlight on the left side would interfere with the grip and worsen weapon control. And when carrying a weapon on a belt, the flashlight does not create discomfort and does not cling to the equipment. I use a remote control button placed on top of the fishing rod, which allows you to conveniently control the light with both the right and left hand,- shares -Festival-. Lanterns are especially useful during urban combat. In Bahmut, they helped assess the state of buildings, look for temporary shelters and positions. -During the evacuation of the groups, the IR flashlight marked positions for the vehicles, which significantly reduced the contact time and made it possible to get to the evacuation point without making a mistake,- says the soldier. Weapon lights are mandatory for special forces, because in a complex with PNB, they give a technological advantage and increase the efficiency of operators. Stormtroopers fighting at close range also need lights to quickly assess the terrain, spot the enemy, and save time. At the same time, for infantry, lanterns are not a primary necessity. Their weapons often do not include a lantern, and fighting takes place in open terrain where a lantern can only unmask a position. As reported by ArmiyaInform, the soldiers of the 73rd Naval Special Purpose Center, who perform extremely difficult tasks, need reliable and effective weapons. The senior operator of the center with the call sign -Den- talked about his choice of an assault rifle and shared the secrets of its care.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/05/nedooczinenyj-pomichnyk-chomu-lihtar-na-zbroyi-zhyttyevo-vazhlyvyj-element-sporyadzhennya-speczpryznachenczya/	2025-02-05T02:28:25-08:00

Defense Assistance and Future Force Strategy: Defense Minister meets NSATU leadership	This is reported by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine on February 5. NSATU is a structure created within NATO to strengthen NATO's role in coordinating international military assistance and training personnel and units of the Defense Forces of Ukraine. During the visit to Ukraine, the NSATU delegation visited a number of military facilities to assess the current needs of the Defense Forces. During the meeting, the parties discussed the key areas of cooperation: training and training of the Ukrainian military in accordance with NATO standards, ensuring the supply of military aid and building the capabilities of the Defense Forces of Ukraine within the framework of the Future Force strategy. -NATO continues to develop cooperation with Ukraine. NSATU's mission is gaining momentum, and it is important that we receive timely and sufficient support. The opening of the NSATU office in Ukraine will contribute to more effective implementation of joint initiatives,- Rustem Umyerov emphasized. The parties also discussed priorities in receiving international military aid and agreed on directions for further joint actions. As reported by ArmyInform, the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Rustem Umyerov and the Head of the NATO Mission in Ukraine Patrick Turner discussed the key issues of cooperation with the Alliance, which remain strategically important for the defense of our state.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/05/oboronna-dopomoga-ta-strategiya-future-force-ministr-oborony-zustrivsya-z-kerivnycztvom-nsatu/	2025-02-05T01:48:22-08:00
A new enemy tactic in the Temporal Ravine: armored stormtroopers go for the kill	Ivan Petrychak, a representative of the 24th separate mechanized brigade named after King Danylo, told about this on the telethon -Yedini Novyny-. According to him, the enemy has somewhat changed its tactics. If earlier the occupiers advanced in small groups, now the Russian command tries to save time and sends assault units directly on armored vehicles. -The enemy wants to save time and throws enemy groups with a large amount of BMD, that is, on armor,- explains Ivan Petrychak. In one of the battles, a Ukrainian tank destroyed a Russian BMD-4 from a distance of only 30 meters. This once again confirms that tanks play a key role in deterring enemy attacks. The enemy also uses mixed tactics: after disembarking from armored vehicles, the Russian infantry disperses, tries to gain a foothold in the basements of buildings and among the ruins, and then regroups for new attacks. In this direction, the presence of the -Akhmat- unit, which is fighting side by side with the 98th airborne division of the Russian Federation, was recorded. However, there are reasons to believe that some of the Kadirov soldiers still perform the functions of blocking units, controlling defectors among the Russian military. -According to our data, they are fighting, but the question is different - how do they motivate the Russian infantry? Captured occupiers say that for refusing to go into battle they can be thrown into a pit, beaten or simply not paid,- Ivan Petrychak notes. Financial payments and the possibility of avoiding criminal punishment remain the main factors that force Russians to fight. Despite heavy losses, the occupiers do not stop their assaults. They operate according to the principle of scorched earth: if they cannot advance with infantry, they destroy everything in front of them with aircraft, artillery and drones. -The enemy destroys possible areas where our soldiers can hold their defense, and then again throws waves of infantry into the attack,- explains the representative of the brigade's press service. The Ukrainian military continues to heroically defend itself, despite the colossal number of attacks. Chasiv Yar is not only a strategic point on the map, but also a symbol of the resilience of our soldiers, who prove every day that the enemy will not be able to win an easy victory. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the 24th separate mechanized brigade named after King Danylo are heroically defending Chasiv Yar, repelling constant attacks of Russian invaders, in particular detachments -Ahmat-. Soldiers hold their positions daily and inflict heavy casualties on the enemy.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/05/nova-taktyka-voroga-v-chasovomu-yaru-shturmovyky-na-broni-jdut-na-zabij/	2025-02-05T01:34:18-08:00
The law enforcement officers detained the suspects in carrying out the terrorist act in Pavlograd	The Prosecutor General's Office informs about this. According to the investigation, a resident of Pavlograd, fulfilling the tasks and instructions of a representative of the special services of the Russian Federation, made an improvised explosive device and left it in a designated place.

Zaporizhia rock and roll: how -Yankee- and his Browning make the occupiers dance	The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. -Yankee- did not immediately get to the front. At first, he applied to the TCC, passed the VLK, but due to the large number of people willing to fight, he had to wait a little. When it was his turn, he joined the 33rd brigade, the machine gun platoon. Prior to that, -Yankee- served under the draft in the State Special Service of Transport, where he had no weapons, but only a shovel and a crowbar. So I was pleasantly surprised by the number of Western weapons in the brigade. He worked his way up from a service number to a unit commander, and after the battles near Robotyny, he became the chief sergeant of a machine gun platoon, acting as a commander. Now he is training recruits for his platoon. The Yankee's signature weapon is the Browning machine gun. He met him while studying at -Desna-. -I liked that he was really knocking. They shot at 900 m and pierced the BMP beautifully. The thing is good, the thing is accurate. The whole platoon fell in love with her,- says -Yankee-. In the Zaporizhzhia direction, when the enemy infantry entered the forest strip, the -Yankee- simply deployed a Browning, put two boxes there - and the enemy retreated with a screech. Five soldiers of his unit were awarded Golden Crosses. -My platoon commander even worked on a dance floor. It was beautiful, it was effective! And no one even wanted to get out of that dance. One occupier's hand was torn off by a bullet. That's all, there was no further movement!- - recalls -Yankee-. Browning pierces the armor of a -one- or -two- with their -grills- at 900-1000 m with an ordinary armor-piercing incendiary bullet. -Nothing compares to a large-caliber machine gun. And the sound, and the speed, and the shooting itself is just a thrill!- - says -Yankee-. Once -Yankee- evacuated his platoon leader with two broken legs from a difficult place by ATV. -Now we communicate every day. The most pleasant thing is when the people you pulled out of positions, brought out, brought out, say hello, -says -Yankee-. As reported by ArmyInform, Sergeant of the Air Force Yevhen Pogozhih knows what a real risk is. In the Kharkiv direction, under heavy fire from the enemy, he carried out a wounded comrade from being hit by an enemy FPV drone, despite mortar fire and a fatal danger	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/05/zaporizkyj-rok-n-rol-yak-yanki-ta-jogo-browning-zmushuyut-okupantiv-tanczyuvaty/	2025-02-05T01:02:18-08:00
-Claster4Defence-: Ukraine joins forces to develop military innovations	The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine informs about this. This event was aimed at establishing cooperation between the Ukrainian military and manufacturers of dual-purpose goods. It was attended by representatives of the Ukrainian army, government, business, international organizations from the EU and NATO, as well as directly by manufacturers of dual-purpose goods in the field of robotics, automation, IT and other key areas. The -Cluster4Defence- initiative is a Ukrainian cluster alliance that includes 40 clusters, among which more than 10 are directly related to the production of dual-purpose technologies. It brings together both large and small enterprises that can freely exchange experience and provide support in building production capacity, substituting the import of complex components from third countries and providing access to new markets. Program coordinator of the Office of Defense Innovation of the European Union in Ukraine, Martin Joesaar, expressed support and readiness for cooperation with the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The office is focused on identifying the necessary directions for helping the Ukrainian military in the field of innovation. The Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Colonel Andriy Lebedenko, thanked Western partners and domestic manufacturers for effective cooperation in the development and production of the latest weapons and emphasized the need to increase joint capabilities in this direction. He shared the successful experience of using already effectively working projects within the Ukrainian army, such as -Army+-, -Iron Range-, -MedEvac- and -On Contact-. These programs help reduce the number of bureaucratic processes within the army and provide Ukrainian servicemen and partners with modern, convenient and transparent access to the necessary services. This event was an important step on the way to developing military innovations in Ukraine and strengthening the country's defense capabilities. As reported by ArmyInform, an international conference -Act in Cryse- was held in Jurmala, Latvia, dedicated to strategic and crisis communications.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/05/claster4defence-ukrayina-obyednuye-zusyllya-dlya-rozvytku-vijskovyh-innovaczij/	2025-02-05T00:54:06-08:00

Defense forces on the Siverskyi direction: every meter is a struggle	Stepan Barna, the commander of the Barni unit of the 10th separate mountain assault brigade -Edelweiss-, told about this on the air of -Suspilne Novosti-. According to him, the Russian troops are striving -from trench to trench- to break through the defense line and gain a foothold in new positions. This is accompanied by almost continuous artillery fire. -Artillery works almost 24 hours a day,- the soldier said. Unlike other areas of the front, where the occupiers try to avoid night attacks, in the Northern Region they fight both during the day and at night. -The enemy is trying to storm around the clock - morning, afternoon, dusk, evening,- Stepan Barna stressed. The Russians focused special attention on the positions of Ukrainian drone operators, trying to suppress their activity with the help of artillery and airdrops. Voiskovy noted that the situation forces our defenders to act flexibly and constantly change positions: -There should be many positions. It is a vital necessity.- Stepan Barna emphasized that the most important task for Ukrainian soldiers now is to -dig, dig, dig-, because well-prepared trenches and dugouts save lives and help withstand the onslaught of the enemy. As for weather conditions, precipitation can make it difficult to use unmanned systems, but currently the situation is favorable: -Now there is minimal precipitation, so the weather helps the operation of our drones.- The military also confirmed that the occupiers have significant reserves and can quickly pull them up: -There were cases when the enemy concentrated a large number of personnel and equipment in a matter of hours, after which the assault immediately began.- Despite the difficult situation, the Ukrainian defenders continue to hold the defense and inflict losses on the enemy. The Seversky direction remains one of the hot spots of the front, where the struggle continues continuously. As reported by ArmyInform, in general during the past day 85 combat encounters.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/05/syly-oborony-na-siverskomu-napryamku-kozhen-metr-cze-borotba/	2025-02-05T00:31:51-08:00
The coalition of states defined the legal basis for the creation of a special tribunal regarding Rus...	This is reported by the President's Office. They also identified the most important elements of the draft Schuman statute, the main legal document that will regulate the tribunal's activities. The Ukrainian delegation at the meeting was headed by the deputy head of the Office of the President Iryna Mudra. -This applies not only to Ukraine. It's about global justice and the message we're sending to the world. That's why we want the special tribunal to be successful, and that's why we ask those who are interested in saving the world order to join us in the cause of justice,- said Iryna Mudra. According to her, the launch of the tribunal will prove that Ukrainians are serious about ensuring peace and international law, that the perpetrators of the crime of aggression will be punished, and justice will be restored. Once operational, the tribunal will have the power to prosecute Russian political and military leaders who bear the ultimate responsibility for the crime of aggression. -When Russia decided to violate the borders of Ukraine, disregarding the UN Charter, it committed one of the most serious international crimes - the crime of aggression. Now justice is coming. Justice for Ukraine. We have laid the legal foundations for the creation of a special tribunal,- said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. The Secretary General of the Council of Europe, Alain Berse, called the results of today's meeting progress, which will also be felt by the next generations of Ukrainians. -Creating a special tribunal on the crime of aggression against Ukraine within the Council of Europe will enable our international partners, in particular Ukraine and the European Union, to fully use our experience and knowledge in the protection of human rights and the rule of law around the world,- Alain Berse added.

Ministry of Defense: robotic units are being deployed in combat brigades of the Armed Forces	reported this by the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Rustem Umyerov. Ukraine is increasing the production of these systems and deploying full-fledged robotic units as part of the combat brigades of the Armed Forces on the front line. This project is based on the experience of tests that have taken place since the summer of 2024 in cooperation with military personnel. Unmanned ground systems have proven their ability to perform a number of combat tasks: -For the creation of robotic units, the experience of brigades that use such systems on the battlefield is taken into account,- Rustem Umyerov noted. It is extremely important that the main suppliers of ground robotic complexes are leading domestic companies. Ukrainian manufacturers have adapted their products to the conditions of modern warfare and the recommendations of combat units of the Defense Forces. -We continue to transform the Armed Forces of Ukraine into a modern army that has a technological advantage over the enemy. Our goal is to create an army where innovative technologies help perform the most dangerous tasks, saving the lives of our defenders,- the Minister of Defense of Ukraine emphasized.

One dead to two wounded: Volodymyr Zelenskyi named the losses of the Russian army in Ukraine	President Volodymyr Zelenskyi said this in an interview with journalist Piers Morgan. -These are approximate numbers. The casualty ratio is one dead to two wounded because their field medicine is weaker. They often leave their wounded soldiers on the battlefield,- Volodymyr Zelenskyi said. The head of state added that despite these losses, Russia is not ready to end this war. -They don't want peace. Next time, they will say that they are ready for direct negotiations with President Trump. They will say that Ukraine is not needed, that it is a global war between Russia and NATO, and that they will negotiate only with the USA. But this is just another reason to continue the war. Putin's only goal is for Ukraine to cease to exist,- Volodymyr Zelenskyi said. As reported by ArmiyaInform, in January 2024 the -I want to find- project, created by the Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War, recorded a record number of appeals from families of Russian servicemen who went missing in Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/05/odyn-zagyblyj-do-dvoh-poranenyh-volodymyr-zelenskyj-nazvav-vtraty-rosijskoyi-armiyi-v-ukrayini/	2025-02-04T23:34:21-08:00
Novopavlovsk direction: the Russians storm - on buggies - but finish in black bags	Lieutenant Colonel Vitaly Milovidov, head of the information and communication service of the 15th brigade of the Kara-Dag NSU, told about this on the Suspilny broadcast. — In the area of ​​responsibility of the units, the night passed relatively stably, as the enemy makes fewer assault attempts in the dark, he noted. - However, the attacks have continued since the morning, accompanied by intense artillery fire. According to him, the enemy's tactics remain unchanged: he continues to use small assault groups, trying to compensate for losses with a large number of personnel. -On the main lines of attack, the enemy has pulled up additional reserves that ensure the advance of these groups,- the military officer explained. — Despite the loss, the occupiers continue their offensive, because the constant replenishment of manpower allows them to maintain the pace of attacks. The situation in the area of ​​Dachny remains extremely tense. According to the representative of the National Guard, in addition to infantry attacks, the enemy is actively using airstrikes, guided bombs and artillery. -The enemy uses the entire range of reconnaissance drones, trying to inflict maximum losses on our positions and equipment,- Milovidov emphasized. An increase in enemy activity near the Zaporozhye-Kurakhove highway is also recorded. According to the Ukrainian military, Russian forces are making maximum efforts to cut off key logistical supply routes. -The enemy wants to make it impossible to provide quality support to our units defending in this area,- Milovidov explained. Ukrainian defenders inflict significant losses on the enemy's manpower every day. -On average, the enemy loses up to a platoon of personnel every day, and sometimes more,- said a representative of the National Guard. As for armored vehicles, their use in the direction is limited. -The enemy rarely uses heavy equipment, but periodically uses buggies and motorcycles to quickly transfer infantry groups to forward positions,- Milovidov noted. Despite the constant replenishment of reserves, the logistics of the occupiers are not perfect. Ukrainian forces are actively working behind enemy lines, striking with long-range weapons and aviation. -The counter-battery fight is being conducted at a high level, and our forces are doing everything to slow down the enemy's replenishment and logistical support,- the military officer emphasized. The so-called drone war is also actively underway. — The enemy uses all possible drones: from the Orlan and Zala reconnaissance complexes to strike drones and fiber-optic drones, which are difficult to disable by means of radio-electronic warfare, Milovidov noted. Worsening weather conditions also affect the course of hostilities. — Bad weather does not exist for the enemy. Even in difficult conditions, they continue assault operations, especially using infantry groups, the military said. At the same time, the decrease in temperature may make it difficult to use heavy armored vehicles, which will additionally affect the tactics of the Russian troops. The Defense Forces of Ukraine continue to hold the defense and inflict significant losses on the enemy, preventing him from achieving his goals. As reported by ArmyInform, the Defense Forces repelled two enemy attacks in the Novopavlovsk direction. The occupiers tried to advance near Rozlyv and Zelenivka.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/05/novopavlivskyj-napryamok-rosiyany-shturmuyut-na-bagi-ale-finishuyut-u-chornyh-paketah/	2025-02-04T23:27:07-08:00

KABs overhead, queues at the pharmacy and four hours to live: ArmiyaInform report from front-line Ko...	What kind of destruction the city suffered, how its inhabitants live in the conditions of approaching the contact line, and why Kostyantynivka is so important for the enemy, further in the material. Every day, the Russian aviation attacks the city with aerial bombs, with artillery strikes, the Rashists destroy high-rise buildings, private houses, social institutions, educational institutions, industrial enterprises and objects of critical infrastructure. Enemy reconnaissance UAVs are in the air and are adjusting fire. The contact line came closer to the city by less than 10 km, and to the ridges about 6-7 kilometers. This is if you take the distance from the Temporal Ravine, in which heavy battles are going on. Some villages and settlements of the Kostyantyniv community, which are located along the front line in the direction of Toretsk, have been completely destroyed, others are subject to unprecedented shelling and destruction. About 17,000 people remain in Kostyantynivka, and more than 1,000 residents live in the villages of the community. By the way, almost 80 thousand people lived in the city before the invasion. The closer we get to Kostyantynivka, the fewer civilian cars there are, mostly military pickups on the road. The central road, which runs alongside the railway, actually divides the city into two parts. The industrial part is on the plain, to the left, if you are moving from Druzhkivka, on the heights are private sector houses and multi-apartment buildings, to the right - behind the industrial facilities, on the hill is another part of the residential sector of the city. So, this part of the city, which is closer to Chasovoy Yar, suffered the most destruction. All around destroyed houses, shops, gutted educational institutions and kindergartens, glass from broken windows everywhere, destroyed production facilities and workshops of industrial facilities. Once upon a time, before the Great War, many enterprises worked successfully in Kostyantynivka, among them, for example, a bakery, a milk factory, and a glass factory. Now they lie in ruins. We approach the former building of the Kostyantynivska City Council. In front of it, you can see the explosions from the Russian anti-tank missiles, the building is ransacked, like everything around in this area. Nearby is a shattered school. The least number of people live in this part of the city, but single silhouettes of residents can still be seen on the city streets. Lyudmila Mykolaivna lived in Kostyantynivka all her life, a pensioner. -It's very scary, especially when the weather is sunny, then the Russians hit the city much more. I still have water, gas and electricity in my house. There are problems with the light, power grids are destroyed, they are fixed, of course. Interruptions with heating. My friends are already living without electricity, water and gas. But it is good that relatives are moving to Dnipropetrovsk region. -Many people still have stoves in their homes, so they heat and cook with them,- the woman says. Almost a year ago, the Russians hit the S-300 on Kostyantynivka and destroyed the railway station. In addition, a temple, private and apartment buildings, shops, market pavilions, three educational institutions, administrative buildings and a post office were also destroyed in this area. Now there are some shops and even open pavilions with products, there are vegetables, fruits, meat, eggs, fish and dairy products. Agricultural goods are sold. In other areas of the city, there are also small shops where you can buy products. All the big supermarkets have already been destroyed by roaches. There are several points of dispensing free drinking water in the city. People come on bicycles, with wheelbarrows and -pushchairs- to conveniently carry bottles of water. Bread is brought, as in other settlements of the community. Pharmacies work, most of the necessary medical drugs are there, so people, for example, with cardiovascular diseases, are provided with pills. Ukrposhta branches, polyclinics, even queues at ATMs for cash are open. There is a minibus that runs around the city once an hour and takes residents to different districts of Kostyantynivka. The Kostyantynivska community has a strict curfew: it lasts 20 hours a day — from 3:00 p.m. to 11:00 a.m. the next day. That is, only at this time residents can be on the street and actually have four hours for everything: to buy groceries, collect drinking water, go to the pharmacy, and so on. But just to breathe fresh air. When the electricity goes out in the city after shelling the occupiers, generators are turned on in shops and pharmacies. Even if the city is shelled, residents still go shopping, they say they are used to it. -Of course it's scary. But we have nowhere to go, there are many single people, they need to at least buy bread. For example, my relatives moved to Odeshchyna, I am here alone, I have to take care of myself. They call to me, I will finish my business here and go,- says Anastasia, a resident of the city. There are -points of unbreakability- in Kostyantynivka, volunteers bring hot food, distribute -humanitarian food-, plus you can get warm clothes here. -Everything you need for life in the city is there. We pray to God and ask him to give strength to the Ukrainian army to stop the Russian occupiers, - adds a grandfather and grandmother walking along the sidewalk, - we have lived here all our lives, where should we go, we have a home here, two pensions are still enough and we don't need much. There is food and water, the TV is working. And it will be spring soon, and it will be warm there, the smell of flowers and the trees will turn green. Let's go further. There is a queue at the pharmacy, people complain that there is not enough time to live. -Four hours to solve all current issues is very little. It's good that the hospital is still open, so help is available. There are qualified doctors, but we don't know what will happen tomorrow or the day after tomorrow,- residents say. In the conditions of war, city utility workers do everything possible to improve the lives of residents. Sometimes they even work under enemy fire. Utility workers are trying to eliminate the consequences of shelling and destruction as soon as possible. Serhiy Gorbunov, the head of the Kostyantyniv city military administration, said that the city still has gas, electricity and partially water supply. -There is no water supply in some areas of the city, because the enemy destroyed one of the water mains, we are delivering water. After each shelling, the entire infrastructure is destroyed, we try to restore everything immediately. We provide people after shelling with construction materials for the preservation of residential premises and civil infrastructure. Volunteers help a lot,- said Serhiy Gorbunov. The center for providing administrative services of the Kostyantynivska hromada works in the mode of recording people's statements regarding destruction, surveys and entries in the registers of information about damaged and destroyed property. It is good that all the children were taken out of the city to a safe place. Schools, of course, are not functioning, schoolchildren study remotely. Entrepreneurs and owners of small shops are reluctant to communicate, do not want to be photographed. For the most part, their business is on the verge of closing, there is no revenue, so they work on their own enthusiasm. They say that while people are still in the city, they will be open to residents. The city remains one of the potential targets for the aggressor, in particular because of its railway hub. Rail logistics make it much easier for the occupiers to deliver troops and ammunition. Moreover, the probable occupation of Kostyantynivka will open the way for a further attack on the large Kramatorsk-Druzhkiv agglomeration. Kremlin seeks to achieve its goal of full occupation of Donetsk region. But the Defense Forces of Ukraine destroy the occupiers on the contact line and prevent them from advancing. The enemy is suffering losses, almost every piece of Ukrainian land on the front line is littered with corpses of Russian invaders. &#8230;When ArmiyaInform journalists were working in Kostyantynivka, the enemy attacked the city with barrel artillery and anti-aircraft guns. As a result of the strikes, private houses, a gas pipeline line, the electricity network and cars of residents were damaged. Recently, the enemy has been striking the city with the use of attack UAVs. Every day, the local city military administration calls for the need to evacuate the civilian population to safer regions of Ukraine! Take care, evacuate in time! For questions about evacuation, please call: 050 567 88 87, 093 420 18 83.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/05/kaby-nad-golovoyu-chergy-v-apteku-ta-chotyry-godyny-dlya-zhyttya-reportazh-armiyainform-z-pryfrontovoyi-kostyantynivky/	2025-02-04T20:51:01-08:00
500 bullets at the enemy with one -shot-: a mine-explosive master class from -Bach-	- The call sign appeared very simply - they came up with the guys when they started in the sapper company. How do callsigns appear? If you don't come up with something yourself, then something will be stuck on you and that something may not be the best. That's why they came up with something related to the sabotage business, detonations, - explains the soldier with a smile. -Bach- comes from the town of Hlyboka in the Chernivtsi region. The future sapper volunteered for the army in the first days of the large-scale invasion. Together with their cousin, they rushed into battle, although they did not have any military experience or long-term service in the Armed Forces. -I came with my cousin. Before the war, we went to the same job and were abroad for almost four years together. On the third day, it was my brother's birthday and I came to his room in the morning and said: -Well, -Boy- - he had a call sign even before the war - I kind of thought I'd go.- And he says that he also made up his mind, and we are a military commissar together,- recalls Nikita. Training at the Yavoriv training ground in Starychy, in contrast to the modern one-and-a-half-month BZVP, was less long, but every extra day in the -textbook- was perceived by the fighters as little more than a punishment, because they wanted to get to the front as soon as possible. -We imagined that the training would be like in the American movies - an obstacle course in the swamp, survival in the forest, urban battles&#8230; In fact, it was not so little, but we were very afraid that we would not make it to the war, we were very excited. We were preparing for VOS 100 as infantry and we hoped that we would be like Rambo in the trenches putting out fuckers - just like in the best blockbusters,- says -Bach-. During the formation of the brigade in Zolotonosh, Nikita and his brother were enrolled in the sapper company, but -Bach- began to fully master the mine and explosive business under the guidance of more experienced colleagues already during the hostilities in the Donetsk region. The fighter got there at the beginning of April 2022. He fought in the Severodonetsk region near Voivodeship. -Our first combat sorties were tough. It's hard for a person from a -citizen- when you don't distinguish between -exits- and -arrivals- - it seems that everything is flying around you. At first, we marched like a company of sappers, because we had to kill the whole -squad-, but in fact we were infantry. Only in the time free from fighting, sappers and contractors came to us, told us, showed us what to do, gave us some kind of basic course,- says the fighter. He gratefully remembers his comrades hardened in combat operations during the ATO/OOS, because they could give useful advice, prompt and show what and how to do. After all, a confident military man, every infantryman must master the elementary things of working with an explosive device. -Each infantryman should at least be able to set an anti-personnel mine. Of course, anyone is afraid to touch a mine, but in fact it is as safe as possible if you handle it competently and carefully,- says -Bach-. What's more, the sapper emphasizes, competently installed mine barriers not only do not pose a danger to their own infantry, but also save their lives. -The modern tasks of sappers are to install mine-explosive barriers. For example, infantry is entrenched and sits on observation posts, that is, it holds some area of ​​responsibility. We are moving forward, setting mines of the MON type in a controlled manner. This is how we -sewing up- our own infantry, so that the enemy cannot approach our positions without losses,- explains the sapper. Even the smallest of the MON-50 anti-personnel mines can stop the advance of a large group of the enemy, because its explosion provides a directed explosion and the impact of half a thousand pieces of debris in a certain sector. -You just press one button and 500 bullets will fly in one sector. We are laying mines along the front to occupy the entire area. Then instead of shooting 20 stores, you can press one button. You see, there's a group coming. Click and the group lay down. The first two of the group fall automatically, because you have already sifted through them. And others will not crawl further, because some of them are -300-, and others are frightened and must evacuate the wounded. Although they met in the Kupyansk direction of -storm-zet-, they simply have no choice to go back there - only forward, because behind them are -blockades-, explains -Bach-. -I personally did not participate in the offensives, but we cleared paths, worked with SSO groups, with the DRG, with intelligence colleagues who were preparing for offensive actions,- the military man says about the role of sappers in preparing for offensive actions. The so-called -gray zone- between the positions is very densely mined both by us and by the enemy, so before the fighters can start an assault, sappers must both remove their own mine barriers and clear the way to the enemy's positions from enemy mines as much as possible. -In order for the group to pass covertly without losses, we climb out first and clear all the mines. If there is an opportunity, we use mine detectors. If there is none, then simply by crawling, with feelers. First, we made a corridor in our barricades, crawled, made as much as possible to the enemy's positions - and then the group can enter through a safe corridor,- says the sapper. A path for armored vehicles is also cleared in a similar way, but mechanized means such as demining units can be used there. They make it possible to lay passages about 4 meters wide in enemy minefields, which is enough for the movement of a tank. The sapper emphasizes that an infantryman must be able not only to detect, but also to set mines. The damage that can be inflicted on the enemy by laying mines of directed action can in many cases be fatal for him. This is how you can destroy and stop entire groups of Russian infantrymen: -As practice shows, people are taught how to handle weapons, shooting, tactics, and tactical equipment at the BZVP. For engineering training in general, there may be only 1‒2 hours for the entire course. But in today's realities, the infantry must be able to lay mines. Now there are many mines of the American model of the M18A1 Claymore type. In our military, it is considered engineer ammunition, and in the US army, it is infantry ammunition. It goes just like a one-shot RPG, just like grenades. The same goes for -Claymore- - a small handbag, an anti-personnel mine and a net with a ready-made detonator. You may not have a sapper with you in the trench every second who can supply you. But there may be several claymore mines. Then he climbed out carefully, put it down. I have acquaintances from the assault brigades, and they tell me that there were cases when our guys held the defense with the help of such mines and repelled several assaults. The assault group simply goes, they put a mine behind the parapet, click - and the group lay down. Stopped smoking, recharged. You see the group again - the mine was placed, click. And whoever remained alive was shot. That is, in skillful hands, you can do serious things.- Since August 2024, -Bach- has served in the 115th separate mechanized brigade as an instructor in mine and explosive training. He teaches newly arrived infantrymen not to be afraid of mines, demining explosive objects and setting mines in combat conditions. -We let you feel every live mine, every detonator, every -fly-, every detonator. We explain and show how to blow up, what are the blasting machines and so on. Everyone felt everything, made several attempts to install it. Of course, without detonation, but the fighters get basic experience and will be able to use it in combat conditions,- says the sapper. During his service as a mine and explosives instructor, he and his brother with the call sign -Monk- have already trained several hundred fighters. -Bach- is sure that thorough comprehensive training of Ukrainian soldiers is one of the key keys to victory. After all, it is not enough to be motivated and have the necessary weapons - you should be able to use them skillfully. Therefore, the service of the instructor is an important contribution to the victory over the enemy.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/05/500-kul-u-voroga-odnym-postrilom-minno-vybuhovyj-majster-klas-vid-baha/	2025-02-04T20:38:52-08:00
Term service in Chechnya, or rape by Buryats: how they force Ukrainians on the TOT to sign a contrac...	Mobilization processes in the occupied Ukrainian territories are already ongoing. For example, conscription is already being held there. As the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine reported at the beginning of January, from October 1 to December 31, 2024, in the temporarily occupied territories of the Zaporizhia and Kherson regions, the aggressor state Russia mobilized about three hundred people. -The occupation administrations intensified pressure with the aim of increasing the volume of conscription in the enslaved communities of the Kherson region and the Zaporizhia region - they require all men under the age of 60 to register for the so-called -military registration-. Those who try to avoid participating in the war against Ukraine are threatened, in particular, with the deprivation of earnings and means of livelihood,- said the message of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications. Also, in the occupied territories, they are actively working with the population to sign a contract for service. According to the data published by the Center of National Resistance, for almost 10 months in 2024, about 10,000 of Ukrainians living in the temporarily occupied territories became servicemen of the Russian army. And in general, according to the Russian plan, at least 150,000 recruits should be added to the ranks of the occupation forces. Among them, a significant share falls on temporarily occupied Donetsk region, Luhansk region, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson region and annexed Crimea. Intensification of mobilization in the occupied territories began in 2024. In particular, in the fourth quarter, for the first time with the start of the conscription campaign, military commissars in the occupied territories received strict mobilization tasks, says Petro Andryushchenko, head of the Center for the Study of the Occupation. These tasks were transferred to the occupation authorities, so that they would send the workers of communal enterprises to the military commissariats. And then they tried to force these people to sign a contract for service in the Russian army. For example, such cases were first recorded in the Mariupol district, and later spread to the Melitopol and Berdyan districts. -The conscription campaign began in October. Military commissars went around the villages, collecting boys under the age of 23. They were brought to the Military Commissariat and the blackmail began. They threatened that they would now be conscripted and sent to Chechnya or to the Buryats. And there they will be raped and the like. And such threats worked. Some guys signed a contract. We know about 15 such facts in the Mariupol district alone,- says Petro Andryushchenko. Also, the occupiers constantly -process- those who were called up for long-term service. They try to -motivate- to sign the contract in different ways. -They were also locked up in military commissariats and forced to sign a contract. They said that they would not be sent to the front. They will be cooks, drivers. They offered 800,000 rubles for signing a contract and from 200,000 rubles a month. These are smaller amounts than offered in the regions of Russia. But this is a lot of money for the occupied territories. They are also -pressing- even in the military units themselves. For them to sign contracts. And it worked too. Because we have data on prisoners from the same Mariupol district. That is, as soon as someone signed a contract, he almost immediately found himself at the front. And if they were lucky, they were captured,- says Petro Andryushchenko. By the way, the treatment of conscripts from the temporarily occupied territories in the Russian army is a separate story, which we have already discussed they wrote. According to Petro Andryushchenko, the situation will only worsen in the near future. The spring draft is approaching, which will have even more aggressive plans for mobilization. In addition, the occupiers have a need to increase the number of mobilized. -Why do I come to this conclusion? On average, the occupiers gather 30-35 thousand people for the army. And they lose from 40 to 45 thousand every month. There is also a clear drop in the number of people willing to sign a contract on the territory of Russia. Therefore, it is unlikely that they will be able to significantly increase this mobilization under such conditions. And this means that coercive measures must be included. And where to do it? In past years, they did it at the expense of their marginals, convicts and migrants. Society approved it. Now this can be done at the expense of occupied territories. -Busification- in conditional Berdyansk or Mariupol will be perceived normally by the same Muscovites. Like, you wanted to join Russia, so go now and fight,- says Petro Andryushchenko. Meanwhile, everything is ready for this in the occupied territories. Military registration is available, the data has been updated. Locking people in the occupied territories is easy. -Block exits to Crimea and the territory of the Donetsk region, and that's it - mobilize as much as you want. And it will happen sooner or later. The Russians have everything ready there. And they are able to collect the necessary number of people by coercive measures,- believes Petro Andryushchenko. In 2022, several tens of thousands of Ukrainians joined the ranks of the Russian-controlled LNR and DNR groups. Forced mobilization there began about a week before the full-scale invasion began. Usually it happened like this - orders came from the military commissariat to the enterprises that the men should appear at a certain time, like for -retraining-. And there they immediately issued weapons, uniforms and sent to the units. And then these very people went to storm Ukrainian positions in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions, they were transferred for the so-called -consolidation- and maintenance of territories captured by the Russians in the Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhya, and Kherson regions. It was the residents of Luhansk region and Donetsk region that were captured by Ukrainians in large numbers. For example, near Mayorsk, the Ukrainian military managed to capture 10 mobilized men from the occupied Horlivka. All of them worked in educational institutions. And all of them were forcibly mobilized and thrown into battle without preparation. Interviews with some of them was once published by journalist Volodymyr Zolkin. Aggressive forced mobilization in the occupied territories continued throughout 2022. People were taken away not only from enterprises, but also raids were arranged through the streets of occupied settlements. Many people got into the occupation army simply by going out into the street for some need. The SBU wrote about one of these stories. Here are literally two quotes from the interrogation of this prisoner, which demonstrate how mobilization in the occupied territories took place at that time: -I went to the store to buy food, they packed me right on the street and brought me to some building. Then they loaded it into a dump truck and took it with the others further.- -They told us to fight. But when the shelling began, I climbed into the tank with the others and hid. They don't shoot because they don't even know how to shoot.- And there were a lot of such stories in 2022. It is not worth counting that nothing like this will happen again. The only guaranteed possibility of not getting into the ranks of the occupying army is to defend ourselves and not allow the enemy to occupy our country. By the way, the mobilization of the adult population in the occupied Ukrainian territories is only part of Russia's plan to replenish its mobilization resources.

Aiming at nuclear deterrence: France develops new hypersonic missile to reach Mach 7	As informs the specialized defense portal Zone Militaire, this project, implemented by MBDA France with the support of the ONERA aerospace research center, is aimed at creating a weapons system that will provide the country with the ability to withstand challenges from Russia and China, ArmyInform reports. The special feature of the ASN4G is its combination of hypersonic speed, stealth and long range, making it an unrivaled deterrent tool. In turn, the experts of the Army Recognition site detailed the plans of the French gunsmiths. This product should replace the existing medium-range missile ASMPA and will be compatible with Rafale F5 fighters. The claimed range of ASN4G is 1K. km, and the speed will reach 8.6 thousand km. km/h ASN4G is expected to reach speeds of Mach 6 to Mach 7, far exceeding ASMPA's capabilities. This speed, combined with improved maneuverability, will allow the missile to avoid radar detection and interception by modern air defense systems. The range of the ASN4G is claimed to be twice that of the ASMPA and will provide greater operational flexibility. The missile will also have stealth characteristics achieved through the use of specialized materials that reduce radar visibility and withstand extreme aerodynamic and thermal conditions during flight. The ASN4G engine is based on a supersonic jet engine developed under the PROMETHEE program. This propulsion system uses mixed combustion technology to transition between subsonic, supersonic, and hypersonic speeds, ensuring the rocket's ability to maintain high speeds over long distances. The inclined X-shaped tail (aerodynamic rudders) with -camber- angles of about 120 degrees, as well as the -zigzag- edge of the tail part of the ASN4G airframe should maximally reduce the EOP of the missile when irradiated by the enemy's ground and air-based radar from the rear hemisphere. At the same time, the area of ​​aerodynamic rudders is very significant, which indicates the possibility of performing anti-aircraft maneuvers of medium intensity even in the upper layers of the stratosphere (35-38 km). The architecture of the ASN4G on-board radio electronic equipment, including the guidance system, attracted considerable interest from experts. Based on the sketch, there is (in addition to the inertial navigation system and radio altimeters) a wide range of radio reconnaissance sensors for the detection of radiation sources and their identification, with further comparison with templates from a preloaded database. This is evidenced by the presence of large radio-transparent panels on the sides of the fuselage that form the nose. Passive antennas of the radiation warning station can also be placed behind them to alert the BCOM (Board Digital Computing Machine, - ed) of the missile about -capture- by illumination and guidance radars of the air defense system, or active search engines of anti-aircraft missiles and missiles of the -air-to-air- class. The development and use of the ASN4G sketch variant for France will mean the appearance in its armed forces of not a conventional 4th-generation multi-purpose hypersonic missile with nuclear -equipment-, but a multifunctional strike-reconnaissance hypersonic platform. The missile's compact design ensures compatibility with existing platforms, including the Rafale F5 fighter and future systems such as the Future Combat Air System's Next Generation Fighter (NGF) (FCAS). Development of ASN4G began in the 1990s at the same time as the modernization of ASMPA. In 2014, the French Ministry of the Armed Forces approved the program, with initial research focusing on two key approaches: stealth and hyperspeed. The choice in favor of hypersonic speed was based on its effectiveness in overcoming increasingly sophisticated restriction and denial of access and maneuvering systems (A2/AD). ASN4G is part of France's broader strategy to modernize its nuclear deterrent capabilities. It will be integrated with the Rafale F5 fighter and compatible with future platforms. Its deployment will strengthen the airborne component of France's nuclear deterrent, which is operated by the Strategic Air Force (FAS) and the Naval Nuclear Air Force (FANu). The missile's ability to perform complex maneuvers at hypersonic speeds ensures its effectiveness against modern missile defense systems. In parallel, related efforts include ArianeGroup's development of the V-MAX hypersonic glider, which complements the ASN4G program objectives. ASN4G is expected to be operational by 2035, and its service life will last beyond 2050. Its development is a continuation of France's commitment to maintaining an independent and reliable nuclear deterrent. With the integration of a hypersonic engine, improved stealth and increased range, the missile is designed to ensure the effectiveness of France's deterrent position in an increasingly contested security environment.

Russia made up -a discharged veteran of the Armed Forces of Ukraine- from -Cirque du Soleil-: analys...	The fake spread quickly through pro-Russian Telegram channels and, as it usually happens, crumbled at the first verified fact. According to the version of Russian agitators, the unknown -Ukrainian fighter- decided to become a circus performer after serving in the Armed Forces. His talent impressed everyone, but then the administration allegedly found out that he was -ex-military- and immediately got rid of him, citing some -political reasons-. Some versions of this fake even contained unique -details- - it was said that circus artists were afraid to work next to him because -he was too good with a knife- and -reacted too quickly to sudden movements.- It sounds like a script for an unsuccessful drama on a second-rate propaganda channel, but in fact it is another clichéd product of a factory of fakes aimed at discrediting Ukrainians in the world. Russian fakers are constantly working to create the impression that Ukrainians are becoming -dangerous to the world- because of the war. Their goal is to sow fear and mistrust, portray the Ukrainian military as aggressive, unbalanced, or even unadapted to normal life. This is part of their information war, which has little to do with reality. -Cirque du Soleil- does exist, but -discharged veteran- does not. The only thing that can be confirmed for sure is that real clowns are sitting in the Kremlin. And if someone really lost their job, it is the Russian propagandists, who can no longer make even their fakes convincing.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/05/rosiya-vygadala-zvilnenogo-veterana-zsu-z-czyrk-dyu-solej-rozbir-novogo-fejku/	2025-02-04T20:04:38-08:00

Russian agents were preparing a terrorist attack against the police in Bukovina	The Security Service of Ukraine reported this on Tuesday, February 4. According to the investigation, two attackers were preparing to blow up a police team in the Vyzhnytskyi district, which was supposed to arrive after a fake call to 102. -To commit a terrorist attack, the perpetrators planted an improvised explosive device (IED) in an abandoned farm building, equipped with self-tapping screws for maximum damage. The explosive device was hidden in a garbage bag, and nearby in a juice box was a mobile phone that filmed the entrance to the building. Using remote access to the gadget, the occupiers planned to activate the SVP when the police entered the building. By this time, the agents should have gone into hiding,- the message reads. They received all relevant instructions from their Russian curator through social networks. The operatives of the special service detained the suspects, who turned out to be local drug dealers aged 17 and 18, after they planted explosives and returned to their apartments. Both defendants were notified of suspicion under the articles of the Criminal Code of Ukraine: Detainees face up to 12 years in prison with confiscation of property. As reported by ArmyInform, the SBU detained a saboteur in Rivne , who was preparing a terrorist attack on the railway.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/04/agenty-rf-gotuvaly-terakt-proty-policziyi-na-bukovyni/	2025-02-04T11:15:31-08:00
Skirmishes in the Pokrovsky direction have decreased, the enemy is looking for detours and maneuveri...	This was reported by the deputy commander for psychological support of the 155th of the separate mechanized brigade named after Anna of Kyiv, major Ivan Surov. -The intensity has indeed decreased a bit, but the general tactics have remained the same. That is, they try to advance in small infantry groups under the cover of artillery. And yes, indeed, the last day or two, the intensity of hostilities has decreased a little,- confirmed the soldier. He also added that currently the enemy is trying to move mainly during the day. -The Russian troops currently have a shortage of night optics, and our drones, known as -Baba Yaga- or -Vampire- — are active at night — heavy bombers. Since they are easy to see during the day because of their large size, they work mainly at night,- explained the representative of the 155th OMBr. In turn, the commander of the 59th separate assault brigade named after Yakov Handziuk of the Forces of Unmanned Systems with the call sign -Bird- notes that, despite the huge losses, the Russian invaders do not stop, but try not to enter into a head-on collision with Ukrainian units, but to bypass them. -The enemy uses different tactics, tries to carry out assault actions in different ways. On armored vehicles, on lightly armored vehicles or, in general, with ordinary vehicles that they have available, such as buggies. Tries to use different tactics. Tries from one side - the brigade fights back decently - tries from the other. Maneuvering,'' said the combatant of the 59th OShBr. As reported by ArmyInform, The defense forces defeated a convoy of Russian Federation in the Pokrovsky direction.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/04/manevruye-boyezitknen-na-pokrovskomu-napryamku-stalo-menshe-vorog-shukaye-obhidni-shlyahy/	2025-02-04T11:07:18-08:00

According to Borodin, the entire system of commanding the enemy's troops is built on -unlimited- manpower. Everyone is thrown into the attacks - some debtors, some convicts, some mobilized go into the attack. They cook for one or two weeks. -Their system is built on losses. They perfectly understand the shortcomings of this system, it is adapted to these shortcomings. The latest trend is that they don't even say to storm a target. They say we must go and take positions, that is, their positions. Near the pine tree. And these are our positions,- Oleksandr Borodin said. As reported by ArmyInform, on In the direction of Pokrovsky, the enemy tried to break through the Ukrainian defenses, throwing into battle a tank, two BMPs with infantry, but thanks to the coordinated work of our warriors, this offensive turned into their defeat.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/04/u-nyh-systema-pobudovana-na-vtratah-rosijskyh-shturmovykiv-na-kupyanshhyni-vidpravlyayut-pomyraty-vtemnu/	2025-02-04T10:44:54-08:00

-Training is the key to success-: Marine -Mickey- on preparing for battle	The story of the fighter was made public on the page of the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. -Mickey- together with his family had to stay in occupation for several months. When they were lucky and were able to go to the territory controlled by the Ukrainian troops, the boy immediately went to the territorial center of recruitment and social support to join the ranks of the Defense Forces of Ukraine. -There was absolutely no thought that I could do it differently. I swore an oath to the Ukrainian people, served a term of service. Besides, I have seen plenty of how the occupiers behave on our land,- the young scout shares his thoughts. At TCC -Mickey- he was immediately offered to join the then 124th separate territorial defense brigade. First, he got into the car company, and then continued to serve in other logistics units. However, from the first days, the fighter dreamed of serving in intelligence. -Intelligence is a very interesting place of service, here a lot depends on ingenuity, ingenuity, non-standard approaches to tasks. You are constantly on the move and forced to improve,- the warrior notes. A junior sergeant's unit and really special. Marine scouts perform complex and very important tasks. They often operate independently, without the support of adjacent units, on the front lines and behind enemy lines. Reconnaissance is not simply about observing the positions of the occupiers. Scouts pave a safe way for infantry to positions, scout for mine-explosive barriers of the enemy, analyze changes in the general situation in the area of ​​their responsibility, and, of course, are directly engaged in the destruction of manpower and equipment of the Rashists. -During combat missions, mostly everything depends on you. How did you prepare, how was the task plan drawn up, what factors were taken into account, what equipment was selected based on the specifics of the task. We pay a lot of attention to personnel training, especially to young recruits. I train them myself, constantly, every day, unless we are on a combat mission. If a fighter successfully completes a training task, well, well done. If not, let's train further,- the young commander smiles broadly. There is a place for both dreams and hopes in war. And it should be so because it gives strength to continue our struggle for our country, the liberation of its territories and our people, who are waiting for us in the Ukrainian lands occupied by the Russian invaders. Despite the difficult years spent in the war, -Mickey- does not lose optimism. He dreams of returning with his mother to his native village and planting a vegetable garden again. And he definitely wants to visit Henichesk and ride the water slides there. The man is convinced that this will definitely happen.

NRK Gimli is a universal unmanned platform designed to perform a wide range of tasks in the complex conditions of high-intensity combat operations.

For a middle finger in the direction of the Armed Forces - 6 years in prison: the Poltava TCC hopes ...	This is the same man from Poltava who the year before last spat at a veteran, provoked a conflict with military personnel of the Poltava TCC and SP, and later posted a video on his Instagram showing the middle finger to the Ukrainian military. Someone will say that almost two years have passed, everyone has already forgotten about this character, and the Ukrainian court has only now made a decision. Yes, the millstones of the legal process grind slowly, but relentlessly. Especially since such cases are not frequent in our country. And, one way or another, the culprit will be imprisoned for the next 6 years and half of his property will be confiscated. -The sentence for Roman Zavoloka is quite expected and fair. We hope that the sentence for the murderer of our serviceman will be just as fair. It is only a pity that the guilty verdicts are not able to change the attitude towards the military servicemen of the TCC and SP, who faithfully and faithfully perform their duties,- the Poltava Regional TCC and SP commented on the event. It may seem that the sentences really will not change the attitude towards the military from TCC and SP. But this is only at first glance. It is only necessary to create a precedent. If the society sees that the state awards 6 years of imprisonment for a middle finger to the military forces of Ukraine, then whoever wants to repeat Zavoloka's -feat- is unlikely to raise a hand to do so in the literal sense. And with this, believe me, comes a change in attitude towards military personnel serving in the TCC and SP. Those whom the state does not allow to be insulted, sooner or later, the part of the country that, according to the Law, is considered conscripts, begins to respect. And it is not for nothing that in the comments of the Poltava TCC and SP expressed the hope that the sentence for the killer of their colleague from the regional Poltava territorial recruitment center would be just as fair. We are talking about the crime committed by the suspect Vadym Kuzub on February 1 of this year, shooting at a military man who was accompanying the mobilized to the educational center. -It is unacceptable that people of various levels of influence and media influence - from Russian bots and agents to people's deputies - are trying to justify the very fact of the murder of a soldier by a civilian in 2025. It is unacceptable the phenomenon when, instead of working on solving problematic issues, instead of planned and immediate work with the goal of eradicating systematic contempt for military personnel of the TCC and SP, there is a detailed examination of the identity of the killed soldier and a discussion of whether he was sufficiently -military,- Poltava emphasized. TCC and joint venture. Yes, Russian bots in social networks did a lot to blacken the image of the deceased. But, you must agree, after today's sentence to Roman Zavolotsa, confidence increases significantly that any citizen who dares to attack a soldier of the TCC and SP will certainly be punished. ArmyInform earlier reported that the commander of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Major General Mykhailo Drapaty, expressed his position regarding the latest cases of attack on the military in the rear. According to him, the killings of servicemen are a red line that cannot be crossed, and society should not silently watch the disrespect for the defenders of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/04/za-serednij-palecz-u-bik-zsu-6-rokiv-tyurmy-u-poltavskomu-tczk-spodivayutsya-shho-i-dlya-vbyvczi-vyrok-bude-spravedlyvym/	2025-02-04T07:02:27-08:00

-Instructor- back in battle: the story of a school teacher who became a company commander on the fro...	Fierce battles on the front line Since 2023, Yevhen has been serving in the 58th brigade, where he joined from the reserve unit. During this time, he passed the hottest points of the front — the Avdiiv and Vugledar areas. Among the most tense battles, he mentions Krasnohorivka, Stepove and Ugledar. The assaults here continued from morning to evening, and the task of the Ukrainian soldiers was to restrain the enemy. Yevhen notes that the enemy's tactics remain the same - the enemy's troops are acting head-on, trying to take quantity, not quality. A feature of the battles in the Vugledar region was the active use of motorcycle groups by the Russians: fighters on high-speed motorcycles broke through to the positions of the Ukrainian troops, throwing grenades into the trenches. Despite the difficult conditions, the motivation of the fighters remains high. -We have been fighting for independence for more than a thousand days. Who but us?- Yevhen emphasizes. He is convinced that Ukrainians are a nation capable of adapting to any conditions and fighting for victory. According to him, representatives of various professions are currently fighting in the ranks of the Armed Forces - teachers, doctors, mechanics, agronomists. -Man is a creature that knows how to survive. And if there is motivation, we will win,- he adds. The commander emphasizes the importance of rest and moral support of the military. Exhausted battles require regular rotations and attention to the psychological state of the fighters. At the same time, he believes in victory: -We want to return to the borders of 1991, and we will work on it. But the main thing is to prevent this war from happening again in a few years.- Addressing civilians, Yevgeny urges them not to be afraid of mobilization and to join the ranks of the Armed Forces. -War is not good, but one must protect one's land, one's children, one's women. We will stand, because the truth is with us,- concludes the officer. As reported by ArmyInform, the Russian special services and the military are increasingly trying to influence the families of Ukrainian prisoners of war. Numerous cases have been recorded when the occupiers contact relatives immediately after taking the defender into captivity.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/04/instruktor-znovu-v-boyu-istoriya-shkilnogo-vchytelya-yakyj-stav-komandyrom-roty-na-peredovij/	2025-02-04T06:04:10-08:00

Transfer through Army+: the MOU explained the difference between orders and orders	In the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine explained what are the differences between these documents and how their implementation is controlled. For officers, the Personnel Center of the Armed Forces prepares a transfer order. At the same time, there are orders for private, senior and non-commissioned officers. Both documents are mandatory. Orders and transfer orders can currently take up to two weeks to form and finalize. However, it is important to distinguish between these documents. When contacting the military unit, the soldier or sergeant should ask for the transfer order itself. In Army+, cases are recorded when the order is already ready, but the soldiers are still not transferred, waiting for the order. When changing the place of service, the order does not indicate the position of a military person. Only name, title, part number and taxpayer card number are provided. Thus, if a position has changed within one military unit, this is not an obstacle to transfer. This is a violation of the right of a serviceman, because orders and orders are mandatory. The Central Office for the Protection of Servicemen's Rights together with the military administration bodies respond to possible cases of commanders ignoring the execution of orders and monitor their execution. If the military unit received an order or order, but ignores their implementation, it is necessary to report this to Army+. The MOU noted that the Central Department for the Protection of Servicemen's Rights will receive the appeal and will monitor the implementation of the order or transfer order. Previously, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine published an explanation of the transfer mechanism in the Army+ application, as well as the reasons why delays may occur.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/04/perevedennya-cherez-armiya-u-mou-poyasnyly-chym-vidriznyayutsya-nakazy-j-rozporyadzhennya/	2025-02-04T05:06:13-08:00

A record number of Russians are looking for their missing people in Ukraine: the -I want to find- pr...	This is reported by Coordinating Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War. During the month, 8,548 requests for information on missing soldiers of the army of the aggressor country were received. This is 22% more compared to the previous month, which is the highest figure for the entire duration of the project. -I want to find- is a separate project of the Coordination Headquarters, which was launched in January 2024 with the goal of facilitating the exchange of prisoners of war. During the project's operation, it received more than 60,000 inquiries about missing Russian servicemen. It is important to note that this figure does not include the dead and is only part of the real number of missing Russians. According to experts, the total number of missing Russian soldiers may be 2-3 times higher, since not all families turn to the Ukrainian project. However, even this statistic is impressive. Of the 60,000 applications received, the project confirmed the captivity of 1,790 soldiers of the aggressor country, 408 of whom have already been exchanged for Ukrainian defenders. These figures are also lower than the actual number of POW invaders, as they are based solely on applications received. The increase in the number of -I want to find- requests from Russians is an eloquent testimony to the huge losses suffered by the enemy in Ukraine. This is not surprising, because Russian commanders are increasingly resorting to the tactics of -meat assaults-, sending untrained soldiers to the front, -zeroing- them and leaving the wounded on the battlefield. As reported by ArmyInform, the Russian special services and the military are increasingly trying to influence the families of Ukrainian prisoners of war. Numerous cases were recorded when the occupiers contacted relatives immediately after taking the Defender into captivity.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/04/rekordna-kilkist-rosiyan-shukaye-svoyih-znyklyh-bezvisty-v-ukrayini-proyekt-hochu-najty-otrymav-hvylyu-zapytiv/	2025-02-04T04:07:00-08:00

They spied on the military under the guise of volunteering: two people are suspected in the Kharkiv ...	About this informsSBU on February 4. According to the case file, the accused worked as a couple. They turned out to be a local unemployed man and his roommate. -For the conspiracy, the agents posed as volunteers who help homeless animals. For this, they even equipped an improvised -shelter- in their own yard. Under the guise of trips to search for abandoned animals, they went around the area and fixed geolocations for fire damage,- the SBU said. Among the potential targets were reserve deployment points and checkpoints of the Defense Forces, as well as medical facilities where wounded Ukrainian soldiers were receiving treatment. -All additional information was obtained by the traitors -in the dark- from local residents whom they met during reconnaissance trips. The received intelligence agents transmitted the game by phone to a militant they know, who is fighting on the eastern fronts and cooperates with the Russians,- the report says. SBU counter-intelligence timely exposed the agent couple, documented their crimes and detained them at their place of residence. At the same time, comprehensive measures were taken to secure the positions of the Defense Forces on the front-line territory of the region. It was established that the military intelligence of the Russian Federation remotely recruited both involved through their fellow villager, who has been fighting against Ukrainian troops in eastern Ukraine since 2014. During the searches, mobile phones with evidence of their communication with the Russian game were seized from the detainees. So far, the SBU investigators have informed them about the suspicion for h. 2 Art. 28, ch. 2 Art. 111 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (treason committed by a group of persons under martial law in accordance with a prior conspiracy).

A representative of the public relations service of the -Charter- brigade told - Volodymyr Degtyarev of the National Guard of Ukraine. According to him, it is necessary to knock out the enemy not so much from trenches and fortified traditional fortifications, but from deep holes. -Charter- in this process is helped by high-quality planning of operations and drones. Ground drones are a direction that is actively developing at Charter. -We have created a separate unit, opened a separate recruitment and training of both pilots and engineering technicians. Recently, a large operation was carried out, where several dozens of both aerial and ground drones were used simultaneously. The further we go, the more we understand the role of logistical tasks, fire damage, mining and demining. Where we can replace a person with a ground drone,- noted Volodymyr Degtyarev. As ArmyInform reported, in the Kharkiv direction in the Liptsi-Hlyboke zone, the front line remains stable. The movement of infantry, as well as the movements of enemy equipment, are not recorded.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/04/roboty-vykuryuyut-rosiyan-z-glybokyh-nir-same-tak-vyglyadaye-prosuvannya-syl-oborony-na-harkivshhyni/	2025-02-04T01:19:52-08:00
-Too risky-: the story of a fighter who brought his comrades out from under enemy fire	The story of the fighter's heroic deed was made public on the page of the air command -East-. The village of Liptsi, which was liberated from the invaders by the Ukrainian military for the second time, is of strategic importance. From here, the enemy could direct artillery fire on Kharkiv, so holding positions is critical. Daily artillery duels, drone attacks and small assault groups of Russians make the situation extremely tense. Logistics and unit rotation are complicated — enemy FPV drone operators control the roads. It was in such conditions that Sergeant of the Air Force Yevhen Pogozhih, together with his comrades, found himself under heavy fire when entering the position. When 50 meters to the destination, the enemy FPV drone dropped a grenade. One of the soldiers, an Air Force fighter with the call sign -Doc-, was seriously wounded. He had to be evacuated urgently. -The brothers shouted that it was too risky,- says Yevgeny. — But there was no other way out. Together with his friend, he began to carry the wounded, hiding behind the trees. However, a Russian drone spotted them and corrected the mortar fire. — The real mortar horror began. The mine fell a few meters away from me. He was wounded in the knee and face. If it weren't for the means of protection, I wouldn't have survived, Yevhen recalls. Despite the danger, the brothers managed to be carried to the evacuation vehicle. Ukrainian soldiers continue to put pressure on the occupiers, causing them significant losses. According to Yevhen, the motivation of Ukrainian defenders is extremely high, and each of them knows what they are fighting for. Sergeant Pogozhih has been in the Air Force since 2006. After his release in 2019, he briefly returned to civilian life, but with the start of a full-scale invasion, he again joined the ranks of the defenders. His wife also serves in the radio engineering troops, so she understands well what it means to be in the military at this time. Yevhen is currently undergoing treatment. The medical commission and doctors' decisions are ahead. But his fighting spirit remained indomitable: - There is something to fight for. So go for Victory! As reported by ArmyInform, when the full-scale invasion began, George - bijczya-shho-ne-znaye-slova-vidpochynok/->pensioner, military reserve- did not hesitate for a minute. He immediately applied for service in the Steel Border border brigade and returned to the fight for Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/04/zanadto-ryzykovano-istoriya-bijczya-yakyj-vynis-pobratyma-z-pid-vorozhogo-vognyu/	2025-02-04T01:06:09-08:00
National resistance: how Ukraine is building a comprehensive defense system	This is about in the notification of the Ministry of Defense. From the experience of repelling the armed aggression of the Russian Federation, Ukraine has rethought its approaches to protecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the state. One of the powerful tools for countering the Russian aggressor was the concept of national resistance, a system that unites the efforts of the military, civil authorities and citizens in the fight for the independence of Ukraine. -For the third year already, our military has been restraining the enemy Russian army, which has carried out a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. All citizens of Ukraine should help the Defense Forces,- emphasized First Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Lieutenant General Ivan Havryliuk. According to him, this is both the maintenance of law and order and countering saboteurs in the government-controlled territories, and assistance to the Special Operations Forces in the temporarily occupied Ukrainian lands. -In order for Victory to come closer, every Ukrainian must realize his role in the defense of the state during hostilities and in emergency situations. We must strengthen military-patriotic education, which forms a stable motivation to protect the Motherland,- he assured. National resistance is a set of measures aimed at protecting Ukraine by maximally involving its citizens. National resistance gives every Ukrainian an opportunity to contribute to the defense of the state. The main goal is to increase the state's defense capability, provide Ukraine's defense with an all-encompassing character, and help ensure the readiness of Ukrainian citizens for national resistance. The system of leadership of the national resistance is built in such a way as to ensure clear coordination of all components of the resistance. At the head is the President of Ukraine as the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, who exercises leadership through the Minister of Defense of Ukraine. National resistance has three components, each of which performs its specific tasks. The first is territorial defense, which protects important facilities, maintains law and order, and counters subversive groups in controlled territory. The second component is the resistance movement that operates in the territories where Ukrainian sovereignty needs to be restored. This may include both information operations and physical opposition to the occupiers. The third component is the preparation of citizens for national resistance. This component of the system provides people with the necessary knowledge and skills to protect their land. It includes both military training and emergency training. Territorial defense units perform a wide range of tasks: from guarding important facilities to countering subversive groups. In emergency situations, they help rescuers and ensure the safety of the civilian population. An important task of territorial defense is also participation in strengthening the protection of the state border and creating conditions for the safe functioning of authorities. In wartime, ground defense units often become the first line of defense for their communities against various threats. Territorial defense also takes an active part in information confrontation, carrying out measures to counter enemy information operations. In addition, it helps in the provision of assistance to the population, which is especially important in the conditions of martial law. Territorial defense has three interrelated components: The military component includes military management bodies, military units of the Territorial Defense Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, other forces and means of the Security Forces and Defense Forces involved in the performance of territorial defense tasks. The civil component includes bodies of state power and local self-government. They provide administrative support, coordination of the population and resolution of territorial defense measures. The military-civilian component is the headquarters of territorial defense zones (districts) and voluntary formations of territorial communities. They are a connecting link between military and civilian structures. The territorial defense management system is built on a clear hierarchical principle. At the national level, leadership is exercised by the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces through the Commander of the Territorial Defense Forces. Within the borders of the land military zone, leadership is exercised by the heads of regional military administration bodies through the relevant headquarters. Each zone and district of territorial defense has its own leaders and headquarters, which coordinate actions at the local level. The resistance movement is a component of the national resistance, which operates where it is necessary to restore the sovereignty of Ukraine over the temporarily occupied territory. Its main tasks include forming a resistance network, conducting special operations and creating obstacles to the actions of the occupiers. An important function of the resistance movement is to carry out informational and psychological operations and to carry out intelligence activities. Specific work methods are protected by state secrets. The leadership of the resistance movement is carried out by the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces through the Commander of the Special Operations Forces. The preparation of citizens for national resistance is aimed at forming citizens' patriotic consciousness, mastering practical skills and skills to protect their state. The main tasks include the formation of citizens' understanding of their role in the defense of Ukraine, training in actions in the conditions of hostilities and emergency situations. Special attention is paid to military-patriotic education, which forms a stable motivation to protect the Motherland. The leadership of the preparation of Ukrainian citizens for national resistance is carried out by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine through the relevant central bodies of the executive power.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/04/naczionalnyj-sprotyv-yak-ukrayina-rozbudovuye-vseohoplyuyuchu-systemu-oborony/	2025-02-04T00:51:11-08:00
-TCKashniks- do not exist: language betrays the enemy	Many of these terms betray the enemy immediately, because their meaning and purpose are obvious. If someone uses the terms -Ukrainian Nazis-, -Ukrainian militants-, -hokhlopiteks-, -banderlogs- and the like in their speech or in posts or comments on social networks, it is clear to everyone that this is done by the Russian occupiers or their henchmen. However, there are apparently neutral terms that are aimed at distorting reality and filling it with meanings beneficial to Russian propagandists. For example, at the beginning of the large-scale invasion, the mass propaganda media of the Russian occupiers tried to use the term -ZSUShniks- to designate the servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Used exclusively in a negative context, this term did not take root in Ukrainian social networks, because despite its pretended neutrality, it tried to replace and stand in for other objective and positive definitions in the speech: -Ukrainian military-, -servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine-, -defenders- and others. Having failed in the task of discrediting the entire Ukrainian army and its servicemen, enemy propagandists and numerous bots have focused their efforts on undermining its foundation — the territorial centers of recruitment and social support. The main goal of the enemy was the disruption of mobilization, and the means used by Russian propagandists were provocations against servicemen of the TCC and SP and artificially exaggerating in the information space those cases when the servicemen of the Armed Forces were unable to resist them. From just a few isolated cases to hundreds of thousands of calmly and correctly mobilized conscript citizens of Ukraine, Russian propagandists have created a fictitious image of demonized -manhunters- who seem to only do what they do by twisting and beating civilians in the rear. At the level of language, this image of the enemy was fixed with the help of the term -TCKashniki- to denote servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine who are serving in the territorial centers of recruitment and social support. Russian propagandists began to artificially contrast -TCKashniks- with defenders from the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Instead, in fact, the opposition of military personnel who serve in the TCC and SP and all other structures, parts, units and units within the Armed Forces of Ukraine is artificial and harmful in nature. There are no -TCC cashiers- — there are servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine who are currently serving in the TCC and SP. And before that, many of them served in combat units and were injured during combat missions. It is impossible at the same time to support the Armed Forces and throw mud at the servicemen of the TCC and SP, applying the derogatory term -TCKashniki- to them. Anyone who denigrates servicemen from the territorial recruitment and social support centers is actually directly opposing the Armed Forces of Ukraine. This means that Ukraine is a direct enemy of the Ukrainian people and the state.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/04/tczkashnykiv-ne-isnuye-voroga-vydaye-mova/	2025-02-04T00:32:10-08:00

He didn't ask if he could - he just stood up: the story of a fighter who doesn't know the word -rest...	The story of the fighter was made public on the DPSU page. Giorgii says that his decision to return to the army was completely conscious: -When I heard that the Steel Border was being created, I immediately applied. I was waiting for orders and was ready to engage in combat work.- The combat routine of his unit is a daily confrontation with the enemy, who uses the latest technology, intelligence, drones and advanced weapons. However, Ukrainian defenders constantly adapt and find effective methods of struggle. The enemy tries to test his weapons on Ukrainian soldiers, but our soldiers quickly analyze his tactics and give a worthy response. -Ukraine is a place where the aggressor tests the maximum of its innovations. But we don't just keep hitting, we learn and improve our tactics.- According to George, high-quality fire support is of great importance. Drones, artillery, mortars and strike drones help destroy the enemy and protect our soldiers. -The calculations of the attack drones -Vampire- showed themselves very well in battle. They allow not only to inflict fire damage, but also to remotely mine the territory where it is impossible for sappers to reach.- When enemy equipment moves to Ukrainian positions, fighters can remotely install up to a hundred mines, which greatly complicates the enemy's offensive. Despite the high combat training and coherence of the unit, George admits that the hardest thing is losing comrades. -When you send people on a mission, and you don't know if they will return. This is the hardest part. It's incredibly difficult.- The Russian army fights en masse, not counting its losses, but for the Ukrainian military, every fighter is not just a soldier, but a person behind whom family, friends, and a whole life stand. When asked what his greatest desire is, George gives a short answer: -To hear the word 'Victory'.- That's the most important thing for all of us.- He believes that the Ukrainian army will be able to stand and win back every meter of native land. As reported by ArmyInform, Vadim with the call sign -Popil- never planned to become a soldier. Before the Great War, he lived a quiet life in Khmelnytskyi, worked in a private firm, traded in dairy products.

Rescuing the wounded in the dark and under enemy fire: ArmiyaInform report from takmed exercises	It is almost impossible to see something in the dense darkness - it is early in Donetsk region. Actually, that's why the fighter came out right now, because it was too dangerous to do so. -I'm here, I'm the -three hundredth-!-, we hear a few meters from the exit from the shelter. Archer is injured and needs help. Fortunately, all this is just an imitation of a possible situation during real hostilities - a final check during tactical medicine exercises in the 2nd International Defense Legion of Ukraine. ArmiyaInform visited the final class and talked with the fighters and instructors. An intensive two-day training in tactical medicine for the soldiers of the Defense Forces is an initiative and one of the main areas of activity of the All-Ukrainian Association -Patriot- Public Organization. Classes are conducted by highly qualified specialists, the purpose of which is to provide primary or significantly improve the already existing skills and abilities of combatants. -Our manager and founder of the foundation, Hanna Maiboroda, has been involved in this community since 2014, since the time of the ATO. The main direction of the NGO -Patriot- is medical, training for both military and civilians. Now we go to different destinations and work with everyone who comes to meet us, because the demand and need for such trainings is extremely high,- says Nils, a representative of the organization. He is a former fighter of the 4th brigade of operational assignment -Rubizh- of the National Guard of Ukraine, was a combat medic in the -Force of Freedom- battalion, so he not only perfectly knows the theory, but also has considerable practical combat experience. Nils emphasizes that such trainings with soldiers, who are taken on rest during rotations, are extremely important, because they allow to constantly update their knowledge of tactical medicine. Important features of the trainings are work exclusively with small groups of 4-6 people, good supply of consumables and training dummies, as well as maximum approximation to real combat conditions. During the final exercise, fighters must render aid to a wounded comrade while simulating intense shelling of the position, in the dark and under conditions of heavy smoke. -Why is it important to implement this kind of approach? Because it is absolutely incorrect to train military personnel only in hothouse conditions for the reason that, unfortunately, there will not be ideal conditions in war. Soldiers need to be mentally and physically prepared for those moments that will arise during their real work,- explains former serviceman of the Defense Forces of Ukraine, tactical medicine instructor Andrian. That is why the fighters spend the second day of training -in the field-, helping the wounded in full combat gear and with weapons in their hands. The training is so close to reality that they need not to remove, but to cut off the uniform from the wounded - training clothes, as well as all other consumables, are provided by the NGO -Patriot-. -We use individual first-aid kits of fighters and various mannequins - for tamponade with simulated bleeding, for needle decompression, fully equipped in accordance with all requirements and standards. In the final session, we dress the wounded in second-hand clothes that can be cut, and also add simulation of explosions and smoke using airsoft and smoke grenades,- says Nils. The instructors are very satisfied with the work of the fighters during training. This is not surprising, because even an outside observer immediately notices how the students do not just perform a number, but take the initiative and ask the instructors to further explain some aspect or practice an educational exercise. -The guys are very well involved in the work. I really like that they always have questions, they talk about some situations from their own experience, they ask to comment on unclear points. Often at first they believe that they already know everything and we will not teach them anything new. But then during classes, we see how their eyes light up, how they want to work,- says Andrian. The final session must be held late in the evening, because, as experience shows, the front freezes during the day and all the events take place at night. Therefore, it is very important that fighters know how to provide first aid in the dark. Also, in the evening, after intensive training, they are already tired, and they will have to rescue a wounded comrade when they are tired. -Today we worked all day in the field in full ammunition, worked out the full MARCH algorithm and individual elements of assistance. And now (during the final class — ed.) we gathered all our knowledge together and fully practiced rescuing the wounded, giving him first aid and preparing him for evacuation,- says one of the fighters of the 2nd International Legion, who just completed training. He is satisfied with his studies, but he hopes that he will not need to use the acquired knowledge in real life: -Thank God, all these are now stickers, shams, dummies. In reality, it would be terrible. However, it is better to know and be able to never need it, than not to know what to do when the need arises.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/04/poryatunok-poranenyh-u-temryavi-ta-pid-vorozhym-vognem-reportazh-armiyainform-z-navchan-po-takmedu/	2025-02-03T20:46:52-08:00
A fighter on miniatures: the appearance of a UAV interceptor drone, similar to a fifth-generation ai...	As noted, not without a certain amount of boasting, on the official portal of the developer firm from the American city of Brighton , in Colorado, this next-generation jet-powered interceptor shares common features with the Lockheed F-35B stealth fighter and F-22 of the 5th generation, ArmyInform reports. The device has a length of 1.8 m, a wingspan of 1.5 m and flies at speeds of up to 320 km/h. A jet engine simulator is installed on it - an electric motor rotates turbines, which creates thrust. According to the plan, the machine will receive its own vertical takeoff system (eVTOL, Electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing). It is designed to detect, track, identify and neutralize enemy drones. According to the plan of the developers, the CobraJet will have the possibility of vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) and a nozzle with a thrust vector, which provides increased maneuverability. The interceptor is equipped with VIPER air-to-air missiles, each of which has a PYTHON warhead to neutralize kamikaze drones. The authors of the UAS Vision profile site about unmanned aerial vehicles stated that the CobraJet is powered by solid-state batteries with a high energy density and equipped with flight controller/autopilot with artificial intelligence, day/night camera and inertial sensors for autonomous flight in 24/7 mode. In addition, it is powered by an -electric jet engine-, a system consisting of in-duct turbines driven by an electric motor to create thrust. VTOL capability allows the CobraJet to launch from mobile platforms such as trucks, ships or other aircraft such as C-130. The SkyDefense Command and Control (C2) control system integrates VRAM (Visual Real-Time Terrain Monitoring). VRAM uses an artificial intelligence-based operating system to quickly analyze data from CobraJets and involve operators in decision-making. In addition, CobraJet drones are designed to maintain operational efficiency even in challenging electromagnetic environments, thanks to advanced anti-jamming radios and GPS receivers that provide reliable communication and navigation in jammed conditions. To further enhance their capabilities, satellite communications systems such as Starlink are being explored, offering the potential for uninterrupted communications and increased effectiveness in electronic warfare scenarios, even in remote or highly competitive areas. -Our CobraJet neutralizes enemy UAVs with airborne munitions and returns to base to rearm. This approach significantly reduces the cost of counter-drone operations, while maintaining stealth and effectiveness against new threats, including unmanned ground vehicles,- SkyDefense President Nick Verini was quoted as saying by American news resource on unmanned aerial systems UASweekly. The product also offers a mobile configuration suitable for law enforcement, Department of Homeland Security and Defense and military applications, according to SkyDefense. In this configuration, the C2 and VRAM systems are housed in tactical or militarized cyber trucks designed to operate in extreme environments with low acoustic and thermal signatures to avoid enemy detection. If you believe the promises of SkyDefense, its new device should be presented to potential customers already in the second quarter of 2025. In this case, it will become a revolution in the military, since this device is a universal hunter for drones and ground robots. Intrigue is fueled by the fact that, apart from low-quality renderings, the manufacturer has not shown anything yet. In the future, according to the assurances of the SkyDefense management, it is expected that the technologies used in the CobraJet will develop in the direction of increasing its flight range, expanding the capabilities of autonomous control and integration with more complex combat control systems. In addition, SkyDefense plans to adapt its platform for civilian tasks, such as territory monitoring or emergency response. Graphic presentation of the CobraJet unmanned drone interceptor.

-Operation -Phantom subpoena-: how Ukrainians in Europe are deported by invisible special agents-	It would seem that what could be a more reliable source of information than Telegram channels with names like -Pravda UA- or -Lawyer for all-? Well, or the same -anonymous sources in the State Border Service- who work exclusively in the fantasies of panic lovers. According to the mythology of these experts, mobile groups are already operating somewhere in Poland or Germany that search for men, instantly hand them a summons and, if possible, deport them to Ukraine on the spot. Eyewitnesses (anonymous, of course) even saw men being dragged into buses similar to those taken to the resort, but without Wi-Fi. The problem is that no real case of such -extradition- has yet been confirmed. And from a legal point of view, this is just nonsense. There is no mechanism of -instant deportation- at the request of the Military Commissariat in international law. Ukrainian legislation also does not provide for the possibility of abducting its citizens on foreign territory. A separate -sensation- is the fact that Ukrainian embassies allegedly transfer the data of evaders to the local authorities, which gladly help to deport them. The reality is that embassies do not have access to lists of conscripts (otherwise they would not ask to bring documents for consular registration by hand). Also, European countries are not very happy to run around with summonses from Ukrainian cafes, because they have more important things to do. Although, perhaps, the latest Ukrainian technology actually works: summonses are transmitted via Wi-Fi at the level of a biometric passport, and they are automatically signed in the phone through Diya. That is why it is so important to go only to McDonald's, and not to suspicious Wi-Fi zones! Some even say that Ukrainian men are no longer being released from Europe without the permission of the Military Commissariat. In particular, there were several stories about the refusal to board flights due to the fact that the -passport is in the database-. And here it is interesting: if someone is already in Europe, why should he be -not released-? Does it work like this: -Sorry, you can't fly to Egypt, but we will help you - Warsaw-Kyiv flight-? The answer is simple - everyone who benefits from creating chaos. Russian bot farms that are happy to fan panic. Dodgers who are looking for an excuse. Telegram channels that need more subscribers. If these horror stories are to be believed, soon subpoenas will be sent through Privat24, and Ukrainian men will be hunted down in European supermarkets, where they are hiding among cheese discounts. But for now, the reality is this: no one issues summonses at the border, no one is deported on the lists, and Ukrainians in Europe can sleep peacefully (unless it's not very peaceful if you have to pay for an apartment in Berlin).	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/04/operacziya-prymarna-povistka-yak-ukrayincziv-u-yevropi-deportuyut-nevydymi-speczagenty/	2025-02-03T20:04:19-08:00
In Kyiv, they said goodbye to the Belarusian sniper: the story of Maria Zaitsava, who died for Ukrai...	Maria asked not to cry and not to bring flowers to her as a farewell if she dies, said reserve colonel Ruslan -Santa- Myroshnychenko, ex-commander of the Second International Legion: -Maria was a strong girl, a soldier, a volunteer. She commanded us to be courageous, strong, to fight the enemy. So, please don't cry. These are not my words, these are what she said. Let's not cry, gather together and fight. And we kill! Glory to Ukraine! Long live Belarus!- Maria joined the International Legion in November 2022. She was a combat medic for a long time. -I noticed that such a fragile girl appeared, a child in fact. I immediately paid attention, because then I thought, what is a high school student doing in my combat unit? But this high school student, relatively speaking, has a very well-formed personality, mature thoughts, and a well-formed determination to fight. She repeatedly repeated that she is not an object of pity, she wants to be a specific subject of struggle and she proved it every day,- said Ruslan Myroshnychenko. At first, she worked in the medical evacuation crew, and then as a combat medic directly at the positions. She was always very goal-oriented and constantly studied, recalls Maria, her fellow health instructor at the medical center, Sergeant Ruslan Boychuk. -She and I came to the Legion almost at the same time. They were in the same crew together, they took positions together. So we have a situation where some women become stronger than men. Men hide, but women even come from abroad. Maria could live peacefully in the Czech Republic, she lived there, she had a residence permit, but she came here,- recalls Ruslan Boychuk. According to Ruslan Myroshnichenko, he did not want to let her go directly to the position. But she convinced him that she could do it. And she saved the lives of several servicemen thanks to her coolness and composure. During one of the trips to the position, Maria was wounded. A fragment of a mine fell into her hand. But after treatment, she immediately returned to the unit. And she said she wanted to become a sniper. -So she firmly told me that that's enough, -Santa- is enough, I'm ready to kill. She had a desire to take revenge for her brothers,- recalls Ruslan Myroshnychenko. And Maria began to train as a sniper. At first, it was an improvised training ground in the East of Ukraine, and then she was sent to sniper courses. After returning from training, she performed combat missions in the Chasovoy Yar region, and then in the Pokrovsk region. She was an effective sniper. -This girl has struggled her whole life. And she died during a combat mission. She was in position until the last,- said the commander of the Second International Legion, Major Oleksandr Yakymovych. According to him, the unit presented Maria Zaitsava with the award -For Courage- (posthumously).

International partners have provided military ecologists with advanced equipment for chemical analys...	About this informs on February 3 the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. The equipment was transferred as part of international aid with the support of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the Swedish government. The official ceremony took place in Kyiv with the participation of the First Secretary of the Embassy of the Kingdom of Sweden in Ukraine, Nils Dahlquis, who handed over the equipment to the head of the Center of Excellence for Mine Action and Environmental Safety, Colonel Oleg Ryabchuk. Now in the arsenal of Ukrainian military ecologists there is an MX908 mass spectrometer and a Raman Serstech Arx substance identification analyzer. The MX908 is a multi-purpose portable mass spectrometer for real-time chemical detection and identification, which will be used for chemical and explosive detection. -This high pressure mass spectrometry (HPMS) device detects and identifies compounds at the residue level with exceptional sensitivity and selectivity,- the statement said. The Serstech Arx Raman analyzer is developed on a modern software platform and in the Quick Scan mode allows you to get accurate results faster for military and industrial explosive devices, military poisons and toxic materials. In his -library- there are more than 2,200 dangerous substances. -Thanks to these devices, we will be able to accurately determine chemical threats in the studied territories, and therefore, plan measures to reduce the negative impact on the natural environment and ensure environmental safety more quickly,- said the head of the environmental safety department of the Main Directorate of Mine Action, Civil Protection and Environmental Safety colonel Yury Sytnyk. Colonel Valery Weber, the deputy head of the Main Directorate of Mine Action, Civil Defense and Environmental Security, thanked the representatives of UNDP and Sweden for their constant support to Ukraine in its confrontation with the Russian aggressor and for technical assistance in the investigation of territories contaminated by dangerous remnants of war.

If someone does not want to serve in his army, he will be -meat- in the Russian army: an expert on f...	Now the experience of wild -safari-mobilization-, tested since February 2022 in ORDLO, is being repeated there. The other day GUR released a video abuse of forcibly mobilized Ukrainians in the Russian armed forces. About why illegal conscription in the occupied territories is another war crime of Russia, says an expert of the non-governmental analytical center -Ukrainian Studies of Strategic Studies-, a candidate of political sciences and a military serviceman of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Yury Oliynyk. ― First of all, it is a flagrant violation of the Geneva Conventions and other international documents that prohibit the mobilization of the population in the occupied territory of a state with which there is a war (in particular, Article 51 of the Fourth Geneva Convention and Article 8 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court - AI). In this way, Russia cynically violates internationally accepted norms. The population that remained in the occupation is brutally used as meat, obviously targeted by people from Russia for control. This is usual for the occupier to instill fear, which is intensified by inter-ethnic confrontation - a practice that has been used for decades and even centuries according to the principle of -divide and conquer-, - believes Yuriy Oliynyk. He says that a typical example of this situation is one of the peoples of the Caucasus, the Chechens. ― In the 1990s, they fought for their freedom, in the 2000s, Moscow was able to overcome them, and many people succumbed to Russian propaganda that soon there will be peace and tranquility, there is no need to fight. Now, instead of fighting for their own freedom, they shed blood for the interests of the invader. In addition, Chechens are specifically demonized in the eyes of other enslaved peoples of the empire in order to instill fear and so that there is no trust in them, the expert explains. It is also a clear example of what can await the population in the occupied territories if the occupied territories continue to expand. ― Against the background of the Russian propaganda campaign that is currently being conducted against the mobilization in Ukraine, against the TCC and SP, we see how they will actually act if they occupy a larger territory of Ukraine. They will not take into account the opinion of the population, but will carry out forced mobilization of everyone they catch. Therefore, if someone does not want to serve in his army, then in the event of the capture of Ukraine by the enemy, he will be used as meat for the needs of the invader.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/03/yakshho-htos-ne-hoche-sluzhyty-u-svoyij-armiyi-to-bude-myasom-u-vijsku-rf-ekspert-pro-prymusovu-mobilizacziyu-na-tot/	2025-02-03T04:44:00-08:00

-Begins to hang on his opponent-: why Pokrovsky's defense resembles the 10th round of a boxing match	The spokesman of the operational and strategic Major Viktor Tregubov of the -Khortytsia- troop group. According to Viktor Tregubov, the enemy's ambitions remain unchanged — to capture the city, cut the routes to it and leave the defenders of the city without supplies. However, now the Russians do not have such a great advantage that would allow them to effectively introduce offensive actions. -If they suddenly have some new powerful reserve. If they suddenly become an absolutely unlimited number. If they have an unlimited number of vehicles, an advantage over drones, then of course this could somehow change the situation,- said the spokesman of the Khortytsia operational-strategic group of troops. But, Viktor Tregubov is sure, the situation looks like there is no such great advantage now. And an offensive for the Russians is a guaranteed four-digit number of losses in just one day. -It's a bit like a boxing match that goes to the 10th round. When both boxers are tired. But the one who attacked more actively, attacked more actively at the beginning, he was already a little more tired. He just doesn't have enough energy. And he is already starting to hang on his opponent. This is what is happening here with the Russians,- Viktor Tregubov noted. As reported by /a> ArmyInform, fighters of the 13th operational brigade of NSU -Chartiya- destroyed 15 Russian invaders, as well as an ammunition depot, a cannon, and an enemy shelter.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/03/pochynaye-vysity-na-svoyemu-supernyku-chomu-oborona-pokrovska-nagaduye-10-j-raund-bokserskogo-poyedynku/	2025-02-03T04:24:24-08:00

Volodymyr Zelenskyi shared photos of the production of Ukrainian unmanned systems	President Volodymyr Zelensky shared new photos from the process of manufacturing unmanned systems on his page. The head of state emphasized that Ukrainian weapons not only help the military gain an advantage on the battlefield, but also save their lives. -Our Ukrainian weapons help protect the lives of our soldiers and achieve results on the battlefield. Our defense production, which includes both equipment and projectiles, increases the space of our security and our arsenal of capabilities,- Volodymyr Zelenskyi noted. According to him, Ukraine will increase this potential every year, which is the strategic perspective of the state. The military-industrial complex is expanding thanks to the efforts of the public sector, private companies and international partners investing in the Ukrainian defense industry. The development of technological weapons, in particular unmanned systems, is critical to the conduct of modern warfare. Ukrainian manufacturers are constantly improving their developments, adapting them to new challenges at the front. -Thank you to everyone who makes our army technological,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy emphasized.

FPV drones on fiber optics: the SBS commander talked about ways to counter them and similar developm...	The Commander of the Unmanned Systems Forces Colonel Vadym Suharevsky told about itin an interview with Radio Liberty's -Donbas Realities- project. -If I'm not mistaken, we recorded the first use of such drones by the enemy at the beginning of summer. Then there was a certain decline and now an active phase again. This is exactly the stage of the Cold War, when the arms race is based on the fact that something effective is invented, and the other side will come up with a way to counter it,- he noted. According to him, it is now a step behind the Ukrainian side. -We must use this technology to our advantage and find an effective means of combating it. I will announce in advance that certain ideas and results are already planned. After a journey of testing and scaling, I think we'll get there. Yes, this is a really dangerous weapon,- said the SBS commander. Vadym Sukharevskii noted that this is, on the one hand, a revolutionary approach, since all EW systems, on which billions of money have been spent, are ineffective against FPV drones on fiber optics. On the other hand, this tool constrains the occupiers in a maneuver, so the way to fight it can be effective when building a normal countermeasure system. -Our guys are already learning, they're already adapting to these drones. Yes, unfortunately, at a high price. As for us, in just the last few weeks, various agencies have already codified more than 14 manufacturers of fiber-optic drones with general parameters from 10 to 15 km with coils of various types,- he informed. In his opinion, Ukrainian diplomats should ask their partners to limit the supply of optical fiber to Russia.

On February 23, 2022, he was at the -No Limits- concert, feeling an uneasy feeling. The next morning the war began. The first thing Vadim did was to evacuate his family. Friends and acquaintances who passed the ATO advised not to rush to the military commissariat - -your turn will come.- And it came in the spring of 2023. Vadym was designated as a driver in the artillery brigade of the Airborne Assault Troops at the Military Commissariat. -I've been driving all my life, so this position didn't come as a surprise,- he recalls. But the war quickly taught that the ability to drive is only a small part of the tasks that have to be performed. Every week, Popil and his brothers drive more than a thousand kilometers with ammunition on broken roads and sticky fields. He not only delivers the shells, but also helps move the guns after the battle. Rollover is always a danger, because the enemy has already calculated the position and can strike at any moment. -Sometimes we invest in 15-20 minutes, and sometimes we get stuck for an hour,- he says. Another feature of the job is constant waiting. -We can sit in the landing at midnight with a full body of shells, waiting for the moment when the enemy will give us a window for safe unloading. Sometimes you have to hide and wait for shelling, because you can't retreat - the infantry is counting on us.- Also, a lot in the lives of gunners is weather dependent. -We are constantly monitoring the weather. If, for example, there will be a full moon at 11:00 p.m., we need to do everything before the enemy gets better visibility.- But this is a two-sided game - the Russians work according to the same principle. War does not allow relaxation. -It was even calmer in Zaporozhye. But not now. FPV drones have become our daily threat. Air defense and electronic warfare do not see everything. On the day when an FPV flew into our car, we were already far away from the firing range, we were driving without headlights with a night lamp, and even the command said that there was no threat. But an enemy drone found us and hit the roof.- The impact came between him and the driver. -My left side was injured, his right side. Shrapnel wounds, lacerations, contusions. They helped each other, our pick-up truck picked us up and quickly took us to the headquarters.- Despite the injuries, Vadim returned to his work. -It was difficult. When I was driving on a fire road after treatment, I even had a panic attack. But the fear passes. When it's hard, I think about my relatives and about the guys at the gun - they count on me, and the infantry counts on the artillery. Here, everything is interconnected.- Work without days off. In addition to shells, they carry food and parcels. Constantly optimizing routes to make them faster and safer. And every night before going to sleep, Vadim remembers the day he experienced. -When CABs fly nearby, you are covered with earth and debris, and even the windows of the cars are intact - you understand that God protects us.- For his service, Vadym was awarded the Iron Cross medal. -What does she mean to me? It's more for my baby. Dad's pride.- As reported by ArmyInform, 28-year-old Oleksandr with the call sign -German- is drona-bomber operator 128 separate of the Transcarpathian Mountain Assault Brigade. Before Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, he worked at a mining and beneficiation plant in Kryvyi Rih.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/03/hlopczi-bilya-garmaty-rozrahovuyut-na-mene-istoriya-poranennya-ta-povernennya-na-front-bijczya-z-pozyvnym-popil/	2025-02-03T02:43:45-08:00

Instead of the ring, the front: how the kickboxer -Aras- stood up for Ukraine	The story of the fighter was made public on the DPSU page. Denys recalls that the military theme fascinated him since childhood: -In kindergarten, when there were performances, they asked what you want to be when you grow up.

This was reported by the commander of the 429th separate regiment on the -Suspilne.Novyny- broadcast. of unmanned systems -Achilles- Yury Fedorenko. According to Yuriy Fedorenko, having a huge number of personnel, the enemy uses -quite interesting- tactics. People are the cheapest expenditure material for them, so it is constantly thrown forward. -The enemy is constantly trying to conduct combat reconnaissance in order to find us on the front line. And in the case of detection, fire damage begins to be actively carried out in the place where the fire came from. Due to its drones, artillery and many other things. The Defense Forces are used to such tactics,- he said. In addition, in order to accelerate the offensive, from time to time the Russians continue to use armored vehicles.

A saboteur who was preparing a terrorist attack on the railway was detained in the Rivne region	This is reported by the Security Service of Ukraine. However, the attacker did not even have time to install the SVP, because the SBU detained him near the track -in the act of red-handed-. According to the case materials, the agent turned out to be an unemployed 23-year-old resident of Lviv Oblast, who had already been prosecuted for vandalism at the burial sites of Ukrainian soldiers. He came to the attention of the FSB as an ideological supporter of racism and because of his desire to leave for Russia, which he repeatedly wrote on social networks. As the investigation established, the suspect received step-by-step instructions from his Russian curators: to arrive in Rivne region, take the explosives from the cache and install them according to the specified coordinates on the tracks.

How to choose a weapon that will not let you down: tips from a special agent -Den-	This is discussed in the post on the brigade page. According to -Dan-, his favorite assault rifle is the Colt M4. He calls it a -simple, time-tested classic- and notes its reliability, ease of use and -survival-. -More than 50% of its reliability, survivability, etc. depends on the operator himself,- says the fighter. He emphasizes that weapons must be carefully cared for and protected from external influences, especially in an aquatic environment. -Dan- said that working in the water requires the use of sealed bags or summaries that contain quality lubricant, cleaning agents and a special nozzle to prevent dirt from entering the barrel. Regarding the choice of weapons for various tasks, the fighter noted that he takes the M4 both for land and underwater operations. Although, he said, he might occasionally use the 5.56mm M249 SAW light machine gun. -I find the AR-15-based carbine with a barrel up to 12 inches, with a gas tube instead of a piston, to be the most versatile for a wide range of tasks. -In my case, it's an M4 carbine with an 11.7- barrel,- -Dan- said. He also shared his experience with various weapons including the Canadian C8, SCAR, Haenel and Daniel Defense. -My main principle for choosing a weapon is that it should be tested by time and harsh operating conditions, and it should be based on accumulated practical experience of use by other shooters in different situations. I don't want to learn about the -nuances- of the weapon sample already during the task. A banal delay when shooting at one operator can frame the whole group,- the fighter emphasized. According to him, operators can have different rifles in one group, but the whole group can also be equipped with the same rifles in the same configuration. The choice of weapon depends on the task, the time of day, the area of ​​operation, as well as the attachments on the rifle, such as the LCV, optical/collimator sights, thermal imaging attachments/thermal sights, and flip-up magnifiers.

They don't even pay their own: in the occupied Luhansk region, the collaborators are without money	This was reported by the head of Luhansk OVA, Artem Lysogor. According to him, debts have accumulated even to those who work in the -Young Guard- propaganda museum in Sorokyno, which glorifies the exploits of Soviet partisans. Employees of other Luhansk institutions, including the Academic Russian Drama Theater, the Academic Music and Drama Theater, local history and art museums, are also without salaries. These facts indicate that even the collaborators who betrayed Ukraine and went to serve the occupiers cannot count on decent payment for their -work-. The Russian authorities do not fulfill their promises and do not provide even minimal social guarantees for those who serve them. As reported by ArmyInform, in the so-called LNR, in order to issue social payments to large families, they require Russian-style documents, in particular Russian passports, birth certificates, certificate of a large family, individual account number of the insured person and certificates from the places of education of children in educational institutions of the Russian Federation.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/03/navit-svoyim-ne-platyat-na-okupovanij-luganshhyni-kolaboranty-sydyat-bez-groshej/	2025-02-02T23:04:28-08:00

The old is liquidated, the new is not created: what kind of military justice does Ukraine need. Expe...	After all, can civilian investigators and prosecutors professionally investigate case materials related to the military and military cases, and civilian judges - deliver a fair verdict? Yes, the Verkhovna Rada is currently working on draft laws on the military police and military specialization of judges, which are intended to bring the creation of the military justice system closer. ArmyInform asked a lawyer, a military officer of the Armed Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Oleksandr Musienko, about the need to create a system of military justice. He states: the issue of the creation and functioning of the military justice system is long overdue. -Unfortunately, judicial and law enforcement reforms that were taking place did not take into account the growth of challenges and those related to Russian aggression, starting from 2014. What's more: the existing system of military justice - the courts and the prosecutor's office - were effectively liquidated, and no fully functioning institutions were created in their place. During this time, the defense and security sector was only growing. Accordingly, a lot of issues arose that required legal settlement, as well as correct interpretation and assessment of the actions of military commanders and military personnel. There were also signs of the problem of considering criminal proceedings related to military service and repelling Russian aggression. It even caused indignation in society and questions in the military sphere,- says Oleksandr Musienko. According to him, the questions that most often arose and still arise in this context: can law enforcement agencies or courts that do not have specialized knowledge in the military field properly evaluate the actions of a military commander, taking into account all the specifics of conducting hostilities. -The other side of the issue is that the military could be indignant over the fact that they can be evaluated by people who have not received appropriate training or have professional experience related to the military,- says Oleksandr Musienko. He emphasizes that he studied the experience of the existing systems of NATO countries, partners of Ukraine. -Full-fledged military justice systems exist in the USA, Canada, Great Britain (with their own peculiarities). France even has a separate code for the military, the Code of Military Justice. These countries introduced a system of military justice also because their armies had the experience of participating in hostilities. This made it possible to make sure that this is the best way to settle legal issues that arise in the course of hostilities, as well as bringing servicemen to justice,- the interlocutor comments. The system of military justice (with its own peculiarities - ed.) also exists in Israel. -For example, in addition to the relevant legislation and the regulation of the activities of the military, there is also an institute of military legal advisers, who help the command to make decisions, observing the norms of international humanitarian law, the need to act in accordance with the internal legislation of Israel,- says Oleksandr Musienko. According to different estimates, he says, more than a million people are involved in the defense and security sector in Ukraine today. -Active hostilities continue, many questions arise regarding the interpretation of the norms of military legislation and their correct application. The law enforcement function can also be singled out as a separate item. Military specifics require specialists to have professional experience and knowledge in this particular field. In order to fully assess the actions of a fighter during hostilities, knowledge and experience are necessary. This is definitely capable of improving the application of legislation, maintaining law and order in the Defense and Security Forces, reducing the burden on the law enforcement system and the court, which have to conduct investigations and consider many other categories of cases,- the interlocutor emphasizes. He emphasizes again: -The creation of a full-fledged system of military justice is more than justified. Moreover, it is necessary to have a closed cycle in this area. That is: the military police, the prosecutor's office and the courts. If not the creation of military courts, then at least the introduction of specializations for judges who consider the relevant categories of cases. These specializations should include training courses, training and consideration of exclusively categories of cases in the military sphere. Therefore, passing the necessary laws is very important.- Oleksandr Musienko adds that the creation of a military justice system will solve the issue of better enforcement of the relevant norms of current legislation, as well as military law. -In addition, the question of the fairness of consideration of certain high-profile cases will be removed, or at least minimized. The best experience of our partners will also be taken into account,- the lawyer and military officer summarized. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/03/stare-likvidovane-nove-ne-stvorene-yaka-vijskova-yustycziya-potribna-ukrayini-ekspert-pro-svitovyj-dosvid/	2025-02-02T20:57:18-08:00
An island with hypersonic ambitions: Taiwan has developed a rocket that travels more than 2,000 kilo...	As reported by reporters of the local publication Liberty Times, the ammunition -Qingtian- is a development of engineers of the Academy of Sciences of this partially recognized island state, ArmyInform reports. In turn, experts from the Dutch defense portal Army Recognition, who studied this project, noted that the newest missile is based on programs Yunfeng and Yungeng II, originally designed for a range of 1,200 to 2,000 kilometers. The hypersonic complex was named Qingtian (-Qingtian-) - literally -Blue Field- in translation. It is interesting that one of the counties of the Chinese province of Zhejiang, located on the coast of the East China Sea, has the same name. Perhaps the creators of the project wanted to hint at the combat capabilities of the missile and its range. -Qingtian represents advances in propulsion, navigation and guidance technologies, increasing range, speed and operational flexibility. Mass production of the Qingtian began in late 2024, with initial units already delivered to the Taiwan Air Force's missile brigades,- Army Recognition said. The National Chung Shan Institute of Science and Technology (NCSIST) led the development of Qingtian. Thanks to the use of composite ceramic materials, the rocket can withstand extreme conditions associated with speeds in excess of Mach 6. These characteristics allow it to avoid air defense systems and expand its operational application. According to published data, the Qingtian missile complex is the result of further development of the existing systems of the Yunfeng series. Already developed solutions and ideas were used within the framework of the new project, and new components and technologies were also introduced. Thanks to this, it was possible to maintain continuity, as well as to obtain a significant increase in the main tactical and technical characteristics. The main element of the -Qingtian- complex is the missile of the same name. Its exact appearance and parameters, for obvious reasons, still remain unknown. However, some data are available that allow us to make estimates and assumptions. The Qingtian is a land-based missile designed for use on a variety of launchers. In flight, the product develops a speed of at least 6 M, which allows it to be classified as hypersonic. The flight range reaches 2000 km. For comparison, missiles of the Yunfen series have a speed of no more than 4-5 M and a range of about 1-1.2 thousand. km According to the available data, the Taiwanese missile is similar to some foreign developments in its technical appearance. She received a fuselage of a characteristic shape with a pointed nose and a special air intake. There are probably planes to create lift in horizontal flight. The glider of the product is manufactured using alloys and other materials resistant to high mechanical and thermal loads. -Liberty Times- reports that, for this purpose, CSIST and related organizations have conducted several additional research works. The dimensions and mass of the rocket remain unknown. At the same time, some features of the compatible launcher are reported. Based on these data, it can be assumed that the length of the missile reaches 10-12 m. The mass is not less than several tons. Qingtian will be deployed on both fixed launch systems and mobile platforms, increasing survivability against potential pre-emptive strikes. The Czech-made Tatra Force 12X12 trucks were chosen for their off-road ability, adaptability to mountainous terrain and maneuverability. If Czech purchases face difficulties, the American Oshkosh M983 is an alternative platform. The adoption of mobile launchers marks a departure from previous trailer-mounted systems in line with modern military trends favoring autonomous launchers. The Qingtian program builds on decades of work on Taiwan's long-range strike capabilities, originating from the Yunfeng program. Despite challenges such as technical issues with guidance systems and international restrictions under the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), the program has made significant progress since key restrictions were eased in 2023. This mitigation, facilitated by agreements with the United States, gave Taiwan access to critical precision targeting and movement components, increasing the Qingtian's accuracy and range. Taiwan's defense initiatives also include the domestic production of submarines and research into advanced propulsion technologies such as the Hypersonic Jet Propulsion Engine for future hypersonic applications. These efforts diversify Taiwan's missile inventory and meet a variety of tactical and strategic requirements. Taiwan's missile advances have come in response to China's increasing military pressure. According to the US Department of Defense, the People's Liberation Army Missile Force (PLARF) currently has more than 3,000 ballistic missiles, including 400 intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), such as the DF-5, DF-31, and DF-41, which have a range exceeds 12,000 kilometers. The PLARF also operates 900 short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs), 1,300 medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBMs), 500 intermediate-range ballistic missiles (IRBMs) and 400 ground-launched cruise missiles (GLCMs). These systems include dual-purpose missiles such as the DF-26, DF-17 equipped with a hypersonic cruise warhead, and the CJ-100 with a range of 3,000 to 4,000 kilometers. The Qingtian missile, with a range of about 2,000 kilometers, can target strategic targets in mainland China. Expert reports show that its reach extends to areas north of Beijing, including Hohhot in Inner Mongolia. This range covers important political and military centers, including Beijing and other urban and industrial centers. The Qingtian deployment gives Taiwan the ability to deal with critical areas in northern China, strengthening its overall defense strategy. Hypersonic missiles, including the Qingtian, challenge existing defense systems due to their speed, maneuverability and low-altitude flight path. When able to be in flight at a speed of more than Mach 5, they reduce the reaction time to interception. Unlike ballistic missiles, which follow predictable trajectories, hypersonic systems perform evasive maneuvers, making detection and tracking more difficult. Their low-altitude profiles further evade radar detection, requiring advanced interception technologies to counter their threat. It should be recalled that Ukraine will continue to adhere to the principle of one China in the issue of Taiwan. This was once again emphasized by the Ukrainian side during personal meetings. > the leadership of the foreign policy departments of our state and the People's Republic of China in July 2024. Taiwan strengthens defenses with hypersonic missiles.

Training of paratroopers at the BZVP: the instructor of the DSHV talked about the peculiarities of t...	Six o'clock in the morning. Getting up, charging, after breakfast, the mobilized go to training sessions. Lunch break, classes again. And until the very evening. This is how basic military training goes 24/7, 45 days. -Smoke, fire, shots, sounds from shell explosions. So that it does not happen all around, the paratrooper must be focused and steadfast. Keep the combat mission in your head that needs to be accomplished,- the tactics lesson goes. Platoon commander Rostislav talks about the peculiarities of the combat situation on the front line. — Enemy drones are a threat from the air. You need to constantly watch the sky. The adversary is now massively using FPV drones with drops, he continues. Cadets are divided into small groups of 15-20 people. While some are learning tactics, others are mastering mine and explosive business. Another group moves to the trenches for practical actions - repelling the enemy's offensive. Rostislav is 25 years old. He is from the Dnipropetrovsk region, graduated from the National University of Civil Defense of Ukraine in Kharkiv. Worked in a mine. From 2021 in the Armed Forces of Ukraine. His story is unique. With training at a military department and an officer's rank behind him, he enlisted as an ordinary soldier. Didn't say anything about his -military- experience. He says: he wanted to experience on his own skin what it was like to go from a simple soldier to an officer. Joined the ranks of the 25th separate Sicheslav Airborne Brigade. He was trained at the same Training Center. I went to Avdiivka, to the area of ​​combat missions, as a simple marksman-sniper of the reconnaissance company. This was exactly half a year before the large-scale invasion. Then he carried out combat missions in Verkhnyotoretsk and Soledar. They offered to become an instructor to train future paratroopers. Already here in Zhytomyr, they were given the rank of officer. -Everything is real. First of all, it depends on the desire of the mobilized servicemen themselves. From their motivation to defend Ukraine and readiness to destroy enemies. Here at the Training Center, the instructors will go out of their way to train the cadets to perform extremely difficult combat missions and kill the Rashists. Moreover, the duration of BZVP should be increased now. 45 days is of course much better than one month. We start the preparation with certain basics. First of all, this is fire training: the boys master the Kalashnikov assault rifle, AGS, RPG, as well as RPK, DShK and Browning M2 machine guns. We put a lot of emphasis on classes in tactical medicine, engineering training and tactics. These are the four aspects that are most important in education today. We use tactics every day. Cadets master the tactics of actions in the composition of departments in defense and offense. This is movement, deployment in battle order, rush from equipment and passes in all the main ways. Analyzing the experience of combat operations with the enemy, especially in the context of the use on the front of small assault groups, recruits learn actions during a confrontation with the enemy. They fire at short distances, practice trench clearing. They are opposed by other groups of military personnel, as they imitate the Rashists. Then we change the scenario, those who were defending are already advancing. The deeper a soldier digs into the ground and properly arranges the dugout, the more likely he is to survive during shelling. We have been teaching this simple truth of engineering training to cadets since the first days of BZVP. In battle, situations sometimes occur that our guys are saved not by a machine gun, but by a shovel. Anti-aircraft missiles, drops from drones, fire from tanks, mortars and other artillery: this is what the enemy uses to attack our positions. And it is logical that shelters should be properly arranged and deep holes should be dug. This will save the lives of paratroopers. We teach the mobilized to set up firing points, trenches and strongholds. Plus topography and communication. The ability to communicate correctly and in a timely manner at the front line. Using our own examples, we tell the boys that they should prepare for the most difficult. The men who come to us for the BZVP often do not understand what is being asked of them here, they do not have the motivation to defend the country. Many say something like: -We are simple people, we worked in -peaceful- professions and were not born for war at all.- What we do right away: sit down and talk to every recruit. We determine his psychotype, whether he volunteered himself or was served with a summons. We convey to them the importance of protecting Ukraine from the aggressor, we say that it is necessary to change those guys who have been at the front since the first days of the invasion. That the state needs them. I, as well as other instructors of the center, were not born for war, we did not have automatic weapons in our hands when we appeared in this world. I prove the information using my own example. At the age of 25, for some reason I am here in the army, protecting the Ukrainian people from the enemy. So are other military personnel fighting at the front. They protect your homes so that your children go to school and do not feel the effects of war. So, many people have to explain on their fingers. The situation on the battlefield is dynamically changing. Now any movement on the front line, approaches to it, as well as in the depth of battle formations is almost impossible to hide. The enemy's massive use of reconnaissance UAVs and FPV drones is a frontline problem. And the meeting of our fighters on the battlefield with enemy drones is inevitable. We teach cadets to counter enemy drones, how to camouflage positions so that they cannot be detected from the air. Always watch the sky. Everyone should be able to identify the operation of a drone by ear and distinguish its type, constantly move and be able to hide from it. Because if the enemy has visually noticed you, he will not let you rest. If the drone has already -burned- you and you hear the sounds of the propeller, you should not just stand still and fall into a -stupor-. It is necessary to inform fellow citizens about the danger by voice and to run to shelter. The enemy pilot does not hear you, but only sees the picture in front of him, that is, the target. Therefore, it is important to react in time. You can try to knock down the -fpvishka- with automatic turns, but from a safe distance from it. It is more realistic to hit a drone-bomber with a machine gun. It is larger than FPV and not as fast. Of course, we are learning to use electronic devices. It is necessary to be able to suppress the work of FPV drones and other UAVs of the enemy. The psychological obstacle course for paratroopers is always exhausting and difficult, but extremely effective. All recruits go through this lane, it is, so to speak, the culmination of the BZVP at the Training Center. Here the emphasis is on cohesion and brotherhood. Cadets must understand that they are one mechanism and each of them is a certain part in it. If one drops out, it becomes more difficult for the others to work. It is very difficult to cross the psychological barrier physically. The length of the obstacle course is 350 meters, on it there are ten elements that the cadets must overcome. But when the boys pass it, they already feel like -rexes-. And it becomes easier for them both morally and physically. I do not understand at all why everyone thinks that somehow this war will not affect them or will simply bypass them. We are at war with the Russians, there are a lot of them. Russia presses and advances every day. The enemy simply will not stop on its own, it must be stopped and destroyed by the Defense Forces of Ukraine. We also suffer losses, our defenders need to be changed, units need to be strengthened. I do not understand why many people, relatively speaking, at breakfast, over a cup of coffee, open YouTube and watch some, sorry, -nonsense-, some pacifist bloggers and so on. On the contrary, it is necessary to prepare oneself for the defense of the Motherland. There are many video courses on tactical medicine, see how to apply a tourniquet. There are a lot of videos on the basics of handling weapons: how to disassemble a machine gun, its characteristics. Go to the shooting range, learn to shoot there. You don't need to sit at the computer, -play dances-. Study, it will be much easier for you and us when you are drafted into the army. In almost three years of the great war, thanks to YouTube alone, it was already possible to become at least a soldier of the first year of service. Having learned all that is needed to survive the war. What can I say to men sitting at home on sofas. Such men should eventually understand that they are not just -egg carriers-, but defenders of their homes and families, their country. Don't whine about life, finally be real men. Come here and show what the Airborne Assault Forces are capable of. We will prepare you qualitatively and then we will beat Russia. Currently, there are many recruiting centers in Ukraine, you can choose a profession yourself. There is even an opportunity, without the participation of the TCC, to mobilize in the military unit you want.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/03/prokachka-desantnykiv-na-bzvp-instruktor-dshv-rozpoviv-pro-osoblyvosti-pidgotovky/	2025-02-02T20:23:39-08:00
A fake on a chain: the Russians - tie up - the Ukrainian military before the battle	Well, judging by the level of creativity, Russian propagandists have obviously overheated under Skabeeva's lamps. Because even for traditional Russian lies it is too much. The information dump appeared in a format typical for Russians: low-quality photos or videos of dubious origin, signed in the style -that's how Ukrainian commanders lead soldiers to the slaughter.- To enhance the effect, anonymous -eyewitnesses- or -prisoners- are also added, who say that no one in the Armed Forces wants to fight, and therefore the soldiers are literally -convoyed- to the front in handcuffs. In the best traditions of Russian propaganda, the -evidence base- of this fake looks like a set of pixels on the screen of a push-button phone. The video is blurred, the voices are distorted, and the face is unknown. But, of course, this is quite enough for the Russian consumer, who has not checked any information for a long time. Now let's open a curtain of reality. In the Ukrainian army, in contrast to the army of the aggressor country, people fight not because they are -driven-, but because they are defending their country. Yes, war is difficult, it is pain and loss. But Ukrainians go to battle because they are fighting for their land, not for the imperial ambitions of the Kremlin elder. In addition, if we talk about handcuffs and the fear of our own soldiers, it is in the Russian army that there have long been stories about zagradzagons and -Kadyrov overseers- who do not allow their own soldiers to retreat. There, -mobs- are thrown into a meat grinder without preparation, and those who refuse can simply be shot. But it is, of course, not for Russian news. This fake is another attempt to demoralize Ukrainians and fuel the myth of the -collapse of the Armed Forces.- They need anything to show that the Ukrainian military allegedly does not want to fight. But the problem is that the desired does not become a reality just from propagandists' fantasies. What's next? Maybe next time they will tell that Ukrainian pilots are tied to the cockpits of fighter jets, and gunners are chained to the guns so they don't escape? The Russians lie - it's not news. But every time their fictions become more and more pathetic. And this only confirms that in reality they have nothing to brag about. So while they are sculpting new horror stories, the Ukrainian military continues to do its job - smashing the occupiers. Without handcuffs, but with great motivation. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/03/fejk-na-lanczyugu-rosiyany-povyazuyut-ukrayinskyh-vijskovyh-pered-boyem/	2025-02-02T20:03:08-08:00

A pro-Russian spy who was studying the movement of Ukrainian ships was detained in Odessa	According to information of the SBU, the agent collected intelligence on the bases and routes of warships of the Armed Forces of Ukraine near Odesa seaport According to the investigation, the collected information was to be used by the Russians to prepare combat operations in the maritime zone, including the launch of cruise missiles and kamikaze drones. In addition, the agent was tasked with identifying the fire positions of the Ukrainian air defense in order to bypass the defense of the Ukrainian military. The agent carried out his activities by driving around the coast in his own car, covertly taking pictures and recording the geolocations of military objects. He transmitted the collected data via messengers to his curator in Russia. The agent's identity and other details were established, and after a search of his apartment, a mobile phone and a computer were found, which he used to communicate with the FSB. The traitor turned out to be a 37-year-old unemployed resident of Odesa, who came to the attention of Russian special services due to attempts to earn money on Telegram channels. He was informed of suspicion of treason under martial law. He is currently in custody and faces life imprisonment with forfeiture of property. The detention was carried out under the procedural guidance of the Odesa Regional Prosecutor's Office. As reported by ArmyInform, SBU employees identified a Russian entrepreneur who produced for the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation more than 13 thousand attack drones of the Geran type, which are the Russian version of the Iranian -Shakhediv-.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/02/v-odesi-zatrymaly-prorosijskogo-shpyguna-shho-vyvchav-ruh-ukrayinskyh-korabliv/	2025-02-02T08:21:48-08:00

Beating and blowing up beds: the occupiers mock forcibly mobilized Ukrainians	About this informs GUR Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. According to the information of the -I want to live- project, last fall, thirty people illegally mobilized by Russia from the occupied districts of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions got into one of the military units on the territory of the occupied Crimea. The Russians appointed as sergeants for them natives from the Caucasus, who incite inter-ethnic enmity, systematically arrange beatings of illegally mobilized people from the occupied Ukrainian territories, detonate training grenades in the barracks, create unbearable living conditions, and force them to observe the performance of prayers. In addition to systematic humiliation from the Caucasian -commanders-, the illegally mobilized also complain of terrible and insufficient food. As a reminder, in the period from October 31 until December 31, 2024, the aggressor state of Russia forcibly mobilized about three hundred people in the occupied territories of the Kherson and Zaporizhia regions. Illegal conscription in the occupied territories is another Russian war crime. -Everyone who has become a victim of forced mobilization has a chance to leave the occupying army and not participate in Russia's criminal war against Ukraine thanks to the I Want to Live project,- the department emphasizes. As reported by ArmiyaInform, Russian commanders en masse ->transfer their mobilized military, who refuse to voluntarily sign a contract with the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, to the so-called -meat- units.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/02/pobyttya-ta-pidryv-lizhok-okupanty-znushhayutsya-z-prymusovo-mobilizovanyh-ukrayincziv/	2025-02-02T06:12:46-08:00
Air Force of the Ukrainian Armed Forces: -Orlan- did not fly over Odesa, did not correct the -Iskand...	This is stated in messages of the Southern Air Command. As you know, between 19:15 and 20:05 on January 31, 2025, the Russians hit with three ballistic missiles -Iskander-M- according to predetermined coordinates. The strike was aimed at the historic center of Odessa. Information immediately appeared in the public space, as if the Russian Orlan-10 drone was correcting a -ballistic- strike directly over the city, and this strike could have been avoided by destroying the UAV. -We officially deny it! However, in order to prevent the further spread of unverified information, the -Southern- air command appeals to bloggers, volunteers, opinion leaders and media persons to comment more carefully on this topic. We thank you in advance for your understanding and are ready to communicate on similar issues,- the statement reads. Regarding the Russian reconnaissance UAV and countermeasures, PvK -Pivden- reported the following: on January 31, 2025, Odesa and the entire south of Ukraine was in the zone of continuous low cloudiness. The lower limit of clouds is 90 m, the upper limit is 3600 m. The reconnaissance UAV -Orlan-10- was indeed fixed, but not over Odesa, but in the waters of the Black Sea at a distance of 25-30 km from the coastline. Today, no correction by a drone is required for launching missile strikes against fixed enemy targets. -Orlan-10- at this time is usually used for the purpose of video recording the results of Russian terrorist actions, as well as for determining the areas of the -exits- of our air defense missiles. -On January 31, the enemy UAV was detected early! It was seen by radar operators during the entire flight (see the diagram), up to the place of destruction - when it became possible (due to the small radius of use of anti-aircraft FPV drones). -Orlan- was struck by the calculation of FPV drone interceptors in the Koblevo area,- the statement said. It is reported that in 2024 units of the Southern Air Command detected and destroyed 106 Orlan-10 reconnaissance UAVs, 75 of them within the Odesa region.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/02/povitryani-syly-zsu-orlan-nad-odesoyu-ne-litav-udar-iskanderiv-ne-koreguvav/	2025-02-02T06:02:34-08:00
How to generate an electronic referral to the VLK in Reserve+: explanation of the Ministry of Defens...	The Ministry of Defense answered key questions about the new feature. What has changed for a conscript? Previously, a conscript could only receive a referral to the VLK in paper form. For this, he had to visit his TCC and JV. Now a person who wants to undergo an examination for fitness for military service can get a referral to the VLK online. To do this, it is enough to log in to the Reserve+ application and submit a request in a few clicks. So the referral to Reserve+ will be immediately to the medical facility? That's right. After submitting a request to Rezerv+, a person receives a notification within a day, which contains all the necessary details: the number and date of registration of the referral, the address of the health care institution for undergoing VLC, the head of which TCC signed the referral. This notification is sufficient to schedule an inspection. Who can receive an electronic referral to the VLK? The Reserv+ service can now be used by conscripts who themselves want to undergo an examination for fitness for military service. That is, they have not yet received a summons to pass the VLK. Received a summons to the VLK. Is it necessary to come to the TCC? Currently, yes. Soon we will also add the possibility of electronic referral, if a person has already received a paper summons to pass the VLC. Is it necessary to go to the TCC after the VLK to update the military registration document? There is no need for this. The Military Medical Commission itself will send the data to the TCC. An employee of the TCC will enter the information into the Reserve register — and the user will receive an updated military registration document in Reserve+. What will happen if you generate an electronic referral and do not come to the VLK? If the conscript himself wants to undergo a fitness test and does not appear, the notification in Reserve+ remains valid for 30 days. After that, the request must be submitted again - and the application will receive a notification with the same or updated information. Will the summonses for passing the VLK also be electronic? No, the summonses will remain paper. They will still be delivered by physical mail. In Reserve+, the TCC cannot independently initiate requests for the passing of the VLK, as well as any other subpoenas. Such a concept as an electronic subpoena does not exist in the legislation. The service of electronic referral to VLK is voluntary. It can only be initiated by the Reserve+ user. Will all referrals be digital now? No, the paper alternative remains. If desired - for example, if it is not possible to use a smartphone - a conscript can continue to receive a paper referral to the TCC, as before. How often do you need to undergo a medical examination? The decision of the Medical Examination on the suitability of a conscript for military service is valid for one year from the date of the end of the medical examination. Therefore, conscripts must update their medical information every year. Should I go through VLC if there is a reservation? If a person has a reservation or deferment, they should not be referred to VLC. The exception is people with the status of -limited suitability- - all of them must undergo a re-examination of the VLC within the terms specified by law. So, a person with the status of -limited suitability- can receive a summons to pass the VLK - and in this case must appear at the TCC, even if he has a reservation or a postponement.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/02/yak-v-rezerv-zgeneruvaty-elektronne-napravlennya-na-vlk-roz%ca%bcyasnennya-minoborony/	2025-02-02T05:44:17-08:00
Explosives were thrown directly onto a man's balcony: another Russian attack in Kherson	This was notified by the State Emergency Service of Ukraine.

Murder of an employee of the TCC: two residents of Poltava region were informed of the suspicion	This was reported by the Prosecutor General's Office. One is charged with obstructing the lawful activities of the Armed Forces during a special period, intentional homicide and theft of firearms combined with violence (Part 1 of Article 114-1, Part 1 of Article 115, Part 3 of Article 262 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine). obstruction of the lawful activity of the Armed Forces during a special period (Part 5 of Art. 27 Part 1 of Art. 114-1 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine). According to the investigation, on January 31 of this year, a resident of Poltava together with other mobilized people, accompanied by military personnel of the Poltava RTCC and SP, went to a military unit for training. Intending to evade military service, he called an acquaintance from Luben several times and informed him of the bus route. When the bus stopped at a gas station in Pyryatyn, a resident of Luben shot one of the attendants with a gun he had brought with him, causing a non-life-threatening gunshot wound to the serviceman. Later, he took possession of the victim's machine gun and fled the scene together with an accomplice. After several hours, the suspects were detained. During the search, the law enforcement officers seized two cases of hand grenades, a hunting rifle, cartridges, a balaclava, mobile phones, etc. from a resident of Luben.

He said this in interview The Associated Press, commenting on the situation regarding the change of leadership in the Defense Procurement Agency. -We have a defense minister who clearly understands that pauses in the support of our army — from drones to air defense — will not only result in military casualties, there will be civilian casualties, and there will be more strikes. He cannot make any pause in the supply,- said the President. Volodymyr Zelenskyy emphasized that the Minister of Defense of Ukraine has the right to do everything to ensure that there is no slowdown in supplies. -If institutionally, he has problems with signing a contract, with supplies or a signal to reduce some kind of support for the Armed Forces. If some institution, which is in the vertical of the Minister of Defense, does not sign contracts, there can be no pause in urgent decisions,- he said. The president added that most of the funding is currently focused on purchases for the army -And if there is money, but some supply has not arrived, then the minister should do everything to ensure that there are no more such problems.

The SBU exposed a traitorous immigrant who collected data on the Armed Forces through her deserter n...	This is reported by the Security Service of Ukraine. According to the investigation, at the beginning of the large-scale invasion, the woman moved to the Vinnytsia region, where she obtained resettled status. While there, she began to cooperate with the FSB. To obtain intelligence, the woman used her nephew, who previously served under a contract in the Armed Forces, but deserted and hid in Toretsk. During telephone conversations, she asked him for information about the positions of the Ukrainian military and the consequences of Russian shelling. She transmitted the received data to the Russian curators via messenger, and after each communication session she deleted the correspondence. Later, fearing exposure, the woman changed her place of residence and moved to the Kirovohrad region, where she tried to avoid contact with the FSB. However, SBU employees established her whereabouts and detained her in a rented apartment. During the search, a mobile phone with evidence of cooperation with the Russian special services was seized from her. As the investigation revealed, the woman came to the attention of the FSB after she left pro-Kremlin comments on Telegram channels. Currently, she has been notified of the suspicion for h. 3 Art. 114-2 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine - unauthorized dissemination of information about the location of the Armed Forces under martial law. The detainee was taken into custody, she faces up to 12 years in prison. The operation was conducted by SBU employees in Vinnytsia, Donetsk and Luhansk regions under the procedural guidance of the Vinnytsia Regional Prosecutor's Office. As reported by ArmyInform, SBU employees identified a Russian entrepreneur who produced for the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation more than 13 thousand attack drones of the Geran type, which are the Russian version of the Iranian -Shakhediv-.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/02/sbu-vykryly-pereselenku-zradnyczyu-yaka-zbyrala-dani-pro-zsu-cherez-pleminnyka-dezertyra/	2025-02-02T04:32:47-08:00

She shared these observations in -Societal News- on Sunday, 2 February, the head of the communications department of the 14th Ombre named after Prince Roman the Great, Major Nadiya Zamryga. -The previous two assaults were repulsed by armored vehicles, the equipment was destroyed, and the infantry that managed to hurry up was destroyed during the movement to landing by FPV drones, drops from the Mavik. Therefore, now the enemy does not do this, sometimes uses light automobile equipment,- Nadiya Zamryga recounted. The servicewoman also said that the Russians use ATVs or cars for assaults in order to be less visible - but our soldiers still destroy them. A change in the tactics of the Russians in the Kupyan direction has not yet been observed. -These are also small groups of infantry that try to move towards the positions of the Armed Forces during the day and at night,- says Nadiya Zamryga. At the same time, the enemy is pulling up reserves in manpower, but this is due to significant losses in manpower and the enemy. As ArmyInform wrote, the other day the Defense Forces of Ukraine in the Kupyan direction managed to stop promotion enemy in the area of ​​Kolesnikivka and to significantly stop the advance in the direction of Zagryzovo.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/02/yidut-na-vsomu-shho-ruhayetsya-u-zsu-rozpovily-pro-speczyfiku-rosijskyh-atak-na-kupyanskomu-napryamku/	2025-02-02T04:12:18-08:00

He told about this on the broadcast of the national telethon -Edyny Novyni- on February 2. . -There is no place to strengthen for quite a long time. A few weeks ago, there was a rumor that the Russians had tightened the pass regime; that the so-called -Rosguard- is raging. They have a separate unit related to marine infrastructure that conducts appropriate inspections. It has happened before. And repeatedly. And even last summer, illegal tourists complained that it was harder to cross bridges than the state border. Of course, they take extreme measures to preserve this object. The reasons are well known to all of us, and the main one has a purely political symbolic component,- said Dmytro Pletenchuk. He also emphasized that the Crimean bridge is an important component (so far) of the logistics chain of the Russian army. As ArmiyaInform wrote, at the beginning of January 2025 it became known that, as a result of a recent storm, the protective barriers that the Russian occupiers placed around the illegally built Kerch bridge scattered across the strait.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/02/dmytro-pletenchuk-prokomentuvav-zakydy-rosijskyh-media-pro-posylennya-ohorony-kerchenskogo-mostu/	2025-02-02T03:51:10-08:00
Sent to storm on crutches: the occupiers demonstrate the latest development on the battlefield	A military serviceman told about this in air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyni- on February 2 Viktor Petrovych of the 77th separate aeromobile brigade of the DSH. -They must forcefully stimulate the personnel to go into battle, because, as the scouts wrote to me, the enemy used the newest development against us - an infantryman on crutches. It is obvious that an infantryman on crutches would not have gone on the attack if he had not been shot in the back with a barrel. They physically affect their personnel,- Viktor Petrovych said. The host asked whether our military actually had the chance to see with their own eyes the Russians who, relatively speaking, stormed with casts or other traumas and injuries, to which the paratrooper replied: -Yes, they have already seen it in battle. It is quite difficult to believe that such a thing can happen until you see it with your own eyes from a drone. Yes, this is information from our scouts: enemy servicemen on crutches were going to attack,- explained the speaker. As it became known, units of the 77th separate aeromobile brigade of the Russian Air Force are currently performing tasks in the Borova region of the Kharkiv region. As ArmyInform wrote, a few days ago, according to the observations of our military, to the mass grave of Russians in the pipe near Chasovoy Yar, delivered -attack crutches-.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/02/vidpravyly-shturmuvaty-na-mylyczyah-okupanty-demonstruyut-novitnyu-rozrobku-na-poli-boyu/	2025-02-02T03:35:58-08:00
NATO Secretary General: the Russian army is losing 1,000-1,500 people a day and is not achieving its...	He said this in an interview with the German publication Bild. -The front is moving in the wrong direction. But at what cost? lose 1,000 to 1,500 people a day who are killed or seriously injured. And yet the Russians do not achieve their goals. And our task is to make sure that they never achieve their goals. Therefore, no: Ukraine will not lose. And we have to support her in becoming stronger,- Mark Rutte said. He added that against the background of talks about possible negotiations, it is necessary to make sure that Ukraine is in the best position. -We must continue to support them with weapons and train their soldiers. And if they want to one day have peace talks, they have to put Putin at the negotiating table. But I cannot describe to you exactly how these negotiations will take place. I already have an idea of ​​how this composition might look. But we don't want to make Putin smarter than he is now. We keep it a little secret. Only the end is certain: after this, Putin will never try again,- Mark Rutte is convinced. At the same time, he warned against naive beliefs that Putin will easily go to negotiations and fulfill all agreements. -Just look at what happened in Bucha. Therefore, if a peace agreement is reached, it must be sustainable. We must ensure that he can never, ever again conquer even one square kilometer of Ukraine,- Mark Rutte said. As ArmiyaInform reported, on January 29, a meeting of the Ukraine-NATO Council at the level of ambassadors was held at the NATO headquarters with the participation of the Deputy Prime Minister for European and Euro-Atlantic Integration, the Minister of Justice of Ukraine Olga Stefanyshyn. Key topics of the meeting were the security situation in Ukraine, the implementation of the decisions of the Washington NATO Summit and the progress of Ukraine in the implementation of reforms, in particular within the framework of the adapted Annual National Program.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/02/gensek-nato-rosijska-armiya-vtrachaye-1000-1500-lyudej-na-den-i-ne-dosyagaye-czilej/	2025-02-02T03:18:03-08:00

During the last missile attack, the Russians did not use the Kalibr cruise missile launchers, there may be several options for such actions by the Russians. This opinion was expressed by a spokesperson on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- on February 2 Dmytro Pletenchuk of the Naval Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. -During the last missile attack, the Russians did not use cruise missile launchers. And it's actually surprising, because they usually involve them too,- Dmytro Pletenchuk said. When asked by the presenter why the Russians do this, Pletenchuk replied that there is no verified information. -The reasons can be different, we can assume several different options. But none of them are confirmed&#8230; It may be their own problems or non-applicability decisions. They understand very well that the effectiveness of these missiles comes down to the fact that they are a distraction: rather harsh, expensive, dangerous, but still a distraction. And given the poor performance, they decided to save them for some other situation. There can be many options. Maybe this time they decided that the attack would not be so massive. It is difficult to say now, it will probably become clear later,- the speaker noted. As ArmiyaInform wrote, in January this year the Navy of the Armed Forces -mi-8/->recorded a decrease in the use of Russian military aircraft over the Black Sea after the loss of two Mi-8 helicopters.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/02/u-vms-zsu-poyasnyly-chomu-rosiyany-pid-chas-ostannoyi-raketnoyi-ataky-ne-zastosovuvaly-kalibry/	2025-02-02T03:07:05-08:00
The murder of a TCC employee: propaganda uses crime to disrupt mobilization and divide society	A man in a balaclava and pixel pants, armed with a hunting rifle, approached one of the TCC servicemen and demanded to give him the weapon. After receiving a refusal, the attacker fired from a distance of 2-3 meters. The intruder took the military weapon from the wounded man and disappeared in an unknown direction together with one of the newly recruited servicemen who was on his way to the training center as part of the team. The deceased serviceman of the territorial procurement center is survived by his wife, children, and parents.- Such a text could be seen yesterday on the official pages in the social networks of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the Poltava Regional Territorial Center for Manpower and Social Support, in the mass media, social networks, various Teltgram channels. The committed serious crime is murder. Moreover, the killing of a serviceman while performing his official task of escorting mobilized citizens of Ukraine to the training center. Killing in a crowded place with the threat of civilian casualties. During the investigation of this crime, different versions may be considered. The investigation will establish all motives and reasons. However, today this crime can already be considered as a continuation of the Russian information campaign aimed at disrupting measures to equip the Defense Forces of Ukraine and, even more, to transfer, for Ukrainian society, the emphasis on the need to strengthen measures to repel Russian armed aggression (the number of victims of which, in particular in relation to the civilian population, increases daily) to the confrontation of conscripted citizens of Ukraine with representatives of the territorial centers of recruitment and social support, the National Police of Ukraine, by other persons designated for carrying out mobilization activities. Numerous -bloggers-, lawyers, -indifferent citizens- are heating up the topic of this confrontation every day. It is significant that the most odious of them, the topic of the armed aggression unleashed by the Russian Federation against Ukraine, the war crimes of the occupiers against the civilian population, the victims of this aggression, are simply absent from their posts. There are only -TCC- in the role of thieves and -fighters against the system- who deliberately evade their duty to protect their country from the enemy. They correspond to the narratives used in Russian propaganda and Russian information operations against Ukraine. The result of such information operations for the enemy should be a forceful confrontation between -evaders- and -tskshniks-, which can easily be turned into a civil war of the civilian population, which -does not want to fight for Zelenskyi, for the deputies, for ... (you can put anything in place of the three dots)- and the military, each of whom can easily be called a -tskshnish- in such a confrontation. -I saw a car with military license plates - they were sleeping or detonated with explosives-, -there is no war-, -children of deputies do not fight-, -TCCs are illegal-, -let someone go to fight first, and then we-... All these theses were written by the enemy. Because of them, the prerequisites for civil confrontation are created, which is a necessary condition for the enemy to occupy all of Ukraine. The practical implementation of such activities of the enemy is quite simple to understand, although it requires regular measures to demonize mobilization and the structures that directly carry it out, to intimidate our conscripted citizens, to discredit state power and military leadership. Even in relation to yesterday's crime: a military serviceman killed by a criminal is survived by his wife, children, parents, and in the comments under the official messages you can see the following: Among such commentators there are obvious bots (no posts, history, characteristic attributes and activity on their own pages at all), so are real citizens of Ukraine (perhaps those who pretend to be real): The quite large number of reactions to their comments is indicative (this can also be artificial reception), which is designed to demonstrate public support for their messages. Simultaneously with the appearance of such comments under official posts, corresponding posts appeared in Russian propaganda telegram channels and, even, a report about this crime in the Russian international media Russia Today, which, unfortunately, is still presented in various countries of the world: Characteristically , that the enemy identifies the criminal who killed our serviceman as -Robin Hood-. The same -Robin Hoods- merged the positions of our troops, aimed (and continue to aim) Russian missiles at our cities and villages, in the temporarily occupied territories, together with the Russian occupiers, torture and kill our civilians. For the enemy, they are really very useful. What do we all need to do? First, to clearly form a relationship to the committed crime. This is not a confrontation with the TCC. This is the killing of a serviceman of the Armed Forces while performing his official duties and, even more, a combat mission. That is, the responsibility of the criminal should lie in the area of ​​crimes against the national security of Ukraine and terrorism. With the maximum possible punishment. Secondly, in no case should we forget who our enemy is and who kills Ukrainians every day. If employees of the TCC exceed their official authority, notify the hotline of the Ministry of Defense, the Ground Forces Command, report it to law enforcement agencies, use all possible tools to protect your rights. Together with the warning of the representatives of the warning groups themselves about the need to observe the law and the fact that the enemy is provoking a confrontation and it is not necessary to help him in this. Third, determine the attitude towards -useful idiots- and -enemy agents-, both overt and covert. If there is no Russian armed aggression for them, it is evil, no defenders and no friends. They do not intend to help you in anything, just as the aggressor does not intend to make your life easier. Evil must be punished, if only informationally - by ignoring their materials, or, if it is impossible to refrain, expressing one's attitude towards the enemy. When Kyiv did not surrender in -three days-, and all of Ukraine - in -several weeks-, at that time, our only strength was unity and a common position. One can have different attitudes towards certain politicians, statesmen, military leaders, but a united, common, independent and sovereign Ukraine is a reality and a future for us and our children.

Probably because when we talk about the reluctance of a part of Ukrainians to serve, we always return to a simple formula: you don't want to fight for Ukraine, you will fight for Russia. And every time one of the Ukrainians talks about it, he hits a nerve. And other military men spoken out about it more than once. But a significant part of society still thinks that this fate will pass them by. It won't actually go away. Recently publicized by the Center of National Resistance (CNS) the figures indicate precisely it. Thus, in almost 10 months of 2024, about 10,000 Ukrainians living in the temporarily occupied territories became servicemen of the Russian army. We are talking about the temporarily occupied territories of Crimea, Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk and Luhansk regions. According to message CNS, conscription to the Russian army in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine began in October last year. -According to the plans of the Kremlin Fuhrer, the ranks of terrorists should be replenished by at least 150,000 new recruits. Among them, a significant share falls on temporarily annexed Donetsk region, Luhansk region, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson region and annexed Crimea,- the publication says. The Central Intelligence Agency clarifies that the first recruitment to the Kremlin's terrorist army took place in the fall of 2023: -Then, as now, recruits were promised that their service would not be connected with participation in the so-called svo. However, as practice has shown, most conscripts were forced to sign contracts with the Ministry of Attack of the Russian Federation and continue to fight against the Motherland. The head of Zaporizhzhia OVA Ivan Fedorov also in his Telegram notes that such conscripts are promised that they will serve in the military units of the occupied Crimea, Rostov Region and Krasnodar Territory. -There is no faith in promises - at the beginning of the occupation Gauleiter Balytsky already promised a 5-year moratorium on service in the Russian army for citizens of the TOT. As expected, he lied,- writes Ivan Fedorov. And he adds that residents of captured territories who were forced to join the enemy army can turn to the state project -I want to live- to voluntarily surrender to captivity and save his life. But even without these facts listed above, in Ukraine they remember very well who in February 2022 fought together with the Russians against our country. These were residents of the temporarily occupied Luhansk region and Donetsk region. And this is a clear example of what fate awaits every Ukrainian if his hometown is captured by the enemy. As joked one recently from bloggers on Facebook, -10 thousand mobilized Ukrainians in the occupied territories for 2024. Conflicts with the military commissars of the Russian Federation have not been recorded. Somehow it is.'' And indeed, in those territories, something is not observed in the social networks of a stream of angry posts against the bad employees of the Russian military commissars and their arbitrariness. And knowing the appetites of the Russian imperial machine, we can say with confidence that the fact about 10,000 conscripted Ukrainians last year can only be the beginning.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/02/ne-hochesh-voyuvaty-za-ukrayinu-voyuvatymesh-za-rosiyu-10-tysyach-ukrayincziv-z-tot-pryzvaly-na-sluzhbu-do-armiyi-rf/	2025-02-01T20:56:48-08:00
Under Pokrovsk, the enemy is hidden by -Gradams- in tandem with the Romanian APR-40 systems: a repor...	-My reactive artillery battery reports directly to the brigade commander, we execute commands through the brigade artillery chief and the combined fire support department. In the Pokrovsky direction, we carry out combat tasks in a non-stop mode, in fact continuously. We have domestic 122-mm BM-21 -Grad- rocket launchers and Romanian APR-40 in our arsenal. The Romanian rocket launcher is practically an analogue of the Grad, which also uses Soviet-style 122 mm shells. Firing from jet systems is always a demoralizing weapon for the enemy. We cover the specified area with volley fire and blow everything there -to fluff and dust.- We destroy control points, warehouses of heavy armored vehicles, weapons and warehouses with ammunition in the depth of the enemy's battle formations. Now it is very hot in the Pokrovsky direction, the occupiers are advancing in small assault groups. We destroy rashists in shelters, fortifications and in places of haste. No one survives there after our righteous fire. In this way, we stop the advance of the enemy's infantry in the zone of responsibility of our brigade. On the day when a large number of Russian attack aircraft are destroyed, the enemy no longer advances in that direction. After all, they need time to prepare new -kamikaze-. Depending on the projectiles, we can attack the enemy at a distance of up to 40 km, mostly we work at a distance of 20-30 km. The crews of the Grad and APR-40 jet systems are in constant combat readiness for use. So that you understand, for example, the time from taking an unprepared position to starting fire is only 3 minutes. Of course, it takes much more time to aim at the target, for example, on -Hrad- up to 15-20 minutes. Before that, air reconnaissance finds out what needs to be destroyed, the command determines the priority of the defeat and passes it on to us. One -pack- of rockets is 40 shots in 30 seconds. Any volley fire system has the possibility that projectiles fall with a certain dispersion, forming a so-called dispersion ellipse. So, we can cover an area of ​​4 hectares with fire. Of course, the largest concentration of projectiles will fall closer to the center of this ellipse and form a zone of stable damage. That is, everything that is in this area is actually destroyed. Under the conditions, if there is not, for example, some kind of powerful underground shelter. The other day we got the coordinates of the target: somewhere 20 km from the contact line, the Rashists had created a field ammunition depot, it was well camouflaged, but our aerial scouts still found it. We were hit by several shells, there was an explosion, oh how beautiful, they said that for several hours shrapnel from ammunition flew around. And once in Zaporozhye, when they were carrying out combat missions, they managed to destroy the command post of a regiment of the Russian Armed Forces. Russian officers worked there, there were many of them. They put a whole -package- of -Hrad- shells there. Another telling story for the enemy to get out of our land. One day the Rashists were advancing on motorcycles, their infantry had to quickly reach the plantation and establish themselves there. Our calculation worked effectively and covered the advance of the occupiers. It was 7 or 8 motorcycles that were blown to shreds. You yourself understand that the salvo fire of a jet system is not a single shell of 152 mm or 155 mm barrel artillery caliber. Maximum damage and destruction of everything around - this allows you to effectively inflict losses on the Russians. What we really need is more shells. The most popular are high-explosive fragments. We want to destroy the enemy much more and drive him out of our land forever. The enemy has the upper hand in the sky. Russian Zala, SuperCam and Lancets are constantly in the air. Therefore, we choose positions for striking with caution, and if we fire from closed firing positions, we try to mask them well, cars, of course, in caponiers. Strict compliance with safety measures. There is no way without it now. We install -anti-lance- protection, an anti-drone net, plus a EW works on the installation. What else is very important in our daily combat work. The ZU-23-2 anti-aircraft installation constantly leaves with us for cover. It works at a distance of 50-100 meters from our systems. -Zenitka- is capable of hitting air targets at heights of up to 2.5 km. If there is a need to shoot down FPV drones, then the artrocalculations are connected with automatic machines. EW tools do not always effectively suppress the work of Lancets. Plus, katsaps already use -fpvishki- on optical fiber. This is a problem and something needs to be done about it. In terms of technical characteristics and capabilities, the Romanian MLRS is almost indistinguishable from the work of our BM-21 -Grad-. Depending on the projectiles, the range of fire is the same, the capabilities of the machine are the same. The only difference is the aiming speed. On -Hrad- the calculation is done faster than on the Romanian installation. There are no questions at all about the accuracy and destruction of racist targets. What is the working principle of the Grad anti-aircraft missile system and the APR-40? Conventionally speaking, the enemy advances or makes a breakthrough to our positions on the front edge. Calculations of combat vehicles of the battery immediately leave for the firing positions. We set the compass, determine the main direction of fire based on these coordinates, which are provided by aerial scouts. We launch the -Nettle- system software. To work with -Kropyva-, you only need to know the coordinates of the targets and locations of your artillery battery, weather conditions. The data is entered into a tablet, then the boys automatically calculate the direction of fire and the distance to the target. All. We are waiting for the command to open fire. As soon as such a command arrives, we open fire, and after the -breakdown-, let's say so, we assemble and quickly leave the positions. So that the enemy does not catch us. Shoot and run tactics. Our work is similar to the work of the Hymers. Only the American systems are more powerful and hit at a much greater distance.- -Before the large-scale invasion of the Russian Federation, he lived with his family in Irpen, Kyiv region. He worked in a logistics company, the last position was the manager of warehouse logistics. In total, I had 12 warehouses under my command throughout the territory of Ukraine. On the fourth day after the start of the great war, he barely managed to get his wife and children out of the city, and he himself got out on the ninth day. Went out with the dog on foot through the woods. I watched all sorts of things. After the liberation of Kyiv region from the occupiers, he returned home. Housing had to be restored. When enemies came from Buchi, our residential complex on the outskirts of the city was the first of the houses to come under fire. Finished all my work matters, later received a summons and to the army. BZVP took place in -Desna-, before that he did not serve in the army. At the educational center, they looked at me, they saw that I am an adequate person, I have an education, I have a lot of experience working in large teams. They offered to join the artillery. The 117th brigade was being formed just at the training ground. Got into a jet artillery unit. Performed the duties of a scout-rangefinder. I am the kind of person who wants to know and be able to do everything, I learned a lot on my own in artillery work, studied the operation of the -Nettle- system, raised money on my own and bought myself a -Mavik-, flew other UAVs as well. In short, I took up anything useful in our work. The brigade artillery chief noticed me and dragged me to the joint fire support section, where artillery fire control is carried out. I took the position of staff sergeant. Managed unmanned systems in the department. Received the rank of officer. Then he was appointed commander of a reactive artillery battery. As soon as the position became vacant, they told me: -Your battery, your guys, you know everyone.- You will go as a combatant-. In principle, it doesn't matter to me in what position to beat the occupiers. The main thing is to do it efficiently and to the benefit of the state,- says Ilya with the nickname -Nazhdak-. -In our battery, all the guys are charged and extremely motivated to destroy the enemy. When you reset the targets and give them the command to hit, they jump for joy. It is a great pleasure to lead such personnel,- adds the battery commander.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/02/pid-pokrovskom-voroga-kryyut-gradamy-u-tandemi-z-rumunskymy-systemamy-apr-40-reportazh-armiyainform/	2025-02-01T20:40:13-08:00
The first is real: construction of a full-fledged aircraft carrier has begun in Turkey	As stated in the information of the Turkish portal SavunmaSanayiST with reference to the Ministry of National Defense of the Republic, the sheet metal cutting ceremony for the national aircraft carrier MÜGEM, the national submarine MİLDEN and the air defense combat destroyer TF-2000 took place in the command of Istanbul Shipyard, reports ArmyInform. -Thus, the necessary practical solution to the construction of 3 different warships, which will advance the Turkish Navy one more step forward, was implemented,- the publication emphasized. The hull design of the MÜGEM (translated as -National Aircraft Carrier-) was developed with the help of a multidimensional optimization tool to improve compatibility with sea conditions and maneuverability. These functions, tested with the help of simulations, will allow the ship to move through the sea in the most efficient way. The special design of the bow of the ship provides fuel savings of 1.5%, and also increases privacy and operational efficiency by reducing underwater noise. According to the Army Recognition website, Ankara independently developed the Milli Uçak Gemisi (MÜGEM) aircraft carrier project. It should become the largest ship in the entire history of Turkish shipbuilding. The declared length is 285 meters, width is 72 meters, draft is 10.1 meters. Water tonnage is 60,000 tons. It is assumed that the ship will have a crew of no less than 800 personnel. For comparison, ships of a similar class - the British Queen Elizabeth has a displacement of 70,000. tons, and the French Charles de Gaulle - 42 thousand. tons The aircraft carrier is expected to reach a speed of 25 knots and have a range of 10,000 nautical miles at 14 knots. This is ensured by four LM2500 gas turbines from General Electric and two variable-pitch propellers for efficient maneuverability. The aircraft carrier is designed in the STOBAR configuration (-short take-off from the springboard, landing on the air finisher-). Meanwhile, American aircraft carriers are being built in the CATOBAR configuration (catapult-assisted take-offs and aerial finisher landings). MÜGEM will have three launch sites. Two are for take-off and one is for landing aircraft. A launch catapult (a device for launching aircraft from a small platform, ship or vessel) has not yet been planned. Instead, the ship has a springboard (an inclined ramp curved upwards, which allows the aircraft to take off with a shortened run). However, this design is only part of the conceptual model of the new ship. Later, the springboard will be replaced by a flat deck and catapult when Turkey gets its own developed catapult system. As the name suggests, MÜGEM is to be built almost entirely without foreign components. The goal is to create an aircraft carrier that is 80 percent Turkish-made components and materials. It is possible that Turkey will want to design an electromagnetic catapult for MÜGEM. Such launch systems are successors to conventional steam catapults and are used by the US on the aircraft carrier Gerald Ford and by China on the Fujian. As indicate experts of the IKK Defense Express (DE) defense portal, MÜGEM will have an air wing with up to 50 aircraft devices But against the background of the lack of a full-fledged deck fighter, its composition will not be entirely traditional. The only manned aircraft will be the combat version of the Hürjet trainer, which has rather limited combat capabilities. But it will be compensated by drones: reconnaissance-strike TB3 and -Currently, the aircraft carrier will be equipped with a springboard, but in the future there are plans to equip it with a catapult. The latter can open the possibility to diversify the composition of the air group, in particular thanks to a special version of the national fighter KAAN. It is worth noting that the construction dates of MÜGEM remain unannounced, but are most likely planned somewhere in the 20s-30s,- DE noted. MÜGEM will not only have armed planes and drones, but will also be equipped with weapons. The corresponding systems should mainly be used to defend against air and sea attacks. It is planned to install the MiDLAS missile launch system with 32 launchers containing anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles. In addition, the project envisages 4 Gökdeniz systems. This is an analogue of the American Phalanx system, which is detailed in one of its materials told our publication. Each of the 35 mm Gökdeniz guns has its own radar, which allows autonomously hitting air targets at short distances if necessary. These include drones and cruise missiles and other incoming missiles. There are also 6 Aselsan STOP units. These are 25mm automatic guns. Combat modules can automatically track targets using optical image recognition. Turkey now has only one -conditional- aircraft carrier in its fleet: TCG Anadolu. And this is a landing ship in general. It is identical to the Spanish flagship -Juan Carlos I-, so it was not designed in Turkey. With a displacement of 27,000 tons, it is half the size of MÜGEM. In theory, it can still be used as an aircraft carrier if the hangar is reconfigured to accommodate aircraft. Initially, it was planned that up to 10 American F-35Bs would be placed on the ship. This is a version of a stealth fighter with a vertical takeoff. Given that, in addition to the Anadolu, Turkey plans to have another similar Trakya ship in its -line-up-, together with the MÜGEM, this will formally expand the aircraft carrier capabilities of the Turkish Navy to three ships. For comparison, Italy has only the 35,000-ton Cavour, France has the aforementioned Charles de Gaulle, and only Great Britain has two Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers. At the same time, the area of ​​responsibility of European states is much wider than in Turkey. In conditions where any attack by another state on Turkey, as a NATO country, is excluded with almost 99% probability, the appearance of a full-fledged aircraft carrier in its fleet indicates the growth of foreign policy ambitions and the further use of such a ship as a tool of -power projection- and foreign political influence Turkey.

Fantasy palmistry: Russian absurdity about lengthening life lines on the palms of conscripts	Seriously. It's not even a joke. They really wrote it. According to the version of Russian -experts- on telegrams, in a Kharkiv private clinic, for $3,000, you can perform an operation that -guarantees a long life.- Because, you see, Ukrainians are so superstitious that instead of normal medicine they decided to rely on surgical intervention in their own palms. After this procedure, as the Russians claim, -patients get a longer life line, which seems to increase their chances of returning from the front.- 1. -REN TV- level fiction This is not even a new fake - similar -stories- appear from time to time in East Asian countries, where palmistry still has some popularity. But in Ukraine, where medical science is developed at a level higher than that of the Russians (who still treat -DNA changes after vaccination-), such things look like a blatant absurdity. 2. Military conscription and -plastic surgery- Let's imagine: a man receives a summons, but instead of collecting documents or passing a medical examination, he carries $3,000 to a private clinic to have an additional incision made on his palm. Well, yes, this is obviously a more logical option than simply serving or going abroad, as the same Russians like to describe it. 3. Phantom clinic No specific name of the clinic, no address, no real feedback. Just -in Kharkiv-, -sources report-. Although the sources seem to be somewhere in the Kremlin between the seventh and eighth shot of vodka. 4. It doesn't work at all Any doctor, even a Russian one, will tell you that surgery on the palm of your hand does not change life expectancy in any way. Because this is not mysticism, but physiology. But in a country where people still believe in -magical biofields- and -energy cleansing- from Kadyrov, apparently, such theories are valid. Comic absurdity aside, this fake has a clear purpose: Russian propaganda is so desperate that it just makes up fakes -on the fly- without even making any effort to make them believable. Unfortunately, the next step will probably be even more absurd. Maybe soon they will say that in Ukraine conscripts are transplanted with a frog's heart for -greater endurance-, or that in Lviv Oblast they developed a ritual of -protection against the draft- with the help of lard and embroidery? Well, we are waiting for new -masterpieces- from Russian information dumps.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/02/fentezi-hiromantiya-rosijskyj-absurd-pro-podovzhennya-linij-zhyttya-na-dolonyah-vijskovozobovyazanyh/	2025-02-01T20:11:22-08:00

Volodymyr Zelenskyi: Every Russian drone or missile is made up of components from other countries	He expressed this opinion during his evening video address on Saturday, February 1. -We must always be completely honest about such Russian terror: they would not have managed to inflict such damage on their own, so intensively and literally every night. Every Russian -shakhed- and every Russian missile are components produced by other countries. One hundred and sixty-five strike units in one night strike of Russia - all these -Iskanders-, -calibers- and other means of killing - are hundreds and even thousands of components from other countries. European countries, China and even America,- the head of state said. According to him, without such critical components, the Kremlin regime -will not have any opportunity to disrupt the lives of other peoples.- -Therefore, it is critically important that the sanctions are really strong and that they cannot be circumvented under any circumstances. There should be no way to supply Russia with critical components for defense production. Violation of sanctions should be interpreted as complicity in the war, and whoever helps destroy life should be held accountable,- the President emphasized. He also added that Ukraine is currently working to attract even more resources from partners to strengthen its air shield. -Protection against shelling is an absolute priority. Much remains to be done, but every partner of ours in the world who helps it is a lifesaver. And this is exactly what everyone in the world should think about now: about life, about joint work, about pressure on the aggressor and about the approach of real peace. Peace that Russia will not give. A peace to which they can only be pressed. We will press on!-, Volodymyr Zelenskyi assured. &nbsp; As reported by ArmyInform, the number of victims of the Russian attack on a high-rise building in Poltava increased to eight people.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/01/volodymyr-zelenskyj-kozhen-rosijskyj-dron-chy-raketa-cze-komponenty-z-inshyh-krayin/	2025-02-01T10:55:57-08:00

Video with another sample of -military equipment- of the so-called -second army of the world- released 32 separate mechanized brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. -Enemy equipment, which has no analogues, is mercilessly destroyed. The occupiers are forced to resort to using stolen motoblocks, but even this time they did not reach their final destination,- Ukrainian fighters note. As can be seen in the released footage, when one of the invaders noticed the approach of the FPV drones, he immediately jumped out of his vehicle, because it was moving so slowly that the only chance for him to survive was to flee on foot. However, his henchman was less lucky, because as a result of being hit by a drone, he was left lying next to a motoblock that had been stolen somewhere. -That's why it hurts, and that's why it's fun,- Ukrainian soldiers commented on their video. As reported by ArmyInform, the soldiers of the DSHV told how in the very first battle they captured immediately six occupants.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/01/tomu-bolno-a-tomu-prykolno-okupanty-namagalysya-nalagodyty-logistyku-za-dopomogoyu-motobloka/	2025-02-01T08:20:58-08:00

He added that the 142nd brigade is replenished with mobilized, contract workers, to a lesser extent servicemen who wish to transfer, as well as those who left the service but decided to return: -The main part of the replenishment consists of mobilized.

Shelter, darkness, panicked flight - nothing saves the invaders from the aiming work of Ukrainian drones. Accurate blows make the enemy run away, but they are not destined to escape retribution. Every explosion is minus one occupier, every attack is another proof that in this war the technology and skill of Ukrainian soldiers are superior to the Soviet methods of -meat assaults-. As reported by ArmyInform, the fighters of the 23rd brigade once again demonstrated the high efficiency of using FPV drones, destroying manpower and enemy fortifications.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/01/nichni-myslyvczi-ukrayinski-dronari-pokazaly-yak-nyshhat-vorozhu-pihotu-v-temryavi/	2025-02-01T05:52:46-08:00

In total, the radio engineering troops of the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine detected and escorted 165 enemy air targets: Anti-aircraft missile units, EW devices and mobile fire groups of the Air Force and the Defense Forces of Ukraine were involved in repelling the enemy air attack. According to preliminary data, 56 -Shahed- strike UAVs/simulator drones of various types were shot down, another 61 UAVs did not reach their targets (lost in location). Some of the enemy's cruise missiles were destroyed by anti-aircraft defense. A significant part of the missiles, due to the active opposition of the Defense Forces, did not reach their goals. However, there are also injuries, in particular, missiles that enter the target on a ballistic trajectory. Detailed information on enemy missiles has not yet been made public. As a result of the Russian strike, civilian objects and objects of critical infrastructure were hit by missiles and attack UAVs. Hitting a residential building in Poltava by an Kh-22 missile, shelling the historic center of Odessa with -ballistics- is yet another evidence of the barbarism and terrorism of the Russian leadership. Also, on the night of February 1, the enemy attacked Ukrainian enterprises and objects of the Ukrainian energy infrastructure in the Zaporizhia, Odesa, Sumy, Kharkiv, Khmelnytskyi, and Kyiv regions. The Air Force continues to perform the task of protecting the airspace of the country. We express our condolences to the families of the victims and the victims.

After that, he did not stop, asked the command and went to study engineering, becoming an instructor in this specialization. -I served two years in the infantry, felt what it was like to be at ground zero.- And now that we fly drones, it helps the infantry.

But in addition to the important work that directly affects combat results, he talks about the team spirit in the Presidential Brigade. -There is an adequate command here, the guys and I understand each other half a word. You can turn to the commander, and he will listen to you, support you, help you if necessary. This is what allows us to work harmoniously and efficiently,- he adds.

He does not blame them, but gives them a chance to adapt to the war, improve their skills and help at the front. It is his duty not only to carry out combat tasks, but also to pass on knowledge to the younger generation, who will defend Ukraine in the near future. -We will show, teach. I have three children, a wife. I also want to see my children grow up. But nothing, we have no way back, we have to fight to victory. And the victory will be ours anyway, because there is no other way,- concludes Sirko, clearly aware of the importance of his mission.

I neutralized and wounded one of the opponents. Later, the wounded man died,- says -Jack-. At some point, the occupiers began to convince our fighters to stop resisting, claiming that all this was allegedly -just politics-, but when they realized that all this was useless, insults and intimidation started. However, no matter what threats the Russians expressed towards the Ukrainian military, it still did not help them in any way. -They started throwing away their weapons when they realized they had no chance&#8230; Then the last attack aircraft came down to us and we already started tying and packing them,- the guys said.

-A bullet stuck in a bulletproof vest-: an incredible story of a fighter with the call sign -Murchik...	The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. His first battles took place in a volunteer unit, although Maxim himself does not like to mention it. Already in the composition of the 58th brigade, he went through numerous fierce battles, including defensive and offensive battles. In one of the hottest places - the village of Urozhany in Donetsk region - he destroyed a Russian tank from the NLAW complex, and together with his brothers captured a group of invaders. Maxim says that during one of the battles, he and his brothers were waiting for an assault group that was supposed to attack the enemy's position in the hangar. However, everything did not go according to plan: during the landing of the attack aircraft, the Russians opened fire, as a result of which one fighter was killed and three others were injured. Despite the loss, the operation had to continue. So the only fighter left from the assault group turned to Maxim and his comrades with a request for help. -He said that there were no more than five Russians in the hangar. I replied that I couldn't storm, and he reassured me: -I can't either, but we'll manage.- And we left,- the fighter recalls. In fact, there were 15 enemies in the room. However, Maxim and his comrades gave them a fight: several were eliminated, seven were taken prisoner. Three more Russian commanders, armed with a machine gun, remained inside. Maxim decided to act by trickery - he took one of the prisoners and returned with him to the hangar to convince the rest of the enemies to surrender. But when they got close, the Russians opened fire. The prisoner was wounded, and Maxim himself hid behind a concrete column, waiting for the enemy to run out of ammunition. -When they shot the ammunition, they ran away. I looked at myself - a bullet from a Kalashnikov machine gun was sticking out of my bulletproof vest: it pierced the phone and got stuck in the plate,- says Maksym. Later, among the prisoners, it turned out that they were also from the 58th, but Russian brigade. The oldest of them is 62 years old, a former prisoner who spent 48 years behind bars. The youngest is 19 and was a conscript. They warned of a planned assault on Ukrainian military positions by 500 militants. And the fighters themselves had only two stores for each. So Maxim returned to the hangar again to collect the enemy's ammunition. In the end, the assault never took place, and the unit was changed. However, the trials for Maxim did not end there. In one of the battles, when he aimed a missile complex with a laser beam at an enemy tank, the occupiers managed to fire first. The shell exploded ten meters from him, covering it with earth. His brothers pulled him out from under the rubble. During another battle near Urozhany, he was wounded by an enemy drone attack. After a month in the hospital, he returned to service and continues to fight.

She was preparing an explosion near the building of the special service: a detained Russian agent	The Security Service of Ukraine informs about this. This location is currently not being used by secret service personnel who have been redeployed to back-up work stations for the duration of a full-scale invasion. However, a potential terrorist attack could have resulted in large casualties among civilian passers-by in the central part of the city. At the scene of the incident, the detainee found a bag in which there was an improvised explosive device with a capacity of 7 kg in TNT equivalent. Such a charge is enough to seriously damage the building and cause fatal damage to people around the epicenter of the explosion. According to the case materials, the Rashists remotely recruited a 22-year-old drug addict from Lviv, who was looking for -quick- money on Telegram channels, to prepare a terrorist attack. On the instructions of the occupiers, the girl came to Kyiv, where her Russian curator rented an apartment for her in the city center in advance. After moving into temporary housing, she picked up a mini-surveillance camera via courier and installed it on the balcony. With the help of remote access, the enemy was able to monitor the central street of Kyiv in online mode and thus wanted to record the consequences of the terrorist attack. Employees of the SBU worked in advance and arrested the perpetrator -in the act- when she took a bag with an explosive device from a hiding place and headed to a rented apartment. During the search, a mobile phone was additionally seized from the detainee, which she used to communicate with the Russian special service. So far, the investigators of the Security Service have notified the suspect of suspicion under several articles of the Criminal Code of Ukraine: ch. 2 Art. 111 (treason committed under martial law); h 1 Art. 14, ch. 2 Art. 258 (preparation for the commission of a terrorist act committed by a group of persons with a prior conspiracy); h 1 Art. 263 (unlawful handling of arms, ammunition or explosives). The perpetrator is in custody. She faces up to life in prison with forfeiture of property. Urgent comprehensive measures are underway to bring to justice all persons involved in the planning and preparation of the terrorist attack. The special operation was conducted under the procedural guidance of the Prosecutor General's Office. As reported by ArmyInform, in Cherkaschyna, a suspect of working for the Russian Federation, who was preparing strikes, was detained in the places of deployment of the Defense Forces, but failed in its mission, falling into the hands of the Security Service of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/01/gotuvala-vybuh-bilya-budivli-speczsluzhby-zatrymana-agentka-rf/	2025-02-01T01:29:16-08:00

But there are cases when storming enemy groups are selected: that is, from units that are not directly against us, but those that specifically come in to carry out storming operations. They are quite well equipped and trained,- the serviceman noted. He added that the more enemy assaults there are, the more the enemy wants to surrender: -Because they don't have much motivation, especially local mobilized (drafted into the Russian army - ed.). Therefore, it is possible to capture them. They then tell us that their task is to go to a certain point and from there wave the drone, show that they have arrived, and wait for reinforcements when the next group has to go forward. But, as a rule, they are all destroyed and do not wait for the next group.- Earlier ArmyInform reported that in the Kupyan direction, the enemy begins assaults, releasing ill-prepared infantry at the positions of the Defense Forces, in order to detect our firing positions.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/01/bez-motyvacziyi-na-toreczkomu-napryamku-pozycziyi-zsu-shturmuyut-meshkanczi-donechchyny-ta-luganshhyny-yakyh-mobilizuvala-armiya-rf/	2025-02-01T01:01:19-08:00

He willingly shared the details of his -business trip- to the war, and his words were once again confirmed: the Russian command views its soldiers as cannon fodder. -I didn't know where I was being taken,- said the captive. According to the prisoner, he was in SIZO-2 in Kuibyshev (Novosibirsk region). No one informed him about a possible -business trip- to the front and did not allow him to sign any documents. -On November 14, 2024, I was sent by stage. I didn't know where I was going. On the way, other prisoners have already explained that we were heading to the Tolmachiv airport at the RDSU (Russian volunteer special service), -he said. He was never issued documents, a military ID, or a passport. From Rostov Zecs were loaded into military trucks and transported to the 74th Motorized Rifle Brigade. The command in the brigade consisted of former prisoners who mocked the new arrivals, beat them and took personal belongings. Already at the front line, it became clear that new recruits were being used as cannon fodder without the right to retreat. -We were told to take the stronghold, throw grenades at it and hold it. On the way, those who had already fought said that it was suicide. We are going in the same direction, and we are all crazy. We are all corpses,- admitted the captive. As reported by ArmyInform, the 155th separate mechanized brigade of the -Anna Kyivska- Armed Forces performs combat tasks on the Pokrovsky direction.

-Communal apocalypse- in the Luhansk region: the infrastructure was on the verge of collapse due to ...	The head of the Luhansk Regional Military Administration, Artem Lysogor, reported this on his page. . At the same time, the occupiers do not take into account the destruction they caused during the storming of the cities of the region in 2022. Then the infrastructure of Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, Rubizhny, Kreminnaya, Girsky, Zoloty and Popasnaya was completely destroyed or badly damaged. In fact, this is a confirmation of many years of ignoring any major repairs. Instead of modernization, the occupation authorities only charged local residents for water, electricity, gas, and heat without investing in system maintenance. For almost 11 years of occupation, the occupation administration only exploited the infrastructure left by Ukraine, without thinking about its renewal. Now, when it is in a critical state, the residents of the temporarily occupied territories are threatened with a real communal collapse. What does this mean for local people?

What UAVs are capable of on fiber optics: ArmiyaInform report on drone testing	We immediately noticed the pilot Tatiana with the call sign -Red-. The woman was constantly checking whether the drone was connected correctly, whether there was a video signal and whether everything was ready for the demonstration flight. — We use optical fiber in these drones to counter enemy EW, says Ruda. - Our goal is not to give the enemy the opportunity to muffle the fiber-optic control system, and this allows radio masking of the crews. Tatiana says that the absence of problems with radio interference provides high-quality communication from the point of take-off of the drone until it hits the target. - Our fiber optic FPVs can fly as far as the coil will allow. Currently available in 3, 5, 10 and 15 km. However, we plan to integrate larger ones so that the drone can fly 50 km, the pilot added. Meanwhile, one of the representatives of the -Sky Hub- school talked in detail about how to properly connect the optical fiber to the drone. - The assembly takes 30 minutes in total, followed by the setup procedure on the laptop. If there are ready-made settings, then it will take three minutes, if it is a complete setup process, then it will be 30 minutes. A very important stage is the testing of the drone. The pilot should fly it first without load, then with a load, give feedback so that the drone improves and is ready for use on the front, the military noted. He also emphasizes that the quality of the optical fiber is an extremely important issue, because it depends on them how high the rate of damage to the target by the drone will be. It is not only small FPV drones that are integrated under optical fiber. Recently, large bombers, or as they are also called -mothers-, have also been following this path. - In fact, optical fiber is a control system and can be integrated into all front-line drones except the Mavic. The advantage of such a solution for large bombers is that the reel, for example, weighs 3.2 kg, maybe less. If this can be significant for an FPV drone, then for our -mothers- it means simply taking one less projectile, - says Dmytro. — Bomber payload is 21 kg for every 10 km. Maybe it will fly a little shorter distance, but that's normal. In addition, the man noted that when the coil ends, the drone simply releases it and the UAV returns on its channels or azimuth to the point from which it took off.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/01/na-shho-zdatni-bpla-na-optovolokni-reportazh-armiyainform-z-testuvannya-droniv/	2025-01-31T20:47:33-08:00
About superiority in information warfare, support of front-line media and the project -Press officer...	—Mr. Serhiy, what, in your opinion, has changed in Ukrainian journalism, the national information space since the beginning of Russia's large-scale invasion of Ukraine? — I note that Ukrainian journalism began to transform even after the events of 2013-2014. She has changed a lot. After all, the concepts of war, hostilities, the need to repel the occupiers on the battlefield - these topics, difficult topics, have been in the Ukrainian media since 2014. But from the moment of a large-scale enemy invasion, every media person, in one way or another, has already become a war journalist from the point of view of fulfilling his duties. Because it was always necessary to take into account the increased danger in which our entire society is, within which our reporters have to work. And, accordingly, the agenda of the Ukrainian media from February 2024 is really determined by the factors that the priority should be topics that help Ukrainians to save lives, to unite in order to repel the occupiers. Topics related to coverage of the exploits of Ukrainian heroes and the Defense Forces in general. At the same time, it must be said that a radical restructuring took place in the activities and the very existence of the domestic media in a situation of increased danger, as well as in the conditions of the destruction of the unstable market of Ukrainian mass media, unstable financial income. Today, they define our information field. Unfortunately, we are saying that hundreds of Ukrainian media and thousands of journalists have stopped their activities both due to economic factors and factors related to the war and the occupation. Accordingly, it must be stated that Ukrainians' access to independent sources of information, in particular regional information, is unfortunately decreasing in Ukraine. But on the other hand, actually, in Ukraine, hundreds and hundreds of already experienced military personnel continue their daily work, professionally covering defense topics and providing objective current information from anywhere in Ukraine. But, of course, the key point that unites us and our colleagues from the international media of the democratic world is the existential challenge. Because Russia sees journalists and the media as a threat to its military offensive, a threat to its propaganda. Propaganda is an integral part of Russia's insidious aggression. So, here we see that this is also a certain battlefield for both Ukrainian and international media to protect their standards and values, which are defining for us, and the freedom for which our soldiers are currently fighting on the front. —Indeed, today hostilities are taking place not only on the fronts of the Russian-Ukrainian war, but also in the information space. In your opinion, on whose side is the advantage in these duels? What do Ukrainian media representatives benefit from, and where are we still failing? — Of course, we currently have a large-scale information war with the enemy. And here we still cannot say that we are on the same level as the Russians. And today in Ukraine, the majority of domestic media still do not receive significant state support for their existence and development. Here, of course, there is an objective factor: in wartime, the priority of state budget spending is directed to the support of the Defense Forces, because they must be provided with everything they need. But at the same time, it would be important for the Ukrainian government to loudly call on international partners to strongly support Ukrainian media so that there is stability in their reporting. Because if we talk about the professional quality of domestic mass media, it is at a high level: both nationally and regionally. And, accordingly, thorough journalistic materials - investigations, reports - they expose the fakes and lies of Russian propagandists. But, again, it is not enough for newsrooms to compete on the information field by themselves. The support of the Ukrainian media space is necessary. We say that the Ukrainian media will benefit from courageous, objective reports from the frontline. Representatives of our mass media document war crimes, so these objective materials are taken into account by international institutions, governments, and international media. Therefore, we say that Ukrainian media really win here, and we are visible. When we talk to our foreign partners and compare Ukrainian materials about the war with reports from frontline reporters of leading international media outlets, we again see the same level and the same expertise. Yes, they paint a terrible picture of the war, but we do not plunge into some primitive counter-propaganda, which would simply be a direct reflection of Russian propaganda. So it's still somewhat of a victory that we've been able to stay truthful in our coverage of these difficult events. Although, of course, the absolute priority for all journalists and the media should be the rule not to harm the Defense Forces and the Armed Forces of Ukraine. So, today, we see that our military mostly adheres to non-disclosure agreements regarding weapons, etc., so that the enemy does not use the mass media to plan their attacks. But, again, since the enemy is extremely powerful, it is difficult to conduct this duel without significant external support, both methodical and informational, analytical, and expert. - What projects did the National Union of Journalists of Ukraine start to implement in the conditions of a large-scale war, and why was it successful? - We completely restructured our activities. And, accordingly, the key priorities for us are both the issue of safety of journalists and the security of the media in general, as well as the search for resources for the survival of the media, for their sustainability. Among our initiatives, already after providing some kind of emergency aid, is mediation in providing journalists who escaped from temporarily occupied territories with financial support, assistance with equipment, as well as starting a network of journalistic solidarity centers. This is actually a network of small regional press hubs in separate regions of Ukraine. Initially, they were created in Western Ukraine. But at the moment, their activities are intensified in the front-line territories - these are Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipro. Within the framework of this network, we administer requests from journalists from all regions and from abroad, related to the provision of protective equipment for work on the front, with the receipt of equipment, with the receipt of psychological assistance. We organize seminars, trainings on physical safety, hand over first-aid kits. And, in fact, this is such a system of mutual assistance with the assistance of the National Union of Journalists of Ukraine, but with the basic support of the UNESCO headquarters, the International European Federation of Journalists and our various international partners. - One of the Union's activities now is the support of regional printed publications in the front-line and de-occupied areas. How important is this project? — Yes, in addition to the network of journalistic solidarity centers, our prominent task is the initiative to revive front-line newspapers. In the conditions when Russia is attacking infrastructure facilities, for thousands of Ukrainians living in the de-occupied territories or in areas close to the contact line, the print local media is often the only source of qualified and important information about their regions. The initiative of the Union is that we finance, again with the help of an international Japanese donation, the printing of the first issue of a local front-line newspaper as a restart of all processes in the circumstances of relocation, suspension of activities, etc. And then we recommend these projects to our other international partners for sustainable support. And, in fact, the result of such activity is the revival and support of 32 front-line newspapers. In particular, in Zaporizhzhia, Kherson, Mykolaiv, Donetsk, Sumy, Chernihiv regions. We understand that it is this network of front-line magazines, it is, perhaps, a newspaper information marathon that bridges the information deficit in regions where the National Telethon cannot technically reach. Get to places where Ukrainians do not have the opportunity to use the Internet or receive a TV and radio signal. This is our project of regional media lobbying both at the level of the government of Ukraine and at the level of international partners. Because it is often difficult for foreign donors to understand and see the contribution of journalists in the regions. - In continuation of this topic. Perhaps this is a trivial question, but periodically from the same volunteers who cooperate with international structures, we have to hear that partners from abroad are a little tired of the Ukrainian war: the international community is not so active in helping. At what expense do you manage to support this aid? — Indeed, we say that this is a general challenge for us, for the Union of Journalists of Ukraine, for other public organizations, and for the government to attract external support. Since the international organizations are somewhat tired of the war, one can say so. And on the other hand, this state of war between Russia and Ukraine and the state of conflict, according to their terminology, is no longer news for foreigners, it is no longer a stressful factor, as it was in 2022 from the moment of the invasion. And these are already certain realities. And that is why they are already shifting their gaze somewhere and are determined with certain priorities, switch to other countries, with other military conflicts. In particular, today many of our partners are paying attention to the Gaza Strip region, to the Middle East in general. Now the topic of the revolution and the liberation of Syria is gone. Yes, it is extremely difficult to attract high-level support to the Ukrainian media sector. But, on the other hand, despite the fact that we too are tired, we are exhausted, but we understand that we do not have the right to stop, we do not have the right to switch to any other topics at all. As long as this unjust war is going on in Ukraine, we increase our efforts, our activity: we inform the international community every day, prepare certain facts, report on the importance and effectiveness of aid. After all, let's take concrete facts: the same laptops handed over to Mariupol journalists. They allow colleagues to remain in the profession, to create materials that are necessary both for migrants from the Donetsk region and for informing the whole world. What unites and inspires us is the understanding that the resources, the help we attract, we proudly pass it on to our brave colleagues who work not in capital offices, not in quiet regional centers, but on the front lines. In particular, I admire the courage of the editor-in-chief of the newspaper -Vorskla- from Velika Pysarivka, in the Sumy region, Oleksiy Pasyuga, who lays out his so-called Route of Truth every week. Every week, he carries and distributes a freshly printed newspaper along the route from Okhtyrka, which is a relatively safe city, to Velika Pysarivka, on the border with Russia, leaving copies in village shops. I admire Svitlana Karpenko, who regularly brings copies of her newspaper to Orihiv, which is 2-3 kilometers from the contact line. And hundreds of residents of Orihiv, who live in basements without electricity, receive true and reliable information. I admire my colleagues from Kherson, Kramatorsk, Sloviansk, Pokrovsk and Myrnograd, who bring the truth to their fellow citizens. Such examples of dedication and courage of professional journalists are, in fact, the strongest arguments for us and for our efforts. And, of course, we cannot fail to mention another one of our priorities. This is a campaign of solidarity with Ukrainian journalists illegally imprisoned by Russia. We are making efforts to support the relatives and friends of our colleagues, whom Russia has unjustifiably thrown into its prisons, and to put pressure on international organizations with the aim of making efforts to release Ukrainian journalists from Russian prisons. After all, at least 30 Ukrainian media workers are currently in Russian prisons. At the same time, we have many of our colleagues who were detained by the occupiers in Zaporizhzhia, Kherson region, and their whereabouts are currently unknown. We also organize international photo exhibitions, such as -Freedom of Speech Shot-, which draws attention to our imprisoned colleagues. We make various printed reports, video materials. But, unfortunately, the key profile challenge in this war for the democratic world is that the aggressor country absolutely ignores all international rules and conventions that the Soviet Union and Russia ratified and integrated at one time. And on top of all that, Russia is slanderous, it makes -marks- on Ukrainian journalists that they are allegedly terrorists, subversives, spies, in order to discredit media workers in any way. But at the same time, we see that the civilized world clearly listens to the arguments of the Union of Journalists of Ukraine. We confirm the journalistic status of each of our colleagues. And we demand, of course, the dismissal of our colleagues. And the results are already there: the fact that Nariman Dzhelal was released in 2024 through exchange, and Maksim Butkevich, who was also released last year through exchange, is a certain contribution to this common cause and due to the efforts of NSJU activists. — Even before the first Russian attacks on Ukraine, many journalists served in the ranks of the Defense Forces in the ranks of the NSJU members. Already after 2014, and especially after 2022, military journalists were joined by mobilized communists. Do you lose touch with them? What is he like? — Of course, this is also one of our priorities — support for our comrades, our heroes, who are already performing their duties for the defense of Ukraine in various positions. And accordingly, both our regional organizations and the central office, we are also looking for volunteer resources to support our colleagues in the military. We also make a corporate contribution to the support of the Union of Journalists of Ukraine for the Defense Forces, and launched our initiative -Press officers are important!-. This is a direct joining of efforts to support colleagues who, in their ranks, organize information about our heroes and military operations. Which, in particular, provide escort of civilian journalists to frontline positions. And within the framework of such an initiative, we launched a special award of the Union of Journalists of Ukraine. This is such an honorable award from the multi-thousand-strong journalistic community to recognize the military work of press officers, about whom we receive the best feedback from civilian war-journalists who go to the front. And in 2024, Serhiy Cherevaty, Roman Chop, Ilya Yevlash, Serhiy Skibchyk, Kateryna Petrenko and other colleagues were among the first to receive this distinction. But, in addition to moral recognition, we also conduct fundraising campaigns and hand over vehicles to press officers. In particular, we also provided a car for Soledar's press service, once on the hottest Bakhmut route. And in 2024, we handed over a car for the press service of the 24th brigade. At that time, in May, the positions of the 24th Brigade were in New York, a Ukrainian village located a few kilometers from the contact line with the occupiers. Personally, it was a great honor for me, together with my colleagues, to come to the position in New York, hand over the car there and understand that it will really help the press service in its extremely responsible and dangerous work, both in terms of covering events from the front and accompanying civilian journalists, especially international filming groups Because we also understand that international support and great global solidarity with Ukraine largely depend on this. And in this unjust war, it happens precisely because the citizens of democratic countries will receive this terrible truth about the war, about its injustice, through their media. And, accordingly, they begin to demand from their governments to make efforts to properly support Ukraine. Recently, the NSJU has brought cooperation with the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine to a new level. Especially in the part of establishing effective communications between the Defense Forces and civilian media in matters of dissemination, additional attention to our army heroes, in general to the Ukrainian army. In particular, we regularly recommend publishing the best materials of the information agency ArmiyaInform in the leading regional media. These are portrait materials that add emotion and details to the images of Ukrainian soldiers and officers, our defenders. We also assist in collaboration between Army FM, Army Radio and the civilian media sector. The union conducts various activities to encourage civilian journalists and their editors to create more professional, in-depth materials on army topics, recruiting topics, army support topics, etc. So, we understand that the military media alone is not enough in informing to tell stories about all the realities that exist. Likewise, for the military, general public support is extremely important. We are very moved by the reviews when soldiers, officers are wisely remembered when their relatives, close people call them, say, from Sumy region, Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk and are proud of their relatives wrote a local newspaper or local journalists.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/01/pro-perevagu-v-informvijni-pidtrymku-pryfrontovyh-media-ta-proyekt-presoficzery-vazhlyvi-intervyu-z-golovoyu-naczspilky-zhurnalistiv/	2025-01-31T20:35:12-08:00
Blatant thefts of the fake state: when and from whom did Russia steal the coat of arms, flag and ant...	ArmyInform reminds of the most flagrant thefts of Russia, which it considers its -primordial-. The coat of arms of Russia is a double-headed eagle, which they -borrowed- according to the official version from the Byzantine Empire. According to another, no less popular, he was a legacy of the Golden Horde, because he was minted on their coins by Khans Uzbek (1283–1341), Janibek (d. 1357) and Aziz Sheikh (1365–1367). But it is more likely that this coat of arms became a trophy. It began to be used after the conquest of the Tver principality by Muscovy. Back in the 14th century, Tver was an implacable rival of Moscow for primacy in Zalissa, and the struggle between the Tver and Moscow princes for the khan label on the Grand Duchy of Volodymyr was very fierce. &nbsp; The double-headed eagle was on the coins and seal of the last prince of Tver, Mikhail Borisovich, issued in the 1470s. And already in 1497 (a few years after the conquest of Tver) he first appears on the state seal of the Moscow prince Ivan III, along with the title -prince of Tver-. The Russians got their tricolor from the Netherlands. The Dutch engineer David Butler, who oversaw the construction of the first Russian sailing ship -Orel- (a type of Dutch pinas), appealed to the Boyar Duma with a request -to ask His Royal Majesty for an order: which, as is the custom in other states, to raise on the ship a flag-. The king ordered to ask him, the butler, which is the custom in his country. Thus, the Dutch tricolor flew over -Orly-. According to another version, in 1693 Peter I ordered a Dutch-built frigate in Amsterdam. In 1694, when it arrived, the Dutch red-white-blue flag was flying on its stern, so the Tsar decided to declare it the trade flag of Russia. Soon, the Russian white-blue-red flags successfully misled the security of the Baltic Sea ports. They were simply confused with the Dutch&#8230; The basis of the modern Russian anthem is the song -Hymn of the Bolshevik Party-, which was written in the 1930s and glorified by Stalin. It was this work that later became the basis of the anthem of the USSR, which Putin returned with cosmetic changes in 2000. The author of the melody of the Bolshevik national anthem is the well-known plagiarist Oleksandr Alexandrov. Therefore, it is not surprising that this melody also turned out to be stolen, like everything else in Russia. The piece, which has now become Russia's national anthem, used a chord sequence from the -Canon in D major- by German Baroque composer Johann Pachelbel. Although, it is possible that Alexandrov took it from the later work of the Ukrainian composer Mykola Lysenko -Epic Fragment-. <iframe loading=-lazy- title=-Mykola Lysenko. Epic fragment.- width=-640- height=-360- src=-https://www.youtube.com/embed/WViX0X-1aNs?start=50&amp;feature=oembed- frameborder=-0- allow=-accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard -write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; referrerpolicy=-strict-origin-when-cross-origin- It is known that Aleksandrov borrowed from Ukrainians the melody of the song -Rise, rise, my people!-, known from the memoirs of Yuriy Stepovy, the brother of Kostya Pestushka, the leader of the anti-Bolshevik uprising of the Steppe Division. This song became popular during the Soviet-German war under the name -Holy War-. As we can see, Russia does not have its own coat of arms, flag and anthem. She stole them like everything else.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/01/krychushhi-kradizhky-derzhavy-fejk-koly-i-v-kogo-rosiya-vkrala-svij-gerb-prapor-i-gimn/	2025-01-31T20:22:23-08:00
Zradophilia Undoes, or Why Video Confessions About Mass Waste From Positions Is Fake	Another -investigation- of the Kremlin's fake agents is the -sensational confession- of the Ukrainian military about the alleged lack of rotations and massive waste from positions. A deepfake video, where some unknown fighters in -pixels- complain about the command, is already circulating in the Russian public. In the video, you can see a group of -Ukrainian military personnel- (although half of them wear Russian-style armored personnel carriers), who complain to the camera: -We have been sitting here without rotations for a year, we are not allowed to leave,- -The command has abandoned us,- -The Armed Forces of Ukraine is falling apart, guys just go-&#8230; One of the -fighters- even declares that his unit is -forced to leave their positions- because -they were betrayed.- 1. Deepfake - but not deep The voices of the characters in the video are superimposed on a separate track, in some places the desynchronization of lips and sound is visible. The conclusion is that either the Russians took an old video and re-edited it, or they used artificial intelligence, but again -saved-. 2. -Fighters- without faces and with strange chevrons Everyone in the video has their faces covered - some in balaclavas, some just in the shadows. But something else is interesting - one -military- unit has a chevron on his sleeve&#8230; up a drigue. Another one has it sewn on the other way around. 3. Phrases that the Ukrainian military will never say: -They have left us, no one is changing us- - the Ukrainian military clearly understands the system of rotations, and it is unlikely that they will -complain- about it to the camera for TG channels. -The command abandoned us- - the Ukrainian army is famous for the fact that the commanders fight alongside their subordinates, unlike the Russians, where the -mob- and the commander are two different castes. -We have nothing to fight- - well, except for the tens of thousands of drones, Leopards, artillery, and MSRW that somehow destroy Russian equipment every day. 4. Why are there -no rotations-? For some reason, the Russians do not explain how -the military is sitting without rotations- when literally every day there are official videos about the rotations of units in different areas of the front. But who cares about real facts when you can invent another betrayal? Russia is again trying to attack not only with drones, but also with fakes, but, as always, in a clumsy, primitive way and with a lack of understanding of how the real Ukrainian military works. Zradophilia is canceled, the video is in the furnace, and thanks should not be given to Russian fake generators, but to our infantrymen, artillerymen and drones, who do everything every day so that Russian mobs no longer have to -complain- about anything. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/01/zradofiliya-skasovuyetsya-abo-chomu-video-ziznannya-pro-masovi-vidhody-z-pozyczij-cze-fejk/	2025-01-31T20:01:29-08:00
Defense purchases under control: the MoU assured that there are no supply disruptions	As ArmiyaInform correspondent reports, during a briefing on January 31, Brigadier General Serhiy Bulavko, the head of the Main Department of Defense Procurement Control, announced this. -Contracting is done with us, there is a financial resource to allow it to be done. We do not have any obstacles regarding the proper, rhythmic, timely supply of this or that weapon of military equipment,- Serhii Bulavko commented. He added: -Percentage wise, of those transition contracts from 2024 to 2025, 55% are the weapons and military equipment that were contracted in 2024 and will be delivered in 2025. And we will pay for them with the financial resource that is also provided for 2025.- As ArmiyaInform wrote, on January 31, the MOU officially announced that from the position held the director of the SE -Defense Procurement Agency- Maryn was dismissed Bezrukova.

Change of leadership of the Defense Procurement Agency: Lieutenant General Ivan Gavrylyuk named the ...	As ArmiyaInform correspondent reports, Lieutenant General Ivan Havrylyuk, First Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine, announced this during a briefing on January 31. -I, as the First Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine, whose authority does not include the function of procurement at all, but due to the great failure and the understanding that many things will not be completed, I had to take about 30% of my official time, starting from September 2024, to focus specifically on the areas of procurement of lethal weapons. And at the end of 2024, the problem turned into a media problem in general, and later into the next plane. Not in relation to the structure as an agency, as a state enterprise, but in relation to the person of the head of this agency,- said Ivan Gavrilyuk. He emphasized that two state agencies will continue to function in Ukraine: the State Rear Operator and the Defense Procurement Agency. -Today, the budget of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine is almost 80% of the budget that goes to the Security and Defense Forces. This is about 1.5 trillion hryvnias in total. From this resource, more than 400 billion was allocated for the purchase of weapons, military equipment, as well as for repair and maintenance,- said Lieutenant General Ivan Gavrylyuk. Ivan Gavrilyuk emphasized the importance of uniform and timely supply of resources for the Armed Forces of Ukraine. -We cannot allow a decrease in the monthly provision of the needs of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. This is necessary to maintain the front line, stabilize it and create conditions for further actions that will bring us closer to the big goal — victory over the Russian Federation,- said the First Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine. He also emphasized that any involvement of the state in internal disputes will only delay the achievement of this goal. According to him, the more Ukraine is distracted by various -showdowns-, the more distant the victory will be. As ArmiyaInform wrote, on January 31, the MOU officially announced that from the position held the director of the SE -Defense Procurement Agency- Maryn was dismissed Bezrukova.

According to the investigation, the suspect sought out a conscript who wanted to leave the country during the war and promised to help with a transfer to Romania for $4,000. It has been established that he ordered the man to arrive in Prykarpattia, and from there ensured his delivery to the border town of Zakarpattia Oblast and settlement in one of the recreation complexes. In order to implement the plan, he involved several more accomplices, materials related to which are allocated in a separate proceeding. According to the developed plan, one of the accomplices was supposed to take the -client- to the border, and the other - to take him on foot through the area he knew well, past the checkpoints. The settlement, according to the agreements, was supposed to take place after the success of the illegal device. Law enforcement officers documented the criminal activity of the specified persons, and they themselves were detained on the way to the starting point. At present, precautionary measures have been taken against all those involved.

The enemy is trying to manipulate public opinion in the temporarily occupied territories, in particular through newspapers that contain distorted information about Ukraine. It is noted that, although such printed publications as Novorossiya and Gorlovka are not popular among the local population, the occupiers have intensified measures to spread propaganda. Since the beginning of 2024, they have been trying to impose narratives about -Russia's inevitable victory-, -protection of the Russian language- and -social assistance to its members- on the residents of TOT. Most of the publications in these publications contain outright fakes aimed at discrediting the Defense Forces of Ukraine and justifying the aggressive actions of the Russian Federation. Ukrainian military, analysts, and law enforcement officers continue to document cases of information terror and the fight against Russian propaganda. As reported by ArmyInform, the situation with the disposal of municipal solid waste (MSW) has reached a critical limit in the temporarily occupied territory of the Donetsk region. The occupation administration of the Russian Federation did not provide the normal functioning of the garbage collection and processing system, which causes increasing dissatisfaction among the local population.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/31/tak-starayutsya-a-nihto-ne-chytaye-gazety-novorossyya-ta-gorlovka-ne-populyarni-na-tot/	2025-01-31T11:44:30-08:00

The kingdom of waste: the garbage crisis is worsening at the TOT of Donetsk region due to the inacti...	About reports Center of National Resistance. As it is noted, the waste disposal system during the years of occupation actually failed due to lack of proper maintenance. The occupiers not only do not support its functioning, but also completely ignore the problems in this area. The lack of separate garbage collection, the lack of specialized recycling enterprises and the chaotic accumulation of waste caused an environmental disaster at TOT. The situation is aggravated by an acute shortage of personnel in communal services, as a significant part of the workers was forcibly mobilized by the Russian army. This is another proof of the occupiers' indifference to the lives of local residents. The main goal of the Russian Federation is maximum exploitation of the region's resources and complete control over the population. According to the Center of National Resistance, the deliberate neglect of the communal sphere and forced mobilization is a direct violation of the Geneva Convention on the Protection of the Civilian Population in Time of War. As ArmiyaInform reported, the Kremlin is building dens in the occupied territories: a Rosguardian who -crushes- drug dealers was exposed.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/31/korolivstvo-vidhodiv-na-tot-donechchyny-zagostryuyetsya-smittyeva-kryza-cherez-bezdiyalnist-okupantiv/	2025-01-31T10:51:12-08:00

They died tired — the Armed Forces forced the occupiers to take part in a -survival marathon-	published a video of how it happened on Facebook 124th Separate Territorial Defense Brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. -Participation in the race is not always the most important thing, sometimes the finish line is the most important thing.

As you can see in the video published by them, during the deadly competition, one of the Russians was immediately eliminated, his more agile henchman tried to fight for the silver, and the third even managed to show good speed. -But the main thing is not the speed, but the result. And the result here is spectacular,- noted Teroboronov soldiers, commenting on the destruction of the invaders.

-Operation Kursk-: in Brussels, they showed the real story of the breakthrough of Ukrainian troops i...	The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine informs about this. Opening the event, the Military Representative of Ukraine to NATO, Major General Serhii Salkutsan, noted that since the beginning of the large-scale Russian invasion, the Armed Forces of Ukraine have repeatedly conducted successful operations, in particular, in the Kyiv region, Kharkiv region, and in the Kherson region, but the operation in the Kursk region is special, because it demonstrated that the Russian regime does not have the strength to resist when Ukraine exerts real pressure. This is the first documentary chronicling the offensive actions of Ukraine on the territory of the Russian Federation in August 2024. It is particularly valuable because, in particular, it contains the comments of key officials who played a key role in planning and conducting the operation, as well as the testimony of soldiers, sergeants and officers who directly participated in its implementation. Most of the interviews with the Ukrainian military were filmed in the areas of hostilities. Before the screening, representatives of the author's team of the documentary film -Operation Kursk- addressed the audience and talked about the details of the film's creation.

Currently, the enemy uses the tactics of small infantry groups, bets on the mobility of its units, actively uses motorcycles and vehicles,- said Denis Bobkov. How ArmyInform reported, the enemy is intensifying its efforts in the Pokrovsky direction. This is due to the peculiarities of the weather in Donetsk - the enemy is trying to storm under the cover of fog.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/31/vtopyly-v-stepah-try-rosijski-brygady-morski-pihotynczi-vlashtovuyut-shtorm-na-pokrovskomu-napryamku/	2025-01-31T07:43:15-08:00

Regarding the number, if we talk about one assault, then there can be from 5 to 10 units of armored vehicles. Not all of them manage to drive in, because both infantry and artillery fire at the entrances,- said Ivan Petrychak. The Russian 98th airborne division is fighting against the royal infantry in Chasovoy Yar, adds Ivan Petrychak. It is reinforced by Kadyrov -Akhmat- and various volunteer units. -Recently, a large number of occupiers have been captured.

An anti-corruption officer who tried to smuggle evaders abroad was detained in Odesa — DPSU	About this on Friday, January 31, declared in the press service of the DPSU.

One moment - and modern technology wins over automatic weapons of the mid-20th century!- - note the Ukrainian defenders. As can be seen in the published footage, the Russian invader, emerging from his hiding place, hoped to aim at the FPV drone, but the skill of the Ukrainian operator did not leave him a single chance.

The occupiers shelled the center of Kramatorsk for the second day in a row	This time the explosion was less powerful, so there were no casualties or damage. -This morning at 10:30 Kramatorsk suffered an enemy attack - the central part of the city. According to preliminary information, an attack UAV. Fortunately, there were no casualties or damage,- said Oleksandr, head of the Kramatorsk City Military Administration. Honcharenko. The consequences of the explosion and the work of utility workers were recorded by ArmiyaInform. Utility workers work tirelessly. A significant part of the windows that were broken yesterday have already been covered with chipboard plates, and the road surface is being restored at the site of the tear from yesterday's explosion. Today, an enemy munition hit a flowerbed nearby - just a few hundred meters from the previous hit. There are significantly fewer local residents on the street today. Lilia, who is inspecting the house, informs her neighbor by phone that the windows of her apartment, fortunately, survived, despite the fact that today's explosion happened much closer to her house. In Lilia itself, the windows were broken yesterday. The woman complains that building materials to patch broken windows are provided only to those who stay at home. Instead, nothing is issued for the temporary repair of the houses of those who left. Neighbors across the driveway left Lilia the apartment keys, but she can't help them. - They say, leave. Many of my neighbors have moved out and left me the keys to their apartments. And yesterday, building materials were issued only to me, because I am registered here and presented my passport. And what should I do with neighboring apartments? They are not given materials, although I have the keys to the apartments and copies of their documents, she says. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that On January 30, the occupiers shelled the center of Kramatorsk.

Two years under water - our fighters captured a unique trophy from the Russians	The video of the operation was published on January 31 on the brigade's channel. At one time, the Russians abandoned it when they fled. Left with full ammunition. For a long time, the BMP was not visible, due to the water, the level of which in the local pond had risen significantly. But during the fighting, the dam was damaged, the water level dropped, and our fighters noticed enemy armored vehicles actually in the middle of the pond. The idea immediately arose to withdraw the BMP and involve it in the Defense Forces. Preparation for this operation lasted one and a half months. Finally, the BMP was pulled out and after repairs it will start destroying the Russians. -On the one hand, this is a brilliant, thoughtful, heroic operation. On the other hand, if our soldiers had enough modern equipment, perhaps we wouldn't have to risk their lives and health for the sake of such -monsters,- the brigade commented on the video. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the 63rd mechanized brigade made a selection of Russian soldiers, which lit up after meeting our drones.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/31/dva-roky-pid-vodoyu-nashi-bijczi-zahopyly-u-rosiyan-unikalnyj-trofej/	2025-01-31T04:03:00-08:00
Change of leadership of the Defense Procurement Agency: official comment of the Ministry of Defense	This is stated in the message at site MOU. -This decision of the ministry is justified by the need to guarantee a stable and continuous supply of weapons and ammunition to the front,- the ministry said. Among the key reasons for the change of the head of the AOZ in the ministry were named: non-fulfillment of planned supplies for the front, numerous remarks of the General Staff regarding poor planning of defense purchases and untimely communication on the part of the Agency, unjustified postponement of supply schedules. Numerous leaks of classified information, which will become a separate subject of consideration by law enforcement agencies, are absolutely unacceptable. Given the significant interest in this case, the Ministry of Defense clarified the legal aspects of the change in the Agency's leadership. On October 11, 2024, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine approved the nominations of members of the Supervisory Board of the Agency, which included two representatives of the state and three independent members. In accordance with international corporate governance standards, the Supervisory Board had to play a key role in monitoring the Agency's activities, ensuring its transparency and effective management of public procurement in the defense sector. The appointment of the first three members of the Supervisory Board (which is sufficient for its jurisdiction) took place on October 25, 2024 by order of the Minister of Defense. However, for a full-fledged start of work, the members of the Supervisory Board had to conclude contracts with the Agency. After the official formation of the council by the Ministry of Defense, the Agency was unable to ensure proper legal registration of legal relations with all members of the Supervisory Board, which led to a delay in its work. This is confirmed by the fact that the first constituent meeting of the Supervisory Board took place on December 17, 2024 (almost two months after the approval of the Minister's order). On January 20, 2025, one of the independent members of the Supervisory Board announced his resignation from the board. The reason was the lack of proper communication on the part of the Agency regarding the agreement on the details of the contract with him. This situation led to the reduction of the number of members of the Supervisory Board to four, which disturbed the balance and efficiency of its work. In addition, this composition of the Supervisory Board did not meet the requirement of the law that the majority of members should be independent. On January 20, 2025, the Ministry of Defense received a letter from the Chairman of the Supervisory Board with a notice of a meeting on the same day, at which it was planned to extend the contract with the Director of the Agency. On the same evening, the Agency's message about this decision appeared on Facebook, although the Ministry has not yet given its approval. On January 21, the Ministry of Defense received another letter from the Chairman of the Supervisory Board, in which the Ministry was given only a few hours to respond. On the same day, the MOU officially recommended not to renew the contract with the director, justifying its decision with arguments. However, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board did not convey this information to all members of the Supervisory Board. In the evening of the same day, the Agency again announced on Facebook about the -unanimous- extension of the contract. The Chairman of the Supervisory Board of AOZ did not ensure proper communication with its members and the Ministry of Defense. Some council members reported that they had not received the positions of the Ministry of Defense, although they were sent officially. After the Ministry of Defense independently sent its position to all members of the Supervisory Board, the independent members changed their opinion and voted against signing an additional agreement on the extension of the contract with the director. The Ministry of Defense emphasized that the mentioned actions of the Supervisory Board did not comply with the principles of transparency and consistency and contained a number of procedural violations: -It is important that when Maryna Bezrukova was hired by the Agency in January 2024, the contract with her was concluded by the Ministry of Defense, which acted on its own behalf as the authorized management body of the Agency. The law establishes that the change of the contract takes place with the consent of its parties. Therefore, the extension of the contract with Maryna Bezrukova required the consent of the Ministry of Defense,- the MOU stressed. Despite this, on January 23, 2025, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board Yuriy Dzhigyr signed an additional agreement without the appropriate approval of the Ministry of Defense. By this, he exceeded the limits of his powers, defined by the law and the Charter of the enterprise. Considering the unsatisfactory performance of the Agency under the leadership of Maryna Bezrukova, as well as the lack of cooperation and proper communication on the part of the Chairman of the Supervisory Board (representative of the state), the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine decided to replace state representatives in the Supervisory Board. The relevant information was immediately brought to the attention of both the specified persons and the Agency. Thus, only 2 members out of 5 remained in the composition of the Supervisory Board, which made it ineligible. In accordance with the legislation, in the event of the Supervisory Board's incompetence, its powers are temporarily transferred to the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. This gives the Ministry of Defense the right to make decisions on the management of the Agency, in particular, on the appointment, dismissal and removal of the director, as well as the appointment of an acting director. -In the conditions of war, effective defense procurement is a key priority of the state. Currently, the Ministry of Defense and the leadership of the Defense Procurement Agency are focused on contracting and uninterrupted supply of weapons and ammunition to the front. Contracting continues daily as usual,- the MOU said. The ministry reported that in the near future, in accordance with current legislation and corporate standards, a permanent head of the AOZ will be appointed. Both procurement agencies of the Ministry of Defense continue their work. In the near future, the leadership will be elected and approved, in accordance with all due procedures. -Ukraine is a state governed by the rule of law, where every citizen can appeal a decision in court. At the same time, all actions must take place exclusively within the framework of current legislation. The Ministry of Defense also turned to law enforcement agencies for an investigation and legal assessment of the actions of the Agency's former leadership,- the statement said.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/31/zmina-kerivnycztva-agencziyi-oboronnyh-zakupivel-oficzijnyj-komentar-minoborony/	2025-01-31T03:48:21-08:00

According to him, such a result was achieved thanks to a detailed analysis of the enemy's actions. Currently, the brigade manages to calculate the ways of the enemy's approach and mine dangerous areas. And also hunt Russians every night and every day with attack drones, destroy shelters, warehouses with ammunition and fuel. -Actually, we do not observe assaults as such. For now, they are trying to pull up and concentrate some forces, moving in small groups of two, three, five people. Because they understand that any larger group is already a target, a priority target for our gunners, mortars and drone operators,- said the representative of the public relations service of the -Charter- brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine. The main task is not to let the assault be prepared. Make it so that the enemy infantrymen get to the positions and see broken shelters there, where there is no light, no heat, no ammunition. And also regularly knock out enemy equipment. -Most often we manage to find the equipment still far on the approach, or even in the rear. If you look at the losses of the enemy for January, you can see that we managed to hit one tank and several armored fighting vehicles.

Investigators are reconstructing the events minute by minute: the military ombudsman about the situa...	In a conversation with one of the sergeants, the ombudsman asked whether the unit knew about journalistic investigations of their brigade, about criminal proceedings? To which the soldier replied: -We knew and know only that we need to hold Pokrovsk.- As Olga Reshetylova notes, the new 155th Brigadier General and his deputies created an investigation department, which included representatives of each of the battalions that suffered losses: -The -investigators- are actually minute-by-minute reconstructing the events during which contact with servicemen was lost, with find out what measures were used for evacuation, analyze intelligence reports to understand what could have happened to the missing brothers.- The military ombudsman notes that this is a good example of not a formal approach to conducting official investigations, but a real investigation, which should be implemented in other military units. -True, such investigative departments should not be deployed after the fact, but in real time. In addition to conducting high-quality official investigations, it is also a source of analytics for commanders and a subject for conclusions and work on errors. In the near future, the families of the missing persons from the 155th brigade should be provided with comprehensive information about the situation with their relatives,- Olga Reshetylova wrote in her post. It should be recalled that for the first time information about the problems at -Anna Kyivska- was announced by journalist Yurii Butusov in his investigation -The true story of -Anna of Kyiv-: SBI opened a case regarding the formation of the 155th brigade.- As a result, the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, General Oleksandr Syrsky said that -paid particular attention to building the capabilities of the unmanned systems unit of the 155th Mechanized Brigade, as well as problematic issues that need to be resolved. I gave all the necessary instructions.- Subsequently, in mid-January, the commander of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Major General Mykhailo Drapaty, in his message noted that he reported to the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces about the situation in the 155th brigade and the decisions made by the command of the Ground Forces for support of the unit and resolution of problematic issues voiced both by the servicemen themselves and by journalists. -I believe that the 155th brigade named after Anna of Kyiv is promising and will prove itself. Yes, it takes time and effort of many to correct mistakes made during formation. But the newly created Ukrainian brigade named after Anna of Kyiv can and should become a real -Gallic rooster- - a symbol of France: proud, indomitable and ready to fight for freedom,- Mykhailo Drapaty wrote at the time. Recently, the journalists of -Suspilny- visited the 155th brigade. In the video story, Serhiy Tsvetkov, commander of the unmanned systems battalion, told about this: -When PR goes like this (we are talking about public publicity about the situation in the brigade. — Ed.): well, like, the brigade can’t do anything there, then it affects the meetings, people don’t want to inform, they don’t want to help, because, like, there is a missing brigade and can't do anything. But in reality it is not so. We never give up and go only together to victory.- As proof of this, on January 30, the official page of the 155th published a post from the video, where it is noted that the brigade once again captured a Russian soldier. -One of the priorities for the -Anna Kyivska- brigade is replenishment of the exchange fund. Often, capturing an enemy is a more difficult task than destroying it. After all, it exposes to additional danger the person who demands to lay down his arms. It is not the first time that the fighters of the 155th OMBr have been recognized in this kind of operations, regularly demonstrating resilience and ingenuity,- the post states. As the military ombudsman Olga Reshetylova reported in her post, the intensive work in combat units gives a completely different understanding of the course of events: -While discussions were raging in Kyiv about the fate of the 155th brigade, its servicemen continued heroic battles: they went on assaults, fought back and held their positions.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/31/rozsliduvachi-pohvylynno-rekonstruyuyut-podiyi-vijskovyj-ombudsmen-pro-sytuacziyu-u-155-brygadi/	2025-01-31T00:31:40-08:00

Training of servicemen support specialists: how they work with military personnel who need prostheti...	One of the main topics of the meeting was prosthetics for injured amputees. Antonina Saleeva, director of the public non-profit enterprise of the Kharkiv Regional Council -Center for Prosthetics and Rehabilitation-, told in detail about this. — We are a complex rehabilitation structure that cooperates with prosthetists, surgeons, and rehabilitation specialists regarding an important part of medical services — prosthetics and orthopedics, — said Antonina Saleeva. Separately, she spoke about the process of rehabilitation and prosthetics: - It begins when the injured person first finds himself in the hospital. First, it is necessary to understand what exactly the patient needs. If it is an upper extremity, it should be taken into account when choosing a profession. If the lower one, prosthetists find out how much he will walk, what his requirements are, etc. Employees of the prosthetics center go through the entire process with the injured, starting from the examination in the hospital and ending with prosthetics and training on how to use the prosthesis. The director of the Center for Prosthetics and Rehabilitation noted that since the beginning of the war in 2014, they had to quickly create conditions for studying new technologies. — We have mastered electronic prosthetics of upper and lower limbs, in particular sports. The NATO project helped a lot in this, because we managed to train 20 specialists who are currently working all over Ukraine. We studied the technologies that we need in prosthetics for young guys, Antonina Saleeva stressed. Today, many veterans have completed a full course of rehabilitation, and there are even those who continue to serve in combat units.

How the propaganda of the Russian Federation takes away the childhood and life of young people in th...	The militarization of youth in Donetsk and Luhansk regions, as well as in the Republic of Crimea, has been ongoing since 2014, and with the beginning of a large-scale invasion, the unfortunate -military-patriotic- upbringing will also be experienced by the younger generation of Kherson region and Zaporozhye. This -gentle time bomb- is laid by Russian propagandists purposefully and methodically. ArmyInform systematized what Ukraine and the world are doing to counter this; to bring to justice each propagandist personally, and the Russian Federation as a state. In 2016, the Russian Ministry of Defense created a youth -military-patriotic- military organization. In fact, it is a movement that imposes the ideology of Russian aggression and educates the future soldiers of the occupation regime. It includes schoolchildren aged 8 and over. Among other things, children are forced to take an -oath of loyalty- to Russia, promise to -protect its interests- and -cultivate great patriotism.- After that, they are taught fire and tactical training, drone control, etc. In addition to Russia and the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine, branches of -Unarmy- also exist in Armenia, Tajikistan, and unrecognized Abkhazia. The occupiers work with the youth not -quietly-, but also generously report on their work on brainwashing young Ukrainians under occupation - you can find a lot about this on the Internet. By the way, the occupied part of Zaporozhye. Only within a few months of 2024 it becomes known that: And this is not the whole list. And this is only part of the information from temporarily occupied Zaporozhye. &#xfe0f; The head of the Center for countering disinformation, officer of the Defense Forces of Ukraine Andriy Kovalenko in the ArmyInform comment states that at least 1.5 million children from the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine have already passed through Russian propaganda processing. The Center for Combating Disinformation is engaged in the search and identification of individuals and legal entities involved in the abduction of children on the TOT, their ideological processing and integration into the occupation structures. In addition, the center is working on identifying propaganda networks of the Russian Federation that involve children, identification of propagandists and cultural figures, special services of the Russian Federation, who are involved in these processes. -The Center forwards the collected data on identified propagandists, natural and legal persons who commit crimes against Ukrainian children to the appropriate state bodies for taking measures, including inclusion in the sanctions lists,- says Andriy Kovalenko. Yes, on War&amp;Sanctions site there is a separate section _blank- rel=-nofollow- href=-https://war-sanctions.gur.gov.ua/kidnappers/persons->-Kidnappers-. Everything about those involved in the specified crimes on TOT is systematized there. In particular, according to Kovalenko, we are talking about almost 300 individuals and about 100 legal entities. And all the curators from the Kremlin and the special services of the Russian Federation, who work in the direction of the militarization of children from the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine, are gathered on the indicated website in the section -Kremlin mouthpieces-. Their names are also known, emphasizes Kovalenko. -In social networks, with the help of Vkontakte or Odnoklassniki, Russians are building a structure of propaganda, and teenagers from TOT are involved in this work. Later, children with leadership qualities are -taken on a pencil-. This is how the Russians cultivate potential agents of influence. And no matter how the Russian-Ukrainian war ends, these processed teenagers will already be agents of influence in the future. And this is a big problem that Ukraine will still have to face,- comments Andriy Kovalenko. Therefore, Ukraine should take preventive steps in order to extract children from the occupation: that is, protect them both physically and mentally, from the point of view of national security, and from the point of view of the strategic future. Thus, the national initiative of the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy Bring Kids Back UA was launched in Ukraine. It is aimed at the return of children forcibly deported by Russia. In January 2025, CPD and Bring Kids Back UA presented an analytical report-Militarization of Ukrainian children in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine-. Only an abbreviated version was published for the general public, its non-public part was presented to the Ukrainian special services. Among other things, the authors of the report draw attention to the fact that the militarization of children on the TOT poses a threat to their very lives. -The involvement of children in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine by the Russian side in military formations, training them in combat skills and instilling the ideology of aggression has tragic consequences. Children's participation in hostilities not only deprives them of their childhood and the possibility of a peaceful life, but also often results in the loss of their lives. These actions of the Kremlin are not only a crime against children, but also part of a hybrid war strategy aimed at destroying the Ukrainian nation,- the report says. Analysts also collected specific names of children treated by Russian propaganda, who later joined the ranks of the Soviet Union and were eliminated by the Ukrainian Defense Forces on the battlefield. This is, for example, Dmytro Kotov. In 2015, he graduated from Gymnasium No. 6 in Jankoy. He was a member of the -Junior Army-, this is confirmed by data from open sources. After graduating from the Sevastopol State Technical University, he completed contract service on the large amphibious ship -Novocherkask- of the 197th amphibious brigade of the Crimean naval base of the Russian Federation. On March 24, 2022, Dmytro Kotov died while participating in the Russian Federation's war against Ukraine. Is Ivan Shifman. He studied at school No. 1 in the city of Kalmiuske. In 2019, he joined the ranks of the Youth Army. After coming of age, he joined the ranks of the People's Militia of the Donetsk People's Republic and began serving in the First Separate Guards Motorized Rifle Brigade of the Russian Federation. Since the beginning of the full-scale war of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, he has been a participant in hostilities in the settlements of Starognativka, Granitne, Maloyanisol, Zaytseve, and Rozivka of the Donetsk region. On April 14, 2022, he died on the battle line near the village of Novobakhmutivka, Donetsk region. Is Ilya Moskvitin. He was also a member of the -Junior Army- unit that operated on the territory of the temporarily occupied Donetsk region. According to the materials published on the page of the movement, on April 14, 2022, Ilya Moskvitin was killed when he was detonated by an anti-personnel high-explosive -Petal- mine. The authors of the report summarize: since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, the Russian Federation has intensified the militarization of Ukrainian children in all temporarily occupied territories. And it is used as a tool to accumulate mobilization reserves of the enemy army. -These actions show, in particular, that the Kremlin has no intention of stopping the war against Ukraine and the Ukrainian people,- analysts emphasize. Analysts single out several means of countering the militarization of Ukrainian children. In particular, it is necessary to increase international pressure on the Russian authorities through additional sanctions against organizations and individuals involved in the militarization of children in the Russian Federation. In addition, it is worth creating global monitoring mechanisms for such violations. It is important to intensify cooperation with humanitarian organizations to finance programs of psychological rehabilitation, social adaptation, and training of specialists for the reintegration of children. It will also be appropriate to develop educational initiatives to prevent similar crimes and create a platform for coordinating the actions of international and national structures in the field of child protection.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/31/yak-propaganda-rf-zabyraye-dytynstvo-i-zhyttya-molodi-v-okupacziyi-i-chomu-ukrayini-vazhlyvo-protystoyaty-militaryzacziyi-na-tot/	2025-01-30T20:53:37-08:00
Who cares about Oreshnik: the expert named the systems capable of stopping Russian terror	Which countries have a system capable of countering Oreshnik? But do we have the resources to create our own anti-missile system of the same level? Military expert Petro Chernyk answered these questions. Oreshnik is a very serious missile system. the Russians present it as incredibly new, but in fact it is far from the case. So what is it? First. This is an old RSD-10 -Pioneer-, which was developed since 1976. This is a pretty serious system. Up to 5,000 kilometers - the task of shocks. The speed of the acceleration units of each is within the limits of 10 thousand kilometers per hour. This is classic atmospheric ballistics that reaches its target at a very high speed. the Russians claim that at the moment there are up to 36 combat elements in the Oreshnik booster unit. But there is a serious point here: it is highly doubtful that there is an explosive. Most likely, this is the kinetic part, because when any body is accelerated to such a speed, even a kilogram of nuts at such a speed will release more energy than one kilogram of TNT equivalent. And if you look very carefully at the single strike (we are talking about last year's strike on the city of Dnipro - ed.) that took place, you can understand the following: from the look at how these combat units came, it is very doubtful that they had any quality. Because a lot of light is clearly visible in the video. So friction light is generally combustion. It is doubtful that the Russians struck a real hard blow. The second system from which the so-called Oreshnik could grow is the RS-24 Yars, its lighter part. Is it possible to knock it down? It looks like neither the MIM-104 Patriot nor the SAMP/T system can handle it at the moment. But to claim that this is impossible at all is also not entirely correct. The Americans have a simply fantastic THAAD system, designed to shoot down just such ballistic targets. This system is atmospheric, it works beyond 200 kilometers. But there is a nuance. One machine costs 2.5 billion dollars. Yes, yes, I was not wrong. This is for one car. And the calculating machine is $600 million. Americans can afford it. And the only country that could afford to buy it is Saudi Arabia. True, there is some optimism. The Americans made the Typhon launcher, literally in 2024 they brought it into service. First of all, this system is designed to fire such a beautiful missile as the BGM-109 Tomahawk. But the package also includes the same launch container: it can launch the RIM-161 Standard Missile 3. This is exactly what an anti-missile is. They were developed against such ballistic weapons. There can be optimism for us if our American allies come to the conclusion that it can be handed over to Ukraine. And it is necessary to look objectively in the direction of developing own systems. Let me remind you that out of more than 30 heavy intercontinental ballistic missiles developed by the Soviet Union at one time, two-thirds were developed in our country at Pivdenmash. That is, the technological potential is there, the scientific potential is there. Only apply intelligence, apply engineering thought, apply financing. I am more than sure that there can be an own strategic anti-aircraft missile system that can cope with what is called Oreshnik. Although, for the sake of justice, it must be stated that at this very moment we really do not have such complexes yet.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/31/komu-oryeshnik-po-zubah-ekspert-nazvav-systemy-yaki-zdatni-zupynyty-rosijskyj-teror/	2025-01-30T20:44:22-08:00
An unexpected sensation: the deepfake taught Ukrainian soldiers to fear and surrender	Well, the algorithm was probably trained on their -mobs-, because such logic is foreign to the Ukrainian army. On the front lines, everyone knows very well: rotations are indeed difficult, delays happen, but what happens for sure is hard counter-attacks instead of -organized retreats- to the camera. And now to the details that once again betray the masters of propaganda: So if you see a new -incriminating video- on the Internet, where -military forces- for some reason speak in the voices of bots and look as if they were drawn by a drunk neural network artist - feel free to laugh. Because the only thing that really leaves the ground after such fakes are the remnants of the reputation of Russian propagandists.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/31/nespodivana-sensacziya-dypfejk-navchyv-ukrayinskyh-voyiniv-boyatysya-ta-zdavatysya/	2025-01-30T20:29:39-08:00
The combat horse of the Defense Forces with an interesting history: on the battlefield is the Pinzga...	As told then our agency, in the acquisition of the first batches of these cars were invested by both businessmen from the -citizen- and a former entrepreneur who at that time was already serving in the Ukrainian army, but continued to inform the army while remaining incognito. Two SUVs from that batch served in the combat brigades of the Territorial Defense Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, the rest were sent to other branches of the military. Subsequently, a few dozen more machines were transferred from Britain, which began to work both as tractors and medevacs, and as deep reconnaissance, support and communication vehicles. Therefore, in the present material, we will pay tribute to the -Pintzgaurs-, or as our soldiers nicknamed these armored vehicles - -Pintzam- and we will recall both the history of their creation and deal with some technical characteristics. The concept of this SUV was developed at the beginning of the 60s of the last century by Erich Ledvinka, the son of Hans Ledvinka, who went down in history as the engineer of the legendary Czech Tatra design. The car was built in the late 1960s by Steyr-Daimler-Puch of Graz, Austria and named after the Pinzhauer, an Austrian horses. It became popular with military buyers and remained in production throughout the rest of the century. In 2000, the rights to the armored car were sold to Automotive Technik Ltd (ATL) in Great Britain. ATL was subsequently acquired by Stewart &amp; Stevenson Services, Inc. in 2005; in May 2006, Stewart & Stevenson became a subsidiary of the aerospace and defense group Armor Holdings, Inc. A year later, Armor Holdings was acquired by BAE Systems plc. -One that provides rock-solid reliability and true go-anywhere ability!-. This was the description given to this -grasshopper- by the British military. In the basis of the design of this car, instead of a frame, a large backbone tube is used, which is lighter and stronger than a conventional frame for the driver. And the most important thing is that not only the drive shafts pass inside this pipe, the gearbox and transfer case are integrated there. Thus, all these units are shockproof. The car also has an original independent suspension. Thanks to this design, Pinzgauer has earned a reputation as a reliable off-road vehicle. The capabilities of the civilian unarmored versions of these vehicles were better than those of the Hummer or Land Rover Defender in some situations. The armored version received an additional 3 tons of weight, which to some extent affected the passability. Pinzgauer Vector with a 6×6 wheel formula, namely, such armored vehicles arrived in the first batch to the Armed Forces of Ukraine, quickly developed for the needs of the British military in Afghanistan. As experts from the Dutch defense portal, the Army Recognition Pinzgauer Vector was developed and put into mass production in less than nine months under an expedited contract awarded by the then Defense Acquisition Agency (DPA) to meet Urgent Operational Requirements (UOR). The Pinzgauer Vector PPV (Protected Patrol Vehicle) 6×6 is an armored version of the Pinzgauer 718 light tactical truck. The armored vehicle was produced from 2007 to 2009. The machine was equipped with a new armored body developed by BAE Systems Land Systems. It is believed that this machine has the maximum level of protection for its weight category - Kevlar armor is actively used here, in particular on the floor, and multilayer armored glass is installed in the cabin and rear doors. The machine provides protection against fire from small arms and fragments of artillery shells. The armored floor provides better protection against explosion and rollover, and the case is equipped with a reflective coating to help control temperature. The design of the Pinzgauer Vector is similar to a light truck with a two-crew cabin in the front and a landing compartment in the back, which accommodates four soldiers who can quickly enter and exit the vehicle through two doors at the rear of the vehicle. However, as the experience of using these machines shows, in some armies of the world, up to 12 soldiers were placed in the landing section. Each of the landing doors is equipped with a viewing unit to provide a view of the rear of the vehicle. The roof also has two large hatches that will allow two crew members to have a good all-round view. The Pinzgauer Vector is equipped with a 10 hp diesel engine. It can travel at a maximum highway speed of 105 km/h with a maximum range of 700 km. The weight of the car is 4400 kg, the maximum payload is 1600 kg. If we talk in more detail about the engine and transmission of this armored car, in the mid-1980s, more powerful 6-cylinder in-line diesel engines with a capacity of 109 hp began to be installed on the Pinzgauer instead of the gasoline 4-cylinder engine from Volkswagen with a capacity of 88 liters. The new engine practically did not fit into the engine compartment, so these versions received a characteristic -hump- in the front part. Later versions received a 2.5-liter 5-cylinder turbodiesel engine with a capacity of 120 hp. with ZF automatic transmission. The engine met Euro-3 standards. The 145-liter tank was enough for the claimed 700 km of mileage. Different versions of the Pinzgauer had different top speeds: for the Pinzgauer Vector PPV 6×6, 105 km/h is declared. As for the specifics of the Pintsa chassis, depending on the configuration, its ground clearance can reach 40 cm. The machine has large amplitudes of suspension travel up to 20 cm, differential lock (separately for each of the three axles), traction control system. Minimum distance between front and center axle. Such geometry provided tremendous opportunities for overcoming off-road conditions. The car has short front and rear overhangs, that is, it feels free on the asphalt. Early versions of the Pinzgauer had drum brakes on all wheels, which had to be disassembled and cleaned after forcing a deep ford because they would clog and lose their effectiveness. New disc brakes are installed on more modern versions. RunFlat tires are used. These vehicles are capable of towing trailers up to 5000 kg on-road and up to 1800 kg off-road. Among the interesting design features, it is worth noting the presence of an obstacle-setting device installed directly during the production of the machine, which counteracts improvised explosive devices. Incidentally, it should be noted that such all-terrain vehicles were supplied to the armies of about 30 countries. In particular, Austria, Bolivia, Great Britain, Venezuela, Malaysia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Oman, Pakistan, Serbia, Slovenia, Switzerland, and later Ukraine. If we compare this Austro-British -horsefly- with machines of a similar class that were inherited by the Armed Forces of the Soviet Union from the Soviet army, then we are probably talking about the UAZ-452 - a car that occupies an intermediate level between a jeep and a truck. However, there can be no further comparison in the conditional classification: -Pinz- in all parameters is several heads higher than that miracle of the Soviet automobile industry.

-Unskilled hands do not hurt-: how a logistics officer ensures the battalion's combat effectiveness	The story of the fighter was made public on page 46 of a separate airmobile brigade of the DSHV. One of the vivid examples of his work is the restoration of the damaged Husky armored car during the battles near Robotyn. Despite the shelling and difficult conditions, -Smart- together with his guys was able to repair the car right on the position, which allowed it to be later evacuated and returned to the formation. -They literally forced her to puta on the position, under Robotyn,- Oleksandr recalls. — Even here, half a hundred meters away, the -Leopard- rolls into position, and we twist the nuts. To the accompaniment of the battle, we did not even hear him appear. He shot and rolled away. The enemy begins to cultivate the territory in response. Everything around is on fire. And we have nowhere to go, the task must be completed. And the car was restored to a condition where it could at least be towed on a trailer. Later, she was evacuated, and after a short repair, she returned to service.- According to -Umnogo-, his team is able to repair any equipment, even foreign ones. They find spare parts all over the world, turn to volunteers and even make parts themselves. -We had a problem with the fan on the Humvee. Tried on a tractor, reground, digested, adjusted&#8230; And it's still going. A clumsy person's hands don't hurt,- Oleksandr jokes. Thanks to -Umny- and his team, the time to repair equipment has been significantly reduced. What used to take hours or even days is now done in minutes. -For example, what used to take five hours to repair is now done in 20 minutes. What used to take a day is now just three hours,- says Umnyi. Oleksandr believes that the main thing in work is responsibility and constant self-improvement. He demands the same from his brothers. -Development, self-improvement, responsibility- is the motto of -Smart-, which helps him and his team to successfully perform their tasks and ensure the combat capability of the 46th brigade. As reported by ArmiyaInform, FPV-group bomb technician Ilya with the call sign -Murena- worked as an inspector of tactical-operational response of the patrol police of Kyiv before the beginning of the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation, but very quickly learned how to equip ammunition, -so that they explode before in the face of the Russians-.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/30/u-nevmilogo-ruky-ne-bolyat-yak-oficzer-logist-zabezpechuye-boyezdatnist-bataljonu/	2025-01-30T11:52:54-08:00
How do the mobile baths of the Armed Forces of Ukraine work and how do they differ from Russian ones	As the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine explain, it allows soldiers to maintain cleanliness even in the most difficult conditions, such as a training ground, a field camp, or even a combat zone. -This is especially important in winter, when the lack of normal conditions for washing can be dangerous to health,- the military said. According to them, the mobile bath and laundry complex (MLPC) is quickly deployed and quite easy to use, since all it needs is free space for installation, water and electricity. But how does the Ukrainian MLPK differ from the trophy field bath of the Russians, see in the plot.

As reports the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Staff Sergeant Ihor Zova once encountered such invaders , who is currently defending his native Kharkiv Oblast and has already managed to get injured, and before the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation, he worked for a large company and had a quiet civilian life. -I was born in a family of military medics. More than 20 years ago, he began his adult life with service in the anti-aircraft missile regiment. But already in the 2000s, he said goodbye to the army, as he thought then, forever. And here I am again. Came to serve in the radio engineering battalion of the Air Force. When the need arose, together with his brothers, he came to the aid of the Ground Forces, because, after all, we all have the same goal!- he explains his motivation. And somehow, during a combat mission, a whole group of enemy soldiers fell into the hands of Zova and his comrades. -Got into position. The first explosion causes a small earthquake. Zova rhetorically asks his comrade: -When do you think we should expect the next one?- Less than a minute has passed. Swarms of drones overhead. But the soldiers are determined not to give the enemy even a meter! That's why they are entrenched, keep the defense- - said the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. And already in the evening of the next day, a group of the enemy came to their positions. -The task is clear: destroy the enemy or make him surrender. The main problem is the unknown: what weapons do they have, are they guided by drones? Therefore, they decided to act decisively and in the most coordinated manner. -On your knees! Captivity is the only reasonable way out for you!- shouted Igor. The three occupants fell to the ground in confusion and immediately agreed. They were sure that they were going to their own. And the offer to surrender was met with joy,- the military said. According to Ihor Zova himself, this became a good motivation for his battalion, and later 12 more invaders were captured by his comrades. As reported by ArmyInform, Ukrainian soldiers met a -rare type of occupier- in the Siver region, who after the elimination of his henchmen had the sense to surrender.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/30/poloneni-rosiyany-ne-pryhovuvaly-radosti-shtab-serzhant-zova-rozpoviv-yak-zmusyv-zdatysya-czilu-grupu-okupantiv/	2025-01-30T11:09:32-08:00

Intercepting and destroying a drone or missile is not easy. Everything must be carefully calculated in order to hit the target. There are seconds to make decisions. We cope with these tasks,- says Sava. According to him, after destroying the target, you feel extraordinary feelings, but the euphoria passes in a moment. The flight continues, so you immediately focus on the next tasks. Sava never knows in which region of Ukraine his airfield will be based in a few days and what tasks in the air he will perform. He has participated in many air operations. -Our aviation survived the first days of a full-scale invasion, gave battle to a better-armed and outnumbered aggressor,- says the pilot. — Now we are participating in complex air operations, in which more than a dozen aircraft may be involved. We launch rocket-bomb attacks on the occupiers.- Sava and his combat buddies, military aviators, protect Ukrainian skies 24/7. -We don't see our families, we don't go home,- says the pilot. — Our work in the sky involves many risks.

The package also includes armored vehicles and other weapons. -Another approximately $250 million will be directed to various international funds. 178 million dollars will be directed to the -Danish model-, according to which funds are raised for the defense-industrial complex of Ukraine,- said the post of the Swedish Minister of Defense. The government is currently negotiating with suppliers in Sweden and Europe for the supply of priority equipment, such as artillery and drones, Kremlin ministers said. In total, the aid package announced by Paul Jonsson consists of eight components, the largest of which is various purchases of the latest equipment, mainly from Swedish and other European defense industries, to be transferred to Kyiv. In particular, it includes: As reported by ArmyInform, Lithuania transferred a batch of MANPADS and missiles to Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/30/shvecziya-ogolosyla-najbilshyj-paket-vijskovoyi-dopomogy-dlya-ukrayiny-na-12-mlrd/	2025-01-30T08:36:00-08:00
Documents confirming the Ukrainian past of Kurshchyna were presented in Kyiv	In particular, the exhibition opened on September 6 and was dedicated to the beginning of the operation of the Defense Forces of Ukraine in the Kursk region of the Russian Federation. As Yurii Savchuk, general director of the National Museum of the History of Ukraine in the Second World War, noted, -most of the materials presented at the exhibition were introduced into scientific circulation for the first time. They were unknown not only to the general public, but also to a narrow circle of specialists. The catalog contains 72 documents and is self-sufficient and important, because these materials will forever remain in Ukrainian historiography, in the formation of our knowledge about this region.- SBU Major General Yulia Laputina, candidate of psychological sciences, emphasized: -Today is a significant event, because in the conditions of asymmetric war, where the parties are different in terms of resources, physical strength, and military strength, strategic communications are very important as a tool for countering asymmetric threats. For many centuries, Russia manipulated history, hid the true facts, and people did not know their identity for generations. And today we are talking about the fact that Ukraine, as a nation of free people, must convey the historical truth to the world. We do not manipulate - we prove real facts.- According to Doctor of Historical Sciences, Director of the Central State Archive of Higher Authorities and Administration of Ukraine Larisa Levchenko, all 72 documents from the catalog have been translated into English. This ensures their availability not only for Ukrainians, but also for a foreign audience, so that the world learns about the situation in which ethnic Ukrainians found themselves in these lands. The catalog, like the exhibition, consists of three sections. The first section covers the 17th-19th centuries and introduces the history of the Ukrainian colonization of the Kursk, Belgorod, and Voronezh regions from the second half of the 17th century. The head of the State Archives Service of Ukraine, Candidate of Historical Sciences, Anatoliy Khromov emphasized: -The story of this exposition of the exhibition should begin with the process of settlement of Ukrainians in these territories and the formation of a coherent, homogeneous ethnographic, cultural, economic and military region, which historically belonged to Ukraine. In addition to the modern Sumy and Kharkiv regions, it also included significant parts of Voronezh region, Kursk region and, in fact, all of Belgorod region. It was on this territory that five Cossack regiments were located - Sumy, Okhtyr, Kharkiv, Izyum and Ostrogoz, founded by immigrants from Dnipro Ukraine.- Documents show that in the middle of the 17th century, this area was settled by the natives of the Hetman region - Circassian Cossacks. They came to lands that were uninhabited before, which is also confirmed by Russian imperial documents. In particular, sub-ensign Bobovnikov reported in his report that -people from the Hetman region settle on the wild steppes and create cities there, and live separately from the Russians.- The exhibition presents census books, which testify that these cities were inhabited mainly by Ukrainians. In fact, Kurshchyna and north-eastern Slobozhanshchyna were Ukrainian lands. However, in the second half of the 17th century, after administrative reforms, despite the demands of the local population to join them to the Slobid-Ukrainian province, these cities were included in the Kursk Governorate under the leadership of Pyotr Rumyantsev-Zadunayskyi. Thus, the Ukrainian territories became part of the Russian Empire. Despite this, for more than two and a half centuries, Ukrainians preserved their national and cultural separateness and did not assimilate with Russians. During the Liberation Struggle, there were attempts to join these territories to the Ukrainian People's Republic, but they were unsuccessful. Therefore, the beginning of the operation of the Armed Forces in the Kursk region can be considered the restoration of historical justice. The incident in the city of Suja, where the Russian flag was shot down by a well-aimed shot, became symbolic. It was demonstrated during the press conference. This step is another confirmation that Kurshchyna is Ukrainian land, and the history of Ukrainians cannot be erased by the Kremlin's manipulations. As reported by ArmyInform, from August 2024 separate units of the 92nd Assault Brigade named after Ataman Ivan Sirk perform combat missions in the Kursk direction. And although the offensive of the Ukrainian defense forces was unexpected for the enemy, it is putting up strong resistance.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/30/u-kyyevi-prezentuvaly-dokumenty-shho-pidtverdzhuyut-ukrayinske-mynule-kurshhyny/	2025-01-30T08:15:30-08:00

In the 155 brigade, an investigation department was created, which deals with missing people	reported this on January 30 by the Commissioner of the President of Ukraine for Rights Protection servicemen Olga Reshetylova. -Now the -investigators- are actually minute by minute reconstructing the events during which contact with servicemen was lost, finding out what measures were used for evacuation, analyzing intelligence reports in order to understand what could have happened to the missing comrades. This is a good example of not a formal approach to conducting official investigations, but a real investigation of the circumstances, which should be implemented in other military units. However, such investigative departments should not be deployed after the fact, but in real time. In addition to high-quality conduct of official investigations, it is also a source of analytics for commanders and a subject for conclusions and work on mistakes,- said Olga Reshetylova. According to her, in the near future the families of the missing persons from the 155 brigade should be provided with comprehensive information about the situation with their relatives. Currently, the brigade is fighting heavy battles in the Pokrovsky direction. -While discussions were raging in Kyiv about the fate of the 155th brigade, its servicemen continued heroic battles: they went on assaults, fought back and held their positions,- recalled Olga Reshetylova.

He washes the window on the fifth floor. I did not hear the warning sirens - and here the explosion is very loud. I'm sitting by the window right now, there's a desk. Rama survived, only flowers from pots flew at me.- She was really lucky, because the glazing of the balcony of her apartment, as well as the windows of most of her neighbors' apartments, were broken. However, the double-glazed window survived, protecting the woman from glass fragments that could have been fatal. -I didn't want to scare the children,- Lyudmila continues, -but it turned out, of course, that I screamed.- I had to cancel the lesson, I asked the children not to worry, but I still can't calm down myself.- The woman does not understand why the Russian military is hitting civilian buildings where there are no military positions.

The weapon of last hope — the Russians launched a disguised rubber woman at our positions	The video of the invaders' prank was released on January 30. Perhaps the Russians were hoping that our aerial scouts would temporarily lose their vision and intelligence in order to strike this creature with drones. Perhaps the morale of the Russians is so shameful that even a rubber woman did not comfort them, so they sent her as far as possible, dressed in their uniform.

Ice element: how special forces divers learn to work in extreme cold	Photos of the training of special forces divers were published on the unit's page. The training covered a wide range of disciplines, including diving, firefighting, engineering training, navigation and underwater navigation. Particular attention was paid to practical training of key elements, such as surveying the bottom with the help of a navigation system, searching for objects on the bottom, preparing and using pontoons to lift objects, as well as working underwater with descents and ascents. In addition, divers studied the theory of undermining underwater and surface objects. The commander of the group of divers of the CSP -Omega- with the call sign -Dart- said that the emphasis of the exercises was on practicing movement on watercraft. This included tasks such as convoy tracking and solo, convoy break-up, working out conventional signs, mooring to the shore, rushing to the coastline and reconnaissance from watercraft using unmanned aerial vehicles. Watercraft were also used to cover a group of divers during missions. Winter training has its own characteristics, because the work takes place in extreme weather conditions. Low air and water temperatures lead to rapid freezing of the equipment, which can lead to its breakdown. This, in turn, reduces the time of underwater reconnaissance and task execution. Dart also noted that the Omega diver group works on a wide range of tasks, including surveying water bodies, lifting cargo, demining coastal areas and shores, sabotage tasks, suppression of fire points on the shore and rescue operations. As reported by ArmiyaInform, throughout 2024, servicemen of the Omega Special Purpose Center performed tasks in the hottest areas of the front. Together with other Defense Forces, they took part in dozens of successful operations.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/30/kryzhana-styhiya-yak-vodolazy-speczpryznachenczi-vchatsya-praczyuvaty-v-ekstremalnomu-holodi/	2025-01-30T03:37:18-08:00

In a few minutes, we see a VAZ and a KamAZ drive past us, blocked by the military. And then our stocky cook says: -Boys, whore, not ours! -. He was the first to open fire, followed by all of us. Some units survived, including a lieutenant colonel of the Russian army whom we captured,- Volodymyr recalls. The next memory of Volodymyr is the defense of Makarov in March 2022.

We moved forward quickly, liberating village after village. Sometimes the units that were supposed to be entrenched did not keep up with us,- the soldier shares his memories. Today, he uses his experience to destroy the enemy with the help of modern weapons. He admires drones the most: -We refine each drone, add something special. And when someone in the department comes up with something new, they share it with others. We have a lot of creative young people, and it's cool!- In addition to military affairs, Volodymyr is fond of sports motorcycles and quad bikes.

As stated in the release published on the official website of the United Kingdom government, soldiers of the 16th Regiment of the Royal Artillery tracked and destroyed several UAVs in flight with a directed energy beam, having demonstrated the effectiveness of the system in real conditions, ArmiyaInform reports. The statement noted that the latest system, using a powerful infrared laser, was tested at Radnor Proving Ground in central Wales. In turn, equipment developer Raytheon UK, part of RTX (NYSE: RTX) Raytheon, emphasized that the tests were the latest phase of the MoD's Ground Laser Directed Energy Weapon (LDEW) demonstration program, in which British soldiers used Raytheon's HELWS, successfully tracking and neutralizing moving air goals -Our high-energy laser weapon system is used in operations around the world, and now the British Army is experimenting with this groundbreaking capability,- Raytheon UK chief executive James Gray said. -The success of this trial is the result of the skill, dedication and vision of our scientists and engineers who have worked with the British Army to help fulfill its commitment to remain at the forefront of technological innovation.- The experiment marks the first time the British Army has tested high-energy laser weapons mounted on armored vehicles, and trained soldiers in the weapons' targeting and tracking technologies. Separately, the British government recalled the fact that, unlike conventional munitions, laser weapons are practically unlimited in terms of ammunition stocks, which means that they can be a cost-effective alternative to some existing weapons. -This ground-breaking technology demonstrates the UK's commitment to remain at the forefront of military innovation,- said UK Defense Procurement and Industry Secretary Maria Eagle. -The successful test of this laser weapon system is a significant step forward in our development of a possible future defense capability and demonstrates British engineering excellence.- The laser was developed through a collaboration between the US Department of Defense, including the Defense Equipment and Sustainment (DE&S) and Defense Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl), known as Team Hersa, and an industrial consortium led by Raytheon UK. The Raytheon High Energy Laser Weapon System (HELWS) was installed on the Wolfhound armored vehicle. Our editors spoke in detail about such a practical combination at the project level in one of -wolfhound-osnashhuyut-lazernoyu-zbroyeyu/->materials. This equipment has a command and control interface and can be integrated with wider combat control, radar and surveillance networks. It is adapted to be installed on different platforms according to different work requirements. However, according to the results of combat tests in Wales, for reasons of secrecy, it was not disclosed how long the beam of the HEL system must remain in contact with the target before it is hit. British officials stress that this development has ensured the implementation of the government's plan for change through the rapid development of technology and the creation of a strong national security foundation. Great Britain has tested a powerful new laser weapon from an armored vehicle. Video: HUF HACK Great Britain tested a powerful new laser weapon from an armored vehicle.

This was reported by the head of the Luhansk Regional Military Administration Artem Lysogor on his page . According to him, the occupation authorities have not paid the workers due funds since October 2015. This shameful fact affects not only those who currently work at these enterprises, but also those who were laid off during this period. People who conscientiously performed their duties found themselves without means of livelihood due to the criminal negligence of the occupiers. The fact that all these enterprises are in the so-called -state ownership- of the self-proclaimed -LNR- is especially cynical. This means that the occupying administration bears full responsibility for this situation.

Autocivilka for UBD: how to issue a policy	Since January 1, changes have taken place in the Law of Ukraine -On Compulsory Civil Liability Insurance of Land Vehicle Owners-. If previously combatants were exempted from mandatory civil liability insurance, now there is no longer such an option in the law. Therefore, the auto-civilian needs to be issued. Instead, combatants received a 50% discount at the legislative level. At the beginning of January, some motorists were faced with the fact that they could not find companies that would provide such a discount to combatants. However, now the market has already reacted to the changes and the corresponding offers have appeared. The easiest way to find is to use the services of online services that accumulate information from various insurance companies. They have online calculators. Including with an option for beneficiaries. It is necessary to enter information about the vehicle, the volume of the engine, the place of registration and the available benefit (somewhere it can be the item -veteran-, somewhere -combatant-). And the calculator will select program options offered by insurance companies. There are certain requirements and restrictions for receiving a discount, including: Another important point is that the discount is provided for only one vehicle of the insured.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/30/avtoczyvilka-dlya-ubd-yak-oformyty-polis/	2025-01-29T21:04:09-08:00
A conductor in an anti-drone cloak: a senior technician of a separate infantry brigade revealed the ...	The serviceman is 35 years old and comes from the Rivne region. In civilian life (and by profession - ed.) - a teacher of playing wind instruments. At one time, he was also a member of the club and a conductor. Before joining the ranks of the Defense Forces of Ukraine, he also worked at a meat processing plant and was an operator of a smoking plant. At the beginning of October 2023, Oleg Targonskyi was already at the training ground, and in the middle of October he was sent to the BZVP in Estonia. Stayed there for 35 days. -Well&#8230; It was different. Another country, learning to survive (laughs - ed). As they say: fell into a wolf pack - you have to live like a wolf. Well, I did: I didn't expect that, without a foreign passport, you could get across the border,- he says with a smile. After his return, he took the position of driver-radiotelephone operator in the 456th battalion of the 141st brigade. Now he is a senior technician in the ranks of the 141st separate infantry brigade. Once, during a combat mission, he managed to occupy lost positions and destroy the enemy's manpower. Our interlocutor does not go into the details of this operation, but reasons as follows: -The assigned task had to be completed, no matter what it cost us. When you think about the fact that you have a wife and children waiting for you at home, there is no other option but to return, because they need you.- If we talk about the secret of success on the battlefield, Mr. Oleg, relying on his own experience, states: -On the battlefield, the skills he acquired from the instructors at the BZVP were very useful. It was not for nothing that I studied something, everything was needed at the right time.- To a traditional question to a military serviceman, whether he is afraid while performing combat missions and, if so, how he copes with fear, Mr. Oleg answers: -Everyone is afraid. But this is war, so there is no choice. Everyone has fear. And during combat sorties - even bigger. But you just put on an anti-drone cloak and you have to be careful: if you don't see the enemy, he will see you.- Victory for Oleg Targonsky will be the day when he wakes up in the morning and hears: -The war is over.- Mr. Oleg's two brothers are also in the army, fulfilling their constitutional duty.

40 soldiers in an armored taxi with a machine gun: the M113 armored personnel carrier showed what it...	ArmiaInform was told about the legendary -Emka- in the armament of the 33rd separate mechanized brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine by the battalion's deputy armament commander with the call sign -Pasichnik-, the technical support platoon commander Oleksandr with the call sign -Tyson- and the mechanic-driver Anatoly with the call sign -Vozduh-. The M113 is primarily designed to provide front-line logistics — to bring fighters to and from positions, as well as to deliver everything necessary -to the front-. However, this armored -horse on tracks- can also provide landing and fire cover for infantry during assault operations. - We call them -taxi-. They are fast and reliable for quickly bringing in or picking up people, evacuating the wounded, transporting BC. They can also be used to storm some enemy positions and landings. We have 12.7 mm Browning and Canik machine guns on them. This is very good fire cover during an assault, says Alexander -Tyson-. In the place of the machine gunner in the basic modification of the M113, there are triplexes that allow you to survey the area, so that even before moving into a combat position, you know in which direction you should open fire. The view through them is quite safe and quite good, no worse than the view available from the driver's seat. — The machine gunner needs to climb up to fire. Therefore, he needs to see where we are going, from which side we are landing, in which direction he will have to work now. Thanks to this, when he opens his hatch and grabs the machine gun, he already knows where to shoot, explains the platoon commander. On some -emkas- in general, automated systems are installed that allow you to conduct machine gun fire without climbing up. Being inside the body of the armored car, the machine gunner can control the weapons located in a small turret and fire using the screen and two joysticks. — Now we have such tasks, when these cars go out purely for fire cover. If the Russians press very hard on our positions, our machine will run up, -scoot- with a machine gun on the landings, drive the enemy away and return, - explains Oleksandr. However, most often, M113s work as -workhorses-, delivering everything needed by mortars and infantry on the front lines. For this, their route is calculated in such a way as to cover several positions at once. — The machine can travel a maximum of 70-80 kilometers in one run. To do this, load the car to the maximum and let it go around the -ring- so that it visits several positions. For example, we have mortar units located deeper in the rear than infantrymen. Accordingly, first we go to the mortars and then we go further to the -front-, explains -Tyson-. One such trip usually lasts 1.5‒2 hours. During this time, up to 10 positions can be visited depending on the need. In order to avoid detection by the enemy, it is necessary to drive at night with a night vision device, move at the maximum possible speed and not stay in one place for more than 2-3 minutes. — They work promptly, as quickly as possible, because if the machine stands longer, the enemy will see it from drones. And if the -emka- stands there for a long time, it means that it is unloading and there are positions there, says the soldier. What is dangerous, he explains, is not so much the possibility of hitting the armored personnel carrier itself, which becomes a much more convenient target in its immobilized form, as the unmasking of the positions of the fighters to which the M113 arrived. — We put at risk those people who unload there. Because the machine will go, but the people will stay and then the artillery will start working on them. That is why, on average, there is a 2-3 minute stoppage: the equipment was dropped, unloaded - and on the move, Oleksandr explains the features of using the M113 on the front line. One of the M113 modifications is the so-called -mule-. Instead of an armored capsule, such an -emka- has a platform designed for the transportation of large-sized cargo, which cannot be placed inside a conventional armored personnel carrier. Also, this armored car is slightly longer than the usual one - it has six support wheels instead of five. Already in Ukraine, the -mule- has been improved for the transportation of logs necessary for the construction of dugouts. For this, a structure was installed on the platform, which allows very quickly, almost instantly, to unload the logs delivered to the construction site. — If you just stack the logs on the platform, it will take a few minutes to unload them. And this triangular design allows you to fasten 10 logs on each side with ties and additionally fasten them with wire. You fly to the position, click two screeds and the logs roll down, explains the deputy commander of the battalion with the call sign -Beekeeper-. - Unload lasts 15 seconds. And this can be done by one person - it is enough to jump out onto a platform that is comfortable to walk on. And then quickly the car flew back. Everything is quick, everything is fast. This allows you to minimize the time spent on the -front-, he adds. Clarification about the possibility of unloading the load by one fighter is important, because it will take at least two or even four people to dump logs stacked in the usual way. Such an interesting rationalization solution not only optimizes the process of delivering specific cargo to the front line, reducing unloading time and the efforts of fighters, but also literally helps save lives. After all, where 4-5 fighters (together with the mechvod) would have to take risks for a long time, one can quickly cope. A very important characteristic of the M113 is the speed of movement. The armored car easily moves at a speed of 45-50 km per hour on any terrain. And on a good road it can be accelerated up to 70 km/h. At the same time, the automatic gearbox installed on the armored vehicle allows you not to be distracted by shifting gears. — If there is a good straight road and there is no load on the gearbox, then I put the fourth position and drive. Then I only use the selector to switch - forward, neutral, backward or turn on the spot. There is a special provision for making a U-turn on the spot, says the platoon commander. Even an untrained fighter can learn to operate the M113 in just a few hours. But, of course, tractor drivers and mechanics with relevant experience in driving heavy agricultural or construction machinery are most likely to get into the driver's seat. They are offered to become M113 drivers in the first place. -Emki- are very convenient to manage. On newer modifications, control is carried out with the help of a rudder, on older models there are levers. On the command and staff modification, it is true that you should slow down before turning, on the other hand, on the combat one designed for amphibious landing, you can turn sharply at any speed. — When you turn the steering wheel, one -guitar- slows down, and the second adds more revolutions. On the combat modification, just turned the steering wheel - and the -emka- immediately makes a turn. On older versions, there are levers at all, so it is even easier there - which lever you clamp - in the other direction and turn. They must have caught the Vietnam War in 1967, -Tyson- jokes. In the command and staff modification of the M113, which is shown to the technical support platoon, turning is somewhat more difficult - for this, you need to slow down and only then start the maneuver. Therefore, driving it requires slightly better skills than -combat- modifications. — Everyone can learn to drive the M113, the main thing is that there is a desire. Automatic gearbox, gas, brake and steering wheel. Started the car and drove off. The most difficult task of the driver is to remember the road correctly - where to drive, where to turn, where you can and where you can't get off the road, because there may be mines there, - explains Oleksiy. Good orientation to the local area and the ability to remember the road is the main requirement for the professional suitability of the emka driver. If there are no problems with this most difficult task, then everything else can be taught gradually. — To teach a new mechanic-driver to navigate, he is first put in the machine gunner's seat and driven several times with him to the positions, showing the way. Where you should and can drive in, where you can't, what are the markings for orientation in the locality, -Tyson- continues. — In addition, drone reconnaissance is mandatory. Every day, drones fly over and inspect the roads, because there are, for example, remote mines and they need to be detected. Intelligence is working, a route is laid out on the map, landmarks are determined. Mehvod should be well versed in this, the military man emphasizes. All this information must be well remembered by the driver-mechanic. Also, he must interact well with the machine gunner and the landing group, pay attention to the information from the drone pilots, which comes via radio communication. - To skillfully manage the -emka- is the easiest task for a driver. The main thing is to turn in time between landings, smiles the driver-mechanic with the call sign -Air-. — After the 13th landing, there should be a -clearance- and you have to jump into it. You drive, you count: seven, eight - and here -arrive- next to -babah!-. And already gone astray. Then you don't start counting again, but just look closely at where that -clearance- will be. A special system of tactile commands was developed for communication inside the rather noisy armored vehicle. Hit on the right shoulder - turn right, on the left - left, on both at the same time or in the back - stop. - These are the main commands. When they leave, they agree among themselves in more detail how to communicate. Because it's hard to hear in the car and you can't shout at the driver - you need special signs. In addition, many people drive with headphones, because after 4-5 departures per night, the driver's head simply breaks, says -Tyson-. Inside the armored personnel carrier, it is practically impossible to really hear anything - tank laryngophones for normal communication are clearly lacking. This forces fighters to improvise, negotiating different ways to communicate. — For example, you can agree on some kind of signal to reset the speed before turning or stopping. Run the mechvoda with your hand from the head down to the back. Then he will know that the next signal - stop or turn - is coming soon, says -Air-. Fighters who are eagerly waiting at the positions for the arrival of the emka and listen carefully can hear its approach already 2-3 kilometers away, because the armored personnel carrier is quite loud. The roar of three armored vehicles moving nearby makes you speak quite loudly, and with the approach of one of them even raise your voice to a scream. -Emks- have reliable protection, capable of protecting the driver and the paratroopers from bullet damage from any small arms and debris from close-range explosions of mortar mines and artillery shells. — The armor here is made of aluminum alloy. If somewhere from the side -arrives- from a mortar or artillery, then it withstands shrapnel brilliantly. One of the driver-mechanics said that when he was driving for a landing assault, he saw a machine gunner hitting him from 50 meters away with a PKM, this is a 7.62 mm caliber. And he only heard something rattling on his armor, Oleksandr says. Then the M113 successfully landed the attack aircraft, covered the landing party with fire and calmly returned. In general, says -Tyson-, the armor of the -Emka- is designed to withstand hits from large-caliber machine guns and, most likely, will withstand a direct hit from a mortar mine. Anti-personnel or anti-vehicle mine protection is just as reliable. An anti-personnel mine is capable of causing some damage only to the tracks of an armored vehicle and will not cause any damage to the mechanized vehicle or the landing party, an anti-tank mine will at most partially disable the chassis. — If it hits an anti-tank mine, the crew will, of course, receive aquabarotrauma. And this is when the crew is sitting on that side where the -harp- catches the mine. We have a mine crew that has been blown up by mines four or five times - and everyone is alive, everyone is fine. -Compared to BMP or MTLB, it's -Mercedes- against -Zhiguls-, because there, if you fly into an anti-tank mine, it's a hook for both the machine and the crew,- Tyson M113 compares. The military man has experience working with Soviet armored vehicles, so he knows what he's talking about. Soviet-made armored vehicles are not only less comfortable and protected, but also, based on their design features, they are less suitable for combat missions in the conditions of modern warfare. One of the undoubted advantages over the Soviet armored fighting vehicles Tyson calls the aparel - an inclined plane that opens horizontally in the rear part of the machine. Lowering to the ground, it creates a convenient inclined bridge for landing fighters. — Soviet cars have doors instead. Now, if a normal person is in an outfit, it is difficult to move through those doors even slowly. Because if a normal infantryman goes out, he has a plate carrier or a body armor, RPS with all the results, a first aid kit, stores. Even for me, with my height and 60 kilograms, it is difficult to push through, - jokes Oleksandr. Instead, the armor allows two fighters to freely and very quickly leave the armored personnel carrier or enter it at the same time. To do this, they do not need to make any complicated movements or make special efforts - it is enough to bend a little so as not to hit their head. - You can walk through the wardrobe as if into a room - the door is wide. The man ducked down so as not to hit his head - and freely ran in and out. It is very convenient, the main thing is to shout to bend down. Because it's good that I didn't succeed in height, and there are people who are taller, so they can sometimes hit me with a helmet, -Tyson- smiles. Thanks to the apparatus, it is especially convenient to evacuate the wounded, who can be quickly brought in and taken out even lying down. - It's all time, and for us time is everything. The sooner, the more responsive you are, the better. And if you carry a wounded person through the door, he will get caught there, hit. It will be necessary to somehow return it, check it - this is all an unnecessary delay, - Oleksandr emphasizes the convenience of the device. As additional protection, the M113 is equipped with anti-cumulative screens, grills and superstructures of mostly artisanal production. According to Tyson, they have proven to be a fairly effective defense against enemy FPV kamikaze drones with cumulative charges. — We put this mainly because of FPV drones, because they hang such strong cumulative charges on these kamikazes that they pierce any armor. And this additional protection that we are now welding allows to dissipate the cumulative jet. The charge is triggered at a distance of 30-40 centimeters from the armor - and then it survives, he explains. The military tells how, from the powerful explosion of the FPV drone's screen-detained charge, the debris hit the triplex and almost pierced it through. If the blow came directly into the armor, then there would be no chance to withstand the blow. On the other hand, the deputy battalion commander with the callsign -Beekeeper- speaks less favorably about the protective superstructures on the M113, believing that they only add weight and can hinder the movement of the armored personnel carrier in dense forests. - The best protection is REB. And if the fiber optic works, it won't help either. What can we expect from this screen if there is a contact detonator on the charge of the FPV drone, and the cumulative jet still goes to the armor and can pierce it? he asks rhetorically. He says that in the past, protective lattice screens of rib-mounted steel strips were designed against RPG charges and were really effective. On the other hand, against the powerful cumulative charges of FPV drones, protective grids are powerless in the vast majority of cases. M113 are very convenient to repair, have easy access to the engine. Many minor breakdowns can be repaired in-house not far from the front lines with experienced mechanics, tools and equipment, and spare parts. And it is possible to pull a caterpillar that flew off the wheels from an anti-personnel mine explosion in the field. — If the edge of the -guisli- hits an anti-personnel mine, the explosion can knock out one of the mounts - we call them -binoculars-. When one -binoculars- flies off, the whole -fiddle- can fly off. But if there is a spare mount, then it is very easy to replace it. I installed it, hit it with a hammer, tightened it - and you can drive on,- says Oleksandr. Damage from anti-tank mine explosions is more difficult, as the explosion damages the rollers. -Emka- with such -wounds- has to be dragged 15-20 km away from the front line for stationary repairs. — If it is an anti-tank mine, then, accordingly, there will be some damage to the support rollers. But here, too, the replacement is quite elementary - drive up, unscrew, screw in a new one - and that's it. Everything is very simple, elementary - how to change a wheel on a car. The jack was placed, lifted, removed, placed and that's it, explains the technical support platoon commander. The biggest problem arises only with the availability of the necessary parts. He says that one of the armored personnel carriers damaged in the spring of 2024 could only be sent for repair in December due to the lack of spare parts. - They are very easy and practical to repair. But there is often a problem with spare parts, because you have to wait for the necessary parts from abroad. They are brought from Holland, Spain, America. Therefore, the whole problem is only with spare parts - if they are available, we will repair them quickly, - claims Oleksandr. The standard capacity of M113 - 8 landfill fighters, but if necessary, a armored personnel carrier can take on board and three times more people. Tyson recalls that there were 24 soldiers from the front of the Emca. - But 24 is when it is quite a battle. Although there were cases when even 40 fighters were exported on one car. Then, of course, not only inside, but also from the outside sat on the armor. They became and selected, because it is very difficult for people to go for many kilometers, especially on the marsh - when the big swamp and viscosity of the soil, - says Tyson. The Bagn -Emk- goes great, although there is some dependence on the type of caterpillars installed on a specific machine - with rubber pads or with the presence of special -soil- on both sides of Husley. This is noticed by the -beekeeper-, showing two neighboring M113 on the caterpillar. - This is where Guslya stands with rubber pillows without -soil-, so in the swamp it is worse controlled. And here are the lateral -soil-, which provide better clutch. Therefore, it is better to put such a -mud- caterpillar - the so -called -swamp- on a powerful machine, - he explains. Cuts with purely rubber lining, the military notes, very well show themselves on solid soil and on asphalt, instead, it is better to put such caterpillars with a soil with a soil with a soil or swampy area. In general, M113 armored personnel carriers, like Leopard tanks, proved to be very good. Fighters 33 of the separate mechanized brigade respond mainly to them. They point out that, if possible, good maintenance and spare parts are not new to foreign armored vehicles are quite capable of performing all the combat missions provided for them.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/30/40-bijcziv-na-bronovanomu-taksi-z-kulemetom-bronetransporter-m113-pokazav-na-shho-zdatnyj-reportazh-z-peredovoyi/	2025-01-29T20:35:57-08:00
The Russian Federation invented a new fake about the mobilization of teenagers in Ukraine	the Russian -information troops- decided not to trifle and launched a spiel about a -pilot project- of mobilizing minors, supporting it with fabricated -documents- and panicked headlines in the style of -Zelensky sends children to the front-. It looks as if the Russian propagandists have finally lost themselves in their own lies. Because just yesterday they were talking about -empty military commissars- in Ukraine and -total evasion- of service. And today they are already drawing pictures of how -minors- in uniform are holding back the onslaught of the -second army of the world-. Official Ukrainian laws and realities smash this -throw-in- to the ground: So the only thing relevant to the -pilot project- is the Russians' failed attempts to launch fake -news- without fact-checking. While the Kremlin is inventing fairy tales about Ukraine, Russia itself is passing laws that allow recruiting prisoners into the army, forcing students to serve, and handing out summonses instead of diplomas. Not to mention the fact that 17-year-old boys there not only receive summonses, but if they refuse, they can end up behind bars. So if teenagers are being mobilized anywhere, it is in the Russian Federation, where they are desperately trying to plug the holes in the army for everyone who can still hold a weapon. Russian propaganda is once again trying to present Ukraine in the role of a -military dictatorship-, while it itself sends schoolchildren and prisoners to the front. Well, if you believe their logic, then the next fake will probably be about Ukraine mobilizing babies and arming them with Molotov cocktails. But taking into account the rate of degradation of the Russian IPSO, we will not have to wait long.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/30/v-rf-vygadaly-novyj-fejk-pro-mobilizacziyu-pidlitkiv-v-ukrayini/	2025-01-29T20:09:31-08:00

Each time they fail, and have huge losses, but they come back again and again. However, Krasnov notes, the number of enemy drones has decreased, because UAV hunters have appeared. -I know these guys. Very talented operators indeed. If at the beginning of the operation in the Kursk region, we constantly heard the sound of these wings above us, especially at night, then after such calculations began to work, both our brigade and our allies really became less of them. Artillery strikes are less accurate, anti-aircraft guns are less accurate,- Stanislav Krasnov said.

However, there is no confirmation that there are actually Ukrainian military personnel in the published footage. In addition, both in the video itself and in the credits to it, only the Russian language appears.

Maritime coalition: the IOU told how 18 states are helping Ukraine to strengthen its fleet	About the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine informs. The issue of control over the Black and Azov seas is strategic for the security and economy of Ukraine, because the importance of maritime trade routes for a country that exports raw materials cannot be overestimated. Hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians work in industries such as metallurgy and agriculture that depend on these routes. Millions of people around the world are consumers of Ukrainian grain and food products. Control over rivers, which serve not only as convenient logistical routes, but also as natural borders between states, is also important. That is why in December 2023 Great Britain, Norway and Ukraine initiated the creation of the Coalition of Maritime Capabilities. Its main tasks are to ensure the urgent needs and long-term development of the relevant capabilities of Ukraine, to ensure the freedom and safety of civil navigation, to deter and repel any aggression from the maritime direction. In addition to Ukraine, 18 other states have joined the -sea- coalition - in addition to the leaders, there are also Belgium, Bulgaria, Greece, Denmark, Estonia, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, Germany, the USA, France, Sweden, Portugal, Poland, Romania and Turkey. Finland, Iceland and Canada are contributing to the development of Ukraine's maritime capabilities, but they are not yet part of the Coalition. Australia and Japan are considering becoming members. Activities of the Maritime Capability Coalition are among the least public. At the same time, it is known that the member states of the Coalition provide Ukraine with, in particular: technical staff and technical support for operation and application. Among the things that can be confirmed publicly, the Netherlands and Belgium are handing over three Alkmaar-class mine countermeasures ships to Ukraine this year. Great Britain, in addition to other capabilities, has already transferred two mine countermeasures ships -Chernigiv- and -Cherkasy- in early 2023, which are currently based in British ports. The crews of these ships are currently undergoing intensive training to perform assigned tasks according to NATO standards. The specified set of anti-mine forces is the basis of the anti-mine tactical group, which will directly eliminate the mine threat in Ukrainian waters. The USA, the Netherlands, Canada, Sweden and Finland have transferred a certain number of boats of different classes and fields of application: for search and rescue operations, transportation, reconnaissance and special operations. In Romania, the Coalition created a naval training center for the training of marines of the Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. On January 9, 2025, the heads of the defense departments of 14 leading states and Ukraine agreed on the road maps of all coalitions. This happened during the meeting of the Group of Leaders of Capability Coalitions within the Contact Group on Defense of Ukraine (-Ramstein- format). As reported by ArmyInform, demining and anti-mine work in the Black Sea continues continuously. The security work of the Armed Forces Navy is at a consistently high level.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/29/morska-koalicziya-u-mou-rozpovily-yak-18-derzhav-dopomagayut-ukrayini-zmicznyty-flot/	2025-01-29T03:39:54-08:00

The Achilles battalion becomes a separate regiment of unmanned systems	The announcement was published on January 29 on the Achilles channel. -In less than three years, we have grown from an infantry company of Teroboron to a separate regiment of unmanned systems. Our work is fire support for Ukrainian infantrymen and high-precision liquidation of the enemy on an industrial scale,- said the message to -Achilles-. During two years of persistent and continuous work with drones, the unit hit and irretrievably destroyed 19,853 enemy targets. Achilles calculated that 30 football fields or 6 Red Squares in Moscow would be needed to accommodate all the enemy's defeated forces and assets. -We are destroying the most expensive and rare samples of the Russian defense industry. We repel large mechanized assaults with drones. And we will definitely pass on this experience to new team members in order to scale the effectiveness on the battlefield, which means the success of Ukraine,- noted Achilles. Due to reformatting, the unit is recruiting to its ranks. As ArmiyaInform reported, Achilles talked about that soon will change the battle line.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/29/bataljon-ahilles-staye-okremym-polkom-bezpilotnyh-system/	2025-01-29T03:21:42-08:00
-As long as there is strength, health, strength-: mortarman -Hetman- about his contribution to the v...	The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. Three days before February 24, 2022, Oleg received a summons. He was in the reserve as a signalman, so he was one of the first to be called. Despite the plan to send him for a three-month training, the situation changed instantly - the Russian army crossed the border, and the man went to his brigade. -This brigade is my family. In 2015-2016, we were just forming, and now those who fought side by side with me have become commanders. For example, our unit is headed by a former soldier, with whom we stretched the wires of the -polovka- under enemy fire. Today he is a major, and everyone in the team respects him,- Oleg recalls. Currently, Oleg is responsible for ensuring communication in the brigade. These are not just generators or antennas, but also modern digital technologies. During his years of service, he witnessed significant progress in this area. -When I started, telegraph poles and punch cards were still used. And now we have Starlinks, satellite Internet, digital systems. But no matter how technology develops, wireline communication still remains indispensable - you can't jam it like a satellite signal,- he explains. Despite his vast experience, Oleg does not associate his further post-war life with the military profession. -As they say, road to the young,- smiles the man. - They also have more flair for new technologies, and they learn new things faster and more efficiently. And I want to be a -citizen- - to my wife and children. Perhaps I will be engaged in entrepreneurship again, as before the war. It would end as soon as possible. As reported by ArmyInform, donor blood is the real currency of life on the front line. Her reserve means a chance for salvation for the wounded defenders of Ukraine.

Jesus on the contrary - in the Dnieper region, doctors made cripples out of dodgers	About this reported on January 29 Dnipropetrovsk Regional Prosecutor's Office. Two doctors and their accomplice have been notified of suspicion on the facts of aiding in the illegal transportation of persons across the state border of Ukraine, obtaining an illegal benefit and abuse of influence, committed by a group of persons based on a prior conspiracy (Part 3 of Article 332, Part 3 of Article 354, Part 2 Article 28, Part 3 of Article 369-2 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine). According to the investigation, a family doctor from one of the region's hospitals together with a neurologist and an accomplice organized a scheme to help men who wanted to avoid mobilization. They demanded and received $500 for a fake MRI report with a fictitious diagnosis. Based on it, the patient had to receive an official opinion of the medical commission about unfitness for military service due to disability. In addition, a fictitious stay of the -patient- in inpatient treatment was registered, as if he had undergone all the necessary examinations, treatment and rehabilitation. During the searches, documents, draft records, money, computer equipment and cars were seized from the suspects. The prosecutor sent a request to choose preventive measures in the form of detention.

Two-wheeled races for survival - the Russians organize motocross races with mines in their hands nea...	About this on the air of the telethon -Society. News- he told Oleksandr Nevymidy, chief of the communications department of the 46th separate air mobile brigade. According to him, sometimes the enemy tries to -mechanize- his offensive. So, recently two assaults took place in the brigade's area of ​​responsibility, each of which was supported by one BMP. Both attacks were repulsed, artillery and UAV units destroyed the BMP. So the enemy again returned to -meat- attacks. -They are trying to break through the defense line somewhere with this technique. But this does not work, so they work precisely in small infantry groups. How cockroaches seep in wherever they can,- noted Oleksandr Nevidimy. Sometimes they use motor vehicles. Mainly for delivery of BC, food, but sometimes also for other purposes. -It happens that it is these soldiers of the Russian Federation on motorcycles that mine. It carries a mine with it.

Summons after summons — in Kharkiv, the TCC helped evaders for money	About this reported on January 29 by the State Bureau of Investigation. According to operational information, those willing to evade the service were offered to officially transfer to the TCC subordinate to the involved parties, apparently, due to a change of residence. For this, it was not even necessary to go to the military commissariat, because all the documents were filled out without the presence of the -client-. Then men were issued summonses every month, with which they could freely move around the city. The conscript had to pay 70 thousand for the transfer to the required TCC and the monthly issuance of the relevant summons. UAH The DBR employees detained the middleman, whom the organizers of the arrangement sent to receive money from another evader. The suspect himself also evaded service using the same scheme. He was informed of the suspicion of receiving an illegal benefit for influencing the decision-making by a person authorized to perform state functions, combined with extortion (Part 3 of Article 369-2 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine). The sanction of the article provides for punishment in the form of imprisonment for a term of up to 8 years with confiscation of property.

The commander of the company of the -Shershni Dovbush- strike unmanned aircraft complexes of the 68th separate hunting brigade with the call sign -Lyuty- told about this on the air of the -Yedini Novyni- telethon. According to him, the Russians work comprehensively. They usually accompany their assaults with drones — some conduct surveillance, FPV drones attack. Especially now there are many drones on fiber optics, which cannot be -jammed- by means of EW. -The number is simply amazing. Recently, the weather was a little clear, and the sun was falling on the ground. You fly over the -mavik- and you can see how the whole earth shines - it is covered with this optical fiber. That is, the intensity of the enemy's use of fiber-optic drones is very high,- the company commander noted. How reported ArmyInform, the situation in the Pokrovsky direction remains quite difficult. Under the cover of fog, the enemy is constantly trying to attack Ukrainian positions. During the week, the forces of the 68th Brigade destroyed about 150 invaders and 280 pieces of weapons and equipment.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/29/vsya-zemlya-blyshhyt-na-sonczi-pokrovskyj-napryamok-vkrytyj-kilometramy-optovolokna-vid-vorozhyh-droniv/	2025-01-29T01:47:44-08:00
Treasonous duo: adjusters of Russian strikes were detained in Kharkiv	This is reported by the Security Service of Ukraine. According to internal security and SBU military counterintelligence data, a 38-year-old local unemployed man and his 24-year-old roommate turned out to be accomplices of the enemy. In the -breaks- between adjusting attacks, the woman sold drugs through so-called bookmarks, which she left around the city for her clients. Both involved worked remotely for a representative of the Russian special service, who -noticed- the couple when they were looking for -easy- money on Russian Telegram channels. On the instructions of the curator, the attackers bypassed the streets of the front-line city, where they secretly recorded the bases of the Defense Forces, and then sent a -report- to the occupiers in the form of photos and geolocations of the objects. As the investigation established, the enemy was most interested in the reserve command posts of units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the SBU. Security Service officers documented the crimes of both informants and detained them in the rented apartment they were renting for the conspiracy. During the searches, mobile phones with evidence of working for the enemy were seized from the detainees. So far, the detainees have been notified of suspicion in accordance with the crimes committed under several articles of the Criminal Code of Ukraine: h. 3 Art. 114-2 (unauthorized dissemination of information about the movement or placement of the Armed Forces or other military formations formed in accordance with the laws of Ukraine, committed under martial law); h. 2 Art. 307 (illegal production, manufacture, acquisition, storage, transportation, forwarding or sale of narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances or their analogues); h. 1 Art. 309 (illegal production, manufacture, acquisition, storage, transportation or forwarding of narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances or their analogues without the purpose of sale).

A warrior with a thousand faces: Khotabych's path from a peaceful life to the front	The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. Roman understood from his youth that war with Russia was inevitable. -While still in military service, the officers said: our enemy is not the West, but Russia,- he recalls. Therefore, when the aggression began in 2014, he immediately joined volunteer activities, and later - military service. In 2015, he joined the National Guard of Ukraine and became one of those who formed the -Spartan- rapid response brigade. But in 2021, something told him that it was time to return to the service. So he signed a contract with the 128th Mountain Assault Brigade, with which he repelled a full-scale enemy invasion. -For many, the war began in 2022, for me it was long before 2014,- he says. -Khotabych- went through fierce battles for Mariupol, Novotoshkivka, Kupyansk, Kreminna. The latter was especially etched in his memory: -We conducted combat reconnaissance for weeks, held the defense and stormed in terrible conditions. The most difficult thing was to pull out the dead comrades when the 23-year-old commander was dying before your eyes. When he was wounded, he was taken to a hospital in Dnipro. There he was impressed by an 18-year-old volunteer who, having lost his family in Mariupol, did not take up arms due to religious beliefs, but helped wounded fighters. -I saw real strength of spirit in him,- says Khotabych. After the hospital, he returned to the army because he could not leave the unit without technical support. Currently, he heads a workshop that repairs small arms, equipment and supplies the military with necessary materials. -Who but us?- he says. Thanks to his efforts, the military has an equipped repair base, which greatly increases the combat capability of the unit. -Khotabych- is an example of how a person from a peaceful life can become an indispensable warrior, not only holding a weapon, but also helping the front with his knowledge and skills. As reported by ArmyInform, 28-year-old Oleksandr with the call sign -German- is drona-bomber operator 128 separate mountain-assault Transcarpathian Brigade. Before Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, he worked at a mining and beneficiation plant in Kryvyi Rih.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/29/voyin-z-tysyacheyu-oblych-shlyah-hotabycha-vid-myrnogo-zhyttya-do-frontu/	2025-01-29T01:32:09-08:00
About the raids in the Belgorod Region, the liberation of the Aggregate Plant and the ideology of -M...	- Tell me, please, how the new chapter of your life in Ukraine began? -When I arrived in 2014, I immediately met the future management of Azov during the Euromaidan. In fact, then, right after him, I came to meet with them on behalf of the Russian nationalist underground. We held a meeting there with them, the guys represented -Right Sector-East-, and the meeting itself was at the KMDA. I remember those steps that were splattered with blood, because that was the headquarters of the Revolution. I was immediately surprised by the protesting-looking people, who were clearly armed with pistols on their belts. When I already moved to Ukraine, I immediately got into Azov. From that moment on, I was already active in the Azov Civilian Corps. This is such an organization, which later turned into the National Corps, so to speak, the civilian wing of the Azov Dvizh. I attended the first ideological training school, just as the corn service was created in the summer of 2014, and I joined the regiment on September 1. - Please tell me specifically about your military experience. -My real and serious military experience began in the Russian Volunteer Corps (Red . hereinafter RDC), because everything that happened before that proceeded somewhat differently. Since 2015, I have been in the -Azov- regiment as part of a sabotage and reconnaissance group. We organized ambushes and attacks on enemy strongholds during 2015-2016. At that time, combat clashes were of the order of three times. The rest of the time we were engaged in patrolling, mining, training. Then I ended up in the corporal service of the -Azov- regiment - this is such an educational ideological service that was built into the army system. In 2018, I resigned from -Azov- and started working in Azov youth organizations. These were national wives, which later turned into -Centuria- - an organization that works with youth. A 3rd separate assault brigade also appeared directly from there. I was there and participated in the operation to unblock Mariupol. Later, I took part in some more operations, but the way my service in the RDK took place is completely different. I became a mortar team commander there. It's one thing to fight as an infantryman, not understanding the overall plan, not taking part in certain planning actions. Already directly in the composition of the RDK, I commanded the calculation, and then the unit, understanding the scale, organizing and planning the combat work, because I had a clear picture in front of me of what was happening in the serious directions, where the enemy's losses from our fire amounted to tens and hundreds of 200 them Therefore, I believe that my military career began directly in the RDK. I joined them at the beginning of 2023. — From the moment you were released from the Azov regiment to the start of a large-scale operation, how has your life turned out? in the -National Wives- organization organized by him. Our tasks were to show Ukrainian nationalism with a human face in order to strive for elections and all those things -that are not available in Russia.- I was a lecturer there. A large number of guys who actually went to war from 2022 and became our friends passed through this organization. There we constantly organized trainings and various events, traveled to all the cities of Ukraine, held entertainment events related to shooting, knife fighting, and sports. In that format, I represented the pan-European component of the composition. That is, we had lecturers who spoke specifically about Ukrainian nationalism, and I was more detached from politics, leaning more towards European history. I came up with the -Scythian Power- seminar series, which talked about the Scythian past of Ukrainians and Scythians in general as a civilization that was unfairly forgotten, although it boldly takes its place among the greatest civilizations of the Ancient World. In general, we constantly came up with activities that nurtured the youth with the right values, which later became Centuria. And there I continued this work. As the year 2022 approached, we were already concentrating on the coming large-scale war, because everyone understood that it would happen after all. They conducted trainings and ideologically charged people, why it is necessary to fight and told about moments related to combat work. - Did you come to Ukraine for the first time in 2014? - No, I was in Ukraine for the first time at the end of 2011. Then they came with a concert to Kharkiv. In general, in the past, Kharkiv was the cultural center of Ukraine in our circle. First of all, this is the Kharkiv right-wing scene — a phenomenon known to the whole world, which was important not only for Ukraine, but also for European listeners. It is a beautiful city that was really nice to visit. In general, the bands from Kharkiv had quite a strong influence on me, including thanks to them I got to know the Ukrainian language back in 2004, because I listened to their music. - How did the large-scale invasion begin for you? -I woke up at 10 o'clock when the war was raging everywhere. Got together and immediately went to our base. It was difficult to get there, because there was a column of people fleeing from Kyiv at the exit. I parked the car, brought people who were also walking and were already ready. Then we moved to another building because we thought there might be shelling. Then they began to organize, and the formation of that unit, which later received the name -Azov-Kyiv-, actually began there. —Did you take a direct part in the battles for the Kyiv region? —I became the deputy commander in our unit and I did not take a direct part in the battles. We went to temporary bases and there I was engaged in organizational work. With a submachine gun in my hands, I went to the blockade of Mariupol. Unfortunately, our idea was not implemented, because already on the spot it was not possible to simply break through the first line. — There were moments in Kyiv when everyone was scared. Did you think that this could be your last day and you would die? —I was sure that I would die in Kyiv. Right at 90%. This is my favorite city and it would not be scary to die for it. There were thoughts that we would get out of it in an organized manner if it was surrounded and bombed. There was no direct fear, because my whole life consisted of a struggle, and I cannot devalue my life by giving up the struggle. Yes, no one was holding me, I could cross the border calmly and freely, but I could not do so. I don't see my life outside the Ukrainian dvizh. Yes, if the war goes to Russia, then of course I will continue to fight there. And in general, all my musical and ideological activities, they have always been in Ukraine. I motivated others to war, and then how could I refuse it myself? Did you ever think that we would all die here? Yes, but it is not scary to die for Kyiv, but the essence is primarily in the people. I think it's better to think in terms of people rather than territories. If I thought so, I would not have left Russia, where life is not like that at all. The people of Russia live like poor people: in hardship, bad conditions, injustice, but at the same time they listen to songs about the -great land-. Although that land is not theirs either, that's why people are important. I was with those who are valuable to me and with those ideas that I carried and realized in creativity. - How did the blockade of Mariupol take place? -It was planned for the moment when we had not yet become the 3rd separate assault brigade, but were still the Azov-Kyiv unit. It was early April 2022. We reached Zaporizhzhia, then further along the populated areas and advanced to the positions. I was with the commander of the Centuria. Together we were there on the second line, so we did not see the enemy. The first line was not able to break through and everyone already knows how the course of hostilities went. There was such a story that a tank was driving, in which was the Hero of Ukraine. He was hit, and he climbed out of it, climbed into another tank and went into battle again. this is a truly incredible story that touches the heart. We stayed there for a day, and then had to return to Kyiv, after which we already left for the Zaporizhia direction. At that time, I was working in the media service there. Closer to autumn, the RDK was formed and it became clear to me that I should move there, because all service opportunities will be in the ranks of this unit. Now I have a team with which we can do large tasks, especially when I am assigned calculations from other departments. - Why did you decide to join the RDK in particular? -First of all, the commander of the RDK-is my old friend who was able to do such a great thing and break through all the bureaucratic hurdles. To tell the truth, at first it seemed that this could not even happen. I thought so, because why was this not done back in 2014, after the Maidan. Then many Russian boys came and took part in it. Even then, we wanted to make a Russian corps in order to influence the politics of Russia. In general, the emergence of our organization is connected with specific tasks, which are primarily of a political nature. I know that this war is about the idea of ​​freedom and slavery, that is, people of different nationalities can take one or another position. And fighting for freedom means working with people who choose the position of good. Nothing in our world is static, people can change their views and opinions, it depends on what information field they live in. It is clear to me why they did not work with Russian nationalists before, because this story has always been stigmatized in the world. Nationalists have always been portrayed as stupid and evil people, but the situation has not changed at all. In fact -it is among the nationalists that the largest number of ideologically minded people, if we talk about volunteers. After talking with them, you immediately understand that these are people who are ready to give their lives for freedom. Nevertheless, in the mainstream world media, nationalists try to be portrayed as the guardians of slavery, but this is a mistake, because we stand for freedom, unlike those people who try to suppress this will. - Why did you join the mortar group? -When I came to RDK, a mortar group was being formed there. With my friend from -Azov-Kyiv- we discussed where to move next and it turned out that the transfer process to RDK went faster for him. I was held back by some circumstances that I was doing in the media service and then in recruiting. When I already officially transferred, I thought that it would be cool and logical to apply the knowledge that I once received at the military department, and at the same time, in an ironic way, thank the university and the department where I received the knowledge and the rank of artillery lieutenant. In general, the meaning of my life isfollowing the ideals of justice. By serving Ukraine, I feel that I am restoring at least a little of this justice. I thought it would be really cool to be the leader of a mortar group, because in reality, a mortar and a barrel art are not very different, and from a command point of view, the difference is very little. I came to a meeting of commanders in different directions and proposed my candidacy. - How did the battles take place in the Avdiiv direction? -That operation was the most vivid for me personally. That was exactly one year ago. Our group was standing there, firing from the same position. Then we killed more than 100 Russian soldiers, and there were also many wounded. A video where the entire landing was littered with enemy corpses made its way onto the Internet. This is exactly the landing on which we worked with calculations. In general, we controlled two landings and worked specifically on them. Then I understood that the stories about meat assaults are not fairy tales, because I saw them with my own eyes. Once (at that time I personally commanded a mortar unit at the position), we destroyed more than 30 enemy personnel in half an hour. Yes, there were still adjacent units helping us, but for the most part we repelled that assault. That is, a group of invaders just came, we eliminated them, but we were surprised by the fact that no one came after them. Maybe someone was running away. But the rest are wounded and killed. It was winter, we saw everything in the stream and literally in a few hours the wounded were also considered dead. —How did the enemy carry out their assaults in the Avdiiv direction and what tactics did they use? —At first they went in larger groups of 20-35 people. Then they began to walk by 10-15, and later generally by one or two. We understood that the enemy had deliberately reduced the number of infantry in this way, because it is impractical to shoot at one person with all types of weapons available to us. By the way, where we controlled the landings, the enemy did not break through until the decision was made to withdraw from Avdiivka. We also worked with neighboring units that gave us a picture of where to shoot. Not far from us was the 47th -Magura- brigade. We were constantly on the radio and once a fighter died there, so it was discussed there for half a day. That is, when someone from the Ukrainian side dies or is injured, it is a great grief that everyone experiences and starts to act to take the person away. And on the Russian side, it's just like a flowing river, where everyone doesn't care. This is commonplace for the Russian military. It was in that direction that the Avdiiv operation lasted for about two months, and then we went to provide the -Road of Life-. We also worked a lot there. I was appointed the battery commander not only of our comrades, but we also had defenders from other units. When we first got there, we had one dangerous place. I went there with a friend and we conducted reconnaissance there, set up positions. Then, in a few days, we equipped positions and set up mortars. After that, we went to the control post, where we had several sleepless days and managed the operation. In reality, everything was very shaky there, because there was only one road left, which the enemy had not blocked, and the boys were going out along it. If this operation had failed, then there would have been a tragedy and there could have been many prisoners from the Ukrainian side. - Tell us about your raids on the territory of Russia. -In fact, they were successful operations. We had a second event in the Grayvoron area. There we entered the village of Kozinka. It was our mortars that did not enter Russian territory, because they shoot forward for 5 km, but they stood at the very border. Then we were most surprised by the number of KABs, because the invaders themselves demolished half of the Russian village with them. I was personally pleased that these ruins are on the territory of Russia, because when we constantly sit in similar places, it happens on the territory of Ukraine and is quite painfully perceived by us. And such a moment became quite symbolic, because it is important that the war was on the territory of the enemy. With their KABs, they turned this village, which was considered quite elite and with expensive houses, into -moonscapes-, thereby warming our souls. There we also destroyed about 40 occupiers with our mines. — Then the RDK took part in the battles for Vovchansk and Aggregatny Zavod. What can you tell us about it? —Then we expected that there might be an attack and the encirclement of Kharkov, then it was all taken very seriously. But, when the whole Russian brigade -ran- towards Vovchansk, reaching the middle of the city, their last point was the Aggregate Plant, where they jumped. Before the battles in the city, we went to Vovchansk, when we conducted reconnaissance. In general, the city was quite lively. Literally in a week there was hell&#8230; Now it is empty, all the houses that were intact are now simply demolished to zero, there are not even the ruins of the first floor. This moment made the release of the Aggregate Plant quite difficult. In September, RDK and other units, with the help of a smoke screen (which we created with projectiles from mines), broke into the territory of the plant and advanced for several weeks. Later, the invaders who were there were captured. In total, there were about 30 soldiers of the Russian army there, and ours captured 15 occupiers. It was just an ordinary motorized rifle unit. Among them was one Russian GRUshnik. The capture of the plant was a highlight, as it was the first time a plant had been liberated. They usually have negative stories associated with them. The most interesting thing is that the enemy for quite a long time disbelieved, saying that they did not lose the Aggregate Plant. And just recently, propagandists wrote in one rather large Russian public that they left the factory, although 3.5 months have already passed. - Why is your call sign -Hammer-? -That's the name of my group and that's how the call sign came about. Moloch is actually a combination of the two words Molot and Moloch. In black metal, this is quite important in pronunciation itself, such an ending reminds of some barbaric and brutal names from the Lord of the Rings universe. - How often do people from Russia try to contact you to join the RDK? - Such situations happen all the time. I even remind that if people contact RDK, then they should write in the chatbot to those whom they respect. You can always write in private messages to Denis—the commander of the RDK. You can write to me or others who run social networks, but do not write comments, because fsb hunts such people. They work there: create lists of those who leave comments under similar posts and pages (although we, of course, are closed) and these commentators pass raids. I know the person to whom they were heated purely for leaving a comment. Dozens of people are included in the lists of FSBShniki and they go to them every month, checking correspondence and that they are happening at home in general, because they say immediately that they are the enemies of the country. Also, to get to us, people can contact the recruiting chatbot of RDC. - What events or people formed your view of creativity? culture Later, in my teens, I began to admire music and this is probably the main and key event in my life. After all, I write music, poems, I do the production of concerts, clips, albums, and all this is closely linked to the fine arts. In fact, it is a combination of all kinds of art in one such cultural phenomenon. I was influenced by heavy music, the most radical form of metal - Black metal. At first, I just liked, and then I realized that such music has certain magical properties and on the one hand is part of rock music, but at the same time similar to ritual shamanic music. The rhythms of extreme and heavy music are so accelerated or slow down that the idea of ​​rhythm is lost. Then the music becomes deeper and in this genre the quality of music is in the place of atmosphere. That is, tools can not be written specifically, but this will have a special sound. It is difficult to explain music in general. The idea of ​​creating music - is the idea of ​​creating magic among the world where nothing holy is left, so everything is so good. - How are your ideas born in creativity? Is it a long process or more spontaneous solution? - I think both. Creativity - develops well when a person has free time. When I was put in prison in Russia, I developed my work very much there and wrote many poems. When a person is busy, he has less time for creativity. However, there are also nuances here. Being at the exit (it was in the beginning of 2023), we sat in a landing in the Zaporozhye region, where I invented the topic for the track -MLA over Bakhmut-. Just then there were cruel battles and I thought it would be a cool comparison of events there with the atmosphere of Howard Lavraft's books. But there, just instead of ominous characters from the books of Lavraft, we had special forces from the Wagner PEC and Storm-St. The idea of ​​war generally awakens the other horrors that are people. I write music when the instrument gets into my hands. That is, I play the guitar, if I do not forget to write it on the video, then super. The lyrics are born less often because the volume of information that goes through me through the - is difficult to concentrate somewhere, but my time, because I have a lot of luggage of unfulfilled creativity. While the old is implemented, there will be a lot of space for the new one. The last album -Hammer-, for example, was recorded for 10 years, because in parallel with it were Singles and other projects. We are now working on Occult, which we started from 2017 until now. The war gives the basis for creativity, but at the same time gives the right to talk about high things. Singing about the war and not being a military, it is not a clear concept for me. It was important for me from childhood that creativity corresponded to the individual. - When the idea of ​​creating a band first came about? Then it was a punk rock. But we already wanted to have a band. It seemed to me in a clear way to express myself in the world. In general, it is easier to write songs than, for example, a book, but on the other hand, the song can crystallize their worldviews and the fact that people will sing them - will affect their spiritual development. At the age of 16, I studied and could not teach someone something, but when in 2004 we recorded our first solo album, it turned out that it was serious in content and even now is not ashamed to listen and perform it. I was interested in philosophy, history, art since childhood. The meanings I read and admired, I digested them through myself and poured into my work. Thanks to the musical taste and therefore the cultural background and the genre, we have such success in our circles. —What do you have projects except the band? It concentrates a bunch of different genres, which is why the public loves them. At the same time, I have a whispering run. It was created to create a semi -ethnic, folk, acoustic side of my creativity, but later became a year and a distinctive feature of this project is that the vocalist - is my wife and I sing a little. Although other vocalists also perform songs there. We wanted to first separate the whisper of the runes, but the project came out in another genre, the type of ethno-year. Just different albums always sound different. For our listeners, this has become a separate kind of art that harmoniously complement each other. I also have a project that, on the contrary, goes towards a radical blackout. The hammer has become more versatile. There is an Okultt project, which in heavy and dark metal. I have said that we have been writing an album since 2017, because there is one demo version and sings, but the album never came out, because we were constantly working on other projects. I also devoted a lot of time to working on my friend's project with the call sign -Nezhegol-. The last album we recorded him with musicians who work with the hammer band, and he sang, so everything happened so well. With it we are another project, one song was even recorded. Now and so many events, so I think that in February there will be another material in the style of punk rock. Those who love our creativity will appreciate. - your concerts have always been special energy. How did it take the stage for the first time after three years of widespread? - was the same as -to- - cool. There were many young people in the hall. We have created asgardsrei Festival to be lavier, which took place in Kiev every year. People from Europe even came there. At the end of 2024, this concert was better, because the youth was more charged, they sang the choir, because they understand the text, there is an exchange of energy. For our absence on stage, a new generation of listeners has grown over these three years, because working with young people allows you to look into the future. It is they who leave these particles in themselves, and it is actually an impact on the future. In general, our recent Yule Night concert - was a powerful and cool phenomenon. In fact, for 3 years of widespread, the Russians gave a concert in the center of Kiev, but everyone understands the nuance &#8230; It is like that during the Second World War, the Poles would come to a concert to the Germans. And here the question is that nationalism has changed. It is about freedom, not nationality, although propaganda dictates exactly. That is, the idea of ​​value dominates the idea of ​​origin. If you reach the ultimate sense, the ideas of spirit dominate the idea of ​​the flesh. We were born in Russia, but chose the side of good - of Ukraine. There are Ukrainians who were born here but went to the so -called -LNR- or -DNR-. That is, the old ideas of nationalism said that where you were born, you should be. Now it's not at all. The more the spirit wins, the more we are to achieve the right goals.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/29/pro-rejdy-na-byelgorodshhyni-zvilnennya-agregatnogo-zavodu-ta-ideologiyu-moloth-istoriya-komandyra-minometky-rdk-oleksiya-lovkina/	2025-01-29T01:30:09-08:00
We can use shells, we can use drones - our gunners destroyed several enemy guns	The video of the blows was published on January 29 on the brigade's channel. Our gunners used both traditional methods of destroying the enemy's artillery - with shells (the enemy's ammunition also exploded) and new methods, when the enemy's guns were hit by drones. Traditionally, our pilots damaged the muzzles of Russian guns, where it is most difficult to replace them. -To destroy the enemy's guns, we use both artillery fire and drone strikes. We can do everything,- the team commented on the video. As reported by ArmyInform, soldiers of 45 separate artillery brigade named after General Myron Tarnavsky destroyed enemy cannon in the eastern direction.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/29/mozhemo-snaryadamy-mozhemo-dronamy-nashi-artylerysty-znyshhyly-kilka-vorozhyh-garmat/	2025-01-29T01:17:06-08:00
The Ministry of Defense is introducing a new model of food supply for the Armed Forces	About informs Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. The new contract has significant differences from the current supply model. From now on, the contracting functions of manufacturers go directly to the DOT, and the logistics operator remains only responsible for: completeness, timeliness and quality of transportation to the military units of food; warehouse operations at own facilities; coordination of processes of shipment of goods; documentation support and payment closing. This will make procurement processes more transparent and more manageable. The key goal of the project is to optimize the interaction between all participants of the supply chain, increase the efficiency of logistics and strengthen the quality control of products before their delivery to military units. -This is an important step to modernize the food system. The new format will make processes transparent, efficient and convenient for all parties. The separation of logistics and procurement functions will ensure the highest quality of products that will go to our military,- Hleb Kanevskyi, director of the Department of Procurement Policy of the Ministry of Defense, emphasized. The pilot project involves continuous monitoring of results for further improvement and scaling up to other regions. -We are already seeing significant interest from well-known Ukrainian brands. Thanks to the open selection of manufacturers, products familiar to them from civilian life will appear in the diet of the military,- added Halyna Litosh, director of the food program of the DOT. As reported by ArmyInform, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine working on the development of lightweight women's body armor and conducting military (research) tests of windproof winter jackets and trousers for female servicemen.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/29/minoborony-zaprovadzhuye-novu-model-postachannya-harchuvannya-dlya-zsu/	2025-01-29T01:07:13-08:00

-Vampire- saving lives: how military transfusiologist Rostislav Zauralskyi saves the wounded on the ...	The story of the military transfusiologist was published on the page of the Medical Forces Command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Rostislav Zauralsky has been working with donor blood since 1997. His first experience was in the maternity hospital, where he was in charge of the blood service. Thanks to his innovative approach, the institution became one of the leading ones in the country, and the Department of Transfusion and Enzyme Therapy was unique in Ukraine. In 2014, when the war began, Rostislav could not stay away. He saw that the wounded were brought to the hospital grounds already dead. The cause is massive blood loss. Then he realized that it was necessary to transport not only soldiers to the hospital, but also blood to them. This is how the -Blood Saves Life- project was born. To ensure the prompt supply of blood to the area of ​​hostilities, Rostislav began to develop mobile transfusion stations - -blood trucks-. Today, this is already the sixth modification of the unique transport, which is equipped with everything necessary for collecting, checking, storing and transporting donor blood. The equipment of a full-fledged blood bank is located inside an ordinary-looking minibus: transfusion systems, test tubes, devices for thawing plasma and heating blood. Most importantly, this process can be done simply while driving to get the vital resource to its destination as quickly as possible. During the war, Rostislav Zauralskyi and his team saved thousands of lives. If during the ATO and OOS he transported half a ton of blood per year, now this volume is transported every month. The record is 176 blood transfusions per day, which is a phenomenal indicator. The use of fresh-frozen plasma at the pre-hospital level made it possible to improve the survival rate of seriously injured patients by 30%. Today, -Vampir- continues to improve the blood service system in the Armed Forces, extending it to all military units. Its goal is to provide each branch of the army with modern facilities for the collection, storage and transportation of blood, so that no soldier dies due to its lack. Every day, hundreds of Ukrainians in peaceful cities donate blood so that it reaches Rostislav and his team in time. It is thanks to such people that military doctors get a chance to save the lives of our defenders. Rostislav Zauralsky is not just a doctor. This is a person who found a way to restore the lives of those who risk their own for the sake of Ukraine. And while the battles continue at the front, -Vampire- continues its struggle - with blood loss, with time, with death. As ArmiyaInform reported, Ihor from Chutivsky district of Poltava region is one of those who bear the burden of war every day. He is a grenade launcher of the 16th separate motorized infantry battalion of the 58th brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. His job is defend positions and repel enemy attacks.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/29/vampir-shho-ryatuye-zhyttya-yak-vijskovyj-transfuziolog-rostyslav-zauralskyj-ryatuye-poranenyh-na-peredovij/	2025-01-29T00:32:49-08:00
The Ministry of Defense has started its own production of FPV drones	This became known on January 29. . Within the framework of the pilot project that started in December last year under the general coordination of the Main Directorate of Defense Innovations of the Ministry of Defense, the state got the opportunity to produce codified FPV drones. As part of a tripartite agreement, a private developer granted a license for the production of UAVs on the basis of one of the state-owned enterprises belonging to the sphere of administration of the Ministry of Defense. It is foreseen that the produced products will be sent to units of the Defense Forces of Ukraine. After working out the production technology and its scaling, the SOE will be able to independently participate in the tenders of the Defense Procurement Agency and other potential customers. -The experience is positive. Thanks to the integration of the state into production chains, we got a clear understanding of the cost of drone production and our competitive advantages in this market. This will make it possible to improve the quality of finished products at the expense of constant competition,- commented First Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Lieutenant General Ivan Gavryliuk. Specialists of the Main Department of Defense Innovations of the Ministry of Defense worked out the road a map of the organization of similar productions together with other developers of unmanned aerial systems (UAS). Thanks to this, it is possible to significantly increase the production capacity for scaling the production of Victory means. -Ready to expand cooperation with private companies. We have a package of template documents and step-by-step instructions for launching similar lines for the production of BPAK at other state-owned enterprises,- said the head of the Main Department of Defense Innovations, Yuriy Taraniuk. As reported by ArmyInform, the Ministry of Defense works on lightened bulletproof vests and winter clothing for military women.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/29/minoborony-rozpochalo-vlasne-vyrobnycztvo-fpv-droniv/	2025-01-29T00:25:33-08:00
Enemy propagandists took over a village in the Luhansk region — the 10th Army Corps refutes the fake	announced this on January 29 10 Army Corps of the ZSU. According to his information, as early as January 26, a video was published on the enemy Telegram channel -Russian Kharkivskaia oblast-, which is actively distributed by pro-Russian channels of social networks, with the raising of the Russian flag on one of the buildings of the village of Novoyehorivka, Luhansk region, which proves the fact that this settlement was allegedly taken under control Russian occupation troops. -It has been established that this building is located in the settlement of Kovalivka. Based on the plot, the enemy is trying to spread a narrative about the rapid advance of his troops in this direction, to demoralize the personnel of the Defense Forces and the civilian population. And also to receive information about the placement of SOU units in this direction, to inflict fire damage,- said the message of the 10th Army Corps. During the reconnaissance, it was established that the informational operation to plant the flag was prepared in advance (on January 23), the object was chosen so that it was impossible to identify the location (population), as evidenced by data from radio interception. -After the spread of this plot, which was intended to hide the enemy's heavy losses during the assault without achieving success as such, probably the command of the -West- will raise a number of questions about misleading the top military and political leadership, commanders on the ground. Attention public and media! The settlement of Novoyehorivka is under the control of the Armed Forces,- the 10th Army Corps assured. As reported by ArmyInform, the Russian propaganda machine was once again -reborn- with another fake. This time, the Kremlin dreamers report that the Armed Forces of Ukraine are supposed to -leave Kurshchyna- by Easter, and ensure peace by May 9.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/29/vorozhi-propagandysty-uzyaly-selo-na-luganshhyni-10-armijskyj-korpus-sprostovuye-fejk/	2025-01-29T00:17:19-08:00

The spokesperson of the Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine told about this in the air -Suspilne.Novyny- Dmytro Pletenchuk. According to him, Russian explosives are periodically thrown onto the coast, which is constantly responded to by anti-mine units. Mine -clogging- is also prevented in the area of ​​the grain corridor. -You see that there are no incidents with mine threats. Precisely because this is a work that is carried out by Ukrainian military sailors all the time,- said Dmytro Pletenchuk. As for the global mine threat in the waters of the Black and Azov Seas, this, according to the spokesman of the Armed Forces Navy, is a deferred problem. It can be solved only by carrying out a full-scale operation. -But that will only be possible after this war is over. After reaching the appropriate level of security that will allow this operation. We are preparing for it. This is work for years, unfortunately,- said the spokesman of the Navy. ArmyInform told earlier that the terrorist country will continue the -ecological war- in the Black Sea, because it will not stop transporting oil on emergency vessels. The task for the Russians is simple - despite everything, sell resources, because money is needed for the war.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/29/peretvoryly-na-vybuhove-zvalyshhe-u-vms-zsu-rozpovily-pro-minnu-nebezpeku-vid-rosiyan-v-chornomu-mori/	2025-01-28T23:29:33-08:00
-This is war, everything is different here-: the story of a drone-bomber operator with the call sign...	The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. Despite his chronic illness, Oleksandr repeatedly came to the TCC to mobilize, but was refused. However, a year ago, during a trip to Transcarpathia, he was served with a summons, and he became a soldier of the 128th OGSHBr. Due to health problems, the -German- had legal grounds to serve in the rear, but he asked for a combat unit. -I immediately said that if I'm going to serve, I don't want to wipe my pants in the rear,- says Oleksandr. - He asked where the brigade was now, and when he heard that it was in Zaporozhye, he asked me to be sent there, closer to home. They offered me a position in the drone division, and I agreed.- After undergoing thorough training, the -German- began to perform combat tasks. He is a universal soldier - he can be a navigator, a pilot, prepare a combat unit for a drone. -Ordinary infantry grenades for drones are not always effective, it is necessary to make specific explosive devices, and I periodically deal with this. But we also use classic ammunition,- Oleksandr says. According to him, the brigade has many productive sorties. In Robotyn, the -German- with his -Baba Yaga- drone chased the Russians, stopped the assaults, and destroyed armored vehicles. Once, having received information about two Russian MTLBs with infantry, which were moving towards Ukrainian positions, he changed course right in flight and successfully worked on them. -Relatives sometimes ask if I have come to terms with serving in the war. But I'm fine, it's not term service, everything is different here. I can't say that I am the master of my life, because at any moment a command may arrive for combat departure - this is war, - says the -German-. -It's dangerous here, of course, but it's much easier from a moral and psychological point of view.- Oleksandr's wife and daughter left for Germany after the start of the full-scale war. For the first time, the fighter was able to see his relatives only two and a half years later, when he received leave. -My wife and daughter came to Dnipropetrovsk region, and after my vacation they returned to Germany again. My daughter is not even 5 years old, we haven't seen her for two and a half years (only occasionally communicated via video link). But on vacation we had such a feeling as if we had not parted at all, and the thought did not even cross my mind that there was a stranger near me or that I did not know something about her. The wife and daughter settled down well abroad, but after the war they will return home, we talked about it many times. I also don't see myself anywhere except Ukraine, I don't even consider other options. - shares Oleksandr. As reported by ArmyInform, 25-year-old Oleksiy, a fighter of the 92nd brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, -svij-dosvid-na-vijni/->who controls the reconnaissance drone Shark, passed the infantry and does not know firsthand what war is. He was awarded the -Defender of the Fatherland- and -Cross of Ground Forces- medals, and was twice awarded the -Golden Cross- by the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. With the modesty and sincerity of this guy, it is hard to imagine that he has met death on the battlefield more than once.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/29/cze-vijna-tut-use-po-inshomu-istoriya-operatora-drona-bombera-z-pozyvnym-nimecz/	2025-01-28T23:24:13-08:00

- Today we are stronger - Rustem Umyerov honored the memory of the Heroes of Krut	The Ministry of Defense announced this on January 29. -Today we honor the young volunteers who in 1918 stood up to defend the independence of Ukraine. Their heroism, faith in victory and sacrifice became an example of boundless love for the Motherland. Then their struggle was left without proper support, and Ukraine lost the chance to preserve its independence. But today we are stronger: we have the defense industry, the support of allies and the unity of the people, which has become our most important resource,- said Rustem Umyerov. In his opinion, the main lesson of Krut is to avoid discord and mistakes of the past. -Only unity and joint struggle will lead us to Victory and a just peace. We remember the Cool Heroes.

-The main thing is to keep your head on your shoulders-: the story of a grenade launcher from Poltav...	The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. Every day, the Russian occupiers try to destroy it by all possible means: aerial bombs, artillery, mortars and drones. However, he remains steadfast and even finds the strength to joke. -It was much more difficult in Donbas, there were constant assaults, even phosphorous ammunition was used. It's also dangerous here, but the main thing is to be attentive and careful,- says Igor. Once, he and a comrade miraculously escaped fire when 82-mm mines filled their small dugout. -We were sitting in a 2×2 meter shelter, we realized that we would not survive there for a long time. They decided to run out - and in time, because the 120-mm mortars started working immediately,- the fighter recalls. Despite the danger, Igor confidently performs his work. The guy also talks about his experience using the RPG-7, which he considers reliable and effective: -You can make several shots if you don't hit right away. When you see the enemy running away after being shot, it's encouraging.- Thanks to his perseverance and professionalism, Ihor destroyed an enemy sabotage group, for which he received a state award - the Order -For Courage- III degree. His story is an example of the dedication and true fighting spirit of Ukrainian soldiers. -Work is work, however hard it is. The main thing is to keep your head on your shoulders,- concludes Igor.

VAB armored personnel carriers: how French equipment saves Ukrainian infantry on the front line. Arm...	ArmyInform visited one of the -Anna of Kyiv- mechanized battalions, which is equipped with French VAB armored personnel carriers. The crews of these combat vehicles talked about their capabilities and advantages, what tasks they perform on the front line, as well as the specifics of military training in France. -Basically, the French VAB armored personnel carrier is an armored vehicle of the front edge,- says Oleksandr, driver-mechanic. He comes from Volyn. In the brigade since August 2024. Combat vehicles arrived at the units of the brigade several months ago. -The VAB (Vehicule de I'avant blinde) armored personnel carrier is translated from French as 'front edge armored vehicle.' From this follows its main purpose - to deliver infantrymen to the battlefield under the cover of armor as quickly as possible. Our defenders also use vehicles to evacuate the wounded, transport provisions, water and even ammunition. By the way, up to 10 people can be accommodated in the landing compartment of the machine, not including the crew - the driver-mechanic and the machine gunner. The landing compartment is quite roomy inside, the seats are soft, so comfortable conditions have been created for the landing. The communication system with the crew and the landing party for communication is working. In general, the machine shows itself well during combat trips to the front, although the VAB was manufactured in the 70s of the last century. Among the advantages of the armored personnel carrier is good passability on wet fields and swamps. In addition, the car is able to overcome small water obstacles with the help of two controlled water jets. There were situations when the car overcame terrain soaked in -wire tangle-. Then the wheels, axle and gimbal were wound. But that didn't stop the undercarriage. What is interesting, the tanker boys said that once their tank was so wound up with wire that the car did not go any further. Automatic gearbox. Renault engine. Weight up to 13 tons. Power reserve up to 1000 km. The French car is maneuverable plus very fast, for example on the track it can develop a speed of up to 100 km/h. Even on the ground, the armored personnel carrier moves up to 80 km/h. These technical features actually greatly increase the chances of escaping an enemy FPV drone attack. The speed of the car is also important because it is necessary to deliver the wounded guys to the stabilization point. This should be done as quickly as possible, the lives of our fellow citizens are worth their weight in gold. The APC is equipped with a large-caliber Browning M2 machine gun, which is covered by an armor plate. The machine gun is installed in the front part of the armored personnel carrier above the machine control compartment. The hatch opens from the inside, the soldier stands at full height and can fire. The machine gun is quite effective against infantry, various fortifications, unarmored and lightly armored enemy targets. The effective firing range of the machine gun is up to 2000 meters. Combat sorties and the delivery of troops to the front line are always a danger. The enemy is waiting for us. Therefore, we use Browning for fire suppression of the enemy. From work experience, this is a rather serious weapon, which does a good job of -stitching- the positions of the Rashists. How we usually work: there is a team for departure, we leave almost at dawn, when the weather is still -gray-. At that moment, the enemy is just rotating his -fpvishok-, switching from televisions to daytime. Depending on the combat situation, weather conditions and areas in the area, we deliver infantry almost to the position. It can be a distance of even 200-500 meters to the enemy. The armored personnel carrier has a welded body made of armored steel sheets, which provides protection against small arms fire and projectile fragments. The VAB is additionally equipped with a deployable anti-drone net to counter Russian FPV drones. In addition, the car is equipped with an electronic device. Just the other day, a neighboring armored personnel carrier from our unit was attacked by mortar fire. It cut the armor on the sides, but the hull survived. The machine did not stop and completed the task to the end. The guys inside were a little muffled, but it's ok. Fortunately, it has not yet been necessary to test the durability of French armored personnel carriers against air strikes, in particular from drops from FPV drones and attacks from kamikaze drones. We include the EW as we advance into the area of ​​the front line. Interestingly, the VAB has a self-inflating wheel system. Also, each wheel of the armored personnel carrier is additionally equipped with rubber, which works according to the principle of a pillow. If the wheel is pierced by shrapnel, this cushion allows the vehicle to continue moving without stopping, which is very important during enemy fire. We had cases when one wheel was punctured, but the APC left its position on its own at the front edge. In fact, the car traveled 50 km with a flat tire, while moving at a speed of 40 km/h. This technical feature saved the crew of the car, and the paratroopers, and the armored personnel carrier itself. France became the first country to fully train and equip an entire brigade of the Armed Forces with weapons and military equipment. It became the 155th separate mechanized brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine -Anna Kyivska-. There is a lot of information and speculation on the Internet about our studies in France. It is necessary to tell people the truth. We were prepared very well. The training lasted 1.5 months in the eastern region of France - Grand Est. The training of driver mechanics was actually carried out from the basics. These are the tactical and technical characteristics, equipment and combat capabilities of the VAB armored personnel carrier. After the theory, there are practical lessons on driving cars on the road, difficult terrain, overcoming water obstacles, delivering and disembarking troops at high speed during the day and at night, loading and unloading BC. Learned to carry out easy -repair manipulations-. There are different situations, so you need to be able to fix the equipment. They studied the capabilities of the Browning M2 machine guns, fired from them at various targets, on the spot and while the vehicles were moving. Moving and non-moving tall figures, some shelters were impressive. I will say from myself, for better efficiency, you need more time to prepare. A month and a half is not much time, as it seems. Of course, the French instructors taught 100 percent. They explained everything on their fingers, tried to convey as much educational materials to us, the listeners, as possible. The French have everything clearly according to the plan and instructions. Dialogues on the subject of the Russian-Ukrainian war were held with them constantly, and sometimes they had to argue. They have a custom: their unit will never go into battle unless outnumbered by more than one to three. I explained to them: I say, in Ukraine, during the offensive of Russian troops, the Armed Forces do not have such a luxury and are unlikely to ever have it. It included a video and showed how the enemy infantry is advancing with mechanized equipment, how much equipment the enemy uses only on one section of the front, and so on. He explained that the Russians have much more manpower and combat equipment. In France, they lived in a modular town on a landfill. The sleeping quarters were divided into sectors. Residential block for 12 people, nearby house with toilet, shower, sinks and washing machines. The dining room was at the same distance from residential buildings of different sectors. Meals, gyms, opportunities for recreation, in short, the French organized simply excellent conditions for studying and leisure for Ukrainians. We thank them for everything!-, adds Oleksandr, the driver-mechanic.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/29/btr-vab-yak-franczuzka-tehnika-ryatuye-ukrayinsku-pihotu-na-peredovij-reportazh-armiyainform/	2025-01-28T22:15:51-08:00

Battle near Kruty: the story of a brilliant defensive operation	But the events that unfolded, both before and after the Battle of Kruty, did not inspire optimism. Proclaimed in the conditions of the war with Bolshevik Russia, the Ukrainian Republic gradually turned into an occupied territory&#8230; the Russians in 1918 brought to Ukraine the same as in 2014: robbery, rape, arrests, shootings&#8230; But the majority of residents of Ukraine at the beginning of 1918 behaved passively and aloof, not wanting to participate in the defense of their native land, like the residents of Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk in 2014. One government, another - what difference does it make, what flags are there? As a result, Ukraine became part of the Bolshevik empire for 70 years. And everyone who had two legs had to fight. Those who did not fight for Ukraine were forcibly mobilized into the Red Army and died for the interests of Moscow. Stubborn ones were shot, others were imprisoned and sent to Siberia. The same thing is happening now in the territories occupied by Russia. Honoring our heroic predecessors, we remember the Battle of Kruty and know that only properly equipped and trained Armed Forces are the key to preserving statehood. Today ArmiyaInform reminds of what happened 107 years ago. The war between the RSFSR and the Ukrainian People's Republic began with the -Manifesto to the Ukrainian People with Ultimate Demands to the Ukrainian Rada- prepared by Vladimir Lenin. This official document of the Bolshevik Council of People's Commissars was adopted on December 16, 1917 at a meeting of the Soviet People's Committee in Petrograd and the next day telegraphed to the Central Rada in Kyiv. The document demanded unconditional support and assistance from the Ukrainian government to the Bolsheviks in Ukraine. For the answer, Lenin gave 48 hours: -in the event of not receiving a satisfactory answer to these questions, the Council of People's Commissars will consider the Council to be in a state of open war against Soviet power in Russia and Ukraine.- This happened after the unsuccessful Bolshevik uprisings in Kyiv and Odesa, as well as the release from the control of the UNR of parts of the Donbas Revolutionary Committees. On December 19, 1917, the Minister of War of the Ukrainian People's Republic Simon Petliura made a stunning statement at the Central Rada congress: -A campaign is being prepared for us! The Bolsheviks are concentrating their army to defeat the Ukrainian Republic&#8230; The first echelons from Gomel are approaching Bahmach!-. On December 21, Bolshevik Red Guard units led by Volodymyr Antonov-Ovsienko entered Kharkiv. On the night of December 22, they took possession of the city. On December 25, the Bolsheviks held the so-called All-Ukrainian Congress of Soviets in Kharkiv, at which they announced the creation of the -Soviet UNR- with the capital in Kharkiv. The Ukrainian People's Republic headed by the Central Council was declared illegitimate. The next day, Russian-Bolshevik troops began to advance from Kharkiv deep into Ukraine. On December 31, Soviet Russia captured and controlled part of modern Kharkiv region, Luhansk region, and Donetsk region. Also, Bolshevik units occupied the Zhmerinka district on the right bank within the Ukrainian People's Republic. The Bolshevik horde was rapidly advancing towards Kyiv. At the time of the proclamation of the Fourth Universal (January 22), the troops of the Ukrainian People's Republic lost Kharkiv Oblast, Poltava Oblast, Katerynoslav Oblast, and eastern Chernihiv Oblast. The headquarters of the Kyiv Military District expected that the main blow of the enemy would come from the side of Poltava (it was there that the freshest and most combat-capable units of the Army of the Ukrainian People's Republic were directed: the 1st hundred Sich riflemen, the combat regiment of black haidamaks of the 2nd Ukrainian military school, the Serdyutsky detachment named after P. .The head of the regiment is a total of 500 soldiers). But Muravyov went on the offensive in the Bakhma direction. About 400 cadets - senior officers and cadets of the First Ukrainian Military School named after Bohdan Khmelnytskyi, who at that time already had combat experience (some of them even went to the fronts of the First World War), as well as the fighters of Kurenya Smerti, a volunteer unit formed from soldiers who returned from the First World War, and free Cossacks from the city of Glukhova. older people who had combat experience. The battle lasted about six hours. Only in the evening, the Krut defenders were forced to retreat in an organized manner, mainly because they were running out of ammunition. Losses wounded and killed, according to the testimony of the commander of the units at the positions, centurion Averkiy Honcharenko, amounted to 10 officers and about 250 soldiers - mostly wounded young men of the 1st Ukrainian Military School. The dead, according to various sources, were from 70 to 100 soldiers, while the losses of the Bolsheviks, according to one of the reports, reached up to 300 people killed. The most tragic episode of the battle near Kruty was the death of a group of students who got lost during the retreat and went to the station, which at that time was already occupied by the Bolsheviks. Enraged Red Army soldiers the next day shot all the prisoners with explosive bullets. On their way out, the Krutyans dismantled the railway track, which delayed Muravyov's advance on Kyiv for several days. These days became decisive in the negotiations that were ongoing at that time in Brest, and provided an opportunity to conclude the Brest Peace Treaty with the countries of the Quadruple Alliance, one of the main points of which was the international recognition of the Ukrainian People's Republic. However, at that time perhaps the most formidable enemy was the Bolshevik agitation. As Simon Petliura wrote: -Criminal agitation against the Ukrainian People's Republic is mainly carried out by people who are not citizens of our Republic and who came from Great Russia and other countries of the former Russia. These people, instead of thanking our Ukraine for the bread they eat here, commit various rebellions, sow anarchy, rob the civilian population, engage in sabotage, provocation and speculation.- It was Bolshevik propaganda that turned some Ukrainized regiments from allies into potential opponents, as happened with Kuren. T. Shevchenko, who stood in Nizhyn and, having declared neutrality, was a threat to the defenders of Krut. It was she who pulled reinforcements from important areas of the front. So, 300 soldiers of the 3rd Haydamatsky Regiment, led by Simon Petliura, were supposed to come to the aid of the Krut defenders, but they had to return to Kyiv to suppress the Bolshevik rebellion at the Arsenal plant. The riot at Arsenal lasted 7 days and was subdued only on February 4, at the cost of extraordinary efforts. The armed action in Kyiv greatly facilitated the advance of the Bolshevik troops, because the way to Kyiv actually remained open. The Ukrainian military, tired of street battles, were unable to resist Muravyov's army, which at that time approached the outskirts of the city. On February 4, in Darnytsia near Kyiv, Muravyov issued an order for the -merciless destruction of all officers, Haydamaks, monarchists and all enemies of the Russian revolution.- During the storming of Kyiv, poisonous gases were used, massive artillery shelling was carried out (up to 15,000 shells). The population of Kyiv, which at that time reached 430,000 people (of which up to 20,000 were military personnel, soldiers and officers of the old imperial army), was generally indifferent to the struggle of independent Ukrainians against Soviet revolutionary formations. Moreover, the Kyiv pro-Russian public (in modern parlance - -Zhduns-) initially even sympathized with the Bolsheviks, but later paid dearly for their spineless position. Muravyov recalled: -I occupied the garden, hit palaces and churches- beat, showing no mercy to anyone! The Duma (Kiev) asked for a truce. In response, I ordered to suffocate them with gases. Hundreds of generals, and maybe even thousands, were mercilessly killed&#8230; So we got our revenge. We could stop the wrath of revenge, but we didn't, because our slogan is to be merciless!- In occupied Kyiv, the Bolsheviks organized the -Red Terror.- There were robberies, violence, and murders. Representatives of the intelligentsia, soldiers and civilians were shot. Up to 5,000 people were victims of the massacre, including Metropolitan of Kyiv and Halytskyi Volodymyr Bogoyavlenskyi, General Secretary of Land Affairs of the Ukrainian People's Republic Oleksandr Zarudnyi, and Central Rada member Isak Pugach. About a thousand officers and generals were also executed - B. Bobrovsky, A. Acceleration, Ya. Safonov, N. Ivanov, Ya. Handziuk and others. In general, terror and violence, including mass confiscation (looting) of private property, arrests, executions, forced labor, forced mobilization, the organization of famine, etc., was a typical Bolshevik practice in all the territories they occupied. The UNR was saved from being absorbed by Bolshevik Russia in 1918 by the Treaty of Berestei with the countries of the Quadruple Union, signed on February 9.

Earlier, information began to spread among Slovak publications that the Prime Minister of Slovakia, Robert Fico, during a meeting of the parliamentary committee on economic issues, continued the conversation about the transit of Russian gas through Ukraine, calling the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyi, an -enemy- of Slovakia. -To the knowledge of the current Prime Minister of Slovakia. A few days ago, President Trump made a strong decision that will make it possible to significantly increase US LNG exports, particularly to Europe. This is what is needed for security and stability - more energy resources from partners for Europe,- the President of Ukraine noted. According to him, you have to pay for American LNG with money, but for Russian gas you have to pay not only with money, but also with independence and sovereignty. -Many people in Europe have already gone through this and chose to preserve their independence and sovereignty. But not Mr. Fitso. He chooses Moscow over America and other partners who can provide his country with gas on commercial terms. This is his mistake,- Volodymyr Zelenskyi emphasized. He noted that everyone in Europe needs to be forward-looking and develop relationships that strengthen our peoples. At the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine declared that the Prime Minister of Slovakia Robert Fico against the background of falling confidence among the Slovak society and protests against his pro-Russian course, resorted to looking for enemies and found them in Ukraine. -We regard these yet another absurd statements as an attempt to shift the responsibility for our own failures in domestic policy onto foreign states and leaders. We advise you to look not over the border, but in the mirror,- the message says. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs noted that the Ukrainian side has repeatedly warned about the danger of the pro-Russian policy of Slovakia's leadership. -The result is obvious: Robert Fico and individual members of Slovakia's parliament have been poisoned by Russian propaganda, have stopped distinguishing between black and white, and have already begun to call the leaders of neighboring friendly democracies -enemies.- We are sure that such a position and policy of Robert Fico goes against the choice of the people of Slovakia to be an integral part of the European Community,- the Ministry of Foreign Affairs assured. As reported by ArmyInform, previously Volodymyr Zelensky stated that Putin instructed Fico to open a second energy front against Ukraine at the expense of the interests of the people of Slovakia.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/29/vin-obyraye-moskvu-prezydent-ukrayiny-prokomentuvav-zayavy-prem%ca%bcyer-ministr-slovachchyny-shhodo-rosijskogo-gazu/	2025-01-28T21:56:06-08:00

-Stingers- will be enough for everyone, the formula for finalizing the war and 200 -Hraks-: an exper...	How has the number of enemy airstrikes in this direction changed? But why did the infantry assaults of the enemy decrease? This was told by military expert Petro Chernyk. -The number of aerial bombings by the Russian Federation on Kurshchyna has increased. If at the beginning of January they used heavy bombs of the caliber FAB-100, FAB-250, because they are the most massive, somewhere between 3 and 24 per day, now this indicator has increased. the Russians raised it to almost forty strokes. Why does this happen? As we always analyze in two planes. The first and most important is geopolitical. There is already a lot of information that, they say, in this year's cycle of dry weather, the formula to finalize this war will be found. For the Russians, both in terms of prestige and purely in the military component, it is extremely important to get our troops out of Kurshchyna before the start of the negotiation process. This is very important. Because if the Defense Forces of Ukraine will still be there at the moment of finalization, it means that we will have the right to change Kurshchyna&#8230; Let's say I'm a big supporter of what's called the Zaporizhia Nuclear Power Plant&#8230; Therefore, this is a tell-tale sign that the finalization process has in fact acquired new qualitative features and is moving towards its completion. We must remember that the use of heavy aerial bombs means exposing our aviation, first of all, to the work of portable anti-aircraft missile systems. For example, we are the second country in the world to stock FIM-92 Stinger. At most, it was this portable anti-aircraft missile system that the Americans restored and put on the assembly line, because at the beginning of the zeros this system was removed from the arsenal. Do the Russians have a margin of safety, primarily in tactical aviation? Their most massive attack aircraft is the Su-25 Hrak. Russians use it quite often. They have some: before the start of the large-scale invasion, there were up to 200 machines in the line-up, and they still have about 200 machines in storage and have begun to de-conserve it. And the stockpile of bombs, in fact, is not counted in thousands, but in tens of thousands of units. That's quite a lot of potential. Plus, a very important detail is that the Russians managed to improve the quality of their bombs as part of the universal planning and correction module. Some bombs have managed to integrate this module already even with a small engine and declare that from the moment of reset to the point of impact, they have increased this distance to somewhere up to 80, even up to 100 kilometers. The general conclusion is as follows: the increase in rocket-bombing in Kurshchyna is a strategic sign that it is essential for the Russians to knock out our contingent, and not to get it out. Another very interesting cut in Kurshchyna is the reduction of large infantry ramparts. If there were about 50 of them per day, now they have decreased to 13-14. What does that mean? The first point is the so-called anticipatory extermination. the Russians can put no more than 40-45 thousand personnel into service for a month, because otherwise they have to announce a large mobilization. According to the results of December, the total loss of their personnel is more than 48,000. These are anticipatory actions on the march. Why did we manage to show such huge figures in Kurshchyna? First of all, thanks to the operation of our rocket salvo systems and simply unique cluster ammunition. And another phenomenal piece of work, especially over the past year, is our FPV drones. There are cases of aiming not just at a person, but at a separate part of the body, say, at the knee or at the head. In general, when it comes to FPV drones, we are delivering unprecedented results. So the lack of infantry - the North Korean contingent did not justify itself at all - and the very high-quality use of cluster munitions explains for the moment the decrease in the number of infantry assaults as such. But this does not mean that the Russians will not return to them. Let's not forget that they have up to three million mobilization resources, and at one time they produced more than 100 million Kalashnikov assault rifles of all types and varieties. Of course, there are not 100 million in warehouses, but what is there is quite a large stock.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/29/stingeriv-vystachyt-na-vsih-formula-finalizacziyi-vijny-ta-200-grakiv-ekspert-pro-kilkist-shturmiv-ta-aviaudariv-na-kurshhyni/	2025-01-28T20:45:57-08:00
U-2S Dragon Lady: America's spy plane protecting global security	As stated in the profile article of the world-renowned encyclopedia Britannica, the U-2 is a single-seat high-altitude jet aircraft that was used by the United States for intelligence gathering, surveillance and reconnaissance, according to ArmyInform. Perhaps the most famous reconnaissance aircraft ever created by engineers, the U-2, also known as the Dragon Lady, has been in service with the US Air Force since 1956. The prototype aircraft made its first flight back in 1955, and the last aircraft in the series was built in 1989. Experts of the Dutch defense portal Army Recognition emphasize the fact that from the moment of creation to the continuous evolution of the U- 2S demonstrates not only technological resilience, but also adaptability, making it a key tool for ensuring information superiority in an era where data dominance is key to operational success Known for its exceptional ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance) capabilities, the U-2S Dragon Lady has been a cornerstone of global security since its introduction into service with the United States Air Force in 1956. Developed during the Cold War era, the U-2 has undergone significant upgrades, with the current U-2S variant introduced in 1994. Over the decades, this aircraft has adapted to changing mission requirements, consistently integrating advanced technologies to stay at the forefront of modern defense needs. It is expected to remain in service until at least the 2040s, continuing its legacy as a vital ISR platform. The U-2S has an advanced set of technical capabilities designed to operate at extreme altitudes, thanks to the General Electric F118-GE-101 turbofan engine, which allows it to maintain flight above 70,000 feet (21,336 meters). Such a high operational ceiling allows it to perform missions that are far beyond the reach of most air defense systems. The aircraft's impressive wingspan of approximately 104 feet (31.7 meters) increases its lift and endurance, allowing it to fly missions lasting more than 12 hours with a range of more than 7,000 miles (11,265 kilometers). Equipped with a payload capacity of 5,000 pounds (2,268 kilograms), the U-2S can integrate advanced ISR systems, including electro-optical and infrared instrumentation, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), and signals intelligence (SIGINT) equipment tailored to a variety of mission requirements. The key to the success of the U-2S Dragon Lady is its modular design with an open architecture that allows for rapid integration and demonstration of advanced technologies. While traditional platforms require years of development to incorporate new advances, the U-2S can do so in a matter of weeks thanks to improved size, weight, power and cooling (SWAP-C) features. These features not only make it a flexible ISR platform, but also a testing ground for next-generation capabilities, ensuring that it is always one step ahead of emerging threats. SWAP-C stands for an optimized balance between size, weight, power and cooling, which ensures that the aircraft can carry extended payloads without compromising performance. The platform's Open Mission Systems (OMS)-compatible avionics system exemplifies the versatility of the U-2S. OMS is a modular architecture standard that supports a plug-and-play approach, enabling seamless integration of new mission-specific payloads, sensors, and capabilities. This adaptability ensures that the U-2S is not only relevant today, but also ready for the increasingly complex requirements of tomorrow's battlespace. The U-2S is ideally suited to meet the demands of future warfare, where dominance depends on the ability to collect, process and share data at unprecedented speeds. Its advanced data processing capabilities give warfighters access to operational intelligence, reducing the time from data collection to decision-making. Using machine-to-machine (M2M) communication, the U-2S provides seamless data transmission at the tactical, operational and strategic levels, improving coordination across the board. M2M communication involves the automated exchange of data between systems without human intervention, which enables faster and more accurate decision-making. This capability is particularly important in the context of Joint All Domain Operations (JADO), a military concept that emphasizes the integration of capabilities in the land, sea, air, space and cyber domains. The U-2S fills this gap with robust networking capabilities, enabling interoperability and providing a decisive advantage in complex multi-domain environments. Recently implemented program The Avionics Tech Refresh further strengthened the U-2S's position as an ISR platform. With advanced electronics and OMS compatibility, the aircraft now supports the rapid adoption of advanced technologies. This upgrade makes the U-2S the first fully OMS-compatible fleet, significantly reducing integration costs and timelines while providing unparalleled flexibility in adopting new mission capabilities. This technological leap not only expands its existing ISR capabilities, but also positions the U-2S as a tool for future combat operations where speed, flexibility and adaptability will be key determinants of success. The U-2S is operated by a single pilot in a fully sealed cockpit. The aircraft routinely flies at altitudes in excess of 70,000 feet, well above commercial air traffic and the operating ceiling of most other aircraft. U-2 Dragon Lady pilots undergo rigorous training and wear specialized full-pressure suits similar to those used by astronauts to withstand the extreme conditions at such altitudes. A team of ground personnel, including mission planners and technicians, support each flight to ensure the aircraft operates efficiently and safely. During the decades of their service, the U-2 planes wrote many significant pages not only in the history of aviation, but also in international politics. The same profile article about this device in the Britannica encyclopedia reminds us that this particular plane, while performing a secret mission, was shot down by an air defense missile over the Soviet Union on May 1, 1960, which led to -Affairs U-2-. And in 1962 during -Cuban missile crisis- U-2 took photos that confirmed the placement of Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba. As the US military continues to adapt to a more complex global environment, the U-2S Dragon Lady remains at the forefront of providing information superiority. Its ability to work hard at high altitudes, its modular design and advanced avionics make it an invaluable asset for today's missions and tomorrow's tasks. The U-2S is not just an airplane. It is a symbol of innovation and adaptability in the pursuit of global security. From its unrivaled ISR capabilities to its role in shaping the future of multi-domain operations, Dragon Lady is a testament to the power of combining proven performance with cutting-edge technology. As the battlespace evolves, one thing is clear: the U-2S Dragon Lady will continue to soar, protecting the skies and providing warfighters with the critical information they need to win the battles of the future.

Peace before Easter and May parades: Russian fantasies in Kurshchyna	This myth is a typical example of how propagandists try to keep their own population in the illusion of -control over the situation.- Imposing the idea that Ukraine has some -secret agreements- to withdraw from Kurshchyna is a way to quell panic among the Russian population, which in recent months has actively felt the approach of war in their own homes. Try to explain to the residents of the Kursk region why after every air raid signal they have to run to the basements, even though -everything is going according to plan.- Kurshchyna is a strategically important region bordering the northern part of Ukraine. The tasks of our units here are clear and multifaceted: So while Russian propaganda invents the next -graphs- of Ukraine's defeats, our soldiers are already systematically crossing out all the enemy's plans. Russia, losing on the battlefield, bets on information warfare. The goal of such fakes is to demoralize Ukrainian society and inspire its own. But here they are waiting for another failure. Ukrainians have long learned to distinguish truth from lies, and sarcastic memes on the topic of -ensuring peace by Easter- have already spread faster than Russian methods. The Armed Forces of Ukraine will not only leave Kurshchyna, but will also continue to destroy the enemy where it is necessary for the defense of Ukraine. And as for -May 9-, it is better for the Russian command to prepare not parades, but evacuation routes. The Ukrainian army has already shown that it knows how to work in advance. So let Russian propaganda continue to paint its scenarios of -peaceful life-, but we know that real peace will come only when the last occupier leaves our land. And no -holy date- will prevent this.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/29/myr-do-velykodnya-i-travnevi-parady-rosijski-fantaziyi-na-kurshhyni/	2025-01-28T20:12:12-08:00

-My guardian angel is always there-: soldier Oleksiy about his experience in the war	The soldier's story was made public on the brigade's page. Oleksiy joined the army when the enemy approached his native Zelenodolsk in the Dnipro region. Working as a security guard at an energy company that was constantly under fire, he couldn't stay away. -I chose the 92nd brigade, because my friend already served here and spoke a lot of good things about unity and fighting spirit,- Oleksiy shares. Oleksiy's first combat experience was full of fear and adrenaline. -You have exactly two seconds to be afraid, then stupor - one second, and do your thing,- he recalls the words of his brother. During the assault on Klishchiivka, their APC came under fire, but they all survived. Then Oleksiy began rescuing his wounded brothers. -I managed to help three guys and since then I realized that it's okay to be afraid, but ineffective, you have to act,- he says. The most difficult thing for Oleksiy was not the battles themselves, but the way to the positions and back. -Six-eight kilometers in one direction under the crosshairs of enemy shells is quite a test,- the fighter shares. -At first the enemy drone hangs, and then they start to hack.- According to him, the guardian angel was always there, because during his service he was not seriously injured, although he suffered contusions that impaired his vision and hearing. Despite all the difficulties, Oleksiy is sure that two years of service have changed him for the better. -Before, I was kind of -torn-, now I have become more organized, united and meaningful,- he says.

-Chess game- with the enemy: the story of a sapper -Monaco-	The soldier's story was published on the brigade's page. Before the war, -Monaco- lived in Poland, where he was engaged in landscape design and growing Christmas trees. However, when the full-scale invasion of Russia began, he could not stand aside. -I came to the Armed Forces to make efforts so that Ukraine lives,- Monaco says. It is interesting that in 2013 he tried to join the long-term service, but was rejected due to his health. However, the war changed his plans. In July 2022, he returned to Ukraine and went to the Military Commissariat. After some bureaucratic difficulties, in the spring of 2023 he signed a contract with the ZSU and entered the training center. There he was offered to become a sapper, and he accepted. -A sapper is a game of chess with the enemy. The greater your imagination, the more effective the work,- Monaco explains its choice. During this time, -Monaco- together with its sister company installed thousands of mines and hundreds of kilometers of engineering barriers. On one occasion, they successfully destroyed a platoon of invaders by blocking their path with anti-personnel mines. -All the 'gifts' worked,- recalls Monaco. Of course, the work of a miner is associated with constant risk and stress. -There are moments of uncertainty and fear. But you understand: you have to make the task of the infantry as easy as possible. You always have to have a cool head to control the situation,- says Monaco. He also admits that he once experienced burnout and a panic attack, but thanks to the support of the commander, he was able to cope with it. The war changed the life of -Monaco-. The circle of his friends has narrowed, because many are now far away. -My morning starts with breakfast and sleep. Because I'm at work at night,- he says. -Monaco- has a girlfriend, but he does not want to talk about her publicly. However, he readily talks about his future children. -When they ask me who the Russians are, the answer is simple - the ones who wanted to kill your father,- Monaco says. As reported by ArmyInform, a machine gun with the call sign -Patron- from the 141st separate mechanized brigade of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine became a real nightmare for Russian drones. From the moment of entry into service in 2023 >he destroyed about 70 enemy UAVs, turning the elimination of drones into a kind of -hobby-.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/28/shahova-partiya-z-vorogom-istoriya-sapera-monako/	2025-01-28T04:22:44-08:00

A philosophy that respects everyone's time, efforts and dignity,- said Kateryna Chernogorenko, Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine for Digitalization. According to her, the electronic referral to the VLK is the first step in a large-scale reform that will build a new, transparent and convenient approach for conscripts.

According to Ruslan, his first days at the front were a huge test, but also an important stage in his life. -We got to the East, the guys who fought since 2014 said that even they had never seen such a hell. They could not imagine that this would happen,- the fighter recalls. And although hard trials awaited him at the front, the hardest battle was within him. -I don't know such a person who would not be afraid. Everyone is afraid, but the most difficult thing is to overcome yourself,- says Ruslan. During the occupation of his native village, in the Kyiv region, Ruslan saw with his own eyes the cruelty of the enemy: -I myself was in the occupation, I saw everything with my own eyes, how our village father was shot, how civilians were shot for nothing. This cannot be forgotten.- He remembers how there were masked snipers on the outskirts of the village who opened fire on civilians without any reason. Such moments are remembered for a lifetime. Ruslan also notes the importance of service for his family and fellow villagers: -Almost everyone serves here, even elderly men are also in the army. I myself, sitting at home, reconsidered my role and place in our society, so I firmly decided to go serve.- He says that it was not just a military duty, but also a way to fight back against those who are trying to destroy his country and people. The fighter, like many others, continues his struggle for peace and freedom of his native country, regardless of difficulties, fear and losses.

-24/7 we live in victory-: the commander of the UAV calculation about her front-line experience	The defender's story was made public on the brigade's page. -The most important thing in war is cohesion, mutual support and readiness for any challenges,- Anastasia says. Anastasia started her military career back in 2014 in the border troops, when she was 18 years old. Later, she signed a contract and served in the Armed Forces of Ukraine. With the full-scale invasion beginning in February 2022, she returned from overseas with no doubts about her duty. -Returning to the service was an obvious choice for me. The main thing is that the closest person in my life - my mother - supported me in this,- Anastasia recalls. Currently, Anastasia heads the all-male unit and works on the modern Poseidon unmanned aerial vehicle complex, carrying out reconnaissance missions. The main goal is to identify the enemy's heavy equipment, weapons and manpower. To effectively manage the complex, Anastasia and her team have undergone specialized training. -At first it was difficult to imagine how to lead a unit where most of the men are much older than me. But in practice, everything turned out to be simpler. We have achieved excellent interaction, we understand each other from the bottom of a word,- says Anastasia. Anastasia is sure that the role of a woman in the army has become an integral part of the modern army. Her own example demonstrates that women can perform the most difficult tasks and make key decisions in wartime on an equal footing with men. -I don't feel any difference in the way I am treated as a woman. The main thing is to know your responsibilities and perform them at the highest level,- she says. She is sure that the modern Ukrainian army is no longer possible without women, who not only perform tasks, but also make key decisions. Despite all the difficulties, Anastasia maintains strength of spirit. -What motivates me is that 24/7 we live in victory. We have to drive the enemy out of our land so that no one ever wants to do it again,- she says. As ArmiyaInform reported, junior sergeant Denys with the call sign -Gif-, a tactical combat instructor of the 38th separate brigade of marines, is an example of indomitability and dedication to his work.

The spokesman of the 33rd separate mechanized brigade told about this on the -Social News- broadcast. Nazar Voytenkov. In general, according to him, the situation is consistently the same — the occupiers are trying to move in small groups, which is now a typical Russian tactic. No armored assaults, instead — attacks by forces of one, two or three. -These attacks have to be repelled every day. Conduct reconnaissance in the air and adjust artillery fire, aim mortars, and tell our infantrymen what is happening several hundred meters ahead. Their main task is to find positions in which they can gain a foothold. Then they use such -shuttles- to drop new personnel there,- said the spokesman of the 33rd separate mechanized brigade. The main thing in this tactic, as Nazar Voytenkov said, is to move constantly. Use a truly inexhaustible number of personnel. So the Russians move and die en masse. -Despite the fact that we mine the areas, and they come across our mined areas, despite the fact that the FPV constantly destroys them from the sky, they leave. It really feels like it's just a mass of meat. It's really a resource, it's not people,- he said. As reported by ArmyInform, the situation in the Pokrovsky direction remains quite complicated.

ATACMS replacement: Pentagon eyeing PrSM Inc's new missile weapon 5	As noted by portal of the Army Times magazine, American generals said that development of a promising modification is underway at an early stage missiles PrSM conditionally the fifth version, which could significantly expand the army's strike capabilities, ArmiyaInform reports. -We are in the science and technology stage of what we may eventually call Increment 5,- said Brigadier General Rory Crooks, director of the Long-Range Cross-Functional Precision Fires Group. According to the plans of the developers, Increment 5 should have significantly larger dimensions than its predecessors. First of all, the length, which will probably allow combining a range of more than 1,000 km with a fairly powerful warhead. However, a kind of payback will be the refusal to use the existing MLRS/HIMARS launchers. They want to use unmanned launchers for launch, and precisely due to the abandonment of the cabin with the same dimensions (perhaps using the same chassis as in HIMARS, at least such an unmanned vehicle has been tested for some time) it will be possible to place a longer transport-launch container. In general, we can say that these are plans for the development of a separate new missile complex with only partial use of common components. Rory Crooks separately explained that initial work on a fifth option is already underway. And the initiative to implement scientific ideas and developed technologies will begin in fiscal year 2026. The idea, he said, is to develop a missile that can be launched from an autonomous vehicle. According to the implementation plan of the PrSM project: PrSM missiles of the first four versions have a length of approximately 4 m, limited by the dimensions of the launcher. Case diameter is 430mm. The increase in flight range, compared to the previous family of missiles, was obtained due to the introduction of a new solid fuel engine, a lighter warhead and other solutions. Now the relevant service of the Pentagon is in the process of using the first Increment 1 projectiles from Lockheed Martin, declared as a way to hit targets at a distance of at least 500 km. Over the past few years, the US Army has been developing four other PrSM missiles, designed to replace the Army's MGM-140 Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) and to be launched from both the M142 High Mobility Artillery Missile System (HIMARS) and the M270A2 MLRS. According to analysts of the Dutch portal for researching defense strategies Army Recognition, the development of Increment 5 is a key step towards the integration of autonomous technologies for advanced military operations. Despite significant technical challenges, this initiative underscores the United States military's desire to push the boundaries of long-range precision strikes. If successful, PrSM Increment 5 could offer significant strategic advantages in future military scenarios. Although the PrSM Increment 5 project remains conceptual, it reflects the Pentagon's clear desire to modernize its arsenal with the help of innovative technologies. The program's trajectory will depend on progress made in the coming years, with potential implications for future warfare. Development of the PrSM Increment project for the US Army.

Zatrofeev -Vintorez-: the story of an airsoft player -Andrew-, who became a paratrooper	The military heroism is confirmed by high awards - he is a Knight of the Order of Bohdan Khmelnytskyi and the owner of the -Silver Cross- of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the -Cross of Airborne Assault Troops- and the -Path of Honor- of the 46th Separate Airmobile Brigade of the Russian Air Force, awarded with a brigade ring and an award-winning weapon . -Andrew- is from Shostka in Sumshchyna, but has been living in Kyiv for a long time. In civilian life, he was the head of the sales department of a large international company that traded rolled metal. -Trumpets are everywhere,- jokes the soldier, recalling that he also had to be a mortar gunner during his service. The future officer first joined the Armed Forces in 2004 as a conscript soldier, studied at the Zhytomyr Military Institute named after S. P. Korolyova, majoring in electronic warfare. However, a military career did not attract the young man, so after the end of the -line- he returned to civilian life. The armed aggression of the Russian Federation forced them to join forces again. In 2015‒2016, the man served in the State Border Service, protecting the northern border of Ukraine in the Sumy region. -Then I didn't get into the real war, but now I'm raking it in full,- smiles the officer. The call sign -Andrew- is a tribute to the civilian hobby of playing airsoft, in which the future officer acquired and improved his combat skills. The service experience convinced the man of the need to always be ready to stand up for the defense of Ukraine, and the desire to independently acquire and improve the skills of shooting combat led him to this team military game. -The knowledge that was given in the army was not enough for me. Therefore, I decided to take up airsoft to improve my tactical skills. Later, a lot of gaming experience was really needed in the army,- says the soldier. The annual training sessions, which he regularly attended as a reservist in the 95th Separate Airborne Assault Brigade of the Polish Army, became just as useful. So, before the start of a large-scale invasion, -Andrew- had good military training. -Andrew- remembers the 2017‒2021 Annual Meeting of Reservists with respect and gratitude. He emphasizes that it was they who made it possible for Ukraine to have a sufficient number of trained fighters to withstand the first months and throughout the year after the beginning of the large-scale Russian invasion. -By February 2022, we had a sufficient number of trained reservists who had passed through the combat zone and had combat experience. Preparation was established, attention was paid to the formation of territorial defense, training meetings were held regularly. Reservists dragged out the war in 2022,- he says. So when the Russian Federation launched a large-scale attack on Ukraine, first of all, those who already had combat experience and regularly underwent retraining during military meetings were recruited into the Armed Forces. This explains the frequent stories of TCC rejections to inexperienced volunteers in the first months of the 2022 invasion. Since -Andrew- was a reservist of the 95th Separate Airborne Assault Brigade of the Polish Brigade, he met the first weeks of the invasion as part of this unit. Took part in the defense of Boryspil airport. And already in April 2022, together with other fighters, he was transferred to the 46th separate aeromobile brigade of the Russian Armed Forces. At the beginning, the soldier recalls with a smile, he had a different call sign - -Grudnichok-. Once one of the commanders saw that, after a hard day of combat, the man was sleeping as calmly and calmly as a baby, and jokingly called the soldier -Breast-. In memory of this old call sign, -Andrew- wears a patch on his forearm with the image of a baby in camouflage with a machine gun. -From April to June, we had a battalion reconciliation. Then they went to the south, fought in the Kherson region. He took part in the battles for Biloghirka, Davidiv Brid, Velika and Mala Oleksandrivka, Trifonivka. Then I reached Dudchan,- the officer recalls. On October 25, 2022, near Dudchany in the Kherson region, -Andrew- received two bullet wounds - one in the back, the other in the hand. The soldier was being hunted by an enemy sniper, but he was saved by a high-quality bulletproof vest. -That bulletproof vest saved me,- the officer shows the bullet mark. He now wears the bullet, which the armor protected, around his neck as a pendant. He was able to return to action after treatment and rehabilitation in March 2023. With a higher education - at one time -Andrew- graduated from the Interregional Academy of Personnel Management - the soldier could apply for the primary rank of officer. The command was happy to meet the desire of a capable, experienced and responsible fighter. -Officer courses in Odessa lasted two months. Plus I was lucky - I got to study in Germany for a month. They have a very good material base, high-quality training protocols. I really liked that they put a lot of emphasis on storming trenches and buildings. -Not everything we were taught works the same way in our war, but they laid a very good foundation,- recalls -Andrew- gratefully. After completing his training and returning to Ukraine, -Andrew- was given the rank of junior lieutenant and, as an educated and experienced man, was appointed to the position of deputy company commander. At this time, he had to take part in offensive actions in the South in the area of ​​the Robotynsky Salient. -There we encountered the Russian special forces of the 45th separate special purpose brigade of the airborne troops. This is considered elite among them, but we showed them that we are better,- says the officer. It was there that he managed to capture a unique trophy - the Russian Vintorez silent-shooting sniper rifle. -My photo with her has been around the Internet for a long time, so I can brag a little,- smiles -Andrew-. From December 2023, -Andrew- became an acting company commander, and soon after, a company commander. He fought in one of the most difficult areas of the front - the Marinsky and Kurakhiv directions. I watched how the nature of hostilities was rapidly changing. -The war has changed a lot. It began to change already in 2023 during the battles on the Robotynsky ledge. The mass use of FPV drones began, they radically changed the war. There used to be artillery, infantry, aviation, and now there are also drones,- notes -Andrew-. Being able to move covertly and camouflage in the terrain, counter drones with the help of EW and shoot down enemy drones with sniper fire is what determines the ability of fighters to survive on the battlefield and complete the combat mission. -Andrew- believes that this is what infantrymen should be taught first of all. -If you are struggling, if you are being pressed by the enemy, it means that you are a key point in a big defense mechanism. You are important in this place and at this time. Everyone needs to be where they need to be and do their job as efficiently as possible,- emphasizes Andrew. Addressing men who are hesitating about mobilization, the officer emphasizes: everyone is actually afraid of war, even the most experienced soldiers who have been fighting on the front lines for more than a year do not avoid this fear. The main thing is to overcome fear and not follow the coward's path of shame, but the warrior's path of honor. -Fear is a natural thing. If a person is not afraid of anything, then he is just stupid. You just need to be able to control your fear. It should be overcome, listen to commanders, believe in yourself and make the right choice,- the officer is confident. Because the -Path of Honor- is not only a high award of the 46th separate airborne brigade of the Airborne Assault Forces. This is primarily the choice of every defender of Ukraine.

Tactics -The Walking Dead-, or How to stop the enemy near Pokrovsk. ArmiyaInform report from Donetsk...	Oleksandr from Vinnytsia region. Already more than 5 years in the army. In the brigade, he started as a scout in a regular infantry unit. During the operation of the Joint Forces, he performed tasks on drones. With the beginning of the large-scale invasion of the Russian Federation, the brigade repelled the offensive of the invaders in the south of Ukraine, in the Kherson region. He has extensive experience in piloting and striking the enemy from various UAVs in different areas of the Russian-Ukrainian war front. Now the enemy is destroying Donbass. -The use of Maviks on the front is an extremely urgent need today, primarily in matters of situational awareness and control over the situation on the battlefield. This is reconnaissance of the enemy's positions on the front edge plus the depth of his battle formations up to 12 km. With the help of drones, the locations of manpower and firepower are determined, artillery fire is adjusted and the enemy is struck by drops of combat units. The command determines priority targets for destruction and gives instructions for combat use, for example, brigade artillery: calculations of guns, self-propelled artillery installations and mortars. It can also be FPV drone crews. We destroy the enemy depending on the type of targets and the distance to them. The drone has a good optical camera that allows you to shoot high-quality video from a height of up to 6 km and transmit it to the operator's console, and a thermal imager can monitor the situation at night. Optimally, -Mavik- can carry 600 grams of a warhead, maybe more, of course. Everything above is difficult for him. The motor overheats and sometimes it can just fall. At a discount. We cling to everything that can kill the invaders. Currently, the format of ammunition is very diverse: grenades, VOGs, combinative resets, thermobars, -ignitors-, explosives and high-explosive fragmentation bombs. Usually, we use fragmentation projectiles against the enemy's manpower, and high-explosive and cumulative drops for other purposes. Everything depends on the combat mission and the characteristics of the targets to be hit. If we need to stop small assault groups of the enemy, then, of course, we use shrapnel drops. To inflict maximum damage on the enemy and prevent his further attack. If there is a shelter, you can dismantle it with explosives. The dugout is covered with some kind of wood, then you can bring in a -lighter-. And if you find an enemy field warehouse with ammunition, you can drop a cumulative charge, a -lighter- or a high explosive to blow it up. A combat unit must be prepared in advance for each combat mission. In the Pokrovsky direction, the Rashists use the tactics of small assault groups. Every day, the occupiers gather at some point in the locality, the first to go is a group of 5-7 people, armed with assault rifles without BC. They are trying to advance to the afforestation to take advantageous positions for themselves. We see all this, we monitor them. At the stage of gathering the enemy, we strike at them. Half of the raschits are destroyed immediately, others with injuries flee to the sides and are shot. But not for long. Very often the Rashists themselves kill themselves with grenades, other -walkers- with injuries crawl and die from massive bleeding. It reminds us of the story pictures from the top American post-apocalyptic TV series The Walking Dead. That is why we sometimes compare rashists with -walkers- from this series, who wander aimlessly around the area and -ultimately- die from the bullets of the main character, policeman Rick Grimes and his men. Interestingly, another assault group of Rashists steps on the corpses of their own men. No one helps the wounded, and even more so no one evacuates them from the battlefield. The kamikaze mortals climb further, and we continue to -ground- the invaders. There are days when the Mavik crew performs only reconnaissance tasks. We -cut- a specific area of ​​the terrain, fly out and conduct observations. In today's conditions, it is important to increase the duration of the flight task. For this, we additionally attach a battery. Usually, we stand in for 4 days on combat duty. This is optimal for intensive combat work, and during these days another shift can sleep, deal with current issues and recover. Our positions are relatively close to the front line, in camouflaged shelters. So that the enemy does not discover our location. We are great prey for the Rashists, so they are looking for us 24 hours a day. Likewise, we are looking for the positions of their FPV drone crews and Maviks. It's a -counter-drone fight- of sorts. On days of combat work, when we work with Maviks with drops, we manage to destroy (hit) up to 60 occupants. This is with the wounded, who, of course, do not survive. It is about only one Mavik crew. There are other UAVs of the -Height Predators- unmanned systems battalion. They also -slice- rashits daily. When it comes to FPV drone crews, they usually manage to destroy the enemy more. After all, their functionality is only striking the enemy. Our crew is engaged in aerial reconnaissance in parallel. Plus, if we talk about the comprehensive defeat of the enemy by all means of defeat of the -Predators of the Heights- battalion, together with the artillery and infantry units of the brigade, approximately 300-400 enemy personnel are quite realistically destroyed. And this is just for four days on duty. It is in -lite- mode of operation, without any particular stress. Tanks, artillery systems, other heavy armored vehicles of the enemy are affected. One night they flew deep into the battle formations of the Rashists, somewhere up to 3-4 km. The tank was discovered, it was well camouflaged. They -burned- his cannon, which looked. The coordinates of the target were reset to our gunners and that was it. A little later, in the morning, they flew over the area again and noticed that this tank was burning. Or we give the coordinates to our -night bomber-. -Baba Yaga- is already attacking enemy equipment with drops. Interesting work within the limits of counter-battery. The enemy strikes with artillery, our -barriers- are activated. Art systems have been detected in some area of ​​the terrain, -Mavik-, which performs tasks in the air, goes to the given area and transmits the exact coordinates of the enemy's artillery. It can be a self-propelled gun, mortars, towed artillery of the Russian Federation. That is, the coordination of efforts and interaction between different units in the war is a key point. EW is a problem for us. But not always. I will tell one story. Once near the front edge of the enemy, a column of armored vehicles was discovered. the Rashists planned to storm our positions with the help of the MTLB. Our task is to destroy the first piece of machinery. We flew a little closer, visually saw a EW device standing on the -motorcycle-. We fly even closer, observe: the EW is either not working, or they simply did not turn it on. Then the first reset passed near MTLB, the second was already a direct hit. The car caught fire, the occupants ran out of it. Then our FPV drones joined, which finished off the enemy and the equipment. Other enemy vehicles turned around and rushed back. Our -fpvishkas- on the move there -took apart- them, it is much easier for them to attack targets while moving. And if the EW radar works, then you need to quickly fly up, -take- a picture, so that the enemy does not have time to turn on the signal suppression and get to a safe distance from him. Or we just bypass it, any EW device has a range, it can be 300 or 400 meters. The hardest part of the Mavik crew's job is to find well-disguised infantry positions, mortar or artillery nests. The adversary learns and improves as well. There is an understanding that not destroyed in time enemy equipment or accumulations of manpower are possible potential losses of our units. Therefore, only vigilance, concentration and experience. The crew must constantly develop and learn to -precede- the logic of the occupiers. To be more cunning, to come up with new tactical ways of defeating the enemy. If the rain is very heavy, we don't work, because the board can be trivially flooded. He is simply in the sky -short- and that's all - there will be no combat drone. If it's fog, some kind of haze, then we're definitely flying. But in these conditions it is difficult to navigate, you can't see where you are flying, you navigate along the -front-. The board returns, it must be wiped from moisture and dried, another -mavik- is already flying to replace it. Watching the enemy 24/7, we can't afford to just rest. At this time, the enemy can advance in assault groups.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/28/taktyka-hodyachyh-mercziv-abo-chym-zupynyayut-voroga-pid-pokrovskom-reportazh-armiyainform-z-donechchyny/	2025-01-27T20:12:22-08:00
- Parachutist robbers: how Russian propagandists created a fake about the 95th ODSHBr	The 95th ODSHBr is a legendary unit of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which deservedly has the reputation of being invincible. In recent years, the paratroopers of this brigade have performed so many feats that the Russians can only look for a way to blacken them. And, as always, instead of the truth, we got a portion of fantasy, which can be described by the phrase: -When you can't win, create a stupid myth.- The essence of the fiction is simple: alleged Ukrainian paratroopers go to the homes of the elderly in the liberated territories and&#8230; robbing them. Propagandists do not specify what exactly they -take- from pensioners. Maybe beets from the cellar or an old TV? But the most interesting thing is that the Russian Telegram channels that promoted this -masterpiece- never even showed photos or videos of the -robbers- - because they themselves understand how ridiculous it sounds. In the liberated territories, on the contrary, the fighters of the 95th help the locals to survive. There are numerous testimonies from residents of Kherson region, Donetsk region, and Kharkiv region about how paratroopers took people out of dangerous zones, brought them food, medicine, and even evacuated their pets. One of these cases happened in Donetsk region: the paratroopers carried an elderly woman who could not move on her own, and carried her several kilometers to a safe zone. Russian propagandists are silent about this, because they do not need the truth - they need a picture that is easy to -sell- to their audience. This is a classic scheme of discrediting: to denigrate those who are models of courage and honor. Russian propaganda tries to -invert- reality, showing the liberators as criminals and their occupiers as -saviors-. However, when in one plot they say that Ukrainians do not have an army, and in another - that the Ukrainian army is so strong that it -bothers- the Russians, a cognitive dissonance arises. If you believe the Russian fakes, then the 95th brigade is not just paratroopers, but universal soldiers. At the same time, they manage to heroically destroy Russian units at the front, rob pensioners and, probably, also launch some -secret drones- in order to interfere with Skabeeva's work. What is there to say? Such a fantasy can only be compared with the scenarios of cheap action movies. Fakes like this are part of the Russian information war aimed at discrediting Ukrainian defenders. But the truth is always stronger than a lie. So while the propagandists paint their myths, the paratroopers of the 95th continue to do their job: to liberate the Ukrainian land and to help the people to whom they gave a chance to live.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/28/grabizhnyky-parashutysty-yak-rosijski-propagandysty-zlipyly-fejk-pro-95-tu-odshbr/	2025-01-27T20:02:21-08:00
The occupiers in the Kherson region introduced new taxes that increase the pressure on the local pop...	About this informs Center of National Resistance. Under the new rules, the residents of the region are forced to comply with the illegal tax demands of the occupiers. This creates additional financial pressure, especially on small businesses that are already suffering from repression and lawlessness. The real goal of these so-called reforms is to establish complete financial control over the region's economy. The occupying power optimizes taxation processes, effectively destroying the economic potential of the region and bringing residents to the limit of survival. The National Resistance Center emphasizes that the return of peaceful life and economic justice is possible only after the complete de-occupation of the territory.

The dodger-corrector - in the dark - used his roommate to transmit data to Russia	This is reported by the Security Service of Ukraine. The new suspect turned out to be a 46-year-old local resident who avoided mobilization and at the same time fulfilled the tasks of the FSB. The man was collecting coordinates for air attacks on the positions of the Defense Forces in the Dnipro. To avoid suspicion, the agent involved his roommate in intelligence activities. The woman went around the places designated by him, recorded the geolocations of military objects and transmitted them in the form of marks on Google maps. The attacker explained to her that it was necessary for -work-, although in fact he was unemployed and transferred the collected data to the Russian intelligence services. SBU counter-intelligence detained the traitor in his apartment. A mobile phone with evidence of cooperation with the occupiers was seized from him. The suspect was informed of the charges for h. 2 Art. 111 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (treason under martial law). The court ordered him to be held in custody without bail.

Communal collapse at TOT: the occupiers destroyed the housing and communal sphere	About informs Center of National Resistance. According to the so-called -head of Makiiv district- Vladyslav Klyucharyov, communal services are only 50% staffed. At least 1,500 workers are needed for the stable operation of the water and heat supply systems, but only about 700 people are currently employed. The root of the problem is the criminal mobilization of the male population of conscription age by the occupiers. This led to a significant reduction in labor resources. A similar situation is observed in occupied Luhansk, where only a third of the required public transport drivers go to work. The rest were forcibly mobilized into the Russian army. Currently, the occupiers cannot find even 300 drivers to ensure the minimum functioning of city routes. The National Resistance Center emphasizes that the forced mobilization of the civilian population in the occupied territories is a violation of Articles 49 and 51 of the Geneva Convention on the Protection of the Civilian Population in Time of War. According to these norms, the occupying power does not have the right to compel civilians to serve in its armed forces or to participate in hostilities. Ukraine emphasizes that sooner or later all those involved in these crimes will be brought to justice before the law and the Ukrainian people. As reported by ArmyInform, the Kremlin is trying to consolidate control over temporarily occupied territories, despite the opposition of the local population.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/27/komunalnyj-kolaps-na-tot-okupanty-zrujnuvaly-zhytlovo-komunalnu-sferu/	2025-01-27T10:50:12-08:00

In Kharkiv, a banker-spy and a speechwriter of Russian propaganda received long terms	The Security Service of Ukraine reported this on January 27. One of the convicts is a Russian spy - a 56-year-old citizen of Russia, who simultaneously worked in a local bank and performed the tasks of military intelligence of the Russian Federation (better known as GRU). It was established that he was preparing the coordinates for the aggressor's rocket-bomb attacks on the storage locations of technical documentation, which is necessary for the restoration of industrial facilities in the region. In order to obtain geolocations of potential targets, the Russian -darkly- tried to use his acquaintance - a local official who has access to secret information. In addition, the attacker drove around the city in his own car and recorded on a hidden video recorder the location of the defenders of Kharkiv. The counterintelligence of the SBU timely exposed the Russian spy and detained him in 2024. Taking into account his cooperation with the investigation, the court sentenced him to 10 years of imprisonment with confiscation of property. Another convict is a 42-year-old resident of Kharkiv, who prepared theses for the public speeches of the Russian -military corps-.

Consequences of Russian occupation: what will happen if the enemy enters our homes. The experience o...	Among many examples, one of the most revealing is the division of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, which took place at the end of the 18th century. Until recently, the powerful Poland lost its statehood and was absorbed by the Russian Empire for more than a century. And now the Kremlin dictator says that it was created thanks to -comrade Stalin-. ArmiyaInform reminds us of the historical lessons of such events, of what the Russian occupation was and what it led to. It is this example that clearly demonstrates what the capture of Kyiv can be like and what will happen to Ukrainians and Ukraine in the event of capitulation. And it all started with the Northern War of 1700-1721. It was during this armed conflict that, entering into an alliance against Sweden with the Muscovite kingdom, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth allowed the -protectorate- of Moscow to be imposed on itself. At the beginning, the Treaty of Narva, which was signed on August 30, 1704, stipulated that the eastern ally would support King Augustus II with a 12,000-strong auxiliary army corps and annual financial assistance of 200,000 rubles. After the victory of the Muscovites in the Northern War and the proclamation of the All-Russian Empire, its influence and appetites are growing rapidly. Throughout the 18th century, Russian soldiers went to Poland -like dogs to the kitchen.- And with each of their -special military operations-, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth became more and more dependent on its -eternal ally-. The culmination was the coup d'état of 1764 carried out -on Russian bayonets- and the -appointment- of Catherine II's lover, Stanislav-August Poniatovsky, by the king of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, who pursued a pro-Russian policy until the end of his 30-year reign. A weak Poland was beneficial to all its neighbors, and especially to the Russian Empire. Catherine II sought to preserve the -protectorate- over the entire Polish territory and further limit her sovereign rights. Despite this, in 1768 it even provided the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth with guarantees of territorial integrity! But already in a few years, as expected, she violated her obligations. the Russian army, which was constantly on the territory of the Commonwealth of Independent States, severely punished any attempts at anti-Russian demonstrations. She drowned the Bar confederation, Koliiv region, Šiauliai uprising in blood, took control of the church, the Diet, and forced a small crown army to carry out her orders. Turkey, which supported the barbarian confederates, began to demand from Russia to stop interfering in the internal affairs of the Commonwealth of Independent States and to withdraw its troops. Finally, without waiting for any reaction, in October 1768 The Ottoman Empire declared war on Russia. For Russia, the costs of maintaining the -Polish protectorate- against the armed resistance of the Confederates and the Ottomans turned out to be too high. And in Petersburg they did not invent anything better, like&#8230; division of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth between its neighbors. Prussia and Austria also took part in the partition, because it was important to -preserve the balance of power-&#8230; On August 5, 1772, authorized representatives of the -balance-forming- countries signed a treaty in St. Petersburg, according to which the so-called -sanitary strips- were annexed, i.e., the territories along the perimeter of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. The Kingdom of Prussia took Pomorie, Kuyavia and part of Greater Poland with a total area of ​​36,000. km² with a population of 580,000 persons Habsburg Monarchy - Lesser Poland and Galicia with Rus, Belz and the western outskirts of Volyn and Podil Voivodeships, a territory of 83,000 km² with 2,650,000 residents (since then, the Austrian period of the history of Lviv and the region began, which lasted until November 1, 1918). And the Russian Empire - East Belarusian lands with Polotsk, Vitebsk and Mstislavl, as well as part of Livland (Latvia), a total of 92 thousand. km² with 1,300,000 population. On September 30, 1773, the Russian-controlled Sejm ratified the agreement on the division of the lands of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, which gave -legitimacy- to these annexations. During the years 1773–1792, supporters of reforms tried in vain to save the remnants of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and to strengthen the state. The four-year Sejm (1788–1792), initiated by a group of patriotic reformers led by Hugo Collontaiy, adopted a Constitution on May 3, 1791, which introduced a hereditary monarchy (instead of an elected one that existed before that) and personal liberties and equal rights for all citizens. The restriction of status privileges caused dissatisfaction among a part of the magnates and nobility, who formed a separatist confederation in 1792 in the town of Torgovytsa (on the then Russian border), and called for the help of Catherine II. As expected, Catherine II reacted quickly. She ordered General Kachowski's troops to enter Poland, and General Krechetnikov's to Lithuania. Fighting broke out. Catherine II was supported by the Prussian king Friedrich Wilhelm II in the invasion of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. For about three months, the Polish army put up a desperate resistance. But under the pressure of forces that had a significant advantage, King Stanislav Augustus was forced to capitulate and submit to the demands of the invaders. The new, completely pro-Russian Diet, convened in the city of Grodno, announced the abolition of the -May 3- Constitution. Garrisons of Russian and Prussian troops were stationed in major cities of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, including its capital, Warsaw. The Polish army was to be significantly reduced, many units were supposed to be disbanded. In December 1792, Catherine II and Friedrich Wilhelm II agreed on a new, second division of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. On April 9, 1793, its conditions were announced: Prussia received Greater Poland with the cities of Poznań, Toruń, and Gdansk, and Russia received Eastern Belarus and Right-Bank Ukraine. In September 1793, the terms of partition were adopted by the Polish Sejm, which was controlled by separatist merchants and occupiers. At the end of 1793, the situation was as follows. Russian troops committed numerous robberies combined with political repression. There was an economic and financial collapse of the state - the seven largest banks in Warsaw went bankrupt, food prices rose. The new government introduced censorship, banning criticism of the Diet, Catherine II, her military and civil servants. A significant amount of the press was liquidated, banned books were removed from bookstores. Cultural contacts with Western Europe were interrupted - the country was artificially fenced off with an -iron curtain-. Despite this, far from all Poles came to terms with the actual occupation of what was left of their state, society carried out a social boycott of Russians. Secret societies were organized everywhere, which set themselves the goal of preparing a general uprising. The leader of this movement was General Tadeusz Kosciuszko, a participant in the American Revolution, who was in exile, the center of which was Saxony (Dresden and Leipzig). It was recognized that it was necessary to establish a military dictatorship in Poland and entrust it to Kosciuszko. It was the last chance to save independence&#8230; The rebellion began on 12 March 1794 with the mutiny of General Antony Madalinsky's cavalry brigade, which refused to obey the decision to disband it. Other parts of the army of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth began to join the rebels. A few days later, Madalinski's cavalry took control of Kraków, which became the center of the uprising. On March 24, the Act was published there, which proclaimed the slogans of the full restoration of Polish sovereignty, the return of the territories rejected in 1772 and 1793, the continuation of the reforms initiated by the Four-Year Sejm, granted Kosciuszko the title of supreme commander of the national armed forces, and transferred all power to his hands. The movement was supported by broad sections of the population, the formation and arming of insurgent units began everywhere. April 4, 1794 in the battle near Roslavice, the Poles managed to inflict the first tangible defeat on the Russians and believed in the possibility of victory. The focus of the struggle quickly spread to other regions: Warsaw was liberated on April 17-18, and Vilna on April 22-23. Kosciuszko announced a general mobilization. The quantitative composition of the rebel army was brought to 70 thousand, but a significant part of it was armed with spears and scythes. Despite this, by May the rebels had established control over most of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Soon after recovering, Prussia, Austria and Russia decided to suppress the uprising by armed means and force the Poles to recognize the partition of Poland. They began to invade the territory of the country from five directions. Since July 13, 1794, the siege of Warsaw by Russian and Prussian troops continued. On October 9, the Russian corps of General Ivan Ferzen defeated the main forces of the rebel forces in the Battle of Maciewovice near the town of Siedlce in eastern Poland. Tadeusz Kosciuszko was seriously wounded and captured. Of the 10,000 rebels who took part in the battle, only two thousand managed to reach Warsaw. The news about the disaster near Maceiovytsi caused panic in the capital. The main strategic point of the city's defense against Russian troops was Prague, the right-bank part of Warsaw. On November 6, 1794, Suvorov's troops launched an assault and, breaking the resistance of the defenders, began to destroy the civilian population with barbaric cruelty. Up to 20,000 people died as a result of the wave of killings that lasted several hours. This act finally broke the rebellion and led its leaders to surrender. The defeat of Tadeusz Kosciuszko's rebellion led to the third partition of Poland in 1795 and the complete liquidation of Polish statehood. This example demonstrates that everyone must fight to prevent what happened to Poland in 1794. Or even worse, because over time, the Russians' methods of warfare become even more barbaric. Everyone will have to fight: only now for the Motherland, or later on the side of the invader. And when Russian troops occupy our country and prepare a further offensive -on NATO-, forced mobilization by field -military commissars- of the Russian Federation will begin. Hardly anyone will speak against this then, because the alternative will be executions, repression, torture, forced labor in the -permafrost-&#8230; So do we want to live under Russian occupation, in eternal fear? The Poles did not want either, but they resisted for only eight months and lost their statehood for 123 years. We are now much stronger, more numerous and more motivated than they were then. We have been resisting for much longer and know very well that victory depends on each of us.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/27/naslidky-rosokupacziyi-shho-bude-yakshho-vorog-zajde-v-nashi-domivky-dosvid-polshhi/	2025-01-27T09:18:26-08:00

-If we had such wings from the very beginning...-: the Armed Forces of Ukraine received a new domest...	This was reported on the brigade's page. The name of the UAV is not accidental: Horus is the ancient Egyptian god of the sky and the sun with the head of a falcon, symbolizing perfect vision and strength. It is these characteristics that make the drone ideal for detecting targets at any time of the day. According to the fighters, the new reconnaissance apparatus is significantly superior to its predecessors. -Hor- is able to fly twice as long as other models - a stable three hours even in winter. It is also more resistant to work in the conditions of the use of means of radio electronic warfare (EW) and has a powerful thermal imaging camera with a high level of zoom. Thanks to this, the operators of the complex can detect the concentration of equipment and manpower of the enemy even far in the rear, where the -Maviks- cannot reach. The UAV operator of the 63rd brigade with the call sign -Tyhiy- said that the complex includes three drones and a ground station. The military organizes the deployment of the complex in less than an hour: from disassembling the catapult to installing the antenna. Thanks to the high-quality characteristics of the -Mountain-, our defenders are able to receive accurate intelligence information about the movement of the enemy, quickly transmit data to artillerymen and deliver accurate strikes. The effectiveness of the -Gor- complex has already been demonstrated in practice. -They worked quite effectively, for example, on the crew of the S-60, who were spotted at the time of the approach. That is, they have just arrived, we detected them, their calculation has not yet begun to break down into positions, and we have already worked on it. The crew was completely destroyed,- the military said. The cost of one Hor complex is about 10 million hryvnias. It includes three aircraft and a ground station. As reported by ArmyInform, operators of the unmanned systems battalion of the 63rd Mechanized Brigade with the help of FPV drones and the Baba Yaga bomber burned two - Urals-, two Uaziks, two cannons, a -loaf- and a buggy. Well, they sent a dozen occupiers to the other world.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/27/yakby-nam-taki-kryla-z-samogo-pochatku-zsu-otrymaly-novyj-vitchyznyanyj-rozviduvalnyj-bpla-gor/	2025-01-27T07:26:41-08:00

10 days under heavy fire: how Air Force fighters restrained the enemy in Kurshchyna	About how the fighters held a strategically important position, told in the Command of the Air Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Enemy reconnaissance drones and FPV drones monitored almost every step, the artillery was relentless, and there were mines and unexploded ordnance everywhere. Explosions rang out almost every second. A group of servicemen from the Combined Rifle Brigade was tasked with occupying and holding a designated sector until reinforcements arrived. The senior of the group was 28-year-old junior sergeant Ruslan, the oldest among his brothers. The night before going to the position was extremely stressful. The enemy met the aircraft with fire, the KAB destroyed a nearby building. Some were checking weapons, some were joking about -finally over the border- to hide their anxiety. -If everything goes well, we will return in 7-10 days,- Ruslan tried to reassure his brothers. But -if- was the key word here. Getting to the position was extremely dangerous. The soldiers walked for several kilometers in full ammunition, with ammunition and provisions. They didn't even walk, but ran and crawled, moving past ruins, burned equipment and bodies — a familiar picture for our military, but this time on the territory of Russia. -Each action has its consequences&#8230; As they say, you can play this game together,- the fighters commented on what they saw. Daily enemy assaults awaited them ahead. -Right now the fate of the country is being decided,- everyone understood. The first shooting battle lasted more than two hours. The Russians pressed with weapons and psychologically, shouting: -Get out! Let's take it in a circle!-. Ruslan supported his people: -Sectors, we hold! Let's knock them down!-. The second battle began in a few hours and continued for ten days: endless anti-aircraft guns, artillery, drones, airdrops, DRGs, assault groups. -Each bush could respond with an automatic queue.- The enemy tried to storm the position several times a day. With incredible efforts, the soldiers of the Combined Rifle Brigade held the sector until problems with ammunition arose. Exiting the position became a separate difficult operation, because the evacuation groups were always a target for the enemy. Unfortunately, one of the soldiers of the brigade, Serhii, who had previously served in the search and rescue service, died during the departure from the UAV. -Is it difficult to coordinate the actions of people who have no prior experience of ground combat?- Ruslan was asked. -No, because these are really motivated young guys. They were worthy specialists in the Air Force and became cool infantrymen! More than once, we experienced real hell together, when the enemy tried to destroy us every minute, and we, in return, tried to prevent him from doing it by all the means known to us,- he answered. Ruslan and his comrades have been fighting side by side in the eastern direction for more than nine months, they have seen heavy losses, kilometers of scorched earth and treachery of the enemy. -Here, in the infantry, we do our best!- - he emphasized. Ruslan, who started serving in the Air Force in 2016 and participated in ATO/OS, understood what he was getting into. After his release in 2020, he briefly returned to civilian life. Now he, although a junior sergeant, commands a platoon and is ready for new challenges. The only thing he regrets is that his two-year-old daughter only sees her dad via video link. But he is sure that one day she will understand what he is fighting for - for her future. As reported by ArmyInform, the officer of the Air Force -Major- told how the soldiers of the Air Force protect the country from the invaders, what tasks they perform on the front lines as part of the ground component of the troops and how they take the enemy prisoner.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/27/10-dniv-pid-shkvalnym-vognem-yak-bijczi-povitryanyh-syl-strymuvaly-voroga-na-kurshhyni/	2025-01-27T02:52:02-08:00

One against ten: how -Kipish- repelled the attack of the Wagnerites who surrounded his position	The soldier's story was published on page 33 of a separate mechanized brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. -Kipish- went to the front with a firm conviction: -Everything is simple - to chase the enemy who is encroaching on our territory. And in the trenches, and in the landings, and in the cities. We don't need him here.- His combat path ran through the Kherson region, where he was always ahead, in intelligence. Then there were Bakhmut and Klishchiivka, Zaporizhzhia, and now he is defending Ukraine near Kurakhovo. One of the fiercest episodes occurred during a clash with the fighters of the -Wagner- PMK. The Russian attack aircraft operated tactically, in small groups of 10, trying to surround the position. Armed only with an assault rifle, a few magazines, grenades and equipment, Kipish was able to repel the attack. The enemies died one by one, because they advanced wave after wave, without counting their own losses and without taking away their dead. -They don't care. They went and did not pick up their corpses. For them, the main thing is to fight back and keep moving, moving, moving. Assault, assault, assault. So, when the enemy sneaks up, you need to shoot accurately, keep on the defensive, and don't panic. Panic is contagious. Or you will have to leave,- Kipish shares his experience. Friend -Kipish- is convinced: the only way to Victory is to destroy the enemy without stopping, giving no chance to consolidate. His battle credo sounds simple and resolute: -Cover them all with concrete.- Destroy the Russians. This will bring us closer to Victory.- As reported by ArmiyaInform, a fighter of the 9th border detachment named after Sich Riflemen under the pseudonym -RE.K.S.- came to the defense of Ukraine in the first hours after the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation, despite the fact that he was born in Leningrad and is a Russian by nationality.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/27/odyn-proty-desyaty-yak-kipish-vidbyv-ataku-vagnerivcziv-shho-otochyly-jogo-pozycziyu/	2025-01-27T01:44:35-08:00

An enemy gunner was detained: he worked for the Russian Federation in the Kramatorsk district	This was reported on January 27 by the Prosecutor General's Office. According to the investigation, a native of Slovyansk, who had been living in Moscow for a long time, returned to Donetsk region two weeks before the beginning of the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation into the territory of Ukraine. In 2024, he was contacted in the Telegram messenger by an acquaintance - a military officer of the DNR. He asked to send him information of a military nature, which he planned to use during the offensive in the Kramatorsk direction.

A swing for a penny, and a blow -for a penny- - the Russians attacked our positions with two ancient...	Danylo Borysenko, head of reconnaissance of the anti-aircraft missile and artillery division of the -Rubizh- brigade. According to him, the enemy's tactics differ in different areas of the front, because different units use personal composition and equipment. However, in general, the main trend is clear — attacks by small infantry groups without the use of armored vehicles. -They are trying to infiltrate the landings, into some separate buildings and accumulate personnel there for further advancement. A group of four or five people is put forward, two get to land, because three have already been hit by FPV drones from our side. If they manage to survive for some time, then the next group is put forward to join them, and then the next,- said Dmytro Borysenko. According to him, the main task is to have time to work on the enemy and inflict maximum losses on him while still on the way to the front line. -They invent anything: they try to jump in on motorcycles and buggies. There was a case when two Zhiguli tried to reach us from the enemy's side. The first model of the Zhiguli and the second is a station wagon. All of them were impressed by our FPV,- said the intelligence chief of the anti-aircraft missile and artillery division of the Rubizh brigade. As reported AmriyaInform, in the Lyman direction, the enemy practically does not resort to mechanized assaults on the positions of the Defense Forces of Ukraine. However, he sends small assault groups of 2-3 people to attack almost around the clock.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/27/rozmah-na-karbovanecz-a-udar-kopijkoyu-rosiyany-atakuvaly-nashi-pozycziyi-dvoma-stareznymy-zhygulyamy/	2025-01-27T00:48:34-08:00
The motorcycle blitzkrieg failed: the Armed Forces of Ukraine repelled the Russian attack in the Kra...	The video of combat work was published on the brigade's page. Russian troops involved a motorcycle group consisting of four crossbikes in the assault. Counting on the speed and maneuverability of the motorcycles, the enemy planned to imperceptibly bypass the positions of the Ukrainian defenders and strike from an unexpected direction. However, thanks to the timely work of the aerial reconnaissance of the 5th assault brigade, the plans of the occupiers were thwarted. Ukrainian drones detected the enemy group in time and coordinated fire to destroy it. At first, artillery with cluster ammunition worked on motorcyclists. And for the final elimination of the enemy group, FPV drones were used. A Russian attack aircraft was destroyed by a well-aimed strike from one of the drones, which forced the rest of the motorcyclists to stop and seek shelter. The enemy's attempts to break through the defense did not end there. The occupiers sent an additional motorcycle group and even a tank for reinforcements. However, even these forces successfully struck the Ukrainian defenders. As reported by ArmyInform, operators of the Phoenix 5 unit of the Kyiv assault brigade showed a series of blows on the enemy's hiding places.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/27/motoczykletnyj-bliczkryg-ne-vdavsya-zsu-vidbyly-ataku-rosiyan-na-kramatorskomu-napryamku/	2025-01-27T00:39:45-08:00

I loved my job, but the feeling that our land is under threat became unbearable,- says the fighter. Despite his Azerbaijani surname, Serhiy grew up in independent Ukraine under the blue and yellow flag. His grandfather is from the Caucasus, but his father is Ukrainian, who raised him with love for his native land. -I don't understand those who are afraid to take up arms. I went to war not to die for Ukraine, but to kill its enemies,- Serhii shares frankly. During two years of service, Serhiy gained a lot of combat experience. His 23 mm anti-aircraft system successfully shot down enemy drones, including the Lancet and Zala, and worked on the positions of the occupiers. -When our work was recognized, it was very motivating. You understand that you are not just following orders, but actually changing the course of the war,- he says. Serhiy feels a deep hatred for the enemy, especially after Buchi, Mariupol and the attacks on peaceful cities. -Every day the occupiers give even more reasons to hate them. We want not just to stop this evil, but to pay back for all our losses,- says the soldier. Today Serhiy wears a sergeant's epaulettes and trains his brothers in a new infantry unit. -The boys are still a little skeptical about my drill, but I hope they will understand later: all this is to survive and return home. We must be able to use every minute on the training ground for training and training,- he is convinced. Despite the war, Serhiy dreams of the future of a free and peaceful Ukraine. He wants to start a family and raise children in a country where sirens will not be heard. His strength of spirit, love for the Motherland and responsibility for the future make him an example for everyone who fights for the freedom of Ukraine. -Our future is in our hands.

The hottest border in the north — Sumyshchyna is under attack by enemy drones and saboteurs	The spokesperson of the State Border Service told about this on the broadcast of the telethon -Edyny Novyny- Andriy Demchenko of Ukraine. According to Demchenko, the length of the border with a terrorist country allows the enemy to constantly look for new routes by which he launches his UAVs. But most of these routes pass through the Sumy region. As well as the ways of enemy sabotage and intelligence groups. -The enemy did not give up conducting sabotage activities on this stretch. Again, the enemy is most actively trying to enter our territory through the Sumy region.

Weeds as an excuse for looting: the occupiers simplify the expropriation of land from residents of t...	This was reported by the head of the Luhansk Regional Military Administration, Artem Lysogor. According to the new rules, it will be enough for the inspectors to identify the so-called unused plot in order to start the process of its -nationalization-. At the same time, the criteria of -non-use- are extremely vague and create a wide field for abuse by the occupation authorities. According to the head of the Luhansk OVA, land can be lost even due to ordinary clutter or the presence of weeds over one meter high. -If the inspectors see an unused plot, they can issue a fine and start the procedure of its so-called nationalization. The land can be lost, for example, due to its littering with garbage and the presence of weeds over 1 m high,- the report says. In effect, this means that the occupying power receives practically unlimited powers to seize private property from the inhabitants of the occupied territories. Vague wording allows any plot to be interpreted as -unused-, creating a constant threat of property loss for the local population. This step is another example of violation of human rights and norms of international law by the occupying power. The simplified -nationalization- procedure is actually a legalized robbery under the guise of -fighting mismanagement.- The situation raises serious concerns about the fate of the residents of the occupied Luhansk Region, who are at risk of losing not only their homes, but also their land, which is often their only source of livelihood. It may also lead to an even greater humanitarian crisis in the territory, which is already suffering from the consequences of Russian aggression. As reported by ArmyInform, the occupiers in Seversko-Donetsk demand from residents free apartments from furniture during repair works, which are carried out on a compulsory basis.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/27/buryany-yak-pryvid-dlya-grabunku-okupanty-sproshhuyut-vyluchennya-zemli-u-meshkancziv-na-tot-luganshhyny/	2025-01-26T23:07:31-08:00

In the Pokrovsky direction, the occupiers intensified the use of armored vehicles	On January 25, the officer of the information and communication service 14 told about this on the ArmyTV stream on January 25. Maksym Bakulin of the operational assignment brigade named after Ivan Bohun -Red viburnum- of the National Guard. -Now in the Pokrovsky direction, there are constant battles, around the clock the enemy is trying to advance, using various tactics,- Maksym Bakulin noted. He paid special attention to the change in the approach of the occupiers to the use of manpower and equipment. If earlier the enemy relied more often on infantry, now there is a tendency to increase the use of heavy and all-terrain vehicles. -Their assaults became more frequent precisely with the help of technology. They use less manpower than before, and use more heavy and off-road vehicles,- the press officer emphasized. This information is important because, as the presenter noted, many speakers from other units in the Pokrovsky direction rarely reported a significant amount of enemy equipment. Maxim Bakulin explained this by the features of the terrain in his brigade's area of ​​responsibility: the presence of paths suitable for vehicles. -In the area of ​​responsibility of my brigade, in those settlements, it is currently possible to pass by vehicles, there is a lot of traffic. They began to bring personnel as close as possible. Earlier, they sent them more often on foot, now in most cases they bring them as close as possible, drop them off and try to fight under the cover of barrel artillery and volley fire systems,- the officer explained. Regarding the size of enemy vehicle columns, Maxim Bakulin clarified that these are usually small columns consisting of two tanks, such as T-72 and T-90, which lead the column, drop off personnel, shoot back and leave. However, as the officer noted, they do not always manage to withdraw completely, as the Ukrainian defenders put up a decent fightback, and some equipment remains on the battlefield. Thus, the situation in the Pokrovsky direction remains tense. The enemy is constantly looking for new ways to break through defenses, changing tactics and increasing the use of equipment. However, the Ukrainian military continues to courageously defend its positions, inflicting significant losses on the occupiers. As reported by ArmyInform, the occupying forces are trying to najgaryachishomu-napryamku/->bypass Pokrovsk from the west to cut important routes and force Ukrainian troops to retreat.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/27/na-pokrovskomu-napryamku-okupanty-aktyvizuvaly-vykorystannya-bronetehniky/	2025-01-26T22:16:59-08:00

What to expect from the enemy in 2025: an expert on Russia's capabilities in the Black Sea and Crime...	About the combat potential of the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation and enemy groups in the Crimea, the available combat capabilities of the enemy in the Azov-Black Sea region as of the beginning of 2025, military expert, retired captain 1st rank, candidate of military sciences, associate professor Stepan Yakymyak told ArmyInform in an interview . —How will the enemy operate at sea in 2025? Does it have sufficient capabilities to seize the initiative and change the nature of actions in maritime spaces to its advantage? What exactly can the enemy oppose to the strikes of the Defense Forces in the Black Sea and will its actions be successful? — The development of the situation in military operations at sea in 2025 will be influenced, first of all, by the consequences of the actions of the parties in the previous period, in particular in 2024. Considering the results of the previous year, it is important to emphasize that in 2024 the Defense Forces of Ukraine achieved a new large-scale success at sea. They forced the enemy to withdraw from the Crimea to the eastern part of the sea the entire combat composition of the surface and underwater forces of the Black Sea Fleet. But at the end of the year, Ukraine surprised the whole world with new unique military operations at sea. Let us briefly recall them. From December 6 to 7, the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, for the first time in world practice, carried out a combined attack with the simultaneous use of at least four different types of air and sea drones, one of which was an FPV-type UAV carrier, and destroyed enemy objects and manpower on gas production platforms near the coast of Crimea. From December 5 to 6, the Security Service of Ukraine, using unmanned surface vehicles equipped with large-caliber machine guns, damaged enemy helicopters in the Kerch Strait region during the battle, in which, in addition to helicopters, enemy aircraft and patrol boats also participated. On December 31, the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine destroyed two and damaged one enemy helicopter near Cape Tarkhankut, located on the western coast of Crimea, using missiles from unmanned surface vehicles for the first time in the world. With these robotic operations, the Defense Forces of Ukraine proved their superiority over the enemy and the possibility of destroying any of his forces deployed at sea. In fact, the enemy's capabilities remain very limited. Most likely, the enemy will not conduct active operations at sea in 2025. The exception will be strikes by sea-based Kalibr cruise missiles from coastal areas near Novorossiysk. He will also try to involve naval aviation and coastal missile forces in actions for the defense of Crimea and defend the areas of the base of forces against strikes from the sea and from the air. In the end, it should be emphasized that in 2025, the enemy will not be able to seize the initiative or at least somehow change the nature of actions at sea in their favor. — Not only recognized foreign experts, but also representatives of the military and political leadership of the leading countries of the world are talking about the successes achieved by Ukraine in the war at sea in 2022-2024 and the revolutionary innovations in military affairs demonstrated at the same time. In your opinion, do and how exactly can the already achieved results of military operations at sea affect the military-political situation around Ukraine in 2025 and the possibilities for a just end to the war? - Of course, changes in the situation at various strategic directions, or in other words, on different fronts, can worsen or improve the general the situation regarding the defense of the state in the war. Now we can clearly state that the successful actions of the Defense Forces of Ukraine at sea are a factor contributing to the state's defense capability and its support from our foreign partners. And it is not only about moral and psychological or image factors. First, the achieved advantage over the enemy at sea forces it to redistribute its own strategic defense resources, including financial, material, change priority and distribution along strategic directions. Secondly, in the military context, the loss of control over the maritime spaces around Crimea, in the Kerch Strait and near the Black Sea coast of the Krasnodar Territory of the Russian Federation necessitates the strengthening of comprehensive defense, primarily anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft, as well as counterintelligence, economic and other measures in these territories. At the same time, this is a diversion of significant resources from other areas of action. Thirdly, the successful actions of the Defense Forces at sea can lead to the complete isolation of the temporarily occupied Crimea from the sea, and the cutting of communications with the mainland - to its liberation and the Russian Federation losing its center of gravity in operations in southern Ukraine. In addition, some experts are inclined to believe that in the event of negotiations to end the war, Ukraine's superiority at sea could be an important counter-argument in the discussion on territorial control. Similar to the situation regarding the control over the territories in the Kursk Oblast of the Russian Federation, the control by the Defense Forces of Ukraine of the maritime spaces within the territorial sea of ​​both Ukraine and the Russian Federation and their exclusive (maritime) economic zones in the Black Sea is, of course, a factor that strengthens the position of Ukraine . Summing up, it can be confidently asserted that Ukraine's successes in operations at sea are an important component of the future victory over the enemy in war. After all, the Russians have practically nothing to oppose the Defense Forces of Ukraine in a war at sea. - What capabilities do the adversary have from performing the tasks listed above in military operations at sea? - First of all, let's consider the adversary's strike capabilities at sea. The conducted analysis testifies to a 25% reduction in the ability to strike sea-based cruise missiles with a range of up to 1,500 km against ground targets. As it is known, this happened as a result of the destruction of two small missile ships -Zyklon- and -Askold-, as well as significant damage to the large submarine -Rostov-on-Don-. There was also a decrease in the striking capabilities of surface ships with anti-ship missile damage by 38%. This was facilitated by the destruction of a missile cruiser and a missile boat. At the same time, there was no reduction in the strike capabilities of the enemy's coastal missile forces, which include two coastal missile brigades located in Crimea and near Novorossiysk, which are capable of simultaneously launching 112 anti-ship missiles. Of these, 48 missiles have a firing range of 800 km and 64 missiles have a firing range of 260 km. Also, the enemy has almost completely preserved the strike capabilities of naval aviation. However, it should be emphasized that due to the current lack of large warships in the Black Sea fleet of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, the enemy's ability to strike with anti-ship missiles by the forces of missile ships and coastal missile units remains unused and does not affect the course and results of actions on the sea - And how do you assess the enemy's naval amphibious capabilities, especially taking into account that they can be used for enemy sea transport? - Analysis of the enemy's naval amphibious capabilities shows critical losses in amphibious ships and boats and the enemy's loss of the ability to landings of operational and tactical marine landings. Based on the real conditions that have developed as a result of the successful strikes of the Defense Forces of Ukraine at sea, it can be argued that the Russians do not have the opportunity to conduct any naval amphibious operations and significant sea transportation. To be specific, according to the results of actions at sea, as of now, the enemy's naval amphibious capabilities are characterized by a decrease in the number of amphibious ships and boats - by 61%. 7 units were destroyed, including 4 large amphibious ships, 3 amphibious boats. In addition, 3 large amphibious ships were significantly damaged and are currently undergoing long-term repairs. The combined capacity to transport landing troops decreased by more than 54%. It is important to emphasize the significant reduction of the enemy's ability to prepare and use the marines as an advanced detachment of marine landing forces intended to capture the landing bridgehead. After all, it is known that as a result of the constant involvement of the 810th Marine Infantry Brigade of the Russian Federation in the capacity of mechanized units in the composition of ground groups of troops and significant losses in the personnel of the brigade, in particular in Kurshchyna, this unit is not suitable for operations as intended. In general, as a result of the strikes of the Defense Forces of Ukraine against the enemy's shock and naval landing forces, the loss of combat capability of four main units of the Russian Armed Forces was achieved. Added to this were losses due to the closure of the Bosphorus to warships with the start of a full-scale military invasion. Because of this, as is known, only one frigate, one small missile ship and two large submarines remained from the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation in the Mediterranean Sea. Thus, in total, 30 divisions of surface ships, 41 brigades of missile ships and boats, 4 brigades of submarines, 197 brigades of amphibious ships lost at least 30% of their combat personnel. In addition, and this is very important, the enemy suffered losses in special, supply and management capabilities. After all, they directly or indirectly affect the results of the use of forces at sea! - Can you give some detail about which additional capabilities of the enemy in sea operations were reduced in the previous period? - In the course of military operations at sea, in particular in 2022, the enemy actively engaged in sabotage and reconnaissance activities. Using Snake Island and gas production platforms as advanced minibases, the enemy made almost daily attempts to land sabotage and reconnaissance groups on the Ukrainian coast. It is natural that in the subsequent actions of the Defense Forces of Ukraine, efforts were focused on the fight against these units and the special capabilities of the enemy were reduced. Thus, as a result of the strikes, a significant number of personnel of special units and more than 10 special purpose boats were destroyed, including the boats of projects: 03160 of the -Raptor- type, 21980 of the -Grachenok- type, 12150 of the -Mongoose- type, 02800 of the -Tavr- type, KS -701 of the -Tuna- type. - How do you assess the enemy's logistical and management capabilities in the Black Sea? Kerch Strait. As a result of these strikes, the transportation of personnel and material, including heavy military equipment, was restricted for a long time by the road and rail parts of the bridge, and the operation of the ferry crossing was suspended due to the damage to two ferries, one of which sank. Attention should also be paid to the use of the Crimean Peninsula as a logistics hub, i.e. a set of logistics hubs and centers, for the comprehensive support of Russian military groups (forces) in the Black Sea region, in particular those based in Crimea. Also, this logistics ensures the actions of enemy troops in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. So influencing her is essential. At the same time, it can be asserted that as a result of the strikes of the Defense Forces of Ukraine on the missile cruiser -Moskva-, the command post of the Russian Armed Forces in the village of Verkhnyosadove and the headquarters of the Russian Armed Forces in Sevastopol, other important facilities in Crimea significantly reduced the ability to control enemy forces at sea and in Crimea. After all, at least three main control points of the operational link were destroyed or damaged, and the control points of the Sevastopol and Crimean naval bases are probably not in use due to the withdrawal of forces to Novorossiysk. Losses in trained management personnel should also be taken into account. After all, in the course of destroying and damaging control points of the operational-strategic and operational levels, the enemy suffered certain losses in the operative composition of these control points. Any replacements in the leadership of the fleet also have a negative impact, which has also happened several times with the command of the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation! —Recently, we have been observing systematic strikes by missile weapons and strike drones on targets in Crimea and the Krasnodar Territory of the Russian Federation. Could you share your assessment of the capabilities of the enemy's military groups operating in the Crimea? - Of course, in order to provide a more complete assessment of the enemy's capabilities for operations at sea and from the sea, its capabilities to defend the Crimean peninsula should be taken into account. After the occupation of Crimea in 2014, the Russian Federation formed the 126th Coastal Defense Brigade as part of the Russian Armed Forces, and later the 32nd Army Corps. Also, a number of units of the Russian Guard, other security agencies of the Russian Federation and types of armed forces were deployed in Crimea. It is clear that an echeloned system of enemy defense has been created in both areas that connect Crimea with the southern regions of Ukraine (Perekop and Chongar) with the aim of preventing the breakthrough of Ukrainian army groups to Crimea. In addition to what we often see in the photos in the Telegram channels, elements of the anti-aircraft defense system of the peninsula have been created in the amphibious areas on the coast of Crimea, designated beach areas and other areas. However, in my opinion, conducted in 2022-2024 Sea raids by the special operations forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and units of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine in several areas of the Crimean Peninsula have shown the presence of weak points in the defense system of Crimea created by the enemy. These facts are also confirmed by the actions of the resistance forces in the temporarily occupied territory of Crimea in conducting reconnaissance, exposing the enemy's facilities and the actions of his forces (troops). It should also be emphasized the constant reduction in the capabilities of air defense forces, which are engaged by the enemy to protect the Air Force, other forces and troops, important facilities in Crimea, as a result of systematic strikes by the Defense Forces of Ukraine. Although the military leadership of the Russian Federation regularly conducts measures to restore the air defense system of Crimea, the number of sets of forces and air defense vehicles detached from other directions will probably decrease with each subsequent time. Summing up this brief analysis of the enemy's capabilities to defend Crimea, it should be noted that this direction is most likely one of the key priorities of the Russian leadership in the war against Ukraine and the implementation of its own expansionist neo-imperial policy in the Mediterranean region. — What do you think are the possible directions for strengthening the enemy's capabilities in the Black Sea? How realistic are his plans for the creation and use of marine unmanned surface and underwater complexes? Can the capabilities of the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation be increased at the expense of forces from outside the Black Sea? — It is clear that the enemy is trying to draw conclusions from failures in combat operations at sea, learn and take into account lessons from the experience gained. After the defeat by the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine of enemy units on gas production platforms near the coast of Crimea with the use of aircraft carrier unmanned surface complexes in December 2024, the enemy, I hope, begins to understand new threats and the scale of future losses. Attacking by unmanned units of the SBU and GUR of the enemy's aircraft over the sea nullifies its superiority over the sea and opens access for these forces to the enemy's facilities in the coastal zone and on the coast. At the same time, with what own successes and achievements can the enemy react to this? There is no clear answer. Currently, the successes declared by him in the creation of marine unmanned surface and underwater complexes are not visible in concrete tests or the application of such equipment in combat operations at sea. Renewal of the enemy's strike capabilities at sea is delayed indefinitely. Moreover, the enemy tends to hide its newly built ships from the strikes of the Defense Forces of Ukraine, as happened with the small Tucha missile ship, which was being completed on the Black Sea, but was accepted into the Black Sea Fleet as far as Caspiansk, which is located in the Caspian Sea. Can the enemy strengthen its strikes from the sea by using forces from outside the Black Sea? Currently, this possibility is assessed as not feasible. The fact is that when some media outlets, as breaking news, report the number of missile-carrying ships in the Mediterranean, it is surprising, to put it mildly. After all, everyone knows that according to the Montreux Convention, no military ship of the Russian Federation, as well as of Ukraine, can be transported from the Mediterranean Sea to the Black Sea under the current conditions. In addition, such a ship cannot use its missile weapons, because it must obtain permission to use aircraft in Turkey, Greece, Bulgaria and Romania. Flea over other states is also unrealistic due to a significant increase in the rocket. That is, from the Mediterranean rocket strikes of the Russian Federation in Ukraine are impossible. If you adhere to another logic, it is also necessary to provide Ukrainian society as daily -hot- new information about Muscovite Krakhetnos ships, for example, in the Baltic Sea. Regarding the possibility of involvement in rocket strokes of Krakhetnosi ships from the Caspian Fleet of the Russian Federation from certain areas of the Caspian Sea, it should be noted that this is unlikely. It should be borne in mind that the missile of the Caliber complex at normal equipment insufficient capacity for firing range. It is known that their maximum range - up to 1500 km, and the distance in the straight line to Odessa is 1500 km, to Kiev - 1600 km, to Lviv, Rivne, Uzhgorod - more than 2000 km. For comparison - in the present conditions, the Muscovites strike the caliber missiles from the Novorossiysk district, from what distance to Ukrainian cities are: to Odessa - about 650 km, to Kiev - 800, to Lviv, Rivne, Uzhgorod - 1200. Thus. , to attract Caspian Fleet Ships, they need to be carried out Volgodonian channel to Azov and then to the Black Sea. With this Muscovites, as we have mentioned above, they do not rush. Summarizing, it can be predicted that there is no significant strengthening of any capacity of the Russian Federation to conduct actions on the Black Sea. Ukraine confidently prevails at sea. First of all, this will certainly happen due to the constant increase of efforts of Ukraine's defense forces, their intellectual and technological advantage over the enemy. The strikes, which took place recently, in January 2025, at the military and logistics centers in the depths of the territory of Russia and on the coast of the Krasnodar Territory, in particular on the objects of marine oil and gas infrastructure, give confidence in the success of Ukraine in the fight against the aggressor.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/27/chogo-ochikuvaty-vid-voroga-u-2025-roczi-ekspert-pro-spromozhnosti-rf-u-chornomu-mori-ta-v-krymu/	2025-01-26T20:50:28-08:00
No longer -limitedly suitable-: how to pass VLK in one day	This is required by the Law of Ukraine dated March 21, 2024 No. 3621-IX -On amendments to some laws of Ukraine on ensuring the rights of servicemen and police officers to social protection-. The demand of the Law is not a caprice: I will go, and I will not. Failure to comply with the rule on timely passing of the VLK is a violation of the rules of military accounting, defense legislation, mobilization training and mobilization, for which a fine in the amount of 17,000 to 25,500 UAH can be imposed. Although the Ministry of Defense assures that if a person with the status of -Limited Suitability- does not undergo a re-examination by February 5, the electronic military registration document in Reserve+ will remain unchanged, it is still not worth taking a risk - it is better to comply with the requirements of the Law and protect yourself from fines. I want to tell you about my personal experience of passing the VLC in January 2025 in one of the district TCCs and joint ventures in the city of Kyiv. Therefore, the observations and advice made cannot in any case be extrapolated to all recruitment and social support centers in Ukraine. It is possible to appear at the TCC and SP to pass the VLK in order to determine suitability for military service as -limited suitability- in the morning any day - there is still time. A summons is not required for this. It is not necessary, but it is better to be registered for this day in the electronic queue. In the TCC, you will receive a referral for a medical examination, a bypass letter and an algorithm for further actions. If the VLK works simply in the building of the TCC and SP, as in my case, then conscripts who have all the necessary up-to-date medical reports on their illnesses can pass the commission in one day. But when you go to the TCC, it is better not to plan anything else for that day, because the process can be unexpectedly long, and you will not be able to leave the premises until the necessary procedures are completed. However, the VLK can work in a separate room or in general in one of the civil hospitals. Enrollment on the VLK in civil medical institutions is done through the medical application. You can go to the required page of this application using the QR code that will be provided by TCC and SP. Then the process due to objective reasons (signing up and arriving at the medical facility) will take more time. Currently, the Ministry of Defense is implementing the VLK reform and soon it should be possible to send a request for a VLK referral through the Reserve+ mobile application, receive a notification with details and go to the health care facility specified in the referral without the need to visit the TCC. If you have illnesses due to which at one time you were recognized as -limited fitness for military service- or -unfit for military service in peacetime, limited fitness in wartime-, then you should not appear at the VLK without any medical documents at all . It is necessary to have at least some statement with a diagnosis. A recent one is better. If the medical conclusions were made a long time ago (during the previous VLC examination or before), you will most likely be sent for an examination to a specialized specialist with an electronic referral and a summons to continue the VLC examination in a few days. An additional examination should update data on your health status. And this is where the real quest begins, because electronic appointment to doctors in public hospitals is a lottery. And the examination may include the need to visit several specialists or do tests. Queues for some specialists are filled a month in advance and are already here - as luck would have it. Perhaps, in order not to wait, you will have to go to a paid appointment. I was lucky enough to make an appointment with an electronic referral to a state institution outside the waiting list due to the fact that I constantly consult a doctor and had a summons from the TCC in my hands. In general, a summons to undergo a VLC is a strong argument for any civilian hospital, because military personnel and mobilized people are served there outside the queue (even during a VLC) and it can really help to speed up additional examination. But, unfortunately, it does not always work, so it is not worth waiting for reception outside the queue everywhere. When the doctor's conclusion about your current state of health is in your hands, you can go again to the VLK doctor who referred you for additional examination. It is he who will record the diagnosis, according to which the head of the VLK will determine the degree of suitability for military service. In the end, the whole process with additional examinations took me 10 days. For comparison, when I passed the VLK 2021, it lasted almost 1.5 months. So, the progress is obvious. There is no longer a definition of -restricted fit- in the Conscription and Military Service Act. Currently, in the majority of cases, regarding persons with serious illnesses, resolutions -fit for service in military support units, TCC and SP, VVNIZ, educational centers, institutions (institutions), medical units, units of logistics, communication, operational support, security- (at least this is the conclusion suggested after conversations in the queue of several dozen conscripts who went through the VLK together with me, both the first and second day). After all, this is exactly the work of the VLK: to find out and record the medically established facts, on the basis of which to make a conclusion about fitness and make the appropriate decision.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/27/vzhe-ne-obmezheno-prydatnyj-yak-projty-vlk-za-odyn-den/	2025-01-26T20:40:42-08:00
From -Google, help!- to a mine-explosive training instructor: about the symbol of faith of a princip...	The fighter told ArmyInform about what his personal symbol of faith and inviolable principles are. Evgeny received his nickname -Monk- because of his beard and the calm demeanor of a prudent, responsible and confident man in his words and actions. — It was a bit funny such a situation. When our brigade was formed, a boy with such a big beard, who was nicknamed -Chaplain-, served with me. I have a smaller beard, so they started calling me -Batyushka-. I then said that I would not aspire to a high rank and would be a modest -Monk,- Yevgeny says. The warrior says that he likes to be alone to collect his thoughts. In his spare time, he often reads the Bible, which he always keeps with him. — During the formation of the brigade, there were guys from different regions, it was necessary to somehow remember each other, that's how it caught on — first as a joke, and then seriously, — he explains. In civilian life, Yevgeny was an industrial climber, he worked at high altitudes for many years, so he had good physical training. During the formation of the brigade in March 2022, -Monakh- was assigned to the intelligence company. — We thought we would get into the regular part, but our part was formed from the reserve. All from scratch, all mobilized. The officers are young guys who have not yet finished their studies. And so we passed the formation in less than a month and entered the combat zone in the Severodonetsk region, says the soldier. The experience of military service came in handy for Yevgeny, however, the man emphasizes, the level of training then was not too high and clearly insufficient for a major war. — It was 2004, there was such devastation in the army&#8230; Then I got into -Desna-, an educational center. Then he served in Bakhmut - then it was still called Artemivsk. They shot a little, threw grenades, but that was not enough, even if you were taught to shoot with aim - you need to learn tactics, train, - the -Monk- is convinced. — The enemy was more ready for war. And at first it was difficult for me, because when you are engaged in your profession all your life, you have invested a certain period of years in one thing, and here you have to fight, you have to defend yourself, you have to kill - it was difficult for a civilian, Yevgeny says. In the -Monk- reconnaissance group, he was a machine gunner, he worked with the RPK - a Kalashnikov manual machine gun. Later, he mastered the Swedish AT4 grenade launcher. Yevhen also has a funny story related to this, because in order to master a new weapon, he had to search for instructions with the help of Google. - RPK is the same Kalashnikov assault rifle, only bigger, so there were no problems with it. But NATO weapons were mastered with the help of the Internet. We even had such a joke in the section: -Google, help!-. -We went on the Internet and looked for videos on YouTube that explained the basics of using weapons,- recalls the -Monk-. The military characterizes the Swedish AT4 grenade launcher as a very high-quality and effective weapon, significantly better than Soviet hand grenade launchers. Although I had to work with the RPG-18 Mukha and RPG-22 Netto, which performed quite well. -Monk- and his brothers mastered the new weapon extremely carefully, because they understood that the performance of the combat mission and their own lives depended on it. Went to the headquarters, asked to connect them to the Starlink signal in order to be able to watch the necessary videos. - Tried to be very serious about it - practiced, practiced, practiced all the time. Because our lives and our combat mission depended on it. If you are killed or wounded, you will no longer be able to complete the task that the command set for you. And I was in the reconnaissance of our brigade, and we had difficult tasks, - says -Monk-. It was often necessary to work on identifying the positions of enemy artillery with the purpose of counter-battery combat. At that time, scouts went into the so-called -gray zone- and calculated where the enemy was firing artillery or mortar fire. — You may not shoot a single cartridge in a week, but bring a lot of useful information. The same -counter-battery-: you sit in a shelter and, with the help of a tablet and a compass, calculate the sound of enemy artillery or mortars. Then you give the coordinates and our artillery works according to them. Then the infantry is easier. And the infantry always have the hardest time - they need to be helped first of all, Evgeny is convinced. While resting and recuperating between rotations, Monks and their brothers were always studying. Together with his comrades, he thoroughly mastered engineering - first at courses organized by volunteers in Kharkiv, and later with the receipt of an official certificate in Kamianets-Podilskyi. - In Kharkiv, they taught the basics - how to detect a mine and understand what kind of mine it is and what damage it can cause. What can be done with it to neutralize it and what can not be done in any case. I learned all the theory on these courses, and the practice was good on the educational materials, Yevgeny recalls with gratitude. The training in Kharkiv lasted three weeks, but since the courses were voluntary, it was not possible to get an official certificate of advanced training and mastery of the new VOS. Therefore, later -Monakh- continued his studies in Kamianets-Podilskyi, where the courses lasted for a month and a half. — I really liked Kamianets-Podilskyi - very qualified, serious teachers. The material base they have for training is excellent - I am very satisfied. The program is very full for 45 days, but you cannot allocate more time during the war, says Yevhen about training in mine and explosives. Thanks to previous training in Kharkiv, it was easier for Monk to acquire knowledge than for guys from other brigades who did not have such experience. However, under the guidance of experienced specialists, they also successfully coped with the training and received the relevant certificates. — It was scary at first, but under the supervision of teachers, all this was done calmly. And when you have made the first or second blow, you somehow calm down, you become confident in your actions. You can, when you know how, it's already a favorite job, -Monk- smiles. After the second serious injury, the soldier was transferred to a group of instructors due to his health, so now he imparts knowledge to less experienced comrades. The military is convinced that teaching well and learning well is necessary for everyone who wants to survive on the battlefield, successfully complete a combat mission and win. — When you teach people, it is a big responsibility. If you neglected a person, behaved carelessly, then he may die. What if suddenly the very training exercise you failed to teach cost a soldier his life? Therefore, we try to give 100%, to the maximum. Other people's lives also depend on us, Yevhen emphasizes. A serious wound in the hand does not allow the soldier to work at full strength, but he is glad that he was not discharged and was allowed to pass on knowledge and skills to his comrades. - I can show you how to neutralize the stretcher placed by the enemy. Explain how to work with it so that it does not explode. I have enough strength for this. I believe that I can still serve the brigade, bring benefit, contribute to our victory, which we are very much looking forward to, says the soldier. In the time since Evgeny became an instructor about a year ago, he has already trained hundreds of fighters. He remembers everyone and tries to help them even after graduation. — Here we always do everything to ensure that a person remains alive, does not get injured and completes a combat mission. We try to work so that the students know everything no worse than the teachers and even surpass us, - smiles Yevhen. This is what the -Monk- creed is all about - learning yourself and teaching others to survive on the battlefield and win. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/27/vid-google-dopomozhy-do-instruktora-z-minno-vybuhovoyi-pidgotovky-pro-symvol-viry-prynczypovogo-monaha/	2025-01-26T20:29:21-08:00
- Escape of a female sniper to Europe-: a fairy tale of the Russian Federation for an audience in sl...	So, according to the script of the Kremlin directors, the -sniper from Ukraine- after several years of service realized that the -Ukrainian army is doomed-, took off her camouflage and disappeared somewhere in cozy Europe. Up to this point, the story sounds more or less familiar for Russian fakes: no names, evidence or photos - just fantasy and loud headlines. And now some facts. Firstly, none of the Ukrainian snipers confirmed the existence of such a situation. The Armed Forces is not a chaotic gathering of random people, but a professional army where every soldier is part of a single system. Of course, there are occasional losses or transfers to another service, but there is nowhere near a mass exodus. Secondly, if someone actually decided to leave the service, it is unlikely that he would choose the high-profile route with -dramatic statements-. This looks like an attempt to give his fiction a dramatic color for the Russian audience. Ukrainian snipers are the elite of the army. They are not just trained, but are formed into real professionals for whom service is not just a job, but a vocation. The stories we see every day only confirm: even in the most difficult conditions, they remain true to their oath. So, the idea that one of the snipers suddenly -freaked out- looks, to put it mildly, unrealistic. As always, this fake is aimed at two types of audience. Let's imagine what the -escape- of this mythical female sniper looks like. Does she take off her uniform, pick up a guitar and go on a European tour with songs about lost home? Or does she record a video message on Tik Tok, where she tells how she is -disappointed- in her own country? I wonder why everything is always so dramatic in Russian fiction? With the same success, one could invent that all Ukrainian snipers took a vacation at the same time to go shopping in Istanbul. Because it is probably as realistic as their escape. The reality is that the Armed Forces continue to hold the front. There is no collapse or panic. On the contrary, the Ukrainian army is becoming stronger thanks to the support of its partners and the resilience of its own people. While Russian propaganda creates myths about fictional -desertive snipers-, real Ukrainian soldiers continue to defend their land. And no fake will change that fact.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/27/vtecha-snajperky-do-yevropy-kazka-rf-dlya-audytoriyi-v-tapochkah/	2025-01-26T20:05:19-08:00
The President of Ukraine introduced the new Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of...	He informed about this during an evening address to the citizens of Ukraine. -Today I want to celebrate the heroic actions of our soldiers in different areas. I especially thank the 95th separate brigade for the efficiency in Kurshchyna, the 25th separate airborne and the 68th separate hunting brigades for the successes in the Pokrovsky direction. Special thanks to the soldiers of the 24th and 100th separate mechanized brigades for their heroism in the battles for Chasiv Yar and Toretsk,- the President noted. Significant personnel changes took place in the command. Major General Andriy Hnatov was appointed Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Its main task is to improve the quality of training of operational staffs and to establish better interaction between command structures and the front. The president also thanked Ukrainian developers and manufacturers of long-range drones and missiles, which effectively reduce Russia's military potential. -Our weapons bring results: unrest in Russia, falling oil prices, limiting the enemy's capabilities - all this brings peace closer,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy emphasized. According to him, the year 2025 should be decisive in the struggle for Ukraine's independence. As reported by ArmiyaInform, the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy decided to strengthen the command staff at the hottest areas of the front in the Donetsk region. Major General Mykhailo Drapaty was appointed head of operational- of the Khortytsia strategic group of troops.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/26/prezydent-ukrayiny-predstavyv-novogo-zastupnyka-nachalnyka-genshtabu-zsu/	2025-01-26T11:48:39-08:00
Key appointment in the East: Mykhailo Drapaty will head OSUV -Khortytsia-	He informed about this during an evening address to the citizens of Ukraine. Major General Mykhailo Drapaty was appointed the head of the Khortytsia operational-strategic group of troops. This group operates in the areas where the fiercest fighting is going on. The head of state also noted that Mykhailo Drapaty will retain the post of commander of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which is the largest component of the army. The combination of these two roles will contribute to the coordination of combat missions with the proper training of brigades. The president added that it is the needs of the front that will determine the standards of staffing and training of military units.

OSUV - Khortytsia - explained the change in tactics of the Soviet Union in the Pokrovsky direction	On Sunday, January 26, told on the broadcast of the telethon, the spokesperson promptly- Major Viktor Tregubov of the strategic group of troops -Khortytsia-. -They don't have an unlimited number of personnel, which they used to throw at the city in wave after wave, until it began to cling to some suburbs, then enter the city, then destroy buildings closer to the center, and so on. They have already used this tactic on Pokrovsk. And this indicates that they simply do not have the people to use such tactics,- he said, commenting on the situation in this direction. According to the speaker of the -Khortytsia- OSUV, all this was the result of Ukrainian efforts to contain the enemy. -The goal of the Ukrainian troops is to slow down and destroy the Russian troops. To knock down the moment that allows them to advance now. It is partly successful, and we can see it on the example of Pokrovsk, where the Russians do not go forward, as they used to go straight to all the cities, but try to cover it,- Viktor Tregubov noted. As reported by ArmiyaInform, previously OSUV -Khortytsia- hortyczya/->denied rumors about the alleged encirclement of Ukrainian troops in Velika Novosilka.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/26/v-osuv-hortyczya-poyasnyly-zminu-taktyky-zs-rf-na-pokrovskomu-napryamku/	2025-01-26T10:53:23-08:00
No wonder the city was bombed, but water was brought: weekdays in occupied Popasnaya	About reports Center of National Resistance. It is noted that the occupation -administration- announced its intention to organize a -regular- delivery of drinking water to the destroyed city of Popasna. Popasna, which was virtually wiped off the face of the earth by Russian troops, still has no public utilities, and promises of water supply remain unfulfilled. In the town, where about 250 people now live, water used to be delivered only periodically in bottled form. As before, the pickup schedule and water quality are not reported. According to the occupiers, water delivery is carried out together with Russian -volunteers- and the so-called -municipal district administration- of the city of Sokologhirsk, to which the remnants of Popasnaya were formally annexed. However, even these plans do not address key humanitarian issues such as the lack of electricity, communications and other basic living conditions. A similar situation is observed in other occupied settlements of Luhansk Region. For example, residents of Novopskov and Bilovodsk have been waiting for the promised Internet connection for more than a year. The Center of National Resistance emphasizes that the occupiers are not able to provide even the minimum needs of the population. Only the de-occupation of the territories can put an end to the humanitarian catastrophe that has been going on for years. As reported by ArmyInform, locals are leaving, migrants are coming: Kremlin is changing the face of occupied communities.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/26/darma-shho-misto-rozbomblene-zate-vodu-pryvezly-budni-okupovanoyi-popasnoyi/	2025-01-26T10:31:20-08:00

He also added that the Ukrainian military is still present there and continues to destroy the Russians and their equipment. -I can't clarify where exactly they are and where the Russians are trying to maneuver, simply because it would jeopardize the operation itself,- explained the speaker of the Khortytsia OSU. As reported by ArmyInform, earlier in the 110th separate mechanized brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, they announced that after entering Velika Novosilka, the Russian occupiers got there in -fire bag-.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/26/okupantam-ne-vdalosya-otochyty-ukrayinski-vijska-u-velykij-novosilczi-osuv-hortyczya/	2025-01-26T09:51:54-08:00
Mobilized Russians are sent -for meat- for refusing the contract — interception of GUR	This is evidenced by radio interception of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine with the complaints of the occupiers themselves. -I walked around the dugouts here today. If you remember, Hades, Balu, FPVshniks, who are standing a little below us, where is the 85th mortar, do you understand? Their brigadier general was now in the infantry. Because they didn't sign the contract. They are mobilized. Tears and swords. There is nothing at all. You also know what happens in hospitals,- one of the Russians whines about this. In turn, his interlocutor, in response to this, notes that the same fate, most likely, awaits him.

A video with another such case was published in their Telegram channel by fighters of the -KHYZHAK- brigade at Department of patrol police. It shows that after being dropped from the Ukrainian drone, the occupant, who was still alive, decided not to wait for what would happen next, but immediately shortened his life by using his own grenade. -I will break for Rus'. Predators carried out a drop near an enemy infantryman, after which the injuries received forced the occupier to detonate a grenade under him. Probably, this is the first (and last) right decision in his life,- the patrolmen said, commenting on the Russian's choice. As reported ArmyInform, the DPSU told the story of a soldier who during the battle with the occupiers received wounded in the head, but continued his service.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/26/za-rus-vzirvus-dron-patrulnoyi-policziyi-sponukav-okupanta-vkorotyty-sobi-viku/	2025-01-26T08:20:03-08:00
- I was considered 200-th. A flamethrower of the Armed Forces spent the day in a trench with the Rus...	He told his extraordinary story to the journalists of Suspilny. According to the fighter, who is currently serving in the 704th regiment of radiation, chemical and biological protection, everything happened last year, during a combat mission in the village of Robotyne, Zaporizhzhia region, when his commander was seriously wounded. -He immediately told me to take responsibility, then lead the group. He told the boys to retreat in twos, because this was their first battle. I thought that they should retreat, and I would stay with him and help,- the fighter recalls. However, when he was helping the wounded commander, the Russians threw a grenade at them, as a result of which he died. -I still managed to go in and clear the hole, climb in and be there. I thought I would stay until the shelling was over. Fortunately, Muscovites did not see that I was there, because later, as it turned out from our drone footage, it was clear that I died there together with my brother, I was considered the 200th. I woke up somewhere at 6 in the morning&#8230; I didn't know what to do, whether to go out or not, I had already come to terms with the fact that I had died,- Vasyl admits. Suddenly he heard the voice of one of the Russians nearby. -Falled next to me, got up, limped. I see that he has a red bandage on his leg, I think, well, that's it, they arrived. I take out a grenade, I think, if anything, I will blow it up.- Here he says: -Who are you?- I say: -My-. I don't know how the head generated it. He: -Move, I'll come to you, after the injury, after the assault in Robotyn.- They got nuts there. I say: -No, go further, there is one of our people further away, go to him, there is still a place.- And he left,- says the Ukrainian defender. However, later the occupier did return, so Vasyl had to continue pretending to be a -Russian-. In the end, he left his shelter, telling an enemy soldier that he was going to get water, and when he met four more invaders, who also did not realize that he was Ukrainian, the fighter decided to find a new shelter. -I was sitting under a metal sheet, I was dying of a drone, because I didn't know at that time whose drone it was. The soldier got on the drone, I see the drone flashing, giving a signal. I did not understand anything, my head hurt so much. Probably recognized. As it turned out, they didn't recognize him, they thought he was a Muscovite, they had already aimed a mortar there and wanted to shoot, and my commander was sitting on the KSP, he was recognized by his jacket,- said the soldier. As a result, his comrades led Vasyl through the trenches, so he found himself in safety and now continues to defend the country. As ArmiyaInform reported, in Toretsk Russian the soldier failed to escape from the Ukrainian soldiers, who organized a real hunt for him, as a result of which he was captured.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/26/mene-vvazhaly-200-tym-vognemetnyk-zsu-dobu-proviv-v-okopi-z-rosijskymy-okupantamy/	2025-01-26T07:58:03-08:00

The occupiers on boats in the fog: our military explained why the occupiers are trying to force Oski...	Ruslan Piddubny, the commander of the battalion of unmanned systems -Antares- of the 4th brigade of NSU -Rubizh-, announced this on the air of the telethon. According to him, due to the fact that the river has not frozen, the occupiers cannot carry out a full-scale forcing using, for example, heavy equipment. Instead, they use small watercraft at night, or in foggy weather, to move in small groups of 5-8 people. After crossing, these groups try to hide in the forest plantations, waiting for reinforcements. -If they are not detected in advance, this reinforcement will number up to 20 people. And the first group to advance already knows our weaknesses. Therefore, it is even easier for subsequent groups to advance. In principle, the enemy's advance across the Oskil River took place in foggy weather,- said Ruslan Piddubny. This advance is not significant, says the commander of the Antares unmanned systems battalion. In addition, it is a very difficult area to arrange logistics. -If you take our experience, when we held a bridgehead in Makiivka, Luhansk region, it was very difficult for the enemy to cross the river there. Therefore, the bridgehead wedged into the defense. The enemy could not advance further. And in the few places where he was able to advance, he was unable to provide logistics. And was forced to retreat. Accordingly, using the terrain, we can stop such advances in advance,- added Ruslan Piddubny. As reported by ArmyInform, since the beginning of the day, the total number of combat clashes along the entire front line increased to 99.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/26/okupanty-na-chovnah-v-tumani-nashi-vijskovi-poyasnyly-chomu-okupanty-namagayutsya-forsuvaty-oskil-unochi/	2025-01-26T07:08:53-08:00

Locals are leaving, migrants are coming: the Kremlin is changing the face of occupied communities	About informs Center of National Resistance. Local residents continue to refuse to work for the occupation administrations or leave the cities where terrorists brought the -Russian measure- in the form of destroyed communities and death. In 2024 alone, almost 12,000 foreign citizens and stateless persons were placed on the migration register in the occupied Luhansk region. For comparison: at the end of 2023, there were approximately 3,800 such persons. In addition, according to the Eastern Human Rights Group, in 11 months of 2024, 109 applications for invitations to enter the Russian Federation were accepted, 101 visas of various categories were issued and extended, and also satisfied 516 applications for obtaining a residence permit. However, even such actions do not solve the region's key problems, such as distrust of the occupation authorities, lack of infrastructure, and the personnel crisis. In fact, knowing that the local population will continue to resist, the occupiers are carrying out ethnic replacement in the region. Instead of Ukrainians who leave or are deported by the Russian Federation, terrorists bring migrants from Central Asian countries or Russians from depressed regions of the Russian Federation. As reported by ArmyInform, the occupiers in Siverskodonetsk require residents to empty their apartments of furniture during repair works, which are carried out on a forced basis.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/26/misczevi-vyyizhdzhayut-migranty-pryyizhdzhayut-kreml-zminyuye-oblychchya-okupovanyh-gromad/	2025-01-26T06:12:02-08:00

-Sniper rifle- with weak armor? We talk with the crew about how the Leopard 1A5 performed in combat	Already in the early autumn of the same year, their saw ArmyInform, and later Army TV showed how 44 OMBr fires at these vehicles. A year after that, we visited the 44th Separate Mechanized Brigade and asked the Leopard 1A5 tank crew about how the machine performed on the battlefield. The guys, in particular, responded to common criticisms about weak armor and outdated equipment. Read about combat capabilities, additional protection, maneuverability and comparison with Soviet analogues in the ArmyInform report from positions in the northeast. The material was recorded in late autumn: the crew had just returned from a combat mission; was on recovery, the gunner was preparing for vacation. Although the fighters had been at their positions for quite a long time and were tired, they still spoke very lively about their machine. We begin our conversation about what expectations were from this tank. We will remind that immediately after it became known about Germany's decision to transfer Leopard 1A5 tanks to Ukraine, a wave of skepticism was observed in the network - they say that we are being transferred outdated equipment that is not suitable for the realities of the modern Russian-Ukrainian war. Indeed, at that time, dissatisfaction was caused by the fact that Ukraine was supposedly being handed over machines that are at least 50 years old, and not modern Leopard 2. The first German tank after the Second World War was also criticized for its weak armor. Gena, a charger from Sumy Oblast, and Volodymyr, a mechanic-driver from Cherkasy Oblast, tell us about their tank. We immediately ask what the guys think about the numerous comments about the fact that this is an outdated car. We have him for at least a year. There are downsides, but there are big pluses. Well, yes, an old man, but he does his job. Easy to maintain. All equipment breaks, but we were taught how to look and how to repair it. That's why nothing so critical happened to him this year, says Gena. Vladimir shares his opinion: - She is old, but she justifies herself. Nothing to add here, it's 100%. The main thing is the proper care of her and the harmony of the crew. I drove the T-72, and I can say that the Leopard 1A5 is better. The boys remember that they were taught everything in Germany - how to take care, and how to maneuver, and how to shoot. Everything was practiced there, because the tank was being prepared for maneuver warfare, so that it could reach anywhere, overcoming all possible obstacles. — The Germans were cheerful, they tried. As far as I remember, soups were not given away there. And I wanted borscht. But every weekend they have a tradition of making a barbecue. They did a particularly nice farewell - they roasted a lot of their sausages, brought various non-alcoholic beers, - recalls Gena. Volodymyr adds that they were taught by instructors who were over 50, because the younger Germans had already learned on the Leopard 2. It happened that one of the former instructors left his business for a certain time and returned to the training ground to teach Ukrainians. Volodymyr has been in the war since 2014, when he volunteered. He served for more than a year in the 30 OMBr as an infantryman, then resigned. He fought in Debaltseve. In 2022, he was also in the ranks of the Defense Forces from the first days. Gena says that in the first days of the large-scale invasion, he went to the Military Commissariat, passed the VLK and waited. The summons came five months ago. — He did not immediately want to join the tank battalion, because he had not previously been associated with equipment. He even asked to be sent back to study as an infantryman. But, as you can see, they are still here, they worked with the boys, - he laughs. Volodymyr says that at first he was also in the infantry, fought in Severodonetsk. But the unit was disbanded, and he became a tank driver. - I was not afraid. I know that a tank is a tank, when it moves to a position, the enemy is afraid in any case. When the dance works, it's something. It cannot be compared with anything. He simply leaves, disassembles trenches and dugouts for spare parts, and so on, - confidently explains the mechvod. He emphasizes that it was easy for the crew to master this machine. This is especially noticeable when compared with Soviet tanks - in the Leopard 1A5 everything is accurate, understandable, everything is done faster than on -our- analogues. To become a tanker driver, he says, the main thing is to have the desire. And don't be afraid to sit inside. Sometimes, fighters are afraid, because a tank, no matter what, is a priority target for the enemy. The worst was the first time. But in general, fear is present every time you leave. Gena remembers how once on a combat tour he had to spend the night in a tent: it started to get cold, something was already falling, damp, rain, mud all around. A stove that can be turned on without starting the machine comes to the rescue here. And in summer, in such situations, the air conditioner saves. - We sat in the dance floor, hid, and could not get out. When the sky is dirty, you have to lie in wait and wait for the command. When we are delayed in such cases, canned goods come to the rescue, the charger recalls. By the way, it has the most space inside the tank. We climb onto the tank with the boys so that they can show the place where the engine is located. It can be replaced here in 40 minutes. -It's fantastic, but it's true,- says the driver, adding that the car is very easy to maintain, and that's its advantage. The tank of the Leopard 1A5 holds 970 liters - this, taking into account its additional protection, is enough for 400 and a half kilometers of travel. The tank can develop a considerable speed for driving in reverse - 55 km per hour. This is very telling, as compared to Soviet tanks, which can barely go 5 km/h backwards, says the mechvod and clarifies that the Leopard 1A5 primer can go up to 65 km/h. The charger adds that he really likes the quiet operation of the machine. The mechvod agrees with him, calling it a great advantage over Soviet machines. Both praise the thermal imager in their work, because they work mostly in the dark or -in the dark-. They mainly work in dugouts and other fortified positions of the enemy. I also had to work on technology. -You can sneak into ravines and do a good job,- the guys say about the Leopard 1A5's advantages. Then we climb inside together with the crew. - The car is very sensitive, it is extremely easy to control, - Vladimir climbs into the driver's seat and demonstrates a small steering wheel that responds very smoothly to his hands. - There is no need to pull anything here. Everything is clear and effortless. Automatic gearbox. It -quickly-, easily works like that. Sitting in the place of the loader, we conclude that maneuverability is one of the main advantages of the Leopard 1A5. It also has a -chip- when the left and right tracks rotate in different directions, so the tank can turn right on the spot. - These are all great advantages in it. There is no such maneuverability and speed in the T-64 or T-72. This -Leopard- only drives in reverse as the T-64 drives forward. And maybe even faster, - says Vladimir. The gunner probably has the least space in this spacious cabin. However, he is in direct contact with the tank commander. We ask what are the disadvantages of this car. Mehvod immediately says that he does not like the fact that the tracks are on rubber pads: - Often, Western machinery has such pads on the tracks so as not to spoil the roads. If it weren't for them, the tank would go even faster. They can be replaced manually, but this is a very time-consuming process, because each thing must be removed separately with a special tool. We sit in the seat of the tank commander and talk to the loader. He shows what his job is and mentions that he has the most space in the cabin. And also shows the twin 7.62 mm machine gun that this machine is equipped with. Gena emphasizes that the tank has a modern fire control system, which is why it has the A5 prefix. Also shows the place where he stores shells - they are different, depending on the type of tasks, but you can't talk about them. A mechvod crawls through the place of the loader to us and confirms that the fire control system is very good, works effectively both day and night: - If we received the exact coordinates from the adjuster, then this tank works like a sniper rifle. I can't tell you all the details, but we have the power and the means to know in real time where we hit. This system significantly helps in correcting the shot, how many corrections to take, azimuth and level. The guys say that Leopard 1A5 shells fall very accurately, and sometimes the enemy did not even have time to understand what exactly was flying at it, confusing the Leopard with a mortar, and they note that it hits very accurately, how to compare with Soviet counterparts is like heaven and earth. Separately, we dwell on the dynamic protection, which was recently installed on this tank. It helps not only against cluster bombs, but also against RPGs, LNG, grenade launchers and drones. Footage of the training of its crews on the Leopard 1A5 with such armor was already shown by the Ground Forces . The guys say that this is not a fundamentally new decision, because the command is constantly thinking about how to protect personnel and equipment. Therefore, such tanks in the 44th OMBr have been fighting with dynamic defense for quite some time. By the way, on Sukhoutka video you can see what the Leopard 1A5 looks like with the -barbecue- installed. Mehvod is not ready to say that the tank is somehow very different from Soviet tanks: -It's no secret, this tank has homogeneous armor. But, thank God, it was not necessary to check its strength. Our advantage is that the command uses this machine very competently.- Although it is mentioned that it was this Leopard 1A5 that was once hit by an enemy FPV, and also received shrapnel from the Lancet. Vladimir shows the mark left on the armor and says that it did not affect the tank in any way, he drove on and worked. The guys say that they are given vacation according to the rules, they are able to recover minimally, but still 30 days is not enough. At the same time, the tankers claim that they are here to win. -I don't want my children to be under the invaders,- adds Gena. We are talking about the fact that there are not enough people to replace those who have been fighting for the third year. - There is enough of everything here - equipment, clothes, and normal food. The team is cool, everyone is adequate. Whoever comes will be supported here, will be shown everything. It doesn't matter how he gets here, says the mechvod. — Our crew is like clockwork. All are interconnected. It's like a family. Only in a tank,- adds Gena with a slight smile. Finally, we say that the fighters on the front lines, especially those who have been fighting for three years or longer, are tired: -When someone says that we are running out, it is not necessarily irreversible losses. People get tired physically and mentally, they need to be replaced.- - We need to get involved, because we are not here forever. And don't be afraid. Yes, war is scary, but there is no need to be afraid. Someone has to do this work. Everything has its resource. Just because we're not eternal doesn't mean we're gone and dead. This means that people are getting tired, and the army needs fresh strength, - adds Gena.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/26/snajperska-gvyntivka-zi-slabkoyu-broneyu-govorymo-z-ekipazhem-pro-te-yak-leopard-1a5-pokazav-sebe-v-boyu/	2025-01-25T21:09:50-08:00
It took a while, now he is a double elite. The story of a paratrooper and a sniper -Gryni-	Oleksiy told ArmiyaInform about his life choices and combat path, as well as the importance of sergeants in the Armed Forces. — All my life I wanted to join the Air Force, because it is a real elite. True, half a year later the Airborne Forces were renamed to the Airborne Forces, but we still remained paratroopers, - smiles -Grynya-. Over time, service in the Armed Forces became for a military man not only an episode in his biography, but also a vocation and a final life choice, and the Airborne Assault Forces was the place where Alexei found the most sincere and loyal friends. — I was thinking of signing a contract for three years, and after it ended, go -for a civilian.- But then it dragged on - even when there was a calmer phase of the war during the time of the ATO / OOS, so I serve until today, - he recalls. Oleksiy began his service as a soldier, gradually acquiring the knowledge and experience necessary to attain the rank of sergeant. — I spent three years in the soldiers, because then everyone said: a clean shoulder is a clean conscience. But then I realized myself, and the commanders saw that I already had the experience to move on, says the senior sergeant. As a skillful and skilled shooter, Oleksiy was sent to study at a sniper school, where he completed the basic courses and received the appropriate certificate. — Then for a year and a half, I ran in snipers - in a line company, but as a sniper. Dual elite - a paratrooper and a sniper - jokes a military man. It was as a sniper that -Grynya- met a large-scale invasion, taking part in high-intensity battles with the enemy. — During the first month of the full-scale war, I had eight -minuses- (confirmed liquidated Russian occupiers - ed.). Then it was a lot, but now it is, of course, little things, - modestly informs the soldier. Soon, responsibility, leadership qualities and many years of service experience allowed Oleksiy to become a unit commander, and later a platoon commander. The soldier was given the rank of sergeant. - Those who could organize people and carry out a combat mission were appointed as commanders. I believe that a sergeant, from junior sergeant to unit commander, is an extremely important rank in the Armed Forces. Everything rests on it, a confident military man. He is convinced that sergeants are the main backbone of the Ukrainian army and play the role of a connecting link from the soldier to the highest levels of command. — A sergeant can hold positions from a department commander to a platoon commander — and that's all a sergeant. It is the backbone of our Armed Forces. Without a sergeant there is no army, without a sergeant there are no normal troops. A professional military sergeant, a universal warrior, characterizes Oleksiy the importance of sergeants in the Armed Forces. In the 199th training center of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Oleksiy serves as an instructor of the Sergeant Training Center, so he is well aware of the requirements for the -universal warrior- of the Armed Forces of Ukraine - from the performance characteristics of any weapon available in the army to making combat decisions and giving orders. — The sergeant must have leadership and commanding qualities. So that he is not afraid to make a decision and is not afraid of responsibility, and also has a good understanding of any weapon from a machine gun and above - up to MANPADS or some kind of equipment. A sergeant must know all the weapons of his unit and be able to replace any of the soldiers, the soldier explains. However, the most important quality of a sergeant, Oleksiy calls humanity and attention to each of the soldiers. Because if a sergeant knows how to work with people of different backgrounds and ages, with different life experiences and education, he will be able to gradually master everything else and become a real leader in the team he will lead in his position. - When I commanded a platoon, soldiers could turn to me with any questions. Or I myself approached them and talked, if they did not go to contact. Because a sergeant is a person who must do everything possible for his soldiers, the instructor is convinced. At the training center, Oleksiy and his colleagues are training precisely such sergeants who are capable of becoming not only commanders, but also representatives of fighters in the teams they lead. There are not many such people, but the best ones get here, the instructor is convinced. — Military personnel with combat experience and command experience come to us. They already have the rank of sergeant and strive to develop and improve. Therefore, there are no problems with motivation - they themselves strive to rise to the next level, to become even better than they were, - explains the senior sergeant. Graduates of the Sergeant Training Center of the 199th Training Center of the Military Intelligence Service really become the real combat elite of their units. The most valuable achievement in training and communication with brothers and fellow sergeants is called mutual assistance and strong friendship. — What I really like in the army is brotherhood. This is such a strong friendship that I would never have met -in a civilian life-. It is this friendship in the army that keeps and does not want to let go. As if I could have -written off- by now, but I made friends here with the boys - and I don't want to go anywhere, I want to be with them and help them, - concludes our conversation.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/26/zatyagnulo-teper-vin-podvijna-elita-istoriya-desantnyka-i-snajpera-gryni/	2025-01-25T20:37:35-08:00
Two million mines: -undermining- reality in Russian	The first question that arises is how much does it all weigh? For those who don't know, one antipersonnel mine weighs 2-4 kilograms on average. If we take only two million such mines (and this is -only- what Russian -experts- tell us), then the total weight of the -arsenal- that we allegedly buried is 4-8 thousand tons. Yes, it is several echelons or a colossal convoy of trucks. And where is all this -evidence-? Or maybe they are also mined? In modern warfare, mining the rear is not only illogical, but also technically difficult. Mines of this scale would take a colossal amount of resources, time and manpower, which are simply not available during active hostilities on the front. At most, Ukraine receives weapons from partners mainly for offensive or defensive purposes, and not for building a mine museum somewhere in the rear. However, Russian propagandists lack logic. For them, the main thing is to come up with something shocking, preferably such that even an old grandmother from Kursk would have her blood pressure raised. Here everything is simpler than it seems. Firstly, through fake statements, they are trying to discredit the Armed Forces of Ukraine, to create an image of -cruel and inhumane Ukrainians- who -do not count for anything.- Secondly, they divert the attention of their own citizens from the fact that their own mobilized people continue to get into -cotton shows- in the rear and on the front lines. And most importantly: this is an attempt to justify his own crimes. For every detonation of a civilian object or mass death of civilians, they already have an alibi ready: -it's not us, it's Ukrainian mines.- Let's imagine that we really -mined- the rear. What's next? Shall we put up -Caution, Russians not allowed- signs along these mines? Or maybe we will sign each mine: -Made in Ukraine, but only for fakes-? It seems that the Russian propagandists were so engrossed in their lying scenarios that they themselves began to believe in this movie. But the reality is this: their fictions are more like a poorly staged play for jaded audiences than anything worthwhile. Real evidence? None. No satellite images, no reports, no photos, no videos. Nothing. the Russian mass media once again created a myth on an equal footing, because inventing horror stories about Ukraine is their way of life. In fact, Ukraine fights honestly, in accordance with international norms, while Russian troops are famous for their minefields, which remain after their retreats. The next time you are told about another -sensation- from Russian propagandists, just think about who benefits from it. And remember: Ukraine is fighting for life, freedom and security, while Russia is fighting for -Olgino ratings-. The reality is simple: Two million mines is not about us. It is about those who undermine themselves on their own inventions.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/26/dva-miljony-min-pidryv-realnosti-po-rosijsky/	2025-01-25T20:15:15-08:00

A ride to the other world — near Pokrovsk, the Russians are bringing their infantry close to our pos...	This enemy tactic was reported on January 25 on the ArmiyaTV stream by an officer of the information and communication service of the 14th brigade of operational assignment named Ivan Bohun -Red viburnum- of the National Guard Maxim Bakulin. -Assaults on vehicles have become more frequent.

BZVP in Ukrainian universities: what you need to know	In this regard, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine answers to the most common questions among students on this topic. -The BZVP program was developed taking into account modern challenges and the experience of leading European countries, in particular Poland, Finland and the Baltic states. It is aimed at forming the necessary military skills among young people and ensuring the readiness of citizens to defend the state.

This would exempt them from mandatory basic military service, which all men between the ages of 18 and 25 are required to do under current law. Also, passing the BZVP will be a necessary condition for the first employment in the civil service, in local self-government bodies and the prosecutor's office. How is the educational process organized? The program is designed for students of full-time and dual forms of education. Theoretical training will be integrated into the curriculum as a separate discipline. Practical classes will be held during the holidays, which will avoid a conflict with the main study. Who conducts the training? Experienced retired military personnel, veterans of war and military service will be involved in the teaching of BZVP. Mandatory requirements are fluency in the Ukrainian language, an appropriate level of higher education, as well as good health and physical fitness. What practical skills do the students get?

Famous Ukrainian documentary photographers Kostya and Vlada Liberovy told the correspondent of ArmiyaInfrom about how their work has changed, what emotions are the most difficult to show in the shots, as well as about photos that are perceived personally and moments when it seemed that this would be the last shot. - How did the war affect you and your perception of life? - Everything has changed completely, starting from the circle of our communication, values ​​and ending with the style of clothing. From people who were not aware, not involved, we began to live a war. It's a real shame the way it used to be and would like to do a lot more now to balance it all out. If you look at what we shot before the wide scale, it is a photo where people are hugging, kissing, where people are smiling. Now, yes, we still have the main colors in photography, the search for our favorite light, that is, visually our language has not changed, but what the photos are about has changed. It took us half a year to get a feel for filming war. At first, we just duplicated what we knew before as photographers, but this is a completely different field of photography, it didn't turn out well, but some part of this experience remained, and you can say that this is some of our individuality in it. Speaking of colors, I don't know about Kosta, but I hate the blue sky in war, Vlada says and continues. — It hurts me so much. The sky is always so happy, right, just imagine: the blue boundless sky above the battered landing where our best men are dying and wounded&#8230; It creates a very strong dissonance for me, because under such a magical blue sky there must be something beautiful, and you find yourself where terrible things happen. Personally, I feel more comfortable filming the war under cloudy skies: in the rain, under the snow, when the weather is bad, then it is logical, I don't expect anything good. We work a lot in Donetsk region, and there are incredible dawns. In Kherson Oblast, there are unsurpassed sunsets, when nature begins to give you something super beautiful, and against the background of all this horror, for some reason I even feel anger inside. - Has your perception of death in the war changed over time? - We have lost many good friends and acquaintances, some of them even before our eyes were injured and died&#8230; Death used to be scary, now it's a habit. It's actually terrifying. Thinking about death, I always have a story in contrast, it was before the large-scale invasion, where we lived in Odessa. A person fell out of a window and died. It so happened that at that moment I was leaving the entrance: I see something covered with a bag, doctors are standing, people are gathering. It knocked me off track for more than a week, then I even dreamed of that situation. I didn't know this person, I didn't see anything, but Kostya knows that it almost became a nervous breakdown for me. Now, like, a lot of things are happening before your eyes and you just keep silent. It's scary that things like this are becoming commonplace. Even for the most sensual people, it is perceived that way, because there is no other way. This is how the human psyche is arranged - we get used to everything and there is no other way. These experiences remain, the pain remains, but it is somehow more dulled. The pain is throbbing, but you can live with it. But, it can last much longer than the sharp pain. - When you return from a war zone, are there any rituals to return to a more calm and peaceful life? - For both of us, it's just sitting at home and doing nothing, but at some point we feel acute the need to go back and do your thing again. We always emphasize that we are not in the army, we are not mobilized, but it so happened that all our social circle is military and it is difficult for us to find ourselves in ordinary civilian life in Kyiv. The government begins to prepare, because it found itself in this. -These are absolutely simple things, but this process, when you cut something, it cooks there, it calms me down and becomes a meditative element. Kostya Pravda then washes the dishes, and he doesn't like it,- Vlada says with a laugh. Kostya looks at his wife with a tender look and says: -She cooks perfectly and it's all very good. We started going to the hall when we are in Kyiv. It is more related to work, we found our coach, to whom we want to return. — When you work on the front lines lately, it's a constant load, you walk around in ammunition, fully equipped. During the time of Vovchansk, I completely changed my protection, I now have Kevlar everywhere: on my sides, neck, lower back, a large striker. I first encountered an FPV drone there, from which I was running away, says Kostya and continues. — When you run away from a drone that is chasing you with one goal: to kill or maim you, you draw a model in your head, where you imagine how the debris will fly into your body, and you think about how best to hold your hands so that less debris will fly. It is generally a weapon against humanity. And it turns out that you already want to take with you some equipment, provisions, and all this is additional weight on you, constant marches of 5-10 km, so sports are in fact an investment in your health and life. We tell all our friends not to neglect protection, so for the New Year holidays, for those who serve, we have updated the armor to be with the attackers. - What are the most difficult emotions for you to show in your works? - You can actually just open our Instagram page and see all the photos we took from the last to the first of the war. Every photo is pain and emotion. The most painful are the burials. This is simply the worst thing that can happen in this life. If these are your good friends, then this is just some surreal plot. We hate shootings like this, but at the same time we understand their importance because we have been thinking a lot lately about the importance of how future generations will remember and remember this war. There is such a persistent feeling that quite often Ukrainians find themselves defenseless before the enemy, because from generation to generation we forget who our enemy is. There is a feeling that the Russians have a background hatred for Ukrainians, and we do not have a background hatred for them. When the acute phase of the conflict, which has been going on for centuries, stops, we forget and begin to build relations with them again, we draw culture and language to us. We want to make it so (this idea was planted by Iryna Tsybukh - ed.) that future generations remember what happened in detail. The burial itself is the plot that best shows what kind of pain the Russians cause us in this period, because we show how painful it is to lose relatives and friends. - You constantly work together in quite difficult and stressful situations. Has the war changed your relationship? - Fortunately, no. Even from the beginning of our relationship, when we were not married, we worked together. All our lives, starting from the moment of meeting, we do everything together. Kostya says: -I love spending time with my wife and I wouldn't trade it for anything.- Vlada, thinking for a moment, proudly answers: -My perception of the person next to me has changed. I never knew Kostya was brave. There were simply no such cases when he was not a person who, for example, gets into a fight, because he is calm. I was surprised that he could work in such conditions. I can't do that, so I haven't been to the infantry for a year. All this year, Kostya actively worked with the infantry and went on assaults. It was a trait of his that I didn't know about. -Are there any stories that you have documented and would like to see them adapted? - An incredible number of stories that we see are actually ready-made plots for some very good cinema. Any infantryman and what happens in the positions is worthy of a screenplay. There is simply an incredible heat of passion. The horrors we saw there, the boys live them day by day. Sometimes when we watch some movies about the war, it seems that everything is much simplified there than what the military tells you, which is 11 years into this war. And we would very much like as many ordinary people and infantrymen as possible to go down in history, to save them and their faces, because they deserve it. - What was the most risky moment for you during filming, when you thought: -This could be my last shot-? - The first time it happened was when Vlada was injured. We were driving the car, not thinking about anything, and here the -Gradiv- packages are opening in front of us. You are muffled, everything is ringing in your ears, you don't even have time to be scared at this moment, but just think how stupid it is to die like that. We had the same thoughts, although we sat on different sides of the car. -I thought that's it, this must be it. I didn't have time to be scared at the moment, only then I was terribly scared for Vlada when she said that she had something wet in her side. I couldn't even open the car door because I was so scared. Then I had a real panic, although I usually tolerate everything very calmly and just shoot it. At that moment I was just confused, Vlada was given first aid, she told me to film this process,- Kostya recalled. -I understood that it was a minor injury, I was not dying and I was not in a panic. I had another moment. At that time, we worked with the -Azov- brigade. The shelling started, we started running and it's all about physical fitness and why it's so important. I had a very heavy armored car, I was not physically ready, and at a certain point I just fell on the shot bridge, because my body simply refused to run any further. I lie on it and think that's it, now the next projectile is in me. Then I got up, crawled, it wasn't scary, I was very angry with myself for putting people near me in danger. I can't move at their pace, everyone slows down because of me and it was a feeling of anger. And there was a second in the moment when I was lying down and thinking about everything: I felt sick,- Vlada shared her memory. - Do you have a -border of fear- that you do not cross? , when you don't physically pull, superimposed on fear after being wounded. When my husband works at zero, I shoot medical evacuation or art. - How do you feel about the fact that your photos can be used for Russian propaganda or manipulation? At most, it was one thing when it was their usual propaganda, but when it was those who tried to position themselves as an independent Russian mass media and could have access to a bank of photo agencies, where they officially buy them, put them on websites, and then write: -Here , again the Armed Forces failed to storm: losses of 500,000 people for today.- However, over time, they got used to it, because they understood that this is a Russian base - to lie. - How do you feel about the fact that your photos may be in history textbooks in the future? - Our close friend told us that there is a teacher in one Odesa school who shows our photos to the children and it really bothers us. moved It just feels like a dream come true that you've done something important. There is a new generation and they are shown our works, and it is an honor for us. Feeling like you've won an Oscar at the same time. It's not about the physical reward, it's much more weighty and meaningful. If our photos will one day be in the history books, it is not for nothing that we lived and did something valuable for future generations. - What are the most unexpected emotions you had to show in a frame? - Burial of Kosti Yuzvuk. He left a will as to how he would like his funeral to be conducted. Honestly, it looked like a party and everyone got into it. It was sweet and brought tears to my eyes. Taken out of context, this may seem strange to the average viewer. We edited a certain part of the photos and did not give them to the agency, because these photos could be taken out of context and propaganda could use this to their advantage. That is, the fact that today, following the will of the deceased, friends and relatives find the courage to smile precisely at the moment of farewell, because this person wanted it, is super cool, because this is the strength of the Ukrainian people. We give these photos to relatives, but do not publish them. - What good emotions did you have to convey in the frame? - There are also a lot of good emotions, despite the pain. In contrast, there are many such bright moments, such as love and sincerity, which are very powerfully felt. We've shot a lot of weddings on the front and it's always so real. When shooting a lot of weddings before 2022, it didn't always feel like it was on the front. People get married for different reasons and you don't always feel such sincerity in them at the moment. It is also the birth of children, brotherhood, the feeling of a strong shoulder and support. By the age of 30, of course, we had friends, but it was somehow sterile. Like okay, like a proper friendship from the TV series, sometimes we visited each other. And here it is completely different. Maybe you see this person 2-3 times, but he becomes so dear to you that you are ready to give everything for this person and this person gives you back. Such feelings are difficult to compare with anything at all. This is possible only during the war, and I hope that we will carry it further after the war. —After the end of the war, don't you plan to create your own museum or space where the personnel will speak for themselves? — On the one hand, this can be related to memory, because we really want to be a part of making sure that our actions do not forget all the horrors of war. We didn't think specifically about a museum or a space, but we don't have the resources now or ever to do something this big. But we do hope that there will be a resource for creating a photo book. Every year we say that we should start doing, but then we think that it is too early. Over the last month, we started working on our archive. These are about 70,000 photos that need to be re-examined, reconsidered and tried to assemble into something unified and harmonious. We hope to do so one day. - What is the most personal shot, even though the viewer doesn't know it? - Personal is an unpublished story that we haven't shown anywhere about the dead Da Vinci. We don't know if these photos will ever see the world, but his story and how he died are very personal to us. In general, it is all personal, it is difficult to single out one or several stories. All our work is with some involvement and emotionality, it cannot be otherwise. There are stories that make their way to the very heart and you can't do anything about it. It happens that we take a picture, and then relatives contact us and ask for a photo. They say that this was the last shot of this soldier and they ask to send a photo in good quality and it also becomes personal. These are quite painful moments. - How often are there moments when you cry after filming? - There is no such thing right away, because no nervous system could withstand that. But all the delayed emotions, Vlada personally catches up in the form of tears or in the form of aggression. That is, everything accumulated comes out later. - Will you return to filming peaceful life after the end of the war? - We will definitely shoot peaceful life, but we do not know in what format. This will definitely not be a love shoot, that is, everything that was done before the large scale. When peace comes, we will look for ourselves in it, but we will remain in documentary photography. We fell in love with this genre, because before we had an influence on the plot and everything that happened in the frame, and now our task is to catch the moment, because we don't have such influence, and that's why we fell in love with documentary photography as a genre. - Do you have a photographic dream that you have not yet realized or are you on your way to it? - When we were just starting out, the dream was to take, as probably every military photographer has, a photo that would stop a war . But the more you take such photos that should have stopped the war, the more you realize that it is not in the power of photographers and photos. We dream of shooting Victory. When we filmed the de-occupation of Kherson, it felt like a small celebration of Victory Day, but in the context of a separate city. And this dream that this day will come. However, now it seems that we will not celebrate it like that, but will remember those who gave their lives for her. We will be given the official casualty figure that day. And we will all go home in silence to think about this number. The best photos are the ones you were able to post, so you're alive.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/25/70-tysyach-foto-vijny-na-dvoh-pro-vtechu-vid-fpv-dronu-neopublikovani-foto-da-vinchi-ta-shho-czinnishe-za-oskar-intervyu-z-liberovymy/	2025-01-24T21:10:00-08:00
-I have never seen so much FPV in my life-: the story of a rugby player, and now a company officer, ...	Senior lieutenant, commander of the countersabotage company in the ranks of the 241st separate brigade of the Territorial Defense of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. In civilian life, he was professionally engaged in rugby (since 1993), played for the Aviator club in the capital. He also had a private business. An active participant of two revolutions (Orange and Euromaidan), he has a stable and unyielding position regarding the future of Ukraine, its sovereignty and territorial integrity. -When I graduated from the ninth grade, in my graduation album, I was the only one with a blue-yellow badge on my school uniform,- recalls Viktor Baranov with pride. He says that after the end of the Revolution of Dignity, in the spring of 2013, he was in the center of Kyiv near the tent where volunteers were being recruited for the ranks of the -Donbas- battalion and thought about joining this unit. -I'll be honest: I didn't have enough courage. I justified myself by the fact that I have a 4-year-old daughter and I need to raise her. But he started volunteering. When the marine units left the Crimea for Mykolaiv, I visited them. Later, in Mariupol, he also worked under Debaltsev, Shchasti on the Svitlodar arc as a volunteer.- He admits that he did not expect a large-scale Russian invasion, and on February 24, 2022, he was in Transcarpathia, at a sports meeting with the Ukrainian rugby league team. -When I was told -Kep, war- - I immediately jumped into the car and drove to Kyiv. It is remembered that a lot of cars drove from the capital, and only a few cars went to Kyiv. When I entered the South Bridge, a rocket exploded overhead,- he says. In order to get into the ranks of the Defense Forces in the first days of the large-scale, says, laughing, -Cap-, it was necessary to resort to -corruption-: the queues at the military checkpoints were crazy, and those who wanted it were in the dark. In the end, Viktor Baranov as a soldier joined the ranks of the Territorial Defense Rifle Battalion (3rd Rifle Company). Got into -my- environment: out of 7 people in the department, 5 are athletes. In June 2022, during the battles for Dementiivka in Kharkiv Oblast, he received an injury. -&#8230; And I -escaped- from the hospital in order to, together with my brothers, with the whole platoon, plan an operation to remove the bodies of our dead, among them was the fallen company commander with the call sign -Sherman-. When everything was successful and we returned with the body, everyone just looked at us with wide-open eyes, speechless. After this incident, everyone respected us very much.- The career growth of an ambitious military man with good physical training was rapid and well-deserved: in March 2022, Viktor Baranov headed a department, in September 2022, a platoon (and, accordingly, already had the rank of junior lieutenant). And in 2023, he became a company commander. I ask which of these command positions was the most difficult for a military man. He says he's a mouthful. -It's a terrible position. The most difficult thing in it is to inform relatives about the death of their husband, son, brother in the war. Or when they call and ask about the circumstances of the death or why the body was not evacuated from the battlefield. It's incredibly difficult. As a company member, I know all the callsigns and year of birth of my soldiers. For example, -Duke-, born in 1999. He died. I know that he is the only son of his parents. And I realize that my son is the same age. I remember talking to him for 30 minutes. And I understood how important this conversation was for him, and my task during this communication was to provide information and support as much as possible. Although I understand for myself that parents do not need all the heroic deeds of their children - they need their child alive. The second most difficult thing in the position of a company commander, continues -Cap-, is to send his subordinates on a combat mission. -And my boys were born in 2003-2005. And the most difficult thing is to give them an order and send them on a mission. But when they return, then the best thing happens in the commander's life: I hug them, thank them for their work, and see how their eyes light up. We always discuss everything. And I always emphasize: any task can be done. Even burning Moscow is possible. But: not today, not by our strength, and not by our means. That is why we discuss each and every task in detail, chewing it down to the smallest nuances. And I am very nervous and very nervous at such moments,- shares the mouthpiece, smiling. And the most valuable thing in the life of a commander, says the interlocutor, is to hear from subordinates words like: -I trust you, commander, and that's why I will do it.- -These are the best people. And they are the best because we, the commanders, make them so.- In his mouth, -Kep- promotes a healthy lifestyle: -Our laws are -wild- - they don't even drink beer. And the chief sergeant of the company, by the way, has 536 jumps with a parachute, before the war he was engaged in parachuting.- &#8230; December 1, 2024 was one of the harsh combat episodes in the life of Comrade Viktor Baranov and his comrades. The place of action is Donetsk region, Velika Novosilka district. Then, according to the command, during the execution of combat missions, he skillfully built defenses in the settlement entrusted to him and thus blocked the enemy breakthrough of 40 infantrymen and eight units of Russian armored vehicles. -We predicted what sort of landings the Russians were planning to take, brought our BMP-2 into position there, it was 5 o'clock in the morning. Among the weapons was also -Fagot- and RPG. I myself was driving a pickup truck. And it so happened that we&#8230; drove into the flank of the Pod*rska column. She was 600 meters from us. We simply did not see them because of the peculiarities of the terrain there. To say that I was scared then is an understatement. If the Russians had seen us then and turned their -cannon- on us, we would be gone, I'm honest. I have never seen as much FPV as December 1st in my life! Three enemy UAVs flew into our pick-up truck, and they also worked on us with anti-aircraft missiles. In total, there were about 20 FPVs - in three years, we have not received such attention,- says -Kep-. The military calls the success of this combat sortie the good strategic position of the Ukrainian units in relation to the enemy; a good, well-camouflaged attack position, etc. During these events, the officer received a second concussion. But this whole story is summed up succinctly: -They crossed each other and left.- All this lasted from approximately 7:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. In conclusion: 10 Russians were eliminated, about 10 were wounded and 15, unfortunately, survived. Traditionally, we ask military personnel from the Defense Forces about how civilians can overcome their fear of the army, mobilization, and war. -Cap- replies, -I always tell my guys that I'm scared every time, every time I go out. Because only an idiot or a person under the influence of some substances is not afraid. For a normal person, fear is a normal phenomenon. And I explain that no matter how they feel about the word courage, courage is the ability to do what we have when we are afraid. That is, you are afraid - but you have to do it. That's what the concept of -courage- is. And to our second traditional question about what will be the end of the Russian-Ukrainian war for him, -Kep- answers as follows: -&#8230; But what is victory?.. Crossing the borders of 1991?.. I understand that it will be difficult to return Crimea now - but I would really like to. Perhaps some sanctions, exchanges, etc. will help. We would categorically not want a freeze on hostilities. Because the enemy will only accumulate armored vehicles, artillery, rockets, increase the army - and again deliver a massive blow. I don't trust the Russians&#8230; But do you know what I dream about? So that the shelling would stop, a kind of -buffer zone- of at least 1 kilometer would be formed on the contact line, and so that we would have at least half a year to take the bodies of our dead brothers from the battlefield. And the bastards took their own, if they need them, of course. After all, I very often talk with the relatives of those soldiers whose bodies have not yet been evacuated. And this is the only thing they ask me as a commander: -Take away at least the body - he wanted to go home so badly.- But I cannot expose my subordinates to such risks and dangers, because now the enemy has a lot of drones. But it is important for me to posthumously award these soldiers. After all, without a body, they are considered -400-, if there is a body - -200-. And only then will I be able to submit them for an award, and for me as a commander, this is very important.- And then, after thinking, the officer adds: -And I would also really like a big fence, about six meters high, on the state border of Ukraine - so that the Great Wall of China would envy us- Or that there was a North Sea on the eastern border of Ukraine, from Vovchansk to the Urals, with beluga and a lot of caviar. Or that we border the Arctic Ocean.- Photo from Viktor Baranov's personal archive	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/25/stilky-fpv-ya-shhe-ne-bachyv-nikoly-u-svoyemu-zhytti-istoriya-regbista-a-nyni-rotnogo-viktora-baranova/	2025-01-24T20:50:22-08:00
-Houston, we've got a problem-: How the International Legion Intelligence Control Point 2 works	Pavlo, commander of the special purpose company, deputy commander of the battalion tactical group, told ArmiyaInform about the combat work of the intelligence control point of the 2nd International Defense Legion. — Previously, when we worked in the Serebryansk Forest, we called such a point TSUP — the Flight Control Center. Now we call it PUR - Intelligence Control Point. Our main task is to coordinate combat work. Everything that can be obtained from radio-electronic intelligence, intelligence reports, and messages from neighbors flows here. We analyze radio-electronic intelligence - the report of our PEP arrives here - and draw conclusions about what the enemy's actions will be in our area of ​​responsibility, Pavlo explains. He notes that the enemy works on both analog and digital radios. The available PEP equipment allows you to listen to all analog communication. As for the -digit-, the keys to it are selected by hardware and also allow radio interception. - We learn the enemy's conventional marking grid - how they mark this or that landing and the points in it. Thanks to this, a layer is created in -Kropyva-, on which we fix points with the conventional markings of the enemy, which he uses in radio intercepts, says the officer. It is possible to find out the conventional signs of the enemy from the testimonies of prisoners and thanks to analytical work. For example, by listening to radio intercepts and observing the events on the battlefield, it is possible to determine how the occupiers mark this or that point on the site. — When shelling occurs, the enemy corrects it. We hear how they mark the point where they are shooting and record it on the map. Or when we inflict fire damage on them, certain assault or counter-assault actions take place, then through interception we also understand how the enemy marks this or that area. Then we put it on the map and report to the management for consideration in further work, says Pavlo. Thanks to such analytical work, it is possible to find out the vast majority of conditional marks used by enemies in the area already in a week. This makes it possible to understand which areas the intercepted messages are talking about and to react accordingly to the actions of the enemy. — When there is some accumulation, some movement, we intercept it all and report it. Because of this, we know and understand what the enemy is going to do, some time before the assaults, or the movement, or the massing, or other movements of the enemy. This is a simple linear analysis, there are no complex systems here. There is just an interception, in which callsigns and some dots sound. This is normal analytical work, there is nothing extraordinary here, he adds. The enemy's radio-electronic intelligence works in a similar way - the occupiers listen to the air and try to intercept and analyze the messages of the Ukrainian military. To prevent eavesdropping, countermeasures are used to effectively counter these hostile attempts. — There are algorithms according to which the encryption system in the radio air changes with a certain periodicity. For example, we change code-plugs on digital radio stations every week. Therefore, even if the enemies decoded our frequencies by hardware and can somehow eavesdrop, very quickly, after changing the encryption codes, they lose this opportunity, says Pavlo. He notes that the ethics of using radio stations, when speaking as little as possible on the air, also plays an important role. Another advantage is the Ukrainian language, because Russians understand Ukrainian much worse than Ukrainians understand Russian. And when it comes to foreign volunteers of the International Legion who communicate in their own languages, it becomes even more difficult for the enemy. — But still the most important are the encryption table, the ethics of communication in the radio air, and the most frequent change of the coding system. This is the only way we can prevent the enemy's PEP from working, the military man emphasizes. — The most important thing now is not to miss the movement of small groups. A year and a half ago, the Russians moved in groups of 4-6 servicemen, and now they are walking in groups of two. I think that in three months there will be one at all. It is much more difficult to -catch- the movement of one serviceman than to see a group of four or six, Pavlo tells about the features of modern military operations in Donetsk region. The movement of such doubles of the enemy is very dangerous, because if they are not detected and eliminated in time, they accumulate at the front edge and assemble into assault groups capable of attacking the positions of the Defense Forces. — Let's say two servicemen passed by and we didn't notice them. And they have already settled somewhere, taken some kind of shelter, buried themselves in a hole and are waiting for the next two. This is how accumulation occurs gradually. It's been three days, and they could already have a whole assault group there, the soldier explains. It is for this reason that surveillance of the area and listening to radio broadcasts must be round-the-clock and as thorough as possible, because even one enemy infantryman who has reached the accumulation point without hindrance is already a problem for the Ukrainian defenders on the front line. Soon, the officer speculates, the Russians will be moving near the front lines all alone, because intelligence can see them from drones at a depth of up to 5 kilometers. — Progress along the front is now measured by population centers. But it is very difficult to hold a settlement if there are no high-rise buildings there. The village is one-story houses, there is no shelter. It's fine to have some utility basement, but it usually can't withstand artillery or even mortars, let alone targeted strikes by FPV drones or UAVs. Instead, the forest or plantation can be maintained much more efficiently, the military officer emphasizes. In order to destroy a small village, he notes, it is enough to drop 6-8 KABs on it. After that, it will be almost impossible to hold it, because there will not be any suitable shelter left there. Such fortifications can be built in the forest or on the plantation, which will be very difficult to destroy with artillery fire or even aerial bombardment. — In order to demolish a fortified area in the forest, it needs to be -plowed- with tens of thousands of shells. Destroying a village is much easier. Therefore, hiding from artillery and drones is much better in thick plantations and forests. Therefore, in my subjective opinion, success should be measured and tasks should be set not by population centers, but by dense forests and forest strips. Because it is much easier to keep them, it is much easier to fight in them than in the village. Because in the village there is nothing to hold on to and we lose it very easily. Instead, we can keep the planting for a month or three, and the forest for six months, Pavlo explains his opinion. In view of this, the loss or retention of small villages should not be considered as much as key, defensible locations outside the population centers. It is by them that the successes and failures of the Defense Forces should be measured. — The relief here is very interesting, because there are folds of the terrain, differences in heights. This all defines the radio horizons for UAV flight. Now you need to maintain altitude not so much in order to put a gun there, as in order to put an antenna there and be able to fly 10 kilometers to the rear of the enemy, the officer explains. This is why it is important to maintain control over dominant heights, because their loss takes away important advantages in the use of drones. Instead, their capture by the enemy opens up significant opportunities for him to inflict damage deep into the Defense Forces' positions. — If I am pushed into some hole, then I cannot take off from there, because I do not have a radio horizon. Or I will be forced to fly at a high altitude, then the image quality will be low and, accordingly, the data quality will be low. In the same way, FPVs, if they are launched from a pit, they fly at a certain height, but when they reach the target, it may not be possible to control them, Pavlo notes. Artillery, having high-quality intelligence and targeting, can shoot from anywhere - it is not so much a high position that is important for it, but reliable shelter and high-quality camouflage, so that it is difficult to detect and hit during a counter-battery fight. The International Legion Intelligence Control Post 2 is a communications hub. Information flows here from intelligence, from strike drones, from REP. It is needed in order to collect information about the enemy, analyze it and bring it to the command. The task of the PUR is to provide the most objective and complete information so that the commander can make the right decision. - Intelligence is always the most progressive guys and girls in every unit. It is they who have the most operational information not only about the enemy, but also about their own. And when there is normal communication between the intelligence control points on this lower horizon, then the plus-minus units cooperate normally. Management is then given information on which to make objective decisions. That is, the quality of decision-making by commanders depends on how well the PURs work in the units, the officer is convinced. In order to be able to qualitatively process all the information that flows to the PUR, at least two military personnel who are able to engage, monitor and organize several processes at the same time must be on duty at the point. - The main problem with operators on the PUR is immersion in several processes at the same time. Information is processed in several - more than four - parallel processes. The thing about -standard- military is linearity. In general, our army is mostly straight linear processes, and where there is branching, there is some parallelism, problems immediately arise. Therefore, we first of all need managers - people who managed or were involved in the work of several parallel processes at the same time. The more a person can process parallel processes at the same time, the better he is an operative on duty at the PUR, the military officer notes. You can learn the technical component of work at the intelligence control post in a month. Instead, civilian experience as a project manager will be a significant advantage, because a person with the appropriate skills and abilities will be able to easily join the organization and management of several processes at the same time. It is the operative on duty who brings together a group of several servicemen needed to perform a certain task within the limits of a separate -myth- - an online meeting. This can be, for example, the pilot and drone operator, who adjust the direction of artillery fire, and the battery commander, who conducts fire damage to the enemy. At the same time, several people scattered many kilometers from each other can be within the -myth-. However, during a mission, they work as a single military body, receiving information, making decisions and executing tasks in real time. — Our intelligence control point is needed to keep a balance between desires and capabilities. In order to identify the enemy and choose the best way to defeat him. In order to constantly keep a hand on the pulse of hostilities, Pavlo emphasizes the importance of PUR 2 of the International Legion.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/25/gyustone-u-nas-problema-yak-praczyuye-punkt-upravlinnya-rozvidky-2-internaczionalnogo-legionu/	2025-01-24T20:33:46-08:00
-Digital defender- for France: the American company will build new planes for the Navy of the countr...	As emphasized in the text of the official release published by the company's management on this occasion, aircraft builders from the United States have signed a contract for the production of of the French Armed Forces three E-2D Advanced Hawkeyes, the delivery of the first of which is expected in 2027, according to ArmyInform. Grumman casually announced that the E-2D -Advanced Hawkeye- aircraft will replace the E-2C Hawkeye 2000 aircraft of the French fleet, which served for more than 25 years. -Our partnership with France has been going on for over 25 years. We are proud to have supported the French Navy with the Hawkeye 2000, and we look forward to the leap in aircraft generations with the E-2D Advanced Hawkeye,- said Northrop Grumman Vice President Janice Zilch. Since entering service with the French Navy in 1998, the E-2C Hawkeye 2000 has been a critical component of the French air defense system, supporting the Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier strike group. The new AVACS (Airborne Warning And Control System) aircraft has the ability to refuel in the air, which significantly increases its operational flexibility. Currently, France remains the only country other than the US to operate these aircraft from an aircraft carrier. If we recall the history of the creation of this aircraft, at the beginning of 2007, the Northrop Grumman company demonstrated at its plant in St. Augustine (Florida) the first E-2D -Advanced Hawkeye- radar long-range surveillance (RLDS) board. Its first flight took place on August 3 of the same year. The E-2D is equipped with Lockheed Martin's AN/APY-9 electronic scanning radar, which provides enhanced search capabilities and combat applications as an airborne combat control system. The APY-9 radar has an electronically scanned active phased array. The new radar will be able to detect aircraft equipped with stealth technologies, such as the Russian Su-57 and the Chinese Chengdu J-20. According to the concept of the Navy NIFC-CA, the E-2D aircraft can direct the missile weapons of the fleet (such as missiles AIM-120 AMRAAM and missiles SM-6, which our editors talked about in their materials) on a target beyond the detection range or capabilities of the launch platform. Demonstrated in 2007, the experimental aircraft was the first of two to be built during the $2 billion System Development and Demonstration (SDD) phase of the E-2D aircraft program (a contract with the US Navy for work on the SDD phase was awarded in 2001). The US Navy has said it plans to build 75 of these aircraft over two decades. Unlike previous options, the new Advanced Hawkeye aircraft can coordinate air strikes against air, ground and sea surface targets. According to Northrop Grumman, -the E-2D aircraft will allow the armed forces to take a large amount of information from various sources and synthesize this data for active intelligence.- Along with the fact that the appearance of the new aircraft is similar to the E-2C aerial reconnaissance aircraft, the systems and capabilities presented on the E-2D aircraft have been completely improved. The aircraft's mushroom-shaped rotating radar antenna fairing, designed by L-3 Communications, features continuous scanning with a 360° field of view, along with an electronically scanning grating antenna. The system allows operators to focus radar on selected areas of interest. Operators of the E-2D also have new radar workstations, satellite communications capabilities and other tools to provide their units with enhanced situational awareness, according to Northrop Grumman. Another new feature is a modern crew cabin with increased glazing and computerized graphic displays that have replaced the previous generation's indicators and on-board radio electronics. One of the advantages is that pilots can also act as weapons system operators. In November 2007, the flight tests of the E-2D aircraft were completed in the USA. The machine spent about 600 hours in the air. Half of them were dedicated to testing the functionality of radar systems. And during the tests, no significant deficiencies were found in the aircraft's systems. The E-2D Advanced Hawkeye DRLO aircraft is equipped with Allison T56 turboprop engines (more than 4,000 hp) and a rotating radar dome with a diameter of 7.3 meters, which is mounted above its fuselage and wings. Spanning more than sixty years of history, the E-2 family has performed early warning and airborne surveillance functions in several countries around the world. Equipped with advanced radar and advanced combat control systems, the E-2D Advanced Hawkeye is considered the global benchmark for carrier-based early warning aircraft. With an active production line and a track record of just-in-time delivery, E-2D ensures operators stay ahead of rapidly evolving threats. By adopting the E-2D Advanced Hawkeye, the French Navy reaffirms its commitment to remain at the forefront of maritime operations, using state-of-the-art technology and long-standing partnerships to protect its national interests and effectively contribute to international security.

- Sensation of the year-: Russian fake about a Ukrainian military man who became a maniac	Let's dive into this -sensation- and analyze why it causes more laughter than fear. First, it is worth noting that the sources of this information remain very mysterious. The primary sources of such -news- often come from fringe news sites or anonymous Telegram channels known for their wild accusations and horrific -scenarios-. We are reminded of the seriousness of the situation, but mostly forget to point out that there are no verified facts and, on top of that, these stories are fantasy. Could it be such an interesting fiction, as in the old youth novels? Apparently, this is definitely not for a documentary film. The appearance of such fakes is part of a wider propaganda campaign designed to discredit the Armed Forces of Ukraine. According to the scenario, Russian propagandists are trying to present the Ukrainian military as unpredictable, who instead of protecting the country are trying to organize -cleanses- in their homes. Here is the perfect picture of a Russian propagandist: a soldier who has learned the horrors of war, is unable to control himself and turns to crime. But let's look at the reality. Most of the Ukrainian military on the front lines are distinguished by a high level of discipline and professionalism, defending the country from the aggressor every day. And think about it, do the Russians really believe that one made-up story can destroy this reputation? Disinformation of this kind is not just a fake, but a psychological game aimed at creating hatred and fear. By releasing such -news-, the Russian mass media hope not only for emotional resonance, but also for destabilization of society. In real life, of course, no one has recorded such a case, but in a moment of impasse, readers think it is better to believe spectacular headlines than to analyze reality. Returning to our -sensation-, the real question is not whether to believe this story, but how many more fakes will be invented to create the necessary image. Each new fake only confirms the statement about the unsubstantiated nature of Russian propaganda. The real challenge is to get information that seeks factual confirmation of what is happening on the front, and not to succumb to provocation. So, the next time you come across a news story about a mysterious military maniac, remember that it's most likely just another piece of the disinformation game.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/25/sensacziya-roku-rosfejk-pro-ukrayinskogo-vijskovogo-yakyj-stav-maniyakom/	2025-01-24T20:10:49-08:00
Europe for $10,000 — two salesmen -tours- for evasion were exposed in Prykarpattia	This was reported on January 24 by the special prosecutor's office of the Western region.

Every -shakhed-, like every Russian missile, is made on the basis of foreign components — President	Volodymyr Zelenskiy said this in his evening address on January 24. -At first, Iran transferred ready-made Shaheds to Russia, then their own production was mastered in Tatarstan, one of the national territories that Moscow still controls. And although these -shaheds- are actually Russian, they still could not have been made there without foreign supplies. Each such -shahed-, like each Russian missile, is made on the basis of foreign components - critical components, without which Russian terror would be impossible in general. -Thirty-one Shaheds last night are approximately 2,635 components from other countries: microcircuits, switches, transceivers,- the President said. In his opinion, all supply of any components for terror to Russia should be blocked in order to stop this terror. -And this applies not only to the protection of life in Ukraine. Now the Russian -shaheds- are hitting the houses of our people, our infrastructure, but at any moment the Russians can transfer terror to any other country - wherever they are ordered,- Volodymyr Zelenskyi said. As reported by ArmyInform, the President of Ukraine presented the intelligence officers with state awards.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/24/kozhen-shahed-yak-i-kozhna-rosijska-raketa-robytsya-na-osnovi-inozemnyh-komponentiv-prezydent/	2025-01-24T11:46:11-08:00
They accumulated -armor- and waited for the fogs - the enemy tried to attack Chasiv Yar	Andrii Polukhin, a representative of the press service of the 24th mechanized brigade named after King Danylo, told about this on the ArmyTV stream on January 24. -The 98th airborne division of the Russian army has been fighting against us since November. They also tried to carry out mechanized assaults before, but failed. We destroyed a similar group of armored vehicles at the beginning of November. There was also a case in mid-December when they were destroyed thanks to our remote mining. Now they were able to land a landing party, this is their goal. But technology does not go back. The staff, too,- said Andriy Polukhin. According to him, the landing party was shot down by drones of the 18th brigade of the National Guard. Andriy Polukhin linked the intensification of the assaults to the foggy weather, which impairs the operation of our drones. This is what the Russians decided to take advantage of. The brigade collects for drones and invites them to contribute financially to the destruction of the enemy. As reported by ArmyInform, Ukrainian defenders broke the mechanized assault of the Russian landing force, destroying four BMDs.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/24/nakopychyly-bronyu-i-dochekalysya-tumaniv-vorog-sprobuvav-atakuvaty-chasiv-yar/	2025-01-24T11:24:10-08:00

12 years for treason: the court sentenced a collaborator from Kupyansk who served the occupiers	informs Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office. The court found a 31-year-old man guilty of collaborative activity (Part 7, Article 111-1 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine) for maintaining a public accusation by the prosecutors of the Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office. He was sentenced to 12 years of imprisonment with deprivation of the right to hold positions in law enforcement agencies for a period of 12 years and confiscation of all property that is his personal property. Prosecutors proved that during the occupation of A local resident of Kupyansk voluntarily assumed the position of -y. at. senior district police inspector of the department of district police inspectors of the Department of Internal Affairs of the Temporary Civil Administration of the Kharkiv Region-. It is known that before the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation into the territory of Ukraine, the man worked as a law enforcement officer in the National Security Service in the Kharkiv region, but he was fired and remained officially unemployed until the occupation. The collaborator carried out the transit regime at Russian checkpoints located on the territory of the city of Kup'yansk and Kupyansky district, carried out checks based on the statements of local residents regarding the commission of criminal offenses.

From the seller of equipment to the chief sergeant of the platoon: the story of a fighter with the c...	The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. At the age of 28, Igor decided to join a newly created brigade equipped with modern weapons. His military journey began with a two-month basic training - the first steps to understanding army life. After training, he got into the mortar unit, where the work was difficult but interesting. Later, Igor took the opportunity to learn how to fly drones. He quickly mastered the Mavic, and later, albeit with more effort, the Vector UAV. So he became part of a new battalion of unmanned systems. -Plut- now spends most of its time in the war zone, performing reconnaissance and adjusting artillery fire. He recalls two episodes that are particularly memorable to him. Once near Chasovoy Yar, Igor's crew discovered an enemy armored car hiding in the landing. The artillery strike was accurate, but the explosion revealed another piece of enemy equipment that had not been seen before. Another case happened in Ocheretino. On a relatively calm day, when the enemy almost did not move, -Plut- and his brothers noticed a moving object 5 km from the observation zone. Additional intelligence established that it was the Russian Solntsepok. Igor promptly transmitted the information to the dispatcher, other units joined the broadcast, and with joint efforts the enemy equipment was destroyed. For Igor, as well as for many other defenders, such moments are not just the performance of official duties, but also a real opportunity to contribute to victory. His story is an example of how war can dramatically change lives, opening up new talents and opportunities to serve one's country. As reported by ArmyInform, Cheka's life until February 24, 2022 was calm and measured. He worked as a programmer in an international company, often visited abroad. However, the first Russian missile strikes changed everything. -Cheka- without hesitation decided to become for the protection of the Motherland.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/24/vid-prodavczya-tehniky-do-golovnogo-serzhanta-vzvodu-istoriya-bijczya-z-pozyvnym-plut/	2025-01-24T09:51:57-08:00

-Sniping is a science and an art-: a special officer of the GUR of the Ministry of Defense spoke abo...	This is discussed in publication on the page of the Artan special unit. -Any military specialty is difficult, but sniper is like the pinnacle,- says the -Korean-. He talked about some elements of sniper training, in particular, photographic memory training. -How we train photographic memory: in the morning, 10 objects are laid out in front of us, and after some time and after physical exertion, you have to describe and draw them with accuracy to the smallest detail,- says the fighter. - We work in the same way in the area - we need to identify and accurately describe objects hidden and disguised in the forest. Or note the smallest changes that have occurred around the position during the absence.- The Korean described the process of memory and observation training in more detail: Separately, the Korean talked about the training for detecting camouflaged positions: -One of the tasks is to detect camouflaged positions or something unusual or non-standard for a certain area. We lay out various objects in the area, for example, canisters or something else, and from a certain distance we are told: -Here we disguised or hid 10 keys.- Our task is to find all the objects and describe them within a certain time, depending on the difficulty of the task. We can use optical instruments of low power to search. It's a difficult task, but we have to do it.- He also talked about terrain change detection training: -During another training session, we look at a certain area of ​​the area, memorize it, then turn away or walk away for a while, during which certain changes occur in the area. After that, we go back and have to determine what exactly has changed. This is necessary because a sniper is, first of all, an observer. He must clearly understand what is standard for the area and what is non-standard, which may have appeared during his absence from the position. In this way, we practice the necessary skills.- According to the Korean, a sniper should be as attentive to details as possible, be able to quickly analyze the situation and notice even minor changes in the area. It is these skills, along with accurate shooting, that make a sniper an effective fighter. In the -Artan- special unit, they emphasize that sniping is a real combination of science and art.

-Hobby — shooting down drones-: the Patron machine gun has already destroyed 70 enemy UAVs	The story of the soldier was made public on the page of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. -Patron- comes from Transcarpathia, Tyachiv district. His decision to join the army was inspired by the tragic events he saw on TV: -I watched TV, saw that peaceful victims, small children, were being killed there. I decided to go to protect them, so I joined the ranks of the Armed Forces,- the soldier says. He became defensive and participated in front-line battles, where he showed remarkable accuracy and endurance even in the hottest spots. During his service, Patron has repeatedly proven that MAVIC or FPV drones have little chance against his watchful eye and steady hand. He even developed his own method of -hunting- for UAVs. -They call me a sniper because I shoot down drones. About 70 drones, definitely shot down. When Mavik works for us, I already know the principle of how it works. He flies and drops two VOGs, we are already sitting, hidden. I run out when I dropped two VOGs, and I'm working on it. He still hangs a little, looks where he got and if he got there at all. And it is so easy to knock it down, it hangs very low,- Patron shares his experience. Patron considers the greatest value in his work to be the gratitude of his brothers whose lives he saved from enemy drones. The story of -Patron- is an example of courage and dedication to one's work. He not only carries out combat missions, but also saves the lives of his comrades by effectively countering enemy drones.

Rustem Umyerov announced the appointment of a new head of the Defense Procurement Agency and the dis...	Rustem Umyerov wrote about this on Facebook on the evening of January 24. -This is the first and last post on the topic of arms procurement. The only criterion that the Ministry of Defense sets before the Defense Procurement Agency is to provide the front with all the necessary weapons on time and in full. Unfortunately, over the past six months, instead of providing the army with ammunition in a timely manner, we have received political games, -drains- of contracts, -drains- of information (law enforcement officers will definitely check these facts), PR inaction and non-fulfillment of the CRI by the subordinate enterprise of the MoU. Arms purchases, which should be closed during martial law and a full-scale war with Russia, somehow turned into an -Amazon-, where every Internet user can see in real time who is buying what and in what quantities and from which manufacturers. And the scale of these purchases, which would have been at least commensurate with PR in the mass media, were never felt by our defenders at the front. Therefore, I made a decision to suspend all those who failed this work: The Ministry of Defense also recalls two representatives of the state from the Supervisory Board. This will become a precedent in the history of state corporate governance, when two independent representatives of the Supervisory Board supported the state's position, and the state-authorized representative of state interests ignored the recommendations of the governing body. The restart of the Supervisory Board will take place in the near future. Arsena Zhumadilov will be appointed as the director of AOZ. This year, AOZ and DOT had the same conditions. One agency got the job done, the other just created media hype. There is a lot of talk about the purchase of weapons for the army, but the result is unsatisfactory. We are changing the system so that the result is at the front, not in the news,- wrote Rustem Umyerov. As reported by ArmyInform, the Minister of Defense congratulated of the military, who ensure the security of Ukraine from the shadows.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/24/rustem-umyerov-povidomyv-pro-pryznachennya-novogo-kerivnyka-agencziyi-oboronnyh-zakupivel-i-zvilnennya-odnogo-iz-zastupnykiv/	2025-01-24T08:31:46-08:00

Luhansk is drowning in garbage and filth: the occupation authorities ignore communal problems	The head of the Luhansk Regional Military Administration, Artem Lysogor, reported this on his page. According to him, at the local waste disposal center, about 40% of the positions of garbage truck drivers remain vacant. There is also a shortage of garbage collectors — 30% of staff units are vacant. In addition, there is a shortage of garbage trucks themselves. Due to a lack of personnel and equipment, utility workers are forced to work overtime, even on weekends. The situation is worsened by the fact that the occupation authorities have been promising to build six new landfills for garbage on the territory of the LPR for the third year, but the promises remain only in words. Instead, waste continues to be transported from neighboring regions of Russia to already existing, long-overflowing and emergency landfills, which creates an additional burden on the ecological situation in the region. Also, according to the report of the head of the Luhansk OVA, problems with water drainage, about which -pytnoyi-vody-okupaczijna-vlada-zatyaguye-remont/->reported earlier, covered not only the eastern quarters Luhansk, where residents of 90% of high-rise buildings complain about sewage problems. A similar situation is observed in the city center. Local utilities, under the control of the occupation authorities, practically do not service the sewage wells, which are now overflowing. As a result, basements of residential buildings have already been flooded in some areas of the city. Artem Lysohor emphasized that the occupying authorities completely ignore the numerous appeals of residents regarding these communal problems, without taking any effective measures to solve them. As reported by ArmyInform, in Toshkivka, which was captured by the Russian invaders in the spring of 2022, in the Mountain community, out of four thousand people remained close 100, a tenth of them are children.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/24/lugansk-potopaye-u-smitti-ta-nechystotah-okupaczijna-vlada-ignoruye-komunalni-problemy/	2025-01-24T06:26:35-08:00

Earlier, the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation Oleksandr Hrushko stated that the rejection of Ukraine's accession to NATO, which was promised to Kyiv in the declaration of the Bucharest Summit in 2008, is one of the key elements for Russia to settle the Russian-Ukrainian war.

Ukrainian fighters hone their weapon skills: from the Belgian FN Minimi to -Pokémon-	A selection of photos from combat exercises was made public on the page of the Land Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. A tense atmosphere prevails at the training ground, which is broken by the loud sounds of gunshots. Special attention is drawn to the Belgian FN Minimi machine gun of 7.62 mm caliber. This weapon is known for its feature — an almost imperceptible flame when firing. As noted in the message, a bright flash in one of the pictures is more the exception than the rule for this machine gun. Along with the modern FN Minimi, fighters practice with weapons that have a much longer history. A machine gun, which the military jokingly calls -Pokémon-, got into the frame. This name arose from the combination of the Soviet abbreviation -PKM- (Kalashnikov machine gun modernized) and the name of a popular children's character. Such a combination is a cruel irony that combined a weapon designed to destroy the enemy with a favorite children's toy. The photos show how a machine gun belt confidently slides through the fingers of a soldier preparing his weapon for battle. Nearby, another fighter stands and fires a Pokémon, demonstrating mastery of a weapon that is over 40 years old. Another duo of machine gunners practice together, directing fire deep into the range. They get used to the loud sound of gunshots and practice marksmanship for educational purposes. The message emphasizes that fire training is not just practicing shooting techniques. It is also work on psychological stability, stamina and confidence in yourself and your weapon. This is the ability to act effectively even in the most difficult conditions, when life is at stake. And this preparation is an important step on the way to the main goal of Ukraine's victory. As reported by ArmyInform, the range of Ukrainian combat drones continues to expand. being replenished with new UAVs.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/24/ukrayinski-bijczi-vidtochuyut-majsternist-volodinnya-zbroyeyu-vid-belgijskogo-fn-minimi-do-pokemona/	2025-01-24T03:36:47-08:00

Stream and waterfall tactics: how different are the actions of the enemy in the Limansky direction	Maksym Bilousov, head of the communications branch of the 60th Separate Mechanized Brigade. According to Bilousov, the enemy has now found a tactic that is more or less successful for him. However, it is accompanied by crazy losses. We are talking about infantry assaults in small groups - a maximum of four people. Such attack aircraft are constantly destroyed, but the attacks do not stop. -You have to understand that they go around the clock, and we work around the clock. However, one way or another, someone manages to slip through. They have absolutely no instinct for self-preservation. They know - the group went ahead, they have not returned and there is no radio signal from them. But the next group comes out after that and moves forward in the same way,- said the head of the communications department of the 60th separate mechanized brigade. According to Bilousov, the difficulty of such assaults lies precisely in the fact that they are permanent. The enemy attacks practically non-stop. -If a mechanized assault is like a waterfall, then the mechanics of such infantry assaults is more like a small stream, but which flows and flows. And that's why it's more difficult than a waterfall. Because you can withstand the impact of the waterfall, fight it off and then rest a little. And here we don't even have time to relax,- Maksym Bilousov said. As reported by ArmyInform , the occupiers continue active offensive actions in the Lyman direction, however, the Defense Forces of Ukraine restrain enemy assaults and regain positions.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/24/taktyka-strumka-ta-vodospadu-yak-vidriznyayutsya-diyi-voroga-na-lymanskomu-napryamku/	2025-01-24T02:32:45-08:00

So the family accepted my choice with understanding. Of course, as a mother, I can't help but worry, but I know they are in their place. For me, my children are real heroes,- says the fighter proudly. After completing a course of basic military training, -Murzik- became a gunner.

Reform of physical support of the Armed Forces: from formal inspections to a culture of quality	About this in the ArmyInform interview told the head of the Central Department of Material Quality Control support of the Armed Forces Colonel Ihor Leshchenko. Moving away from formal inspections to a comprehensive approach that includes laboratory testing, field control and video recording encourages manufacturers to continuously improve and increase responsibility. Before the reform, as Colonel Ihor Leshchenko notes, the acceptance system was often reduced to a formal inspection of the quality of things. This created conditions for the supply of products that outwardly met the standards, but were made of low-quality materials. In fact, quality control was focused on the appearance rather than the actual characteristics and properties of the materials. The reform changed this approach radically. The introduction of mandatory laboratory tests, the transfer of the acceptance process to the supply bases and the video recording system became elements of a comprehensive system aimed at ensuring real, not formal, quality. An important aspect of the reform is its impact on manufacturers. Initially, as mentioned earlier, some companies resisted the new requirements. However, over time it became clear that strict control is not an obstacle, but an incentive for development. Manufacturers began to invest in new technologies, improve production processes and improve the skills of personnel. In fact, the reform catalyzed the transition to a new culture of quality, where quality is not a formal indicator but a key priority. Colonel Leshchenko emphasizes that the goal of the reform was not only to identify and reject low-quality products, but also to create conditions for continuous improvement. The feedback system, when manufacturers receive information about detected defects and have the opportunity to correct them, contributes to the formation of a responsible attitude to quality. As reported by ArmyInform, material support quality of the Armed Forces of Ukraine is critical important for the effectiveness and safety of our military in active combat conditions.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/24/reforma-rechovogo-zabezpechennya-zsu-vid-formalnyh-perevirok-do-kultury-yakosti/	2025-01-24T01:26:37-08:00

About the superiority of Stugna over Kornet and the dream of punching Putin: the junior sergeant tol...	Why did he learn to work with anti-tank missiles while working as a driver? But what does Valery dream of hitting, apart from enemy armored vehicles? He told the correspondent of ArmiyaInform about this. -Before the large-scale invasion, I already served in the army, retired in 2019. Since April 2022, he has returned to the army. At first, my wife was in shock, she was afraid for me. But then she pulled herself together and supported me. Of course, it was difficult to leave my family, but I knew that I had a reliable back at home. &#8230;It is so established in our mouth that each person must know everything so that we can replace each other. Therefore, in the position of a driver, I mastered the work of ATGM. Of all ATGMs, my favorites are -Stugna- and -Cornet-. -Stugna- is better because you shoot from the dugout, you are in cover, in safety. Even when fire is being fired at you in response, you are calmer, you can concentrate. I can remember one day when we destroyed the enemy with a lot of equipment. It was in the Lyman direction. It was the second day of the enemy assault. On the first day, another shift worked, and we changed them for the next two days. When we arrived at the position with the boys, we saw that our comrades had done a good job: there were no rockets left, the boys had used them all. Therefore, there was an urgent delivery of ammunition for us. After the first defeat of enemy equipment, then, of course, there was great euphoria, joy! I dreamed about this for a long time, I was very pleased. Well, then everything went smoothly. You just have to keep a cool head: we just left and worked out. I shot both from Stugna and Kornet that day. &#8230;So, that day, I remember, the first group of the enemy left. We wanted to hit him immediately so that he would shoot less at the infantry positions, because the infantry is covering us, standing in front of us, and we want to secure it. This tank gave off smoke, it was difficult to see. The boys and I spent about a minute, or even one and a half, healing him for a long time, but then we saw flashes in the smoke when he was shooting, fired at the flash and hit. We worked it out with -Stugna-. When I worked with -Cornet-, then the enemy Tanchik and -Bekha- left. I shot at the tank, because it is a priority, it is a -fatter- target. And Vitaly worked on the -devil- with the call sign -Elephant-. An assistant with the call sign -Acapulco- was with me. This is his first combat outing, and he was pleasantly surprised when he heard how it was firing, how everything was happening, he was pleased as well as I was. &#8230;What target do I still dream of hitting? Of course, you want to punch Putin. Well, at least hit the helicopter. In general, in order to effectively destroy enemy equipment with the help of ATGMs, you need to be patient, attentive, and cool-headed. So that your calculation works as one whole, as one team. When the calculation works well, then everything will be fine. In terms of knowledge and skills, of course local knowledge is required. You need to be able to use -nettle- and maps so that you can orient yourself to the locality: what is the distance to the landing or the road so that you can calculate correctly. Because when you make a launch, so that you can count in your head how far to the target, so that when you -lead-, you better understand where you will hit.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/24/pro-perevagu-stugny-pered-kornetom-ta-mriyu-vlupyty-v-putina-molodshyj-serzhant-rozpoviv-yak-nyshhyt-vorozhi-tanky-z-ptrk/	2025-01-23T21:05:07-08:00
Reach sky-high speed: The Pentagon conducted a key test of a hypersonic missile demonstrator	As DF-17, which are capable of carrying both nuclear and conventional payloads. The Chinese military is also investing in advanced launch platforms and testing mechanisms, focusing on increasing the speed and range of its hypersonic systems. Russia under Putin has been aggressively developing hypersonic weapons as part of its military modernization program. The country has already deployed hypersonic missiles such as the Avangard, which, as reported Reuters, apparently capable of speeds up to Mach 27. In addition, Russia has developed the Zircon missile, a sea-based hypersonic weapon designed to target both sea and land targets. Both China and the Russian Federation have demonstrated their capabilities through successful test flights, causing, according to Dutch experts, a sense of urgency in the US military to advance its own hypersonic development programs. In addition to China and Russia, countries such as India, France and Australia are also developing hypersonic technologies, each working to integrate these systems into their defense strategies. For the US military and its allies, hypersonic weapons represent a paradigm shift in the way war is waged. The strategic advantages they offer are obvious. Hypersonic weapons allow for near-instantaneous strikes, significantly reducing response times to new threats and providing a new tool for rapid deployment of military power. It can also penetrate traditional anti-missile defense systems. Systems such as those developed by the US Aegis or Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), about which our editors previously told, optimized to intercept slower ballistic missiles. But hypersonic weapons, because of their high speed and unpredictable flight paths, present a much more difficult challenge for these systems to defend against. In addition, hypersonic systems can be adapted to various platforms, from land-based launchers to submarines and aircraft, allowing military forces to deploy these weapons in various operational scenarios. Given their speed and range, hypersonic weapons can be used in a variety of theaters of operations, from deterring regional conflicts to countering more complex threats from adversaries with advanced air defense systems. Thus, the US military is focused on hypersonics not only to keep up with China and Russia, but also to maintain a technological edge that will be crucial in future conflicts. The MACH-TB test is one of the most important steps in this ongoing race to develop and deploy hypersonic weapons, which will become a staple of the US military arsenal in the coming years. The success of the MACH-TB flight test is a major achievement in the Pentagon's efforts to accelerate the development of hypersonic technologies. By using commercial launch services, the US Department of Defense is laying the groundwork for more frequent and cost-effective testing, which will ultimately lead to faster deployment of these advanced weapons. With global competitors such as China and the Russian Federation ramping up their own hypersonic development programs, the need for US leadership in this field has never been greater. Hypersonic weapons are poised to revolutionize military strategies around the world, and initiatives like MACH-TB are critical to ensuring that the United States remains at the forefront of this technological revolution.

Without - schematics - and with equal conditions for manufacturers: how the new material quality con...	How was it possible to restore laboratory control during the acceptance of tangible property and eliminate corruption risks in the supply system? What results did the reform of the property acceptance algorithm bring, and how did it affect Ukrainian manufacturers? Colonel Ihor Leshchenko, head of the Central Department of Quality Control of Material Support of the Armed Forces, told about this in an interview with an ArmyInform correspondent. —What key changes took place in the system of receiving tangible property, and what did this process look like before the reforms? — As a result of a detailed analysis, it became clear that the old system did not meet modern requirements, especially in wartime conditions. Previously, the processes were mostly formal: manufacturers brought samples of goods from large batches, and only they were inspected. However, the real assessment of the quality of materials and raw materials was often ignored because the necessary laboratory examination was not carried out. This made it possible to supply products that outwardly met the standards, but were made of low-quality materials. Such an approach was unacceptable, because we are talking about the provision of our military. Thanks to the comprehensive approach of the team under the leadership of Deputy Minister of Defense Dmytro Klimenkov, it was possible to reform this process. — One of the first changes was the introduction of mandatory laboratory tests, which allow checking not only the appearance of the product, but also the quality of the materials, their resistance to wear, water resistance and other important parameters. However, after that, we encountered a new problem: some manufacturers, having received a contract for large batches of goods, divided them into several smaller ones, successfully passed laboratory tests on the first samples, and the rest of the products were made from inferior materials. This became possible due to the existence of a procedure, according to which, after signing the act of acceptance of the goods, the suppliers independently delivered the goods to the warehouses of the Armed Forces. — To remedy the situation, we decided to transfer the process of accepting tangible property directly to the Armed Forces supply bases. Now all batches of goods are checked immediately on the spot, and those that do not meet the standards are returned to the manufacturer for revision. This approach allows you to reduce the risks of product substitution and to ensure the high quality of materials supplied to the military. —What results have been achieved thanks to the recent changes in the system of acceptance of tangible property, and have these changes affected the work of Ukrainian manufacturing enterprises? — To evaluate the results, it is worth referring to specific figures. Initially, in 2023, the share of property returned due to non-compliance with standards was only 6%, which was due to the low quality of the inspection. However, after we improved the reception system and strengthened control, this share increased significantly to 30-35%. This was because we were able to identify a number of manufacturers whose products did not meet the requirements. — However, over time, it was possible to significantly reduce this indicator to 10%, which is a good trend and indicates positive changes. Such a result proves that the market has adapted to the new standards, and the quality of supply has improved significantly. In addition, an important achievement is the absence of media information incidents or complaints about the poor quality of goods that we received during 2024. This indicates that the control system works effectively and ensures a high level of product compliance with all requirements, which is a key factor for the safety of our military. — As for the impact on the work of Ukrainian manufacturing enterprises, a high level of control stimulates them to improve. Manufacturers who discover defects in their products have the opportunity to correct them and resubmit the product for inspection. This contributes to the improvement of quality and the improvement of production technologies. National companies that are able to quickly respond to such requirements have a competitive advantage over foreign suppliers who, due to logistical constraints, cannot resolve problems as quickly. This makes Ukrainian manufacturers more competitive. —How do you react to attempts at pressure or manipulation by unscrupulous manufacturers? Have you faced biased accusations from companies whose products did not meet the standards in the largest volumes? - Unfortunately, yes. Unprecedented pressure began as soon as we implemented changes to the system of receiving tangible property. Some manufacturers immediately began to accuse us of biased assessment of the quality of their products. There were even funny cases when, during briefings where we discussed problematic issues, company representatives brought samples of their products, trying to visually demonstrate their -compliance- with the standards, in order to cast doubt on the results of our inspections. — In response to such attempts, we implemented a video recording system of quality violations during property reception. Now, when we find products that do not meet the requirements, all defects are recorded and the information is immediately sent to the company management. During the first months of operation of this system, we have collected a large amount of video material, and we plan to make it available to the public after the end of martial law. This is currently not possible for security reasons. — At the beginning, many perceived increased control as an attempt to discredit certain companies or to establish a monopoly on the market. However, over time, even the fiercest critics began to support our initiative. The new system not only made it possible to exclude -schematists-, but also created a level playing field for honest manufacturers, giving them a competitive advantage. As a result, we have achieved significant improvements in product quality and support for our military. - What steps do you plan to further improve the supply system, and are there any plans to extend new approaches to other types of logistics? - Our main task is to maintain high quality standards and constantly improve the supply system. We have already started work on improving the verification procedures not only for tangible property, but also for other categories such as food, fuel and other logistics. Our efforts are aimed at providing the Ukrainian military with high-quality and reliable equipment, as well as food that meets the most modern standards. — Now we are actively studying existing problems in these systems and are starting to create effective algorithms to improve quality in these areas. Our main priority is to adapt new approaches to all categories of provision, so that not only tangible property, but also other resources critical to our army meet the highest quality and safety requirements.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/24/bez-shematoznykiv-ta-z-rivnymy-umovamy-dlya-vyrobnykiv-yak-praczyuye-nova-systema-kontrolyu-yakosti-rechovogo-majna-u-zsu/	2025-01-23T20:28:35-08:00
US sanctions against the Zaporizhzhia NPP: Kremlin-style absurdity	According to the information disseminated by the Russian media (and it is more like an old anecdote than news), the United States of America for some reason decided to impose sanctions on the Ukrainian nuclear plant, which, moreover, is under Russian occupation. It seems that inventing such stories has already become a hobby in the Kremlin. If earlier they stated that Ukraine, apparently, has no right to its independence, now they invented another incredible theory: the USA, they say, imposed sanctions on the Zaporizhia NPP, which&#8230; suppose, for some reason, it became a target for America, not even taking into account the fact that Russian troops are now stationed on the territory where it is located. Of course, the Kremlin cannot forget its mission in the world of disinformation, and this is its favorite tactic: the more fiction, the harder it is to find out where the truth lies. But let's not forget a few obvious facts. First, the USA has long publicly declared its support for Ukraine, in particular, in the matter of energy security. The Zaporizhia NPP is an important facility for the entire energy infrastructure of Ukraine, and imposing sanctions on such an institution, which is an important part of the infrastructure of another country, looks not only illogical, but also frankly absurd. Secondly, if we have already talked about sanctions, we cannot fail to mention who exactly is under sanctions: not Ukraine, not Zaporizhia NPP, but Russia itself. And it is she who is to blame for the fact that the Zaporizhia NPP is under occupation. It is Russia that seized the station and its troops that forced local workers to act on the instructions of others. But the Kremlin does not seem to understand this absurdity and continues to invent new fairy tales. Perhaps the next fake will be the claim that the USA has imposed sanctions against Crimean donuts, but in fact it is just part of the American plan to support the Ukrainian pie. This fake news about sanctions is not only another confirmation that Russian propaganda knows no bounds, but also a reminder of how easily facts can be manipulated when reality becomes too difficult to grasp. But the truth will still win, and even the Kremlin understands this. Isn't that right?	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/24/sankcziyi-ssha-proty-zaporizkoyi-aes-absurd-u-styli-kremlya/	2025-01-23T20:13:05-08:00
The deputy from Transcarpathia, who led the evaders across the border, went to trial	reported this on January 23 by the special prosecutor's office of the Western region. The investigation established that four residents of Transcarpathia, including a deputy of the district council, provided conscripts who wanted to avoid mobilization to cross the border through the so-called -green corridor-. They were gathered in a designated place and settled near the border. Then people who were oriented on the terrain led them through the forest past checkpoints. From there, the men walked to Romania. The cost of such a service was $8,000 from one -client-. During the searches, over $16,000 dollars, 500 euros and 30,000 hryvnias in cash, GPS devices and other physical evidence were seized from the accused. The men were detained and preventive measures were taken. The smugglers face up to 9 years in prison.

The footage shows the complicated process of evacuating a wounded soldier. Doctors act quickly, coherently and professionally, demonstrating a high level of training and dedication to their work. The evacuation process consists of two main stages: casevac - urgent evacuation from the line of fire, and medevac - transportation of the wounded in a medical vehicle to a stabilization point. From the conversations of medics on the video of the evacuation process, it becomes clear that they are primarily concerned with the safety and comfort of the wounded. While moving the fighter, medics give clear commands: -Brother, take me by the neck. Nephew, now move a little. Come on, yourself,- while cheering him on, -That’s it, well done.- Doctors constantly monitor the condition of the injured, discussing the nature of injuries and vital signs, as well as discussing the localization of injuries. Their actions are clear and coordinated, everyone knows their role and performs it flawlessly. Psychological support of the wounded is also an important component of the work of military medics. They encourage the fighters, find time for jokes and kind words, which helps relieve tension and maintain morale. The work of the Algiz evacuation team is a daily act of heroism that deserves the highest respect. These people, risking themselves, save the lives of Ukrainian defenders, demonstrating professionalism, endurance and humanity. As ArmyInform reported, during the week of fighting in Kharkiv Oblast, enemy losses amounted to 557 soldiers only in the area of ​​activity of one brigade. Killed 246 occupants, another 311 injured.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/23/algiz-na-peredovij-yak-medyky-tretoyi-shturmovoyi-ryatuyut-zhyttya-pobratymiv-pid-obstrilamy/	2025-01-23T11:34:49-08:00
Near Velika Novosilka, our gunners are forced to switch to round-the-clock work	About this January 23 on the head of the communications department of the 110th mechanized brigade named after Colonel-General Mark Bezruchka, Major Ivan Sekach, told ArmiyaTV's stream. -There is almost no equipment, but the enemy's infantry is constantly advancing. Our machines work almost 24 hours a day, you can make a sign -We work without days off- and 24 hours a day. Recently, the first serious NATO equipment appeared, this is the M109, the American self-propelled guns. They have the entire nomenclature of projectiles, from those intended for mining to cluster ones. Therefore, our gunners are working, covering the infantry, trying to prevent the enemy from getting closer. But the situation is getting worse every day,- said Ivan Sekach. When asked about the situation in Velika Novosilka, he answered: -The fighting continues in the city, our guys are holding their positions, fighting like lions.- The brigade is collecting for an excavator, which will help make hiding places for American self-propelled guns.

The first graduates of the anti-drone course are already working with shotguns at the front	On January 23 ArmiyaTV, the head of the media group of the 413th battalion, Sergeant Oleksiy Godzenko, told about this. -We launched a course against FPV drones (both radio-controlled and fiber-optic) with the use of a shotgun. Because in many videos you can see how in the last seconds of their lives, katsaps try to shoot down our drones with a machine gun. However, it is very difficult to hit a small and very fast target even with a fast rate of fire. But a shotgun that shoots across the square is now almost the only way to fight fiber-optic drones and ordinary ones,- Oleksiy Godzenko said. In the video, which was provided by the battalion, it can be seen that the courses teach how to hit drones, both on the ground and from the body of a pickup truck while driving at speed. According to Oleksiy Godzenko, the first graduates of the course are already working at the front and have good results. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the 413th battalion of unmanned systems -Raid- of the SBS of the Armed Forces of Ukraine showed frames of damage by missiles of the command post of the Russians in the eastern in the vicinity of the village of Maryine in the Kursk region of the Russian Federation.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/23/pershi-vypusknyky-antydronovogo-kursu-vzhe-praczyuyut-z-drobovykamy-na-fronti/	2025-01-23T11:18:51-08:00

The enemy armored personnel carrier with the landing party inside and on the armor moved at high speed towards our positions. Artillery and drones began to work on it, which little by little removed the armor of the enemy landing party. But only our mine could stop the Russian armored car. When the armored personnel carrier caught fire, Russian attack aircraft began to climb out of it, but our FPV drones were already waiting for them. As reported by ArmyInform, the fighters of the 68th hunting brigade named after Oleksa Dovbush removed the work of one of the shifts on the -holidays- of the brigade, the center for making the most important decisions, where the management of the battlefield on the approaches to Pokrovsk takes place.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/23/doyihav-i-zgoriv-yegeri-vidbyly-shturm-zuhvalogo-vorozhogo-btra/	2025-01-23T10:57:14-08:00
Dangerous flights -Movie-: journeys through fire and fear	The story of the fighter was published on the page of the 58th separate motorized infantry brigade named after the Hetman. Ivan Vyhovskyi. Before the full-scale invasion, Anton from Kyiv worked as a truck driver, but since 2022, his profession has taken on a completely different, deadly meaning. Moving from a MAN truck to a regular civilian pickup, Anton performs vital tasks on the front lines: delivering and picking up infantry, delivering ammunition, food, water and fuel for generators. All this without any reservations, under constant threat from the sky. According to Kino, the biggest danger to him and his machines is FPV drones, which are now literally saturated in the sky above the front line. When asked about -driving hacks- to protect against drones, Anton frankly answers: the only way is speed. But it is not always a panacea either, because there are very few places on the front line where you can safely accelerate. -Recently, in just one week, we 'caught' two drones,- recalls Anton. — It's good that the REBka worked, and the -birds- got close to the car. The wheels were cut a little, but the people are all alive and well.- The fighter adds that the means of electronic warfare are not always effective, so to minimize risks, drivers try to drive in the -darkness- - at dusk, when it is not yet completely dark or just beginning to dawn. Unlike many drivers, Anton does not have any omens, superstitions or rituals. Before each trip, he only prays and begins to perform tasks that bring our victory closer. As reported by ArmyInform, a fighter of the -Hart- brigade Vasyl Ilyus with the call sign -Faithful- -prykordonnyka-vasylya-virnogo/->received five bullet wounds during fierce battles for Bachmut. One of the bullets remained in his body forever.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/23/nebezpechni-rejsy-kino-poyizdky-kriz-vogon-ta-strah/	2025-01-23T10:42:41-08:00
HIMARS in Kurshchyna — cluster munitions cleared the forest of Russians	The video was published on January 23 on the part's channel.

Ukraine insists on increasing international pressure on Russia to end the war	The head of state told about this in an evening address to the citizens of Ukraine. The President stated: -Peace is possible through strength, we are absolutely sure of that. The main thing is not to lose momentum and pressure. To put pressure on Russia, on the only entity that wants this war, that is guilty of this war.- According to him, Russia is deliberately trying to prolong the aggression and occupation, so countering its actions should be coordinated as much as possible. One of the main directions of international efforts is the issue of energy security. The President emphasized that energy resources, particularly oil, remain one of the most important keys to peace. He called on Europe to work more actively with America and other global partners in the energy sphere to reduce dependence on Russia and its influence. -Europe needs to work more with America and other partners in the world, and not with Russia regarding energy resources,- the head of state said. The President expressed deep gratitude to all those who are fighting for the independence of Ukraine, in particular in the hottest spots - in Donetsk region, Kharkiv region, South and Kursk region.

In Odesa, racketeers beat out a military serviceman for his father's funeral	reported this on January 23 Odesa Regional Prosecutor's Office. According to the investigation, the direct leadership of the group was carried out by a resident of Podilsk, who has been repeatedly convicted of self-interested crimes and is in the pre-trial detention center in the status of a -watcher-. The members of the group specialized in -knocking out- non-existent debts. If they did not agree to give the money, they persecuted the victims, resorted to beatings and psychological pressure. They also threatened physical violence. It is documented that the suspects demanded a -debt- from a soldier of the Armed Forces of Ukraine from Podilsk. After learning that he had received a large amount of financial aid from the state for his father's death during a combat mission in the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the perpetrators began to call and demand a non-existent debt. Fearing for his life and health, the victim paid them 70,000. UAH But this was not enough for the attackers, they wanted another 850 US dollars, which he allegedly owed them. When the money was not received, their accomplice, who was at large, organized a meeting with the victim and, using physical force and psychological pressure, forcibly took 5,000 hryvnias. The perpetrators were unable to complete their criminal plan because they were exposed by law enforcement officers. The suspects are currently in custody. The involvement of the members of the criminal group in the commission of other similar crimes on the territory of Odesa is also being checked.

-It's scary, but it's necessary-: how the crew of the 2C1 self-propelled guns works on the front lin...	The video with the story of the gunners was published on the brigade's official page. -The composition of the crew of the 2C1 self-propelled guns has practically not changed since the beginning of the full-scale invasion. And the one who joined the team adapts quite quickly. The main secret is mutual support and humor,- the message says. One of the soldiers responsible for the technical condition of the car talks about his duties: -My task is to maintain, to see that everything is clear, so that the car does not fail. Oil check, filter replacement, engine, gearbox, levels. Check to see if there are any trains, nothing. Look at the air system. And the goose must be pulled out there. One pull to tighten, and she was more stretched, and so that, suddenly, she did not swell. He adds that the Gvozdyka engine is reliable and easy to maintain: -The Yandzor engine is good. There is nothing complicated.- The biggest test, according to the fighter, is entering the positions under fire: -Entering under fire is the most difficult. Very scary. Well, I have to.- Before the war, he worked as a miner and an electrical fitter, and in 2019 he signed a contract and entered the service of this self-propelled gun. Another gunner, mobilized in the summer, talks about the PG-2 sighting device, designed to point the gun at the target: -I think that anyone with hands and a head can do this job.- It also demonstrates the process of loading the cannon and sending the gunpowder. The third crew member acts as a signalman and is responsible for orienting the firing machine using a compass. Fighters emphasize the importance of mutual assistance and cohesion in the crew. -If the machine broke down or there were any problems in the machine, we all tried to solve this problem. The sooner the better. Our guys are very kind and everyone can help. If something is not clear, they will tell you right away. Everyone stands for each other, as without this,- they say. Despite fatigue and difficult conditions, the gunners maintain optimism and faith in victory. -There are moments when morally, honestly, it is difficult. We are motivated by the fact that your family is here. We just do our job and hope it benefits our state and we win. Either you are wanted and in hiding, or you come and work together with everyone, protecting, fighting for your country,- the fighters conclude. As reported by ArmyInform, Roman is a junior sergeant of the 45th separate artillery brigade named after General Myron Tarnavskyi, who, despite the risks to his life, delivers ammunition on firing positions.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/23/strashno-ale-treba-yak-praczyuye-ekipazh-sau-2s1-na-peredovij-rozpovid-garmashiv-92-yi-brygady/	2025-01-23T08:41:48-08:00

In order to go abroad, the evader bought virtual children from Germany — DPSU	This was reported in the press service of the DPSU on Thursday, January 23. They said that in order to confirm his status as a father of many children, the man submitted for verification the birth certificates of three children, which were allegedly issued in Germany. -According to the documents, his twin children were two years old, and the third child was 7 months old.

As reported by ArmyInform, previously the Security Service of Ukraine and the National Police uhylennya-vid-mobilizaczyiy-za-dva-dni/->liquidated 10 schemes for evading mobilization.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/23/shhob-vyyihaty-za-kordon-uhylyant-prydbav-virtualnyh-ditej-z-nimechchyny-dpsu/	2025-01-23T08:08:41-08:00
The Armed Forces refuted the fake story about the so-called million-dollar bonuses of commanders	They published a corresponding statement on their channel. -Some media, referring to the post of People's Deputy Marjana Bezuglai, spread a fake about the so-called -million dollar prizes-. The statements made public by the deputy do not correspond to reality and only help the enemy to bring discord and mistrust into Ukrainian society,- the message reads. The StratCom of the Armed Forces drew the attention of the media that the military command is ready to provide the necessary clarifications for the dissemination of true information. -Yes, Article 15 of Chapter II of the Law of Ukraine -On the Disciplinary Statute of the Armed Forces of Ukraine- provides for an exhaustive list of incentives that apply to military personnel. Among them, in particular, there are also cash prizes - in addition to valuable gifts, badges and awards, diplomas, thanks, etc., -said the StratCom of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. It is noted that in order to provide such bonuses and valuable gifts, the Minister of Defense of Ukraine issues a separate mandate every year within the limits of the amounts provided for by the Law -On the State Budget of Ukraine-. Therefore, the commanders and leaders of the Armed Forces, their types and separate branches of troops (forces) receive an annual bonus fund to encourage personnel with monetary bonuses — for additional motivation of the best servicemen, within the limits of the implementation of the laws on the State Budget and the Disciplinary Statute of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. -Yes, the discretionary fund of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in 2024 amounted to UAH 19 million. Incentive bonuses were paid to 426 servicemen of all categories (soldiers, sergeants, officers),- the Armed Forces StratCom reported. The Main Directorate of Communications of the Armed Forces of Ukraine added that the incentive fund of the Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine last year amounted to UAH 1.8 million, but in general, a much smaller amount was used to reward 22 servicemen. Personnel and other leaders of the Defense Forces of Ukraine were rewarded within the framework of the specified funds. -Without the material incentives of a serviceman, both a common soldier and an officer, no combat-ready army can function. And even more so is the country's army, which is repelling a full-scale invasion. Please be guided by verified information and do not spread fakes that discredit the defenders of Ukraine and fuel enemy propaganda,- the Armed Forces StratCom stressed. As reported by ArmyInform, the Commander of the Naval Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Vice Admiral Oleksiy Neizhpapa, told about mechanisms of encouraging servicemen using the annual bonus fund.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/23/u-zsu-sprostuvaly-fejk-pro-tak-zvani-miljonni-premiyi-komanduvachiv/	2025-01-23T08:01:50-08:00

The MOU explained the rules for granting deferment for students and teachers	About this informsthe Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. The granting of a deferment to those obtaining professional, professional pre-university and higher education, interns and doctoral students, as well as to teachers is regulated by the Law of Ukraine -On Mobilization Training and Mobilization- and the Procedure for Awarding Citizens for Military Service During Mobilization, for a Special Period, Approved by Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine from May 16, 2024 No. 560 (hereinafter referred to as the Order). It is noted that the Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine from December 31, 2024 No. 1558 introduced important changes to the Order. Now the rules for granting deferment for education seekers and teaching staff are clearly defined. In particular, students of professional and technical, professional pre-university and higher education institutions, interns and doctoral students will receive a postponement for the whole semester, but not more than six months (September-February and March-August). Scientific and pedagogical workers who have a scientific degree, as well as pedagogical workers of various educational institutions, will have a deferment until the end of the academic year (if they are in a permanent job - lasting 12 months a year). -The principle innovation is that now education seekers do not need to confirm their status every three months in the territorial recruitment and social support centers (TCC and SP). Previously, this was exactly the requirement of the legislation during the legal regime of martial law and general mobilization,- the MOU said. Information about students is contained in the Unified State Electronic Database of Education (SEDEB). As long as the register states that a citizen is getting an education, he is guaranteed the right to a deferral. Currently, students can apply for a deferment in connection with their studies in the Reserve+ application. -Thanks to the constant exchange of data between the EDEBO and the registers of the Ministry of Defense, the extension of the postponement takes place online. This means that an education seeker does not need to apply to the TCC and SP every six months (previously every three months), the message says. A separate procedure is provided for students who do not have the opportunity or desire to use Reserve+. They have to get an extract from the EDEBO once every six months at their educational institution and apply to the TCC and SP for an extension of the deferral. The Ministry of Education and Culture noted that the conditions for receiving a deferment for teachers have not changed. They must be employed at a rate not lower than 0.75, which is confirmed by the educational plans for the academic year, which lasts from September 1 to August 31 (including vacations and holidays), unless otherwise established by the Regulations on the organization of the educational process of the relevant institution. The Ministry of Defense is currently working on the integration of registers with the Ministry of Education and Culture for the automatic exchange of information and the granting of deferrals to scientific, scientific-pedagogical and teaching staff. This will greatly simplify the procedure and reduce paper bureaucracy. -Fundamentally important: vacations and the end of the academic year are not grounds for losing the right to postponement. Changes to the resolution are aimed at simplifying the procedure and reducing the burden on TCC and joint venture employees, who previously had to process a huge number of documents every three months,- the MOU assured. The Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Education and Science urged to trust only official sources. -Vacations and the end of the school year are not grounds for losing the right to postponement,- the MOU summarized. We remind you that on January 22 in the Rezerv+ electronic system again /->the service of obtaining postponements from mobilization for students and postgraduates has become available.

The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces explained the issue of redeployment of troops and plannin...	This was told by the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces Oleksandr Syrskyi in an interview project BAZA on Radio Bayraktar. -If you read in the news that someone has been removed from somewhere and moved, it does not mean that there is some betrayal or something else. This means, more than anything, that there is a certain plan, and it will work if someone was transferred somewhere just for this,- the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces emphasized. He emphasized that the success of operations often depends on surprise for the enemy. Disclosing information about troop movements can harm mission performance and lead to casualties. -Of course, unsuccessful actions when both the enemy and society know. If everyone knows, they will take adequate and appropriate measures. When it happens quietly or people do not know the intentions, why it is being done, then there is success,- explained Oleksandr Syrskyi. The Commander-in-Chief also addressed the citizens, urging them to trust the military leadership. -Most people understand that if something is done by command, it is done for a purpose, not just like that. Some really start to raise and disperse panic, completely not understanding why this is being done,- the Commander-in-Chief noted. Oleksandr Syrskyi emphasized that information from the Ukrainian mass media is monitored not only by Ukrainian, but also by enemy experts who use it to make decisions. Dissemination of such information can cause significant damage and lead to loss of personnel. -Each of our soldiers is worth their weight in gold, I will repeat this many times,- the Commander-in-Chief emphasized. Regarding the planning of operations, Oleksandr Syrsky said that this process is continuous and takes place around the clock.

-Service in the rear is not for me-: a 56-year-old fighter -Rubezhu- with the call sign -Batya- has ...	The story of the fighter was published on the page of the 4th brigade of operational assignment -Rubizh-. -It was easier then. Walked around positions without armor. Now the war has become different,- -Batya- recalls. After 2017, the fighter took a break, but with the beginning of a full-scale invasion of Russia in 2022, he did not hesitate to return to the army. At first, he got to the rear, but later transferred to the -Rubizh- brigade, because, according to him, -sitting and guarding- was not to his liking. Now, despite his age, -Batya- repels enemy attacks on par with his younger brothers. He recalls a heavy assault that took place before the New Year. Then the enemy attacked in small groups, trying to break through the Ukrainian positions. However, thanks to the coordinated work of the Ukrainian defenders, the enemy did not succeed - 36 invaders remained on the battlefield. -There is no fear. Not only our battalion worked, we were also helped by drops from drones, but the main thing is coordinated work,- says the fighter. The actions of the Russian occupiers during the so-called -meat assaults- surprise even such an experienced warrior as -Batya-: -They are either crazy or -stuffed- with some substances. They reach our ego, someone specially lies on it so that others will step on it. But this tactic is not stupid - it's just that they fight with drones, and people are worthless to them.- -Batya- frankly admits that during enemy attacks everyone, even the most experienced soldiers, feels fear. However, the most important thing in such a situation is to support and encourage your brothers in time. -We pretend that we ourselves are not afraid, we joke. Somehow there were gas dumps - we put on gas masks, took out our phones and started playing games. Those who were afraid saw this and also calmed down,- he shares. After the end of the war, -Father- dreams of a quiet life in retirement. -Rather, peace would come so that the children would not see this,- he says, adding that he is ready to defend his native land as long as he has enough strength.

-I am their eyes-: aerial scout -Samsung- about escorting infantry and evacuating the wounded under ...	The story of the fighter was made public on the page of the 141st separate mechanized brigade. According to Samsung, its main task is to constantly conduct reconnaissance and monitor the enemy. -My job consists in constant reconnaissance, monitoring the enemy, his possible movement, assault attempts, infiltration to our positions,- the aerial scout shares. The enemy often fires at the positions of Ukrainian drones, they are one of the priorities for him. -If they know approximately where our positions are, they use everything to destroy them. From the beginning to the end, the landing is constantly fired at by artillery and mortars,- says Samsung. In addition, the occupiers actively use drones of various types, trying to detect his positions. -Often the enemy searches for us, enemy drones, enemy FPVs, wings, kamikazes fly in. We constantly have to leave the shelter, the dugout, to take the drone out, pick it up, and so on,- he adds. One of the episodes shared by Samsung demonstrates the effectiveness of using drones to destroy enemy manpower. Having discovered an enemy soldier without weapons and protection, aerial reconnaissance began surveillance. After the occupant tried to hide under the downed equipment, he was struck by an FPV drone. As a result, first three, then six occupants who tried to escape ran out of the shelter. -There was no longer even a queue, as it works here. Just all there, a series of fpvshocks, resets and so on. In total, we disassembled nine -catsaps-, which simply ran in a crowd in a friendly manner along the landing,- recalls -Samsung-. An important aspect of Samsung's work is the support and security of Ukrainian infantry during night operations. -Because all the movement takes place more often at night, for greater security. Well, they walk almost blindly, they don't see anything, and I am their eyes, I show them the way, how it is safer for them to enter, when it is better for them to hide,- he explains. The aerial scout also helps evacuate wounded soldiers by dropping water and medical supplies on them. Training on how to control Samsung drones was completed quite quickly - in two weeks. However, he acquired the main skills directly during combat missions. Now, in winter, when daylight hours are short, the work of an aerial scout becomes even more intense, because he has to work mainly at night, resting only for a few hours. As reported by ArmyInform, 38-year-old Bogdan, call sign -Voron-, platoon commander of the mortar battery of the 128th separate mountain assault brigade, has combat experience actions since 2014.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/23/ya-yihni-ochi-aerorozvidnyk-samsung-pro-suprovid-pihoty-ta-evakuacziyu-poranenyh-pid-pokrovom-nochi/	2025-01-23T05:27:20-08:00

About this on Thursday, January 23, notified the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Rustem Umerov. -Today, conscripts are forced to receive paper referrals at the TCC, wasting time in queues. Thanks to the reform, this process will become much simpler and more convenient,- he wrote on Facebook. According to the head of the Ministry of Defense, this will be -the first step towards digitalization of the VLK.- How the new service works: -First of all, referrals will be able to be generated by citizens who wish to pass the VLK themselves. But later this opportunity will appear for people who have received a paper summons to pass the VLK. The goal of beta testing is to check the operation of the new service together with Rezerv+ users and to improve it until the moment of its full launch,- said Rustem Umyerov. He also noted that the next step will be the integration of the information systems of the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Health. -As early as the fall of 2025, it will be possible to independently choose a medical institution that has a contract with the National Health Service in Rezer+ to undergo a suitability review.

The Defense Forces announced a hostile information operation surrounding the battles for Velika Novo...	The statement of OSUV -Khortytsia- about this was made public in the afternoon of January 23. -The information is provided objectively, taking into account that the enemy also carefully studies the messages of the Defense Forces - knowledge from open sources helps the enemy to plan and adjust his further offensive actions. The defense forces of Ukraine are fighting grueling battles with the superior enemy at the respective positions and lines. The actions of the soldiers are aimed at inflicting maximum losses on the enemy, preventing defense breakthroughs and encirclements. The command is taking measures to strengthen the units, provide them with the necessary means for fighting, and strengthen and secure the flanks. Measures are also planned for actions in the event of an aggravation of the tactical situation and possible options for its development. The conduct of hostilities is accompanied by information operations. Against the background of heavy battles, losses in personnel, and the frantic dynamics of the war, the enemy is intensifying its psychological influence both directly on the personnel in front-line positions and on Ukrainian society as a whole. The main goal of Russian propagandists is to shake public sentiment, disorient and undermine confidence in the military leadership and the Defense Forces. As a result, the stability of Ukraine's defenders is reduced and their offensive operations are facilitated. The enemy uses information as a weapon, skillfully hiding behind the sources of its supply. Soldiers of the Defense Forces of Ukraine are fighting hard and defending every position. Please observe information hygiene, carefully assess the situation and continue to support your Armed Forces. The life of the state rests on them,- said the report of the Khortytsya State Security Service. As reported by ArmyInform, the Defense Forces commented on the situation around Velika Novosilka. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/23/v-sylah-oborony-zayavyly-pro-vorozhu-informaczijnu-operacziyu-navkolo-boyiv-za-velyku-novosilku/	2025-01-23T05:03:28-08:00

It was established that at the beginning of the full-scale invasion, the suspect, who was working at the time in the Black Sea Biosphere Reserve, using his knowledge and expertise, helped the invaders navigate the area. In addition, he provided them with information about the state of water bodies, the depth of the coastal zone and possible places for launching ships. -The figurehead collected and transferred data about his colleagues to the enemy and reported their readiness to cooperate with the occupation authorities. For loyalty and assistance to the invaders, the man expected to receive a position from them. However, when he realized that his hopes would not come true, he left for the territory controlled by Ukraine,- said the SBI. A collaborator was detained in Khmelnytskyi. Criminal proceedings have been initiated against him under Part 2 Art. 111 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine.

In Odesa, they wanted to spend millions on the development of Zmiiny Island	reported this on January 23 Odesa Regional Prosecutor's Office. Due to the intervention of the prosecutors of the Kyiv District Prosecutor's Office of Odesa, contracts for the purchase of works, the value of which exceeded 69 million hryvnias, were terminated. This decision was the result of an inspection that revealed the inconsistency of the signed contracts with modern realities. It has been established that in 2020-2021, the Public Enterprise -Maritime Search and Rescue Service- held open tenders, as a result of which it signed contracts with contractors for the construction of the Zmiiny base station on the island of the same name. The project provided for the creation of a facility to ensure the safety of navigation and communications during emergency situations. Financing was to be carried out from the state budget through the Ministry of Development of Communities, Territories and Infrastructure of Ukraine. However, since the beginning of the large-scale invasion of the Russian Federation, Zmiiny Island has been included in the list of territories of active hostilities. This made it impossible to carry out the planned works. Despite this, the customer extended the term of the contract to 2023 and 2024, which created a risk of unjustified spending of state funds. Therefore, in view of the damages caused as a result of the aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, it is unreasonable to spend funds on goals that do not correspond to state interests. State funds should primarily be directed to the financing of the Defense Forces of Ukraine, the reconstruction of destroyed infrastructure facilities, the support of temporarily displaced persons, etc. In connection with the above, prosecutors, pursuant to Art. 23 of the Law of Ukraine -On the Prosecutor's Office-, the supervisory authorities informed about the detected violations and noted that if they are not eliminated on their own, the prosecutor's office will file a lawsuit in the interests of the state to terminate contracts for the purchase of works. Due to the reaction of the prosecutor's office, the parties eliminated the violation by terminating the above-mentioned contracts. As reported by ArmyInform, a man was found in Odesa who > traded -armor- for conscripts.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/23/na-odeshhyni-hotily-pylyaty-miljony-na-zabudovi-ostrova-zmiyinyj/	2025-01-23T04:47:10-08:00

Generals of the Russian Federation, involved in the attack on Sumy Oblast with a super-heavy bomb in...	This is reported by the SBU on January 23. The evidence base has been collected on the war criminals of the Russian Federation, who in May 2022 gave the order to strike the civilian infrastructure of the Sumy region with a guided aerial bomb of the UPAB-1500B type.

Then this super-heavy bomb hit the agricultural complex on the territory of the Putivl community, destroyed several buildings of the local agricultural company and damaged the buildings of two colleges. According to the SBU investigation, the initiator of this bombing was the commander of the Western Military District of the Russian Federation, Colonel-General Oleksandr Zhuravlev. It was he and his first deputy, Lieutenant General Oleksiy Zavizyon, who planned the air attack on the local agricultural enterprise. Subsequently, the commander of the Russian Air Force, Lieutenant General Serhii Dronov, received a request to carry out an air strike from Zhuravlev and gave his consent. Then, on his order, the occupiers launched a Su-34 bomber from the airfield in Akhtubinsk and launched an attack on the Ukrainian enterprise. The investigation also established the identities of four more Russian officials who were involved in the preparation and execution of the enemy air attack. All of them are Dronov's subordinates: On the basis of the evidence collected, the investigators of the Security Service informed the seven Rashists in absentia about the suspicion for h. 2 Art. 28, ch. 1 Art. 438 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (violation of the laws and customs of war, committed by a group of persons following a prior conspiracy).

They saved money on evacuation — near Chasov Yar, the Russians burned about a hundred of their dead	About this January 23 on the channel -We-Ukraine- the representative reported operational-tactical group -Luhansk- lieutenant colonel Dmytro Zaporozhets. According to him, on January 4-8, the Defense Forces detected the enemy in the area of ​​the -Siverskyi Donets-Donbas- canal.

Probably the personnel of the Russians, who had accumulated there in the number of up to 100 people, was destroyed. -For 2 days after the impact, no movement was observed either in the collector or near the collector. And on January 21, an incomprehensible situation arose for us, when we saw on the streams that the enemy had organized an arson in the collector, probably with the aim of hiding the traces of the destruction of such a large number of personnel and avoiding evacuation measures. The fire lasted for 5 hours,- said Dmytro Zaporozhets.

The Defense Forces spoke about the situation in the Pokrovsk and Novopavlovsk directions	Major Viktor Tregubov, the spokesman of the Khortytsia operational-strategic group of troops, stated this on January 23 during the telethon. According to Tregubov, the commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces Oleksandr Syrsky is in the area of ​​responsibility of the group, who keeps under constant control the actions in the Pokrovsky direction. The situation near the settlement of Velyka Novosilka, where active hostilities continue, remains the most difficult. -Commands at all levels are monitoring and planning actions to change the situation near this settlement as closely as possible,- the spokesman emphasized. When asked about the risk of encirclement of Ukrainian units in Velika Novosilka, Tregubov explained: -At the moment, our troops are not completely encircled, but there is a risk of operational encirclement. We do everything possible to prevent this from happening. The Russians are trying to take the approaches to the village under fire control, which complicates the situation. Special difficulties are created by the geographical location of Velika Novosilka - the river that crosses the village limits maneuvers. However, this has been taken into account and we are developing action plans to address these difficulties.- The spokesman also added that in this direction, as well as in many others, Russian forces have a numerical advantage, particularly in terms of manpower. According to Major Viktor Tregubov, fierce fighting continues in the settlements of Novy Trud and Zelene near Pokrovsk, and at the moment they remain in the so-called -gray zone-. -These villages are small in size and are completely covered with small arms, which complicates the situation. It will be possible to talk about control over them only when one of the parties takes a position there, arranges defensive fortifications and takes control of these positions. So far, this has not happened,- explained the spokesperson of the Khortytsia group. The situation in the area remains dynamic, and Ukrainian forces continue to resist the enemy's attempts to establish full control over this direction of the front.

Correspondents of ArmiyaInform recorded the devastating consequences of the airstrike. -Two men, aged 41 and 64, suffered head injuries with concussion and stab wounds. The victims were provided with medical assistance. Previously, the enemy used -FAB-250 with the UMPK module-, - informed in Donetsk regional prosecutor's office. -Early in the morning, Kramatorsk came under enemy fire - private sector. 2 people were injured. Fortunately, not heavy. About 20 houses were damaged. All relevant communal services are working at the site-, reported Oleksandr Honcharenko, head of the Kramatorsk City Military Administration . -I slept here. He woke up on his heel under the rubble, fell asleep completely right on the couch. The house, the kitchen, the barn were completely destroyed,- says local resident Boris, who was in the house at the time of the shelling. His house, as well as several neighboring ones next to the breach, has been completely destroyed, it is completely unfit for living or repair. Another 15 or so buildings around are a little more fortunate - they still have roofs to fix and windows to cover. Opposite Boris's house lives an elderly woman named Olga. About three months ago, she left Chasovoy Yar and now it is not the first time she is forced to look for a new shelter - before that she had to move several times. -Lived on the Canal, moved to the Second Workshop. They broke up the Second Shop, then came here, she recalls the local toponyms of Chasovoy Yar. - Three months have passed - and on you. The house was beautiful, warm. And they just received firewood yesterday, they gave us 21,000 for it.- Relatives and neighbors are helping the victims to remove the surviving property from the ruins, trying to find new housing. Olga gratefully remembers the owner of the now-destroyed house in which she lived for three months and is worried about whether she will be able to find a new home. It seems that, thanks to the caring neighbors, she is lucky - the local residents, who have been taking care of the victim since the morning, find a woman who has the ability to let the old woman into an abandoned but habitable house. Electricians and gas workers have been working at the scene since the morning, eliminating the consequences of shelling and repairing power lines. Residents are waiting for help from local authorities and charitable foundations to temporarily repair the relatively unscathed houses and to find housing for those whose homes are beyond repair. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that occupiers fired Pokrovsk and Kramatorsk, kindergartens, schools and clinics were damaged.

About this on Thursday, January 23, told in the press service of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. As noted, the need to replace the Soviet fleet of tactical aircraft with a Western multi-role fighter platform was discussed long before the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation, and the Swedish Gripen, the American F-15/F-16 and the French Rafale were among the possible options. And the beginning of the implementation of this important task for Ukraine was the creation of the Air Force Coalition in May 2023. Currently, it has 14 members &#8211; Belgium, Great Britain, Canada, Luxembourg, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, France, the Czech Republic and Sweden, led by the leading states &#8211; Denmark, the Netherlands and the USA. At the same time, the goal of the Coalition is not only to provide Ukraine with Western-style aircraft and aviation means of defeating them, but also to train our pilots, mechanics, engineers, and other personnel. These actions are aimed at the development and development of the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the transition of the aircraft fleet to new models of Western aviation and, most importantly, ensuring interoperability with NATO aviation. -Our pilots demonstrate their skills and efficiency of Western aviation in the Ukrainian skies. We need more aircraft to repel Russian attacks and gain superiority in the skies. We are working with our partners on this and we are waiting for their respective decisions regarding the transfer of a larger number of platforms to achieve the ultimate goal of interoperability between our and their aviation,- Serhii Boev, Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine for European Integration, emphasized. The Air Force of Ukraine received the first F-16s from Denmark and the Netherlands in 2024. Belgium, Denmark and Norway also announced the transfer of American fighters. In addition, a mechanism is currently being developed for the acquisition of two ASC 890 long-range radar detection aircraft, which Sweden announced in May 2024, and the retraining of aviation personnel for their use and maintenance. At the same time, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine notes that the work of the Coalition is not public due to the -sensitivity of the information-, so most decisions become known after the fact. -In general, within the framework of the work of the Contact Group on Aid to Ukraine, eight coalitions of capabilities were formed: the Air Force Coalition, the Coalition of Integrated Air Defense and Missile Defense, the Coalition of Maritime Capabilities, the Coalition of Drones, the IT Coalition, the Coalition of Artillery, the Coalition of Armored Equipment and Maneuverability, and the Coalition for Mine Action-. &#8211; reminded in the department.

NATO Secretary General: It is necessary to strengthen support for Ukraine and change the trajectory ...	He stated this during his speech at the -Ukrainian Breakfast- in Davos, organized on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum. -If Ukraine loses, it will mean that within NATO we will no longer talk about spending 3% of GDP on defense. Then it will be about the need to spend trillions of dollars to contain Russia. This will be a much higher price than what is currently spent on modernization and increasing defense production,- Mark Rutte said. He added that by the time the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyi decides that it is necessary to start negotiations with the Russian Federation, Ukraine should be in the strongest position. -The main issue is for it to be a permanent peace, so that there is no repetition of the situation as with the Minsk agreements, when we thought we had a permanent peace, but in fact Putin continued the seizure of Ukraine in 2022,- Mark Rutte said. The NATO Secretary General emphasized that for sustainable peace it is necessary to ensure that Putin never again occupies a single square meter of Ukrainian territory. -We must strengthen support for Ukraine. We have to change the trajectory of the war. The front line is currently moving in the wrong direction. The focus should be on Ukraine being in the strongest position, especially at the beginning of the negotiations. And when they will be completed, so that the achieved peace will be permanent. Ukraine's full membership in NATO would be the easiest way to ensure peace in the future. But whatever the outcome of the negotiations, Putin should have no say or influence over who joins or doesn't join NATO,- he concluded. As reported by ArmyInform, the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyi said that Europe should preserve unity, increase defense spending, ensure energy independence and be able to guarantee security. The President emphasized that Ukraine has created models of defense cooperation that can make the whole of Europe stronger. It is about the joint production of artillery and drones, including unique ones that have no analogues in the world.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/23/gensek-nato-neobhidno-posylyuvaty-pidtrymku-ukrayiny-ta-zminyty-trayektoriyu-vijny/	2025-01-22T23:19:21-08:00

Lawyers, foreigners, recidivists, officials — 19 more organizers of evasion schemes were detained	This was reported by the Security Service of Ukraine on January 22. The extras sold fake medical certificates or, for money, illegally transported men abroad outside checkpoints. In Odesa, law enforcement officers stopped 4 minibuses in which local agents were trying to secretly take 47 evaders to the unrecognized Transnistria. The -motorcade- with conscripts was accompanied by a car in which the organizers of this scheme were located. In total, the criminal group involved in transporting evaders consisted of 9 people, including two foreigners from the South Caucasus. All of them are currently in custody. In Kharkiv Oblast, 4 more organizers of -evasive schemes- were exposed. Among those detained is a local lawyer and a repeat offender who has a criminal record for premeditated murder. They involved more than 10 accomplices in illegal activities. The perpetrators sold the evaders fake medical certificates about the presence of disability in order to remove them from the military registration. During the searches, almost half a million US dollars were found on the detainees. In Kyiv, a former lawyer who helped evaders to escape abroad under the guise of freight forwarders of humanitarian goods was arrested red-handed. To implement the criminal mechanism, the person involved registered his clients with a local charity organization. An official of the Department of Health Protection of the Poltava Oblast was exposed in the Poltava Oblast. To register a fake disability, she sold fake medical reports on magnetic resonance imaging examinations. Another scheme in the region was organized by two businessmen who sold fake IDs of employees of the State Emergency Service to evaders. In Khmelnytskyi region, the deputy head of the medical advisory commission and two local doctors were suspected of issuing medical certificates for disability to conscripts without grounds. Based on the revealed facts, the persons involved were notified of suspicion in accordance with the crimes committed under several articles of the Criminal Code of Ukraine: The perpetrators face up to 9 years in prison with confiscation of property. ArmyInform reminds that it is better not to break the law or risk your life, but to use the aggregator of vacancies in the Armed Forces and recruiting centers. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/23/advokaty-inozemczi-reczydyvisty-posadovczi-zatrymano-shhe-19-organizatoriv-uhylyantskyh-shem/	2025-01-22T22:39:15-08:00

On Wednesday, People's Deputy Maryana Bezugla published screenshots of documents about cash prizes, calling them -generalship prizes-. In fact, we are talking about the annual bonus fund, which is part of the system of calculating the monetary support of military personnel. -I saw a mention of myself in one of the published documents on the social network. Therefore, I consider it appropriate to comment on the use of the annual premium fund,- Oleksiy Neizhpapa said. He explained that the Law of Ukraine -On the Disciplinary Statute of the Armed Forces of Ukraine- provides incentive mechanisms, including monetary bonuses, to support military personnel. And this is not just a formal reward, but a way to thank them for their dedication, perseverance and desire to become a reliable pillar of our state. Oleksiy Neizhpapa added that as the commander of the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, he has the authority to encourage military personnel with monetary bonuses at the request of the commanders. So, last year, the fund in the amount of 1.2 million hryvnias allowed to reward 223 servicemen of the Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine of all categories - sailors, sergeants, foremen and officers. -Tens of thousands of servicemen are under my command, and our priority is to act in the interests of their well-being. We approach this issue responsibly and transparently. Therefore, there is no need to look for betrayal where there is none. As for my income as Commander of the Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, all of them are reflected in the official declaration available for public viewing. We have one enemy.

A fantastic target for FPV drones, 5 km to the front line and an old GAZ-66: a cog expert that can d...	&#8220;Ukrainians show simply phenomenal success in the part of exterminating Russian vehicles. Compared to January of last year, these indicators have tripled, and even quadrupled. If in January 2024, Russians experienced losses in the automotive industry of about 10-30 units per day, now these indicators reach 100-120. A simple and logical question arises, why did this happen? In fact, this question should be considered in the mandatory reference to their armored vehicles, both tanks and armored fighting vehicles. Because that's the only way it really looks. What is the point of the question? During this war, we destroyed almost 10,000 tanks. Is it a lot? It's unbelievable, fantastic! Nothing like this has happened since the Second World War. I would like to remind you that at the beginning of the war, the Russian Federation's official tank fleet was 3,400 units. So, at this minute, we have destroyed almost two and a half state parks. And armored fighting vehicles of all types, starting from the old BTR-60PB, including the most massive BTR-80, and ending with BMP-1, BMP-2 and a small number of BMP-3 machines - that's almost 20,000. And their full-time fleet was 14,000. One important detail should be considered here. Russia can no longer produce full-fledged, high-quality armored vehicles. First of all, this applies to tanks. If the Soviet Union at the time of its collapse had six large armored tank factories, at the moment the Russian Federation has only one: Uralvagonzavod. And it can produce only one tank - T-90. They say that, they say, we put up to 1,500 tanks in service per month. But there is a nuance. This is not a new technique, it is a restored technique from conservation. Yes, the warehouse is still quite large. At the beginning of the war, it was estimated at up to 20,000 units of various types and types of armored vehicles. And it is no secret that the Russians have begun very serious and scrupulous work on returning their own equipment from Third World countries. Because since the mid-60s of the last century, the Soviet Union exported a huge amount of various equipment to a large number of countries. And because of this, the Russians still have a certain margin of safety. However, again, the same T-90s can produce a maximum of 25 tanks per month. This is the top bar. It's just two mouthpieces. We will remind that a full-time tank company is 10-11 units, no more. This is what their potential looks like. This also applies to their modern armored vehicles. So, in view of this, the Russians are forced to compensate for transporting their personnel by car to the front line. As for the cars themselves: what are the main workhorses and what is their margin of safety? The most popular military vehicles are the KAMAZ 4310, the Ural 4320, and probably their most successful medium-class truck, the GAZ 66, which has already been discontinued. It was discontinued in 1999, and for the entire time it has been produced since the 60s, produced almost a million units. These main corporations — KAMAZ and Ural — can collectively produce, as they themselves declare, up to 55,000 units of a wide variety of equipment of all modifications per year. But there is a nuance. Let's not forget that the Russian industry is a resource industry, and it is also an agricultural industry. Russians are still among the top five producers of agricultural products, primarily legumes, oil, and the like. The economy also needs a huge amount of auto equipment. And in view of the fact that the main two corporations (KAMAZ and Ural - ed.) have come under international sanctions, there are very big problems with the components. Even the Soviet Union could not fully provide all production cycles on its own, especially in the bearing part. Therefore, the Russians will not be able to produce such a large amount of automotive equipment that would be able to cover all the necessary moments for transporting personnel. And not only that. And, let's say, the delivery of standard ammunition to the artillery. And there is one more nuance. Automotive is just a fantastic target for our FPV drones. And in terms of the quality of the use of FPV drones for such purposes, we are now showing perhaps the best indicators not only in terms of our war, but in general, in a global sense. So why are car scrapping rates so high? Because Russia has serious problems with the production of tanks, serious problems with the production of the entire line of armored personnel carriers. And this problem will only increase: about the bearing, I reminded. Not to mention, say, aiming systems. At one time, even before the beginning of the large-scale invasion, the best configuration of the T-72B3 was provided exclusively by French thermal imaging systems. Sanctions are increasing and will continue to increase. This problem will grow and, not surprisingly, it is in automotive technology that a phenomenal thing can happen, when a small cog can destroy the whole car. the Russians are not giving up on the strategic task of seizing the eastern bridgehead. A soldier cannot run 5 km to the front line on the attack line. Let's say, at least one and a half kilometers, it has to be transported by automobile. And if the indicators continue to grow, it may happen that the Russians will be forced to redistribute this automotive equipment from the national economy. And in view of the colossal sanctions pressure on this economy, the moment may come when entire industries may stop due to the fact that there will not be enough trucks, say, to deliver the required amount of coal to a thermal power plant. Such is the phenomenal state of affairs in the field of destruction of automotive equipment. We hope that our soldiers will soon raise this figure to 120-130, or even up to 200 units per day (destruction of enemy vehicles - ed.). We wish them success in this.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/23/fantastychna-czil-dlya-fpv-droniv-5-km-do-peredovoyi-ta-starenkyj-gaz-66-ekspert-pro-gvyntyk-yakyj-mozhe-zrujnuvaty-usyu-impersku-mashynu/	2025-01-22T21:02:31-08:00
With a gun and a prayer - on foot and at night: how the rotation of infantrymen at -zero-	ArmyInform tells how the rotation of fighters takes place on the front line in the 2nd International Defense Legion of Ukraine. Before moving forward in the direction of forward positions, fighters arrive from rest at a common assembly point. It is here that they can get the most up-to-date information about the advance, listen to orders and advice from commanders, check weapons and -equipment-, set up -radioks-. — In connection with the dynamics and active assault actions of the enemy, every rotation now happens in manual mode. Previously, we had planned rotations, which were prescribed in the morning or the day before and were carried out clearly according to the script. Currently, due to the active assault actions of the enemy, everything needs to be adjusted and plans are changing dynamically. That's why rotation is difficult, - says the company commander Oleksandr. Advancing further can be fast, but sometimes you also have to wait until it is safe to continue moving further towards the positions. Depending on the situation, the wait can last from several tens of minutes to several hours. During their stay at the assembly point, the fighters have the opportunity to rest or have a snack. Located several kilometers from the drop-off point, the shelter where they stay is quite safe, well camouflaged and comfortable. It is possible to get comfortable here to lie down or drink hot tea. — Here we are waiting for the team to leave. One of the rotation algorithms provides for the movement of the group leaving the positions to the disembarkation point in such a way that the new group arrives there at the same time as them. Therefore, we are now waiting for the command to load into the car and drive towards the front line, - explains the second commander of the company, Yuriy. If everyone is replaced, there is no need to wait for the exit of the previous group, because it will start exiting only when the new shift enters the position. At this time, the transport returns to the assembly point and will go to the loading point in such a way as to immediately pick up those who leave and rush to the rear without any waiting. — We try to change the position completely, but due to a number of circumstances, not always it works. Therefore, we find out who is more tired and try to pick them up. We have to hold those who can still stand in their positions for another day or two. But we usually try to change people in the positions completely, - assures Oleksandr. - During the rotation, you can experience even greater losses than during the rotation of the positions. Because it is much more difficult and dangerous to bring people to -zero- than to be there. Therefore, we constantly change the landing points so that they cannot be detected by the enemy, and we -crush- enemy drones with EW. Brigade EWs work very well, - says Oleksandr. In addition to suppressing enemy UAVs with EWs, fighters also have additional active protection from drones - there are hunting rifles in each of the groups and at each of the positions. With their help, a trained fighter can shoot down a detected drone at a safe distance. —A hunting rifle was purchased for each position, which destroys enemy drones with gunpowder. This is quite an effective tool. A fighter who knows how to use her stands out for her. He practices how to load it correctly, how to shoot at a drone. That is, his additional task is the destruction of drones, - says Yuriy. - The average distance of a pedestrian crossing is one and a half or two kilometers, but it can be 3 or even 4. If there is a danger of fire damage to the unloading point, then it is transferred deeper to the rear. Because of this, soldiers have to go to positions further and longer, and with a very significant load, - says Oleksandr. In addition to weapons, body armor and other ammunition, soldiers additionally carry up to 30 kilograms of cargo. First of all, these are ammunition, water, food, means of communication, a backpack or trench EW, additional batteries and many other necessary trinkets. The task of the commander is to check that the fighter does not forget the necessary things and does not collect extra. - When the fighters go back, they take only personal belongings, weapons and protective equipment. Heavy weapons - machine guns or RPGs, as well as sleeping bags and similar things remain in place, because all this is additional weight, - explains Yuriy. The rotation now takes place exclusively at night, because the nearest rear is closely watched by numerous enemy drones. However, even darkness is not a sufficient guarantee of security — the Russians have enough UAVs with thermal imaging capabilities. If the shelling begins, because the rotation is -drawn- by the enemy, then it is either paused, or the group is camouflaged. The average rotation time is 2‒3 hours. This is enough to withdraw and start a group, or vice versa - first start and then withdraw. But if we don't go according to plan, it can drag on for the whole night, says Oleksandr. While he is talking, the fighters inspect their equipment. Someone has already managed to doze off, others are happy to listen to the story about the Ukrainian Antarctic station -Akademik Vernadskyi- and the research vessel -Noosphere-. Quiet and focused, they are happy to distract themselves with an interesting story before a dangerous task. Everyone who is currently in the forefront is not doing it for the first time. According to the established tradition of the 2nd International Legion, the unit's sleeve insignia should feature a stylized antique helmet and spear and the motto in Latin -Viribus unitis- - -With united effort-. This chevron is a combat chevron and should be earned. The arm badge is issued to soldiers who have completed their first combat mission, so those who wear it are no longer newcomers to the Legion and have passed the baptism of fire on the front lines. task. Company commander Yuriy congratulates the soldiers and personally fastens a chevron on each shoulder. This is the combat green and black version of the arm badge, the soldiers will receive the ceremonial red, gray and black version after returning. A blessing from the military chaplain and a joint prayer are mandatory before going to the position. This is part of the tradition and a tribute to the brothers, for whom faith is the strongest support that strengthens the spirit in a difficult hour. The military chaplain of the 2nd International Legion, Father Makarii, conducts a short service. While taking the soldiers of the unit from different countries of the world on vacation, he not only instructs and strengthens them in the Christian faith, but also tells them about Ukraine and Ukrainians, introduces them more deeply to the culture and history of our people. — My dear friends, my dear brothers in Christ, you are here together for a very clear mission. Don't think this is an easy mission. You have a special calling from God because we cannot do anything without God's will. If you are here, it is because God called you to come here - he addresses the soldiers and asks God to protect them from Russian bullets, shells and bombs. The machines will soon arrive and the rotation will follow the usual planned algorithm - an expensive disembarkation at the point and a few kilometers of walking to the positions with a heavy load and under the constant danger of detection by the enemy. The group that the fighters are supposed to replace has already advanced to meet and will soon arrive at the place, which is only 10-15 minutes away from here.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/23/z-rushnyczeyu-ta-molytvoyu-pishky-ta-ponochi-yak-vidbuvayetsya-rotacziya-pihotyncziv-na-nuli/	2025-01-22T20:48:40-08:00

Imitating the Ukrainians: American marines are actively using TRV heavy drones	In October of this year, Combat Logistics Battalion 8 (CLB-8), part of the 2nd Logistics Group of the US Marine Corps, demonstrated the capabilities of the British-made Tactical Resupply Vehicle 150 (TRV-150) cargo drone during maneuvers Bold Quest 24. Actually, drones from Malloy Aeronautics are well known in the Defense Forces of Ukraine. About the fact that the leadership of the United Kingdom transferred to our state flying products from this company, ArmyInform reported last September. Characterizing their UAV TRV-150, its developers stated: -Thanks to the ability to reliably lift 68 kg in any weather, you can trust the T150 to get your loads anywhere!-. And talking about the course of multinational military exercises Bold Quest 24, reviewers of the defense portal Army Recognition noted that under frequent field school at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina, aimed at to improve interoperability between air, ground, sea, space and cyber units, the TRV-150 drone operationally delivered 38.5 kilograms of medical supplies, including donated blood. In April 2023, the US Navy signed an $8.4 million contract with the British company Malloy Aeronautics and its American reseller Service Engineering for 21 units of these unmanned aircraft systems. This decision was made after the TRV-150 took first place in the PMA-263 Tactical Resupply UAS Challenge in 2019. On 27 October 2023, the Marine Corps announced an initial operational capability (IOC) for the TRV-150C at Marine Corps Base Hawaii, equipping and training the Third Maritime Logistics Battalion (LLB-3) to operate the system. The US Marine Corps plans to deploy the Tactical Unmanned Aerial Supply System (TRUAS) to all logistics battalions by 2028, with each unit expected to receive between three and six drones. The development of the TRV-150 stems from Malloy Aeronautics' previous work on hovercraft concepts in 2012, which evolved into more practical unmanned cargo delivery systems. The TRV-150, an electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) cargo drone, can transport up to 68 kilograms of cargo over a distance of 70 kilometers at a cruising speed of 108 kilometers per hour. It has a flight time of 36 minutes and uses waypoint navigation for autonomous mission planning. The TRV-150 features eight electric motors that drive the propellers, removable batteries for quick replacement, and modular components, including foldable propeller booms and a fixed chassis for compact storage and easy transport. The device is designed to be deployed by one person and is capable of operating in a variety of weather conditions, including rain, wind, desert and arctic environments. The drone is capable of delivering cargo both by landing and dropping it from the air. The demonstration of the TRV-150 at Bold Quest 24 underscores a broader trend in military logistics where armed forces are increasingly relying on autonomous drones to solve problems in battlefield supply operations. These unmanned systems can transport critical items such as ammunition, food and medical supplies, reducing reliance on manned convoys in high-risk areas. The US Army is implementing similar initiatives, developing autonomous air supply systems for infantry brigade combat teams. Advances in battery technology are expected to increase the payload, range and speed of these systems, as well as potential plans for in-flight wireless charging. Drones like the TRV-150 are especially valuable in medical resupply missions, where sensitive materials like blood must be transported in difficult environments. The US Army's Project Crimson uses the FVR-90 drone, which has the ability to take off and land vertically, to deliver whole blood to combat medics. During the Convergence project, 22 drones transported simulated blood packages in the Mojave Desert, demonstrating their effectiveness in scenarios involving mass casualty of service members. These initiatives are aimed at improving the logistics of medical supply in contested airspace and rough terrain, potentially increasing the survival rate of the wounded.

Russian air defense repelled an attack on Smolensk: this had never happened before	It seems that every day the Russian mass media is becoming more and more like scenarios from thrillers, in which the main character always manages to stop the disaster at the last moment. And here's a new story for you: the Ukrainian attack on Smolensk region, which was repulsed by Russian anti-aircraft defense so quickly that even in fantasy films, they don't have time to show all the tension. But there are a few things you should pay attention to before accepting this as the truth. First, let's look at the concept itself: the presence of active attacks by Ukrainian forces on the territory of Russia indicates that the front has long ceased to be limited only to Ukrainian lands. However, for Kremlin propagandists, it looks as if the protected city of Smolensk is one of the last bastions worth defending to the last breath. And now, they are presenting it as a battle that took place with the invincible Russian air defense. But isn't it strange that at this time official sources have not confirmed any evidence of this miraculous reflection? Secondly, the Russian sources themselves limit themselves to statements that the anti-aircraft missile system successfully destroyed all targets. But there are no videos or photos anywhere to confirm this -heroic- moment. Doesn't that seem a little suspicious? After all, as we know, if anything happens in Russia, even similar to the lightning flight of a rocket, the video is already in all social networks. And now about the fictional -reflection- itself. Doesn't it seem strange to you that even in the most difficult conditions of the war in Smolensk, no one noticed that parts of Ukrainian drones or missiles disappeared from the air defense system, which could confirm this statement? Maybe because no attacks actually happened? The Kremlin is well aware that if they want to support the morale of their army and population, it is necessary to create stories about an indomitable power that seemingly continuously protects the country from all troubles. However, reality does not always correspond to such stories. Especially when it comes to actual results: the situation at the front is actually quite different. If we put everything together, we can only laugh at how the Kremlin is trying to create a new victory with the help of fantasy. And if the anti-aircraft defense really destroyed many targets, then most likely, these -targets- existed only in the fiction of Moscow propagandists. Isn't that right? This is another vivid example of how manipulation and fake news are becoming a tool for waging war, not on the front, but in the information space. But who believes all this? But only those for whom it is important to remain in the dark, without access to the truth.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/23/rosijska-ppo-vidbyla-ataku-na-smolensk-takogo-shhe-ne-bulo/	2025-01-22T20:16:01-08:00

- Fart or experience? - how a Ukrainian mortar destroyed an enemy tank with one shot	The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. Bohdan has experience working with different types of mortars and can compare their effectiveness. In 2014, he worked with the Soviet 2B11 mortar, later he used the Ukrainian Hammers and the American M120 mortars, which he considers the most convenient due to their design features. Bohdan mentions two cases that are particularly memorable due to the effectiveness of mortar weapons. The first occurred in the Kherson region, where he managed to destroy an enemy MTLB carrying ammunition for the Russian infantry. And the second in Zaporizhzhia, when one of the mines hit the hatch of a Russian T-72 tank that was moving to support the infantry. Although this shot was accidental, it turned out to be fatal for enemy equipment. In addition, Bohdan notes that the mortar has repeatedly confirmed its effectiveness in destroying enemy fortifications and equipment. -Our calculation worked on the enemy infantry, but it so happened that at the moment of one of the shots, a Russian tank approached with open hatches (the ventilation of the tower in the T-72 is bad, so tankmen during intensive firing often open the hatches in order not to be poisoned by powder gases ). And our mine hit directly into the open hatch of the moving tank. It happened by accident, we were just lucky, but the fact remains that we destroyed the tank with one shot from a mortar,- says Bohdan. However, not all stories turn out the way you want them to. Bohdan recalls the case when, a few months ago, his unit came under fire from Russian artillery and aircraft. An enemy drone detected their positions, and 152 mm artillery began to work on them, covering them with 17 shells. One of the shells hit the shelter where four fighters were hiding. Bohdan was wounded, but after treatment he returned to the army. Despite the difficult tests, Bohdan firmly believes in the victory of Ukraine. -We must be prepared that the war may last longer than we hope. On the other hand, there is no other choice - we will definitely win,- he concludes. As ArmiyaInform reported, sailor Vasyl with the call sign -Robbiynyk- served in the 38th separate brigade of marines, where he heroically defended Ukraine in the Pokrovsky direction. In close combat he neutralized the enemy, took a prisoner and became an example of courage for his brothers. Vasyl is currently undergoing rehabilitation after a serious injury, but dreams of returning to the service.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/22/fart-chy-dosvid-yak-ukrayinskyj-minometnyk-vidpravyv-v-utyl-vorozhyj-tank-odnym-postrilom/	2025-01-22T09:11:10-08:00

Homeland as a source of strength: the story of a doctor -Syaivo-	Information about the project published on the official Facebook page of the 12th special purpose brigade -Azov- of NSU. Friend -Syaivo- was born in Kirovohrad Oblast, in the region she describes as the border between Naddnipryan Oblast and the Zaporizhia Steppe. This area is a source of inspiration for the heroine, as it combines unique natural landscapes, rich history and cultural heritage. She mentions the Corypheiv Theater, founded by Mark Kropyvnytskyi, which became a symbol of the struggle for Ukrainian culture. -Ukrainian theater could not exist in its native language for a long time due to prohibitions. But such figures as Kropyvnytskyi, Sadovskyi, Lysenko, and Zankovetska were able to join forces and create the first professional theater in Ukraine,- Syyvo shares. With particular enthusiasm, -Syaivo- tells about the archaeological wealth of Kirovohrad region: Scythian mounds, ancient sites and monuments of the Neanderthal era. Her region, like the Ukrainian steppe, remains for her a symbol of freedom and the power of nature. -Here you feel like you're part of a history that spans thousands of years,- she says. Ukrainian folk song occupies a special place in the life of -Syaivo-. She remembers how her great-grandmother and grandmother taught her lullabies and carols, which became a symbol of home warmth. The song -Oh long ago-, which tells about the steppe and the difficult fate of Ukrainians, is an important connection with her native land. The -Genesis- project not only reveals a deep connection between the personal history of the fighters and the cultural code of Ukraine, but also forms a modern epic about heroes who fight for the freedom of their land. The following episodes will tell new stories of brave defenders, for whom love for their homeland has become a driving force in their lives.

For example, he organized a military youth training school called ``Desant'' in order to interest young people in service in the Armed Forces and in particular in the Airborne Forces. Contributed to the holding of the annual military camp ``Legion,'' Andriy Kovalev shares his memories. At the same time, he notes that Konstantin Zhuk talked about the inevitable war with the Russian Federation long before 2022. -I must have heard it from him as a young man at the camp in 2006, when Kostya asked me if I would go to serve in the army. He said that we should become officers, because there will be a shortage of them when the war with Russia starts,- the officer added.

Occupiers on rubber boats swim across Oskil, but they are met by our drones	Major Viktor Tregubov, the spokesman of the Khortytsia operational-strategic group of troops, stated this on January 22 on the air of -Suspilne Novosti-. To the presenter's question, thanks to which the Russian military manages to advance towards the village of Dvorichna, he answered that this is due to the infiltration of the occupiers through the Oskil River. -They are constantly seeping there through Oskil. Usually at night, usually on small watercraft. Every day we register the destruction of a certain number of Russian watercraft, but these are rubber boat-class watercraft,- Viktor Tregubov said. For example, according to him, six occupants can get into a rubber boat to swim across Oskil at night or during fog and hide in a forest strip. The spokesman of the -Khortytsia- OSUV noted that Ukrainian drones hunt them both when the Russians try to cross the river and in the forest strips. -When they have already accumulated a certain number of people there, they try to carry out assault actions. Our people catch and destroy them in the forests. That's why the map always looks like it's constantly flickering. They are sometimes in Dvorichnaya, sometimes not in Dvorichnaya. They have a favorite crossing point there,- he explained. Viktor Tregubov said that the main problem for the Russians is that the Oskil River has not frozen over. -If the river had frozen over, they could have more or less fixed the logistics there. And the river is not frozen, you can't throw a pontoon across it, because there is fire control of Ukrainian troops there, which will simply destroy it instantly, and that's why they have to go in small groups like that,- he said. As reported by ArmyInform, the Russian troops changed the offensive tactics in the Pokrovsky direction, in particular, the Russians -use-myasom-yak-zminylas-taktyka-rosiyan-na-pokrovskomu-napryamku/->reduced the number of yes so-called -meat- assaults and began to manage personnel more economically.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/22/okupanty-na-gumovyh-chovnah-pereplyvayut-oskil-ale-yih-zustrichayut-nashi-dronari/	2025-01-22T03:38:10-08:00

Today is Sobornosti Day: what Ukrainians celebrate on this day	Since the end of the 17th century, our lands have been divided between different empires, so their confederation (i.e. unification into a single state entity) has become the pinnacle of social life aspirations for Ukrainians. The Ukrainian national movement presented a political program unification during the -Spring of Nations- - a series of revolutions of 1848-1849 that swept across Europe. The main Russian Rada (the first Ukrainian political organization that appeared in Lviv at the time) in the manifesto of May 10, 1848 declared its desire for the unity of the Ukrainian lands. Among the preserved materials of the Main Russian Council is an anonymous article in which it is noted: -From the Tisza behind the Carpathians, on both sides of the Dniester and Dnieper to the banks of the Don, there are settlements of one Slavic people, the number of which reaches 15 million. Therefore, the purpose of such a great nation cannot be to occupy a secondary position in Europe, to be subordinated to another-. After 1865, in a song to the words of Pavlo Chubynskyi from Dnieper and music by Mykhailo Verbytskyi from Galicia (it was this song that became the basis of the national anthem of Ukraine ) the following words appeared: -Let's stand up, brothers, in a bloody battle from the Xiang to the Don, We will not let anyone rule in our native land.- The Tarasiv Brotherhood, a secret student organization created in Poltava in 1891, proclaimed in its program: -Independent, sovereign Ukraine: cathedral and indivisible, from the Syan to the Kuban, from the Carpathians to the Caucasus.- The slogan -One, unified, indivisible, free, independent Ukraine from the Carpathians to the Caucasus- was also used by Mykola Mikhnovsky in the brochure -Independent Ukraine- (1900). The First World War, national revolutionary movements and the collapse of empires brought the realization of the dream of cathedral unity. The Ukrainian Central Rada was established in Kyiv in 1917, and on January 22, 1918, it proclaimed the independence of the Ukrainian People's Republic from Russia. And in Galicia, on the ruins of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the West Ukrainian People's Republic emerged on November 1, 1918, after the November Revolution. Its leaders initiated negotiations on the unification of Transnistrian Ukraine with Transnistrian Ukraine. On December 1, 1918, at the -Fastiv- railway station, representatives of the ZUNR and the UNR signed the -Pre-Accession Treaty- (that is, preliminary or preliminary). The agreement stated the unwavering intention of ZUNR -to merge into one large state with the Ukrainian People's Republic in the shortest possible time.- For its part, the Ukrainian National People's Republic announced its agreement -to accept the entire territory and population of the Western Ukrainian People's Republic as an integral part of the state integrity of the Ukrainian People's Republic.- The contract was signed by: Volodymyr Vynnychenko, Simon Petliura, Fedir Shvets, Panas Andrievskyi from the Ukrainian National People's Republic of Ukraine, Longyn Tsegelskyi and Dmytro Levytskyi from the National People's Republic of Ukraine. The pre-accession treaty was ratified on January 3, 1919, at the first meeting of the Ukrainian National Council, the governing body of the Ukrainian People's Republic. On January 18, a joint meeting of the Directorate and the Council of People's Ministers of the Ukrainian People's Republic was held with the participation of a delegation from Galicia, Bukovyna, and Transcarpathia. It was about the promulgation of the Act of Unification of the UNR and the ZUNR and the celebration on this occasion. The Council of Ministers instructed the Minister of National Education Ivan Ohienko to write the script of the events and personally lead all the ceremonies. It was he who proposed to organize a national holiday on the anniversary of the declaration of independence of the Ukrainian People's Republic. On January 22, 1919, on Sofia Square in Kyiv, on the first anniversary of the independence of the Ukrainian People's Republic, in a festive atmosphere the proclamation of the -Universal Directory of the Ukrainian People's Republic- (which we symbolically called the Act of Zluka). Buildings in the central part of the city were decorated with national flags, the entrance to Sofia Maidan was decorated with a triumphal arch with the coats of arms of the UNR and ZUNR. Tens of thousands of capital residents and numerous guests flocked to the central streets to the music. The choir led by Kyryll Stetsenko, accompanied by the orchestra, sang -Ukraine is not dead yet-. And the historic moment came - the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the ZUNR Longyn Tsegelskyi announced the letter, the resolution of the UNRada, and handed it over to the head of the Directorate Volodymyr Vinnychenko. In response, a member of the Directory Fedir Shvets read Universal: -&lt;&#8230;&gt; From now on, the West Ukrainian People's Republic (Galichyna, Bukovyna, and Hungarian Rus) and Trans-Dnieper Great Ukraine, separated from each other for centuries, will merge into one. The age-old dreams that the best sons of Ukraine lived and died for came true. From now on there is a single independent Ukrainian People's Republic &lt;&#8230;&gt;-. The holiday ended with a solemn prayer and a parade. The columns of Sich riflemen and Colonel Yevhen Konovalts were greeted with special enthusiasm. The next day, January 23, 1919, in the premises of the Kyiv Opera House (modern National Opera of Ukraine), the Labor Congress of Ukraine discussed the mentioned documents and approved them. By thus ratifying the Universal Directory of the UNR, the Congress gave it a legitimate legal character. The President of the UN Rada, Yevhen Petrushevich, was soon elected to the Directory. ZUNR, after merging with UNR, changed its name to Western Oblast of the Ukrainian People's Republic (ZO UNR). Unfortunately, due to the ongoing war with the Russians, the unification of UNR and ZUNR into one state was not completed . However, the Act of Zluka became a symbol and legend for subsequent generations of fighters for a free Ukraine. Yulian Bachynskyi's old slogan -from Syan to the Caucasus- was included in the words of the March of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN anthem), written in 1929 by Oleksa Babii. On August 24, 2018, a version of the song adapted to modern Ukrainian conditions became the March of the Ukrainian Army: -Our glory leads us into battle. For us, the law is the highest order! The cathedral Ukrainian is a state - one for the ages, from the Syan to the Caucasus!-. The memory of one's own state in 1917-1921 became one of the cornerstones of the formation of the modern national identity of Ukrainians, inspired the continuation of the liberation struggle . In 1990, on the occasion of the 71st anniversary of the proclamation of the separation of the UNR and ZUNR, the Ukrainian patriotic the public formed a living chain of unity from Ivano-Frankivsk to Kyiv. An example of that -Ukrainian wave- was the -Baltic Way- action by residents of the Baltic countries. How many participants came to the commemoration of the events of the Ukrainian Revolution is not known for sure: various sources say from 500 thousand to three million people who joined hands and created a continuous chain from Kyiv through Lviv to Ivano-Frankivsk. The action became a harbinger of the future fall of the USSR and the emergence of Ukraine's independence. The idea of ​​territorial integrity of the country is combined with ideas of spiritual cohesion. In the conditions of the modern Russian-Ukrainian war, sobrality acquires greater symbolism and poignancy, because now, more than ever, Ukrainians need to unite for the sake of the future. A united nation that sees its own future will certainly restore the unity of the territory. This will happen after the de-occupation of Crimea, as well as our territories in Donetsk and Luhansk, Zaporizhia and Kherson, Mykolaiv and Kharkiv regions.

A robot to replace a sniper: American gunsmiths offered a technological rotation on the battlefield ...	As state in a post on the official website of the manufacturer, representatives of the American weapons company SWORD Defense Systems, their development ensures safe and reliable deployment of the weapon system, giving the operator the ability to load and safely use the weapon at a distance, according to ArmyInform. These features also allow the operator to troubleshoot and safely unload the platform for recovery. 6.5 Creedmoor cartridges allow accurate fire up to 1200 m. SPUR can also use the 7.62×51 NATO cartridge if suitable ammunition is available. Thanks to its powerful SPUR sensors can work in various conditions, both day and night. The development was called -Special Purpose Unmanned Rifle- (SPUR) and was made in the form of a detachable module. At one time, the SPUR self-propelled gun made its debut on the exhibition floor of the main annual convention of the Association of the United States Army (AUSA) in Washington, DC. The rifle was cooperated with the development of the Ghost Robotics company, the Vision-60 robot dog. Such four-legged robotic devices are actively being introduced to the defense market by companies from various countries and are equipped with a variety of weapons. In particular, our editorial office earlier spyni/-> told about the Thermonator robot dog, on which a compact ARC flamethrower with an electric drive is mounted. Speaking of weapon details, the SPUR is based on a semi-automatic rifle that uses a proven short-stroke piston design. The model is available in two calibers, which makes it versatile for tasks that require high accuracy at medium and long distances. For flexibility, the rifle is equipped with the following key components: Optics and sensors: — High definition day sight. — Thermal imaging module for night operations. These systems allow effective use of the rifle at any time of the day and in difficult weather conditions. Actuators are perhaps the most important part of the SPUR, turning it into an autonomous combat unit. Executive mechanisms provide: Remote charging of weapons. — Installation and removal of the fuse. - Shooting process. — Discharge and eliminate major delays. A standard magazine has a capacity of 10 rounds. This may seem like a limitation, but this choice is driven by point-use missions, not mass fire. Management is carried out remotely over a secure communication channel. The automatic ballistic system ensures accurate calculation of the trajectory of the shot, minimizing the human factor. SPUR is not just a rifle, but a system that can be integrated into different carriers. At the NDIA Future Force Capabilities Expo arms show, the rifle was demonstrated on a robot dog, which caused quite a stir. Platforms such as quadpods are highly mobile and can be used in urban environments, difficult terrain or even indoors. This demonstration highlighted SPUR's conceptual flexibility: it can be installed not only on ground robots, but also on unmanned aerial vehicles or stationary systems. Robotic systems with weapons, such as SPUR, can be used in various scenarios: - Defense of strategic assets: installed on a stationary platform, the rifle is able to monitor the area around the clock and automatically respond to threats. — Targeted military operations: SPUR use on drones or ground operations minimizes risks to the lives of operators. — Suppression of sabotage groups: thanks to the autonomous system of ballistic calculations and the capabilities of thermal imaging, SPUR becomes an effective tool for detecting and eliminating the enemy. The SPUR includes a thermal imaging camera with 30x magnification, which means that in the middle of the night, a remote operator can easily detect living and breathing targets. The Vision-60 and SPUR tandem is designed to allow soldiers to approach the target at close range without exposing themselves to danger. A new US Army robot dog with a sniper rifle.

-He screamed with joy-: the story of -Multa- from the 23rd OMBR, who burned a Russian on a quad bike	The senior soldier of the 23rd separate mechanized brigade Volodymyr with the call sign -Mult- is the master of the unmanned aerial systems battalion of the unmanned systems battalion. Until 2015, he worked as a dispatcher of -Poltavaoblenergo- in the Kobelyak branch. This was his home field for the last 17 years. In 2015-2018, served in the ranks of the 27th reactive artillery brigade (senior mechanic-driver on BMP-1 and BMP-2 and Uragan BM). Then he served in the Military Commissariat for another 6 months, and then went abroad. He worked as an electrician in the Czech Republic, Poland and Germany. He states that he earned less than he could earn in a similar position in Kyiv. -In the capital - 50 thousand hryvnias, and in Europe, the work of an electrician is paid at the level of 35-40 thousand hryvnias,- says the military man. However, with the large-scale invasion, -Mult- returned to Ukraine with his wife - she then left for Europe again with her two daughters, and our interlocutor began, as it often happened, to -storm- the Military Commissariat - the same, native one where he once served. -I went to them for two weeks and asked to be accepted into the army. It was a pike(laughs - ed.). Somehow they call and ask if I am ready to leave at 6 in the morning. I agreed, packed my bag, took a pack of cigarettes. We were brought to Cherkassy in the 93rd Brigade. Then there were two busloads of people, about a hundred people, and only 13 of us were taken. I was among them. In my military ticket it was written that I was a senior mechanic-driver. I was asked if I would go to the APC. I replied that I could go even to BRDM. To which I was answered: -Well, then you will be a grenade launcher,- -Mult- recalls his story. A month of training followed, and the trooper became a proficient user of both the Needle and the Stinger. In 2022, he recalls, just in time for Easter, the brigade went on combat missions in the Raisin direction, in Barvinkovo. Then our units managed to pass and clear 30 kilometers of territory. -Once, my partner and I dug a 2-person dugout for ourselves - but we never spent the night there. An urgent telegram came for the rotation, and three days later we were in Bahmut.- They held the defense and fought for the city for 2 months. In the battles for this city, -Mult- was wounded - -Uragan- served in the positions of the Armed Forces. -The shells fell 2 meters from us. My brother was burned, I was thrown 7 meters.- After that, he served in the Kharkiv Military Commissariat for 5 months. From October 31, 2024, -Mult- is in the ranks of the 23rd separate mechanized brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, in the battalion of unmanned systems. -Back in 2022, in the 93rd Brigade, I bought myself a drone. Two pieces. I am self-taught in general, I love technology. I used to solder phones (laughs - ed.). That's how I became the master of the BPAK shock unit,- the army man shares. On November 24, 2024, there was a particularly tasty exercise against the enemy. This combat episode is described in the -Khortytsia- OSUV as follows: during the performance of combat missions to detect and identify enemy ground and air targets, UAV strikes by dropping weapons from the UAV on enemy targets, senior soldier Volodymyr Kononenko discovered two enemy BBMs, ATV and 47 enemy manpower. -Thanks to his skillful and decisive actions, nine servicemen of the USSR were killed, 28 were wounded, an ATV and an anti-aircraft vehicle were damaged,- the command emphasizes. -Mult- describes this episode succinctly, but emotionally: -I was flying, and I see a quadric.- I took it and threw it at him. And this was my first shot like this! I was screaming with joy!-, the serviceman does not hide his emotions. When we ask whether, with all his baggage of experience, he still had to go through a course of basic general military training, the army man laughs heartily, nods in the affirmative, and asks us to guess in which year. It turns out that in 2024. But notes that it was interesting. -As a MANPADSman, I have never conducted assaults. And during the BZVP, we practiced the skills of assault and trenches, and buildings.- Success on the battlefield, in the words of -Multa-, now depends largely on technology. -The more drones, the better,- he succinctly emphasizes. &#8230; On Thursday, December 12, 2024, there was a big Russian offensive in the direction of Kurakhovo. -And on Friday, the 13th, my circle -smashed-. Tore off the fingers on the right hand.- So far, the military has already carried out five operations. Treatment is ongoing. When asked the traditional question about how he would advise civilians to overcome their fear and join the Defense Forces, Mult says: -Just get over that fear. During my time in the army, I must have been up there 10 times already. I want to get a tattoo: the number -10- with wings, with the face of a ragdoll doll.- Photo is from the personal archive of a serviceman	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/22/azh-vereshhav-vid-radoshhiv-istoriya-multa-iz-23-ombr-yakyj-spalyv-rosiyan-na-kvadroczykli/	2025-01-21T20:31:17-08:00
Fake about -energy catastrophe in the EU-: how many lies in one gas pipe	The first wave of disinformation began back in 2022, when the EU announced a reduction in dependence on Russian energy carriers. the Kremlin launched the thesis: -Europe will not survive the winter without our gas.- Then, when the winter passed, and Europeans still did not freeze in their apartments, the dark people changed: now the emphasis was on the -long-term damage- to the economy. It was a classic approach: first to intimidate, then to push to the conclusion that -without Russia, there is nowhere.- Only the script did not work. In reality, the Russian economy is suffering from sanctions, and the Europeans are just wondering how long they endured energy blackmail. Europe is confidently walking the path of energy independence, building its strategy on real achievements and not on propaganda myths. Meanwhile, Russia is still trying to sell the world the fiction that -everything is lost- without it. Perhaps the Kremlin should apply to Hollywood - screenwriters are valued there. True, only the talentless are not hired - so the chances are small. The lie that Europe cannot survive without Russian energy carriers is an attempt to save face in a situation where Russia has lost on all fronts. The EU is alive and developing, but the Kremlin has to sit on the -gas needle-, no longer having anyone to supply its raw materials to.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/22/fejk-pro-energetychnu-katastrofu-v-yes-skilky-brehni-v-odnij-gazovij-trubi/	2025-01-21T20:07:01-08:00
Instructor -Batman-: a woman who tempers the strength and spirit of recruits	The defender's story was published on the page of the Land Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Natalia has been in the ranks of the Armed Forces since 2014. Demobilized in 2016. Married, gave birth to a son. With the beginning of the full-scale invasion, she left the border with her young son. But she could not be without her husband and siblings. -I returned because my heart and soul were here, and my body was there. The country needs everyone, and I was already waiting for them to mobilize me,- Natalia shares. She went through many difficulties at the front. The first call sign she got was -Leila-, but it didn't stick. Her real nickname was -Batman,- and it was this name that stuck with her after an incident with a hat she made from a buff that resembled Batman's ears. -It's not just a call sign, it's a part of me. I train our boys and girls, because I know that life depends on physical training. Each of us must be ready for everything, even for the most difficult conditions,- says -Batman-. She emphasizes the importance of physical training, because it helps not only to withstand physical exertion, but also to strengthen the will. Thanks to her perseverance, not only physical strength, but also moral endurance develops under her guidance. -My job is not just to train, but to motivate. Each soldier must be prepared not to become a burden to his unit. I always make it clear that fitness is not just about us, it's about our brothers and sisters,- she says. Natalya is now training recruits, preparing them for real battles. -These are people from different professions, with different experiences, but with one thing in common: they have motivation.

How the border guards of the -Forpost- brigade use Mavic drones: the experience of -French-, -Nexus-...	The State Border Service of Ukraine informed about the peculiarities of drone operators' work. A drone operator with the callsign -French- notes that positioning is one of the key aspects of a successful operation. According to him, movement to locations is complicated by difficult conditions - broken roads and swamp. Fighters are forced to stay in their positions for at least four days. -We have prepared a dugout for ourselves, because basements and houses are a good target for the enemy. And the dugout and the correct location allow you to stay hidden and perform the task effectively,- he says. The operator of the UAV -Nexus- explained that the main losses of drones occur not only due to combat operations, but also due to technical failures. -The drone can crash due to firmware problems or failure of the gimbal, the camera's stabilizing system. Often this becomes critical, as the operator loses the ability to see the route,- he notes. The technician with the call sign -Fin- is responsible for the repair of all types of reconnaissance and attack drones. According to him, the most common malfunctions are body damage, gimbal failure and loss of drone beams. -Engine failure is less common, but it also needs attention. The success of combat missions depends on the quality of repairs,- he explains. According to French, UAV operators play an important role in protecting infantry. They accompany military units, monitor possible threats and even mine approaches to positions. -We are doing everything possible to keep the infantrymen safe. We understand how difficult the positions are, so we try to make their work easier,- the operator emphasizes. The experience of the fighters of the -Forpost- brigade confirms that effective aerial reconnaissance is the coordinated work of operators, technicians and the entire unit.

30,000 kits of poor quality: the Kyiv company was exposed in a supply scam	This is reported by the SBU. In Kyiv, the Security Service exposed two founders of a private company that supplied wholesale batches of low-quality military uniforms to National Guard units. It is documented that between March and October 2023, those involved shipped 30,000 units of clothing for Ukrainian defenders with a total cost of UAH 28.7 million. The examination initiated by the Security Service showed that the military uniform purchased with state funds was sewn using hardware that did not meet the technical conditions. In particular, the materials used have a lower class of wear resistance, so a serviceman will not be able to reliably fix protective ammunition and weapons with ammunition on such clothing. Accordingly, this may pose a real threat to the life and health of Ukrainian soldiers on the front line. According to the case materials, the defendants deliberately -saved- on quality materials in order to buy cheaper components and thus make more profit. During the searches, commercial documentation and a hard drive with evidence of embezzlement were found in the residences of the participants. So far, the SBU investigators have informed both founders of the enterprise about the suspicion for h. 2 Art. 28, ch. 5th century 191 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (possession of property by abuse of official position, committed on a particularly large scale by prior conspiracy by a group of persons under martial law).

The President of Ukraine called on Europe to increase defense spending and jointly create air defens...	About this he said during a speech to the participants of the World Economic Forum in Davos. The head of state noted that despite the fact that Russia's overall economic potential is much smaller than Europe's, the Russian Federation produces several times more ammunition and military equipment than all of Europe combined. In addition, Russia is increasing cooperation with Iran and North Korea. That is why it is important to maintain unity in Europe. -We need a common European policy in the field of security and defense, and all European countries should be ready to spend on security as much as is really necessary, and not as much as they have become accustomed to through years of neglect. If defense requires 5% of GDP, then it should be 5%,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. The President emphasized that Ukraine has created models of defense cooperation that can make the whole of Europe stronger. It is about the joint production of artillery and drones, including unique ones that have no analogues in the world. In addition, the head of state called to jointly create air defense systems that can deal with all types of cruise and ballistic missiles. -Europe needs its own Iron Dome capable of resisting any threats. We cannot rely on the goodwill of a few capitals when it comes to Europe's security,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. He also emphasized that no European country should depend on one energy supplier, especially Russia, and the policy of US President Donald Trump can help in this matter. Separately, the head of state noted that Europe must be able to guarantee peace and security for itself and for others. -Europe deserves to be strong. And for this, Europe needs the EU and NATO. Is it possible without Ukraine and without a fair end to Russia's war against Ukraine? I'm sure not. Only real security guarantees for us will be real security guarantees for everyone in Europe. And we must ensure that America also considers us necessary,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy concluded.

As reported by ArmyInform, earlier the Defense Forces struck the oil depots of the Russian invaders in Kaluga and Tula regions.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/21/atakovano-smolenskyj-aviaczijnyj-zavod/	2025-01-20T22:34:42-08:00
Soldiers of the Armed Forces told how a captured North Korean soldier tried to kill himself against ...	The fighters told about how it turned out for them in the story, which published on Tuesday, January 21, by the Command of the Defense Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. -It's no secret that military personnel from North Korea do not surrender to captivity, they are ready to lay hands on themselves in order not to fall into the hands of Ukrainian soldiers. However, Polish paratroopers managed to capture such a militant,- the military said. According to them, the prisoner fell into their hands after another assault on Ukrainian positions, when the enemy realized that it would not be possible to break through and began to retreat. -Then they were chased away by mortars, skirmishes. Towards the end of the assaults, one of the drones said that a body was moving. They said to check who it is. We got together and ran out. We were corrected by drones where to go to see it. When they approached, they saw a green scarf-pipe on top of their heads, they thought it was ours. They asked if he needed help, he did not answer. When they came closer, they saw narrow eyes. They saw that the armor is not ours&#8230; Gestures showed what he had to do. He had a grenade and a knife on his armor. They told him to throw it all away,- shared one of the Ukrainian soldiers. The fighters also recall that when they searched the prisoner, in one of his summaries, they unexpectedly discovered a sausage that the soldier from the DPRK had taken with him on the assault for some reason. -We showed him the direction to follow us. They kept their distance. The task was to deliver it to the point where the car was supposed to arrive. When the box was approaching&#8230; Before that he was very calm. A box came up, he was already getting scared or something. We almost took him out by force. When the box was already approaching, there were concrete pillars under the road, and he hit the pillar with his head from all the acceleration. It hit very hard and turned off. The guys got out of the car, packed it up and took it away. Our task is accomplished,- the paratroopers said. As reported by ArmyInform, the President of Ukraine Vladimir Zelenskyy awarded soldiers who took in the captivity of the first soldiers of the DPRK in Kurshchyna.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/21/bijczi-zsu-rozpovily-yak-polonenyj-soldat-kndr-namagavsya-vbyty-sebe-ob-betonnyj-stovp/	2025-01-20T22:28:57-08:00

We are grateful to your government, President Gitanas Nausieda,- the Head of State noted. Volodymyr Zelenskyi thanked Lithuania for over 1.5 billion euros in aid, half of which is defense support. After all, strengthening Ukraine's position on the battlefield is very important on the way to establishing a just and lasting peace. In particular, Lithuania allocates at least 0.25% of GDP to Ukraine's security and defense needs every year, and recently handed over 4,500 FPV drones that it purchased from Lithuanian manufacturers as part of its participation in the drone coalition. The country is also an active participant in demining coalitions, strengthening Ukraine's air defense, artillery. During the meeting, they discussed the continuation of support for Ukraine, the preparation of a new EU sanctions package, strengthening of military-technical cooperation and joint projects in the defense and industrial sector. Separately, the President noted Lithuania's leadership in advocating Ukraine on the way to the EU and NATO. -We are glad that on the difficult path to NATO membership - with all the challenges - the Lithuanian people, Lithuania is always with us,- he said. Saulius Skvernialis emphasized that Lithuania and its parliament are ready to continue to provide defense and humanitarian support to Ukraine, to rehabilitate Ukrainian soldiers, and to rebuild infrastructure destroyed and damaged as a result of Russian aggression. -We understand peace as the complete liberation of Ukrainian territories, including Crimea, punishment of the dictator for war crimes, bringing him to legal and financial responsibility, and Ukraine's full membership in NATO and the EU,- the Speaker noted. As reported by ArmyInform, NATO and Ukraine formed a plan the work of the Ukraine-NATO Joint Analysis, Training and Education Center (JATEC), which is located in the city of Bydgoszcz.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/21/lytva-peredala-ukrayini-4500-droniv-ta-obgovoryuye-posylennya-spivpraczi-u-sferi-oborony/	2025-01-20T22:07:00-08:00

The enemy tried 16 times to penetrate the Ukrainian defense in the Toretsk direction	This is reported in the operational information of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine as of 22 :00 January 20. On the Kharkiv direction there were two combat clashes with the Russian invaders in the Vovchansk region. In the Kupyansk direction the enemy tried eight times to dislodge our units from their positions near Petropavlivka, Kolisnikivka, Lozova and Zagryzovo. One battle is ongoing. Fifteen times the enemy attacked in the Lyman direction near Nadiya, Novoehorivka, Makiivka, Kopanok, Nevsky, Terni and in the direction of Zarichny. Two clashes continue until now. On the Severskyi direction, the invaders tried to advance in the direction of Verkhnokamyanskyi, Ukrainian soldiers repelled the attack. In the Kramatorsk direction Defense forces repelled nine enemy attempts to advance near the settlement of Chasiv Yar and in the direction of Stupochky. Two clashes are still going on. The enemy tried 16 times to penetrate our defense in the direction of Toretsk. Since the beginning of the day, the occupiers in the regions of Toretsk, Krymske, Diliivka, Shcherbynivka and Ozaryanivka have been strongly repulsed by our defenders 13 times. Three attacks are still ongoing. The enemy is intensively attacking the Ukrainian defenders in the Pokrovsky direction. Here, during the day, the aggressor carried out 72 assault and offensive actions. The greatest activity of the Russian occupiers remains in the areas of Vodiane Druge, Myrolyubivka, Promin, Elizavetivka, Myrnograd, Kotlyne, Nadiivka, Andriivka, Shevchenko, Dachne, Ulakly and Yantarne.

Can Polish tanks withstand ATGM strikes: ArmiyaInform report from Donetsk region	About the capabilities of PT-91 tanks in battle, the destruction of racist targets at short distances, and why the enemy wants to cut the Pokrovsk-Kostiantynivka highway so much further in the ArmyInform material. Getting to the -hiding places- of our tanks is another quest. We leave in the morning, overcome broken asphalt and field roads, behind more or less -living- settlements. The closer to the front line, the more broken villages where almost no one lives. The extreme part of the path is on a wet and viscous field, the swamp hits the car with -shards-. Ahead is a plantation, where Polish PT-91 Twardy tanks are hidden. Cars in caponiers, well camouflaged, nearby we can see a field warehouse with ammunition. From the outside, it is almost impossible to understand what is here. Even in winter, among bare trees. Neither enemy UAVs nor other enemy intelligence can detect tanks. -You can't get here on foot, although, of course, you can,- says the pickup truck driver who accompanied us with a smile, -somehow the guys took more than two hours to get through this wet field, and then we spent half a day washing them from the swamp.- Let's meet, tank platoon commander Andriy. He is from Kharkiv Oblast. In 2004, he graduated from the military department of the Kharkiv Institute of Tank Troops. After the large-scale invasion, he was mobilized into the ZSU. He underwent retraining at the National Academy of Ground Forces in Lviv. -In Lviv, a group of tank officers was formed for training at a training center in Poland. There they learned to work on PT-91 tanks. We mastered the technique together with the crews. After 1.5 months of training in 2023, together with these tanks, they went to Ukraine to perform combat missions. First, the Zaporizhzhia direction, now here in the Pokrovska district we are -piling up- on the occupiers,- says Andriy. -In short, the PT-91 Twardy tank is a third-generation Polish main battle tank modeled after the Soviet T-72 tank. In fact, these two tanks do not differ in any way. A combat vehicle weighing approximately 45 tons. The RT-91 tank uses active armor developed by Polish ERAWA: these are 400 protective blocks with a coating that reduce the visibility of the combat vehicle in the infrared and radar ranges. There are additionally welded protective blocks that should protect against projectile fragments of various calibers. Also, additional armor is installed to preserve the lives of tank crews from the hits of anti-tank missile systems. Considering the aerial threat posed by enemy UAVs, an anti-cumulative -brazier structure- is attached on top. Regarding weapons. The caliber of the gun is 125 mm, the Kalashnikov tank machine gun is 7.62 mm. Plus there is a 12.7 mm anti-aircraft machine gun, but it is practically not used on the battlefield. After all, the machine gun itself was developed in the 60s of the last century to be used against helicopters. The rotorcraft in those days did not fly fast, they were clumsy, so the tank commander could safely climb onto the armor and strike at them. Now, in times of mass use by the enemy of small UAVs at high altitudes, this capability of the tank is not used at all. If we talk about FPV drones, then only the -barbecue- will help effectively. The tank is equipped with a smoke grenade launcher, in addition, there is a night vision device. The chassis works stably. The maximum that we managed, it seems, the mechanic squeezed 60 km/h out of the tank on a dirt road. The car can maneuver over difficult terrain and overcome water obstacles. Overcomes fords and swampy areas up to 1 meter. Of course, you need to choose roads wisely, because you can drive into a swamp and sit -on your stomach-. It is not easy to pull a multi-ton car out of there. Lately, work has been very dynamic in the Pokrovsky area. Depending on the combat tasks, we work both with direct fire and from closed firing positions. The targets are diverse: accumulation of manpower, enemy equipment, shelters, some kind of dugouts. Most often, we use direct strikes here. At the same time, the firing distance was different: a kilometer, 500 m, 300 m, even up to 200 meters to the enemy. As it usually happens. For example, the command was given to the car crew to -dismantle enemy shelters where small assault groups have gathered- or perhaps a situation where the enemy is trying to break through the defenses of our units with infantry. The target can be located in a settlement or in a forest plantation -in the gray zone-. A tank equipped with EW goes on a mission, it is accompanied by an air reconnaissance unit, the commander at the control point -monitors- the video of the battle through the UAV. The tank crew must have full situational awareness on the battlefield. Conventionally speaking, the tank reaches the forest plantation, the -fire- command goes and that's it - the target is destroyed. If a direct hit, a second strike is no longer necessary. Of course, a Polish tank can fire up to 6 shots per minute. Just the other day, during one day of combat work, only one tank crew engaged the enemy 3 times with -direct fire-. Then the tankers shot the enemy at a distance of up to 200 meters. Is there anything left of the shelter and the raschits themselves? Judging by radio intercepts, no, only frantic Russian screams and continuous -mother- could be heard. So you understand, our work is -high-adrenaline-. The tank crew completed the task, rolled back, then headed to the -sink-. From closed firing positions, the tank works already at considerable distances. It is 8, 9 or even 10 km. In Donetsk region, it is more necessary to destroy the Rashists with -direct fire-. This is due to the high intensity of combat operations and the use of enemy assault groups in the area of ​​responsibility of our unit. We destroy the enemy with filigree precision. There has never been a case where a detected target was not hit. There is no significant difference whether these are small infantry groups advancing in the -gray zone- or a single unit of enemy equipment. There are coordinates, targeting and boom! Somehow, from closed firing positions, it was possible to destroy a Russian tank and BMP, which were moving in a column of enemy heavy equipment. It was about 8 km to the enemy. The boys and I didn't know anything about it. The combatant reported, said: -Well done, you got it!-. In general, during the two years of the war, so much enemy equipment was -placed- that you can't remember everything. At first, they exterminated the Rashists in Zaporozhye in the Rabotine district, now near Pokrovsk. In combat conditions, it is very important to maintain the survivability of the crew. People's lives matter, machinery is replaceable. The enemy is also hunting our tankers. Once one of our Twardys was hit by an anti-tank guided missile. The car stopped and caught fire, but the boys got out. Of course, the car stayed there because it couldn't move on its own. The crew left that place on foot. Good thing enemy FPV drones weren't working then. It happened that enemy shells burst very close, shrapnel hit the car. Then the boys were simply concussed, but they completed the task. The task of the Russian occupying forces is to take control of the main routes in Donetsk region, through which our troops are supplied -at zero-. Therefore, the enemy is trying to cut off the main logistics route Pokrovsk-Kostyantynivka for the Defense Forces. The enemy attacks in this direction continuously. The tactics of the Rashists are unchanged - they advance in small assault groups, infiltrate a certain area in the -gray zone- and try to advance to our positions. In some places, mechanized equipment is also used to lift the slats. But at the stages of their movement, our aerial scouts -fix- the movement and the coordinates are transmitted to the fire attack.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/21/chy-vytrymuyut-polski-tanky-udary-ptrk-reportazh-armiyainform-z-donechchyny/	2025-01-20T20:44:55-08:00
On the finish line: the US has decided on a site for the assembly of aircraft that will replace the ...	According to site The Defense Post, FLRAA is an ongoing program designed to replace aging helicopters UH- 60 Black Hawk and AH-64 Apache for modernized convertible aircraft, ArmyInform notes. Located near the company's Air Defense Center in Beech Field, this facility will conduct all manufacturing work for the initiative and will be supported by Bell's manufacturing network in Texas. Additional fuselage development will be conducted at the firm's Advanced Composite Center in Fort Worth, and final assembly of the aircraft will be conducted in Amarillo. Operations at the Wichita hub are expected to begin -in the next few months,- the company said. . -As Bell prepares for the next phase of FLRAA engineering and manufacturing, we are committed to investing in advanced manufacturing to deliver exceptional performance at an affordable price for our customers.- - said Bell CEO and President Lisa Atherton. -Textron has a rich history with the state of Kansas as well as the city of Wichita, and we are proud to deepen that relationship with this new venture.- Bell Textron awarded the main development contract FLRAA systems for the US Army in December 2022, with the company's V-280 Valor selected as the program airframe. Platform components will be sourced from various partners: Safran for the aircraft's high-voltage generator, Eaton for hydraulics, GE Aerospace for avionics, and Astronics for power and distribution systems. At the same time, CAE will supply flight simulators for the appropriate training of crews under this program. In August, the U.S. Army authorized Bell Textron to proceed with the development of the V-280 prototype. The first production aircraft is due to arrive by 2030. So, how do its creators see the successor to the famous American helicopters UH-60 Black Hawk and AH-64 Apache? The Bell V-280 Valor is a multipurpose convertible designed for the transportation of people and cargo, as well as for special operations. According to the customer's technical task, it should have a load capacity at the level of modern army helicopters, but surpass them in terms of flight characteristics. The V-280 has a streamlined fuselage with a cross-section close to rectangular. The bow part is reserved for the pilots' cabin, and in the center is the cargo-passenger cabin. A high-mounted wing is attached to the fuselage, at the ends of which there are two motorized nacelles. The tail feathers are V-shaped. The total length of the convertible is 15.4 m, the wingspan is about 25 m. The two propellers are 10.7 m in diameter. The dry weight of the machine reaches 8.2 tons, and the maximum take-off weight is 14 tons. The V-280 is capable of carrying up to 4.5 tons of cargo both inside the cabin and on external suspension. The cabin is designed for 10-11 passengers. The Valor test sample was equipped with two General Electric T64-419 turboshaft engines. Serial equipment will be equipped with a pair of Rolls-Royce AE 1107F engines with a capacity of more than 6,000 hp. k.s. everyone This decision was made to increase the overall characteristics, as well as for partial unification with the V-22 Osprey convertibles. The V-280 screw motor group has an original design. The motor nacelle and the engine are fixed on the wing, and the nose part of the nacelle with the propeller sleeve can move in the vertical plane for different flight modes. The engine and propeller are connected through an original Bell-Textron gearbox that provides power transmission in all hub positions. The onboard radio-electronic equipment of the V-280 meets Pentagon standards and includes all necessary command and control instruments, as well as navigation and communication systems. BREO allows you to control the convertible in all modes and solve transport tasks. The Valor's maximum design speed exceeds 550 km/h. Cruiser - 520 km/h. The practical height limit is declared at the level of 1800 m code. The combat radius of the flight is 1-1.4 thousand. km, and the driving range is 3900 km. The main advantage of the V-280 is its high flight characteristics. According to such parameters, it surpasses any helicopter of the US Army Aviation. In comparison, the maximum speed of the UH-60 is only 295 km/h, and the maximum range is 2.2 thousand. km With the appearance of the V-280 Valor, US Army aviation will receive new capabilities. Aviation units, as before, will be able to transport people and cargo both in the rear and in combat zones. However, the speed of transportation will increase significantly. Convertibles will be able to transport the same cargo faster than helicopters or make more flights in the same time, increasing the volume of transportation. However, Valor is not the only project in the design -portfolio- of Bell Textron Inc. As reported ArmyInform, this American aircraft corporation in February this year presented its plans for the development of a high-speed the next-generation Sprint X-plane convertible. Convertoplan Bell V-280.

A British colony, you say? The enemy is once again trying to sell lies with Soviet dust	Well, it's worth figuring out who is the colony here, and who is chasing after his -methodics- again. Let's start with the main thing: such a -contract- does not exist. In June 2023, Ukraine and Great Britain signed a Memorandum of Partnership, which provides for cooperation in the defense, economic and political spheres. And this is a standard international practice that in no way makes one country a colony of another. But, of course, Russian propagandists decided to put on their rose-colored imperial glasses and see what is not there. Probably, for them the very word -partnership- sounds like something suspicious - because they are used to a hierarchy where someone always has to be the master. The history of Russia is a history of chronic fear of the freedom of others. They built an empire for centuries, where the whip and fear were the main tools of power. Therefore, it is difficult for them to understand how countries can be equal partners and not master and slave. In addition, Britain has long become a -horror- for Russian propaganda. There are -insidious Anglo-Saxons-, and -a prime minister who makes decisions in a sauna with Zelensky-, and even mentions that Britain supposedly -rules the whole world-. Probably, it is even more difficult for them to come to terms with the fact that Ukraine builds partnerships that bring real benefits, and not -gas deals- or -grain blockades-. If Russia is so fond of handing out labels, it should take a look at itself. Didn't Russia colonize nations for centuries? Didn't Moscow force Ukrainians, Belarusians, Georgians, Kazakhs and other nations to dance to its tune? And now, when Ukraine is finally breaking out of this toxic addiction, they are trying to portray us again as a disenfranchised colony. But unlike their imperial reality, our treaties with partners are based on mutual benefit and respect. Trying to convince the world that Ukraine has become a British colony looks like an anecdote from a series of -Putin fairy tales.- Because if Ukraine is a colony, then Russia, it turns out, is a -great democratic state.- But even that already sounds ridiculous. It's amazing how, in a world where there are so many facts, Russia still tries to sell cheap fakes. But you know, let them fantasize further. Meanwhile, we will build a future with those who know what freedom and partnership are, not colonialism and lies.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/21/brytanska-koloniya-kazhete-vorog-vkotre-namagayetsya-prodaty-brehnyu-z-radyanskym-pylom/	2025-01-20T20:09:14-08:00
- There were ten or more departures per day - military man Vadim saved about 100 wounded	The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. -I was working when the enemy surrounded Chernihiv. There were ten or more departures per day. Then the chairman did not think about how many people you brought,- Vadim noted. All these wounded servicemen were evacuated while the enemy was ravaging Chernihiv Oblast. He recalls one particular story that will forever remain in his memory. -In Chernihiv, the enemy fired at civilian infrastructure. One of the injured is a civilian man whose leg was torn off above the knee. Someone from the civilian or military applied a Soviet -Esmarch- tourniquet to him, and the man was taken to a military hospital&#8230; in the trunk of a civilian car,- Vadim recalls. When they opened the trunk, they saw that it was covered in blood. -They thought that the person was not alive. But I checked the pulse on the carotid artery - it was there,- the man said. He quickly took out a tourniquet from the first aid kit and put it on the wounded man. When he twisted the noose, the man screamed in pain. It was a sign that he was still fighting for his life. In the end, he was saved. As reported by ArmiyaInform, junior sergeant Bohdan with the call sign -White-, a pilot of the battalion of strike unmanned aircraft systems of the 38th Marine Corps Brigade, became a true symbol of accurate and merciless revenge on the occupiers. During his service, he sent about 250 Russian soldiers to hell. .	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/20/vyyizdiv-bulo-i-desyat-i-bilshe-za-den-vijskovyj-vadym-vryatuvav-blyzko-100-poranenyh/	2025-01-20T11:51:28-08:00

The men claimed they were on their way to visit relatives, and the son, who is a conscript, produced documents purporting to prove that his father was terminally ill and required constant care. However, the border guards discovered that the documents showed signs of forgery. They did not correspond to the official model and contained errors. Because of this, the Kyivan was refused to leave the border, and in his actions they see signs of a criminal offense under Art. 358 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine — -Forgery of documents or their use.- The State Border Service reminds of the futility of attempts to use forged documents when crossing the border. Thanks to modern inspection equipment and qualified personnel, border guards ensure reliable control and protection of the state border. ArmyInform reminds that it is better not to break the law or risk your life, but to use the aggregator of vacancies in the ZSU and recruiting centers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/20/nevylikovno-hvoryj-batko-ta-slozlyva-istoriya-na-kordoni-zatrymaly-kyyanyna-z-falshyvymy-dokumentamy/	2025-01-20T11:31:21-08:00
Millions in scrap metal: Defense forces defeated a massive Russian assault on Kurshchyna	The video of combat work was published on the page of the 47th separate mechanized brigade. It is noted that the scenario of the enemy in Kurshchyna does not change - the Russian troops again launch convoys of equipment and throw in manpower to dislodge the Defense Forces of Ukraine. -But our warriors continue to stand strong.

Oleg -Hera-: 10 years of war — from the defense of the Donetsk airport to the battles in Kurshchyna	The story of the fighter was published on January 20 on the brigade's page. -Ruins, smoke, constant sounds of explosions - Russian artillery, mortars, tanks were working on us. Sometimes it came to close combat. The enemy tried to destroy everything that was still intact. But we didn't give up,- Oleg recalls, talking about those difficult days. In 2014, after mobilization, Oleg returned from earning money abroad, where he worked as a welder at large infrastructure facilities. When the war began, he could not stay away and went to the Military Commissariat, where after a short training he was assigned to the 95th Airmobile Brigade, and later to the 90th Separate Airmobile Battalion. From the first days of his stay at the Donetsk airport, Oleg saw it destroyed and covered with smoke, as if from a picture of the apocalypse. Defense of the airport area became more and more difficult: lack of ammunition, food, water and constant cold. -The hardest thing was when we lost our brothers. It is the greatest pain when you realize that they no longer have a chance to survive,- shares the memories of -Hera-. Oleg's main task was to provide defense from the control tower, where the enemy repeatedly tried to break through. This point was key to controlling the airport. Then he not only led the defense, but also gave numerous commands, adjusting the fire of the mortar battery and destroying the enemy. Oleg does not forget his brothers who showed incredible courage during the defense of the airport. He mentions Ihor Branovytsky, who was captured while trying to help his seriously wounded comrades, and who was tortured for it. -He became a Hero of Ukraine posthumously,- says Oleg. Other heroes from DAP, such as Anatoly -Spartanets- Sviryd and Ruslan -Baghdad- Borovyk, had a great influence on Oleg. The -Spartan- was known for his courage and motivation for his brothers, and Ruslan, having released a photo book about the defense of DAP, became a symbol of struggle and resilience. -We have not surrendered the airport. Every meter of this territory cost the enemy dozens of their lives. We have shown that even in the most difficult conditions it is possible to remain invincible,- Oleg is confident. In the ten years that have passed since those events, Oleg has not stopped at what he has achieved. Despite the injury, disability and long years of rehabilitation after several operations, he returned to service. Today, he is the commander of a mortar battery unit and continues to destroy the enemy in the Kursk direction. -I want to say to those who are struggling right now: don't give up. We, the guys from DAP, held the defense when it seemed that we had no strength left. But we persevered. Your fortitude is your most powerful weapon,- adds the unit commander, talking about the continuous struggle for Ukraine. As reported by ArmiyaInform, Denys Gubernator, a former football player, after being wounded in the Donbass, decided to go into self-defense in order to return home and rest. After a year of rehabilitation and struggle with his own emotions, he realized that he could not leave his brothers at the front. Later he joined the -Charters- where his father serves.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/20/oleg-gera-10-rokiv-vijny-vid-zahystu-doneczkogo-aeroportu-do-boyiv-na-kurshhyni/	2025-01-20T10:37:15-08:00

The Ministry of Defense has updated the system for checking the quality of property for the Armed Fo...	About the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine reported. To control the quality of material property received by servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the Ministry of Defense uses an updated procedure for receiving it. According to the new algorithm, things that do not meet the requirements as a result of the inspection are returned to suppliers with reasoned remarks. Those, in their turn, should take into account the recommendations and return the material property already of appropriate quality. From December 2023, the Central Department of Quality Control began to change the system of acceptance of tangible property. When the new algorithm was just launched, between February and March 2024, 30-35% of products were returned to suppliers due to non-compliance. However, over the course of the year, thanks to the updated rules, the situation improved - and now this figure does not exceed 10%. -Providing the Armed Forces of Ukraine with quality property is not only a matter of standards, but also of trust in the state. The new approach to quality control creates transparent conditions that encourage suppliers to meet the highest standards. This is another step towards increasing the efficiency and fairness of the defense procurement system,- said Deputy Defense Minister of Ukraine Dmytro Klimenkov. In December 2023, the procedure for checking property samples in testing laboratories was resumed. This made it possible to carry out a study of all indicators of raw materials and tangible property materials supplied under concluded contracts for the needs of the Armed Forces, and to identify the possible use of low-quality materials by suppliers for the manufacture of goods. In addition, the Ministry of Defense entered into an agreement with the British State watch fund, which finances the work of an independent laboratory to conduct a re-audit in case of suspicion of biased test results. Also, the Central Department of Quality Control has changed the place of acceptance of the property - it is delivered to the supply base and checked directly at the warehouses to avoid possible substitution. Previously, the supplier could deliver tangible property directly to the units after inspection at the factory. -The main task of the Central Quality Control Department was to create such conditions that would centrally prevent the participation of companies supplying low-quality property in tenders. This is possible only thanks to the creation of an evidence base,- said the head of the department Ihor Leshchenko. For the objectivity of the conclusions, the inspection is now not carried out individually, but by a collegial decision and is recorded on video. In case of violations, the video serves as an evidence base for both the manufacturer and law enforcement agencies. In addition, the introduction of a new algorithm for accepting tangible property is designed to prevent the pressure of interested parties on the bodies of the Ministry of Defense. The process is established by regulations and orders of the Ministry of Defense. As reported by ArmyInform, the Ministry of will coordinate with the NATO Science and Technology Organization (NATO Science and Technology Organization — STO) research in the military field.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/20/minoborony-onovylo-systemu-perevirky-yakosti-rechovogo-majna-dlya-zbrojnyh-syl-ukrayiny/	2025-01-20T06:24:20-08:00

Wounds in the back and buttocks could have been fatal, but Vasyl managed to survive thanks to the quick help of his brothers.

They are his biggest motivation and reason not to give up. -If we do not defend the country, the enemy will come to our home. And we don't need that,- says Vasyl confidently. Today, -Virny- continues to serve in the rear support, helping the unit maintain combat capability and maintain morale. He remains faithful to his cause, his brothers and his native land.

Note that all these gang formations, which the Russians are trying to legalize under the guise of -Cossacks-, have nothing to do with the Cossack heritage.

Defense forces received more than 30 new models of small arms and grenade launchers in 2024	The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine informs about this. The list of codified samples includes pistols, machine guns, assault and sniper rifles produced by arms concerns of Germany, the Czech Republic, Belgium, the USA, etc. Among the samples of small arms approved for use are products of Ukrainian gunsmiths, in particular, a universal shotgun that can be used both against enemy infantry and against drones. -The level of the army's capabilities is assessed primarily by its arsenal of weapons. It is important not only the number of tanks, artillery systems, MLRS, but also what the infantry are armed with. New tools of war in the hands of our soldiers means more opportunities on the battlefield. Modern small arms and grenade launchers from the world's leading arms manufacturers and domestic gunsmiths allow our soldiers to shoot more accurately and hit the enemy at greater distances. Better characteristics of weapons, greater reliability are the factors on which both the results of combat missions and the lives of our soldiers depend,- said the First Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine, Lieutenant General Ivan Havryliuk.

Soldiers also highly appreciate the ergonomics and ease of use of Western-made assault rifles and machine guns. In addition, Western-made assault rifles use 5.56 x 45 mm NATO cartridges, which have a higher bullet energy than the Soviet 5.45 x 39 mm small arms ammunition. And therefore, Western weapons have an advantage in killing action. Compared to Soviet or Russian models, the products of European or American gunsmiths are also distinguished by a much higher culture of factory execution. All grenade launchers codified during 2024 have NATO calibers of 40 and 84 mm. Among them are products of European and American arms concerns.

-Collect the frame-: as an actor and soldier, Maksym Devizorov helps veterans return to life	The guest of ArmiyaInform was the well-known Ukrainian actor Maksym Devizorov, who spoke about what motivated him to join the Defense Forces, how his acting experience helped during his service, and why it is important in the realities of war to continue to enrich Ukrainian cultural heritage. —What prompted you to join the ranks of the Armed Forces? — I was prompted by the call of my heart. I had no idea what I could do for the country at such a moment. We watched for several days what was going on. Then I could no longer marinate in it&#8230; From the first days I went to the TCC, I was told several times that they only take those who had combat experience. Then, with my friends and my girlfriend, we left for Lviv to send the girls abroad. Already there I registered, and when they asked who was ready to go to war, I immediately agreed. He immediately got into the 103rd separate territorial defense brigade named after Andrii Sheptytskyi. From the moment the battalions were formed, when all the recruits were still in civilian clothes, no one knew what they could do or what they could be useful for. However, we started training quite quickly and left for Donetsk within a month. My first position was a grenade launcher driver, it was even somewhat funny, because I have a license, but I was not a very confident driver at that time, I lacked experience. I studied here and there until I got a secondment at TRO-media, I was in the autorotat. - What moments on the firing line are most etched in your memory? -The brightest moment was on the first night in Pokrovsk. Then for the first time I saw this glow that did not stop. Of course, the moments when I lost my brothers are the ones that will be with me for the rest of my life. The first time we lost our brother in Donetsk region, then in the Kupyan direction three more of ours were missing. —How did your acting experience help you during your service? —My acting experience helped me record my appeal to volunteers. When it was necessary to ask them for help or to thank them, they immediately called me. In addition, he somehow -made a noise- in the technical education classes. We were then told to imagine that we were injured and had to put a tourniquet on, so I paid for my entire salary. Screamed, writhed in pain, saw how the boys even began to -catch the pale man- a little. These are such moments of humor, because there is no way without it. —Tell us about your service at TRO-media? What projects are you working on? —When I got there, we were preparing for the big festival -War in the Lens-. There were a lot of different projects. We shoot videos for a mobilization campaign, for recruiting, in addition to this, analytical programs. Currently, my main line of work is -Veterans Theater-. My brothers and I started such an initiative, where soldiers and veterans can come, learn to write plays, share their experiences in the circle of those who understand them. I personally consider this project very valuable, because it is not only therapeutic, but also cool texts come out of our military. These plays win various dramaturgy competitions, and are taken by directors to be staged in academic theaters. For example, Alina Sarnatska's play, A Combat Medic, will be played in the Zankovetska Theater next season. Volodymyr Tuka's play is already being staged in Kherson. We want to scale our project so that in every city there is a cell and those who feel the need to work through their pain through creativity. — You recently returned to the stage of the Theater on the Left Bank in the play -You can't go, you can't stay.- What feelings arose after such a long pause? - I breathed a sigh of relief, because for a long time I had been -mourning- myself that I could not return yet. Only then. when the war ends After all, I understood that at any moment the commander's combat order could come and I would have to go. However, as long as there is an opportunity to be in Kyiv, my colleagues asked me to somehow play together. I could no longer refuse, I somehow silenced these doubts and fears and left. It was very cool when my colleagues from the theater greeted me so warmly and showed such humane attitude. That's when we wanted to combine the -Veterans Theater- and the Theater on the Left Bank. I have become such a link through which this can be realized. Now we have launched the -Livy ++- project, that is, on the stage of -Livy- we will play performances of both the -Veterans' Theater- and other projects related to veterans, their rehabilitation, where they will be both actors and playwrights. —How do you manage to combine shooting in films and service? —When the situation became more or less clear to me, I agreed during the vacation to shoot the TV series -Cure from the Past-. There, I play a military man who has been injured and has lost his memory. Now this project has already been released. If sometimes it can be realized in short episodes, then this is a great joy for me, because I continue my service. We have prepared the New Year's movie -Train on December 31-, there I also play a soldier, I have a small appearance on the screen, but my brothers say that they are waiting and plan to go see this movie on vacation. - Do you plan to return to acting on a permanent basis after the war? -After the end of the war, we will tell the story of this war both on stage and on the screen. If we can adapt our -Veterans Theater- project to the needs of society and the market, I would very much like to continue doing it. Personally, it happened to me here that I was able to write and stage a play. Now I am organizing screenings of the play -Military Mom-, this is what drives me and helped me return to the idea that there is still a chance for a normal life. There were times when my friends said that this project was a turning point for them too, so for me it is real honey for the soul. And it will be cool if after the war it will also be possible to do this. - What is the main goal of the -Veterans Theater-? -The main goal of the -Veterans Theater- -is to build a dialogue between the veteran and the civilian. There is a lot of unspoken pain when many are stopped by the thought that no one needs it. For example, it's easier for me to live my experiences inside, I don't need to talk to someone, but to reflect on it alone. Therefore, the goal of this project is to help, so to speak, to -put together a frame- for our military and veterans in a circle of like-minded people who also went through all the horrors of war. Any possible manifestation of creative realization is the right path to yourself, first of all, to your healing. Someone may have done it before and now need a resource to resume this activity, and someone just needs to try it to understand if this activity is suitable for a person. And we are looking for different ways how this can be implemented. It would seem like the -Veterans Theater-, but we also organized an elective course in clay modeling. Personally, I have never done this, but when I got a small plate, a little strange, but still mine, I brought it home, put it there, and my heart loved to look at this beauty. - In your opinion, is it important to develop Ukrainian theater and cinema during the war? -It is extremely important to develop our art even during the war. We have been consuming pro-Russian content for a very long time in an incredible amount and this -warm bath- that everything will be fine has played an evil joke on us. Since the survival of our nation is now at stake, culture is an integral element of preserving our identity and statehood. Because of this, it is necessary to find an opportunity for the Ukrainian word and thought to be heard everywhere, including abroad, because otherwise everything will be tragic. - How did the war affect your relationships with family and friends? -Someone -dropped out-, on the contrary, relationships strengthened in the family. I have two brothers who also serve, we see each other very rarely, but there is already that unbreakable bond that is supported by our beliefs, that is, it gives us even more bricks in a strong family foundation. With friends, it is easier for me to communicate with those with whom I have a common experience. For almost 3 years, large-scale companies have lost touch with many, but this is life and we constantly have new companies, new partnerships.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/20/zibraty-ramu-yak-aktor-ta-voyin-maksym-devizorov-dopomagaye-veteranam-povernutysya-do-zhyttya/	2025-01-19T21:15:55-08:00

Ukrainian soldiers of the 24th Separate Mechanized Brigade named after King Danylo, the 79th Separate Assault Taurian Brigade, and the 37th Separate Marine Brigade were honored at the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, who steadfastly restrained the onslaught of the overwhelming enemy forces.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/20/na-toreczkomu-napryamku-okupanty-19-raziv-shturmuvaly-pozycziyi-syl-oborony/	2025-01-19T21:06:19-08:00
Advanced -stabik- with a cat in Donetsk region: why -the package of the wounded- is most needed near...	The stabilization point of the 2nd International Defense Legion of Ukraine was shown to ArmiyaInform by the head of the medical service of the 2nd International Defense Legion of Ukraine, senior lieutenant Mykhailo with the call sign -Engels- and paramedic Oleksiy with the call sign -Donatello-. He owes his nickname -Engels- to one of the senior officers, to whom Michael's beard reminded him of the famous German philosopher. Since the beginning of the large-scale invasion, the soldier has gone from a soldier and a platoon combat medic to the head of the medical service of the 2nd International Defense Legion of Ukraine. On February 25, 2022, Mykhailo was mobilized as a soldier, but soon became a platoon combat medic. When it became known about his medical education, he graduated from the National Medical University named after O. AT. -Engels- from Bogomolets in Kyiv, a specialist in radiology, was appointed to the position of doctor of a medical center and promoted to the rank of officer. In the 2nd International Legion, the officer has been serving as the head of the medical service for a year and a half. The service had to be created from scratch, because when Mykhailo headed it, it had two drivers, two paramedics and no doctor. Therefore, the personnel issue had to be solved simultaneously with the establishment of material support. — Two paramedics, two drivers and zero doctors. And now we already have five doctors - a completely closed staff. To organize a medical service, first of all, people are needed. If there are people and people have the initiative, then everything will follow,- he says. Oleksiy -Donatello- adds that a lot depends on the head of the medical service, who is able to organize the work of the team and establish the necessary financial support almost -from scratch-. — I would say that an initiative nachmed is needed. At the moment when there was no Misha, there was almost nothing in the medical service either. The main thing the Legion could do then was try to engage with friendly organisms to help with the evacuation. There was one car, there were not enough crews, - stresses Oleksiy. He owes his nickname to the absence of several fingers on his hand, which makes his hand look like the limb of a ninja turtle from the famous series of comics and cartoons. With such a long-standing injury, Alexei could not serve, but he could not stand aside when his knowledge and skills were needed to save the lives of soldiers on the front lines. — It was still in my childhood, I already came to the war with an incomplete number of fingers. You may remember that my wife, who loves me very much, came up with the call sign. Who else would not have thought of it or dared, but she called it that, - jokes the doctor. Initially, the battalion medical service of the 2nd International Legion had to use the help and support of those military organizations to which the unit was attached, because their level of equipment and provision was much better. - Since we are a separate battalion, it is our -damned fate- to be assigned to someone forever. If we are attached to someone, it means we can use some resources of their organization, including medical services, Mykhailo explains. However, at present, thanks to the initiative of the commander and the staff of the battalion's medical service, the situation has changed, and already those military organizations to which the Legion is attached and interacts, have begun to use the established work of stabilization point 2 of the International Legion. - At the moment, the brigade to which we are assigned and all units have everything tied to this -stabic-. That is, now the brigade to which we are seconded works purely through us. And if you look at the map, then probably there is no such -stable- so close to the front anywhere else, - notes the head of the medical service. You can really get to -zero- from here in 10-15 minutes. However, such a quick evacuation of the wounded is possible only under ideal conditions, when the enemy shelling subsides and the activity of Russian drones in the air decreases. Then the injured person can be very quickly brought to the point, stabilize his condition and send him further to the hospital. - By the standards of how it could be and how it was - this is super close. In other subdivisions, it happens that it is necessary to drive an hour one way to the stabilization point. And this is taking into account that the front is not a straight line, and you still have to drive parallel along it to get to the positions, explains -Donatello-. Rapid delivery of the wounded simply from the positions to the stabilization point is one of the main advantages of the medical service of the 2nd International Legion. Medics emphasize that they managed to establish an evacuation mechanism at the grassroots level in such a way that everything can be done independently without the need to involve the resources of units. - We have specially equipped cars that can go there and pick up the wounded. We emphasize that we want to reduce the evacuation time. We are taking a risk, because now a lot of wounded cannot be evacuated from the positions when it is really necessary. The problem of overstretched tourniquets, tourniquet syndromes, and infected wounds has become acute. The advanced -stable point- allows you to avoid this, Mykhailo emphasizes. Shifting at the stabilization point is organized in three shifts, each of which works for three days. For the next three days, the members of the shift rest, after which they work in the battalion medical service for another three days. After that, back to the headquarters. — At the moment, we have three shifts of four people each: two doctors, a paramedic and a driver. If we have a wounded person, the driver and the paramedic go and pick him up from the position and bring him here. Next, two doctors stabilize the patient, and at this time the car is being prepared for further evacuation, says the head of the medical service. Previously, the shift was two-day shifts, but too frequent shifts could attract the attention of the enemy, so it was abandoned. There is a permanent -farm- on the -stabik- - a big black cat Boris, who does not go anywhere and helps take care of the premises and supports the wounded morally. Because sometimes, doctors joke, warming up, sipping on a -stick- of hot soup and petting a cat is no less important for patients than getting the necessary medical care. After all, the lightly wounded, who arrived from the positions, often did not have the opportunity to eat properly and warm up there. The medical service has several vehicles at its disposal - a bus, SUVs and even an American M113 armored personnel carrier, which, however, is currently under repair. All of them are necessary both for the evacuation of the wounded from the positions and for their subsequent delivery to the hospital. — What is good about wheeled machinery? The fact that it is easily repaired, has a better resource, is fast. But it is less passable. What is good -goose-? She's slower, but she's passable and has defense. However, at the same time, it attracts a lot of attention. Therefore, if we can drive quietly on an unarmored wheeled vehicle and without making a noise pick up the wounded person, this is the best option and we do it, -Engels- explains. — If we know that they are already waiting for us there in any case — it is necessary to do anything to pick up the wounded, and it is better to do it by riding a tracked vehicle, then we choose a tracked vehicle, -Donatello- adds. Soldiers can be sent from the headquarters to the hospital both in the transport of the medical service of the 2nd International Legion and in the vehicles of allies who are unable to evacuate the wounded from the front line, but can easily pick them up from the -stabik-. - Two doctors for one wounded person is quite enough. One works as an anesthesiologist, the other as a surgeon. -We are trying to provide help and stabilize the wounded as quickly as possible,- says -Engels-. Doctors can be joined at this time by a paramedic or a paramedic, who assist when working with a patient. Thus, three specialists can work with one wounded person at the same time. The main task at the headquarters is to stabilize the condition of the wounded so that he can get to the hospital normally. This journey can last from 30‒50 minutes to 1.5‒2 hours, and during this time nothing critical for the injured person's health should happen in the vehicle. — We do everything to ensure that the patient remains stable within an hour. This is our task. He gets to the hospital, and the full range of care is already provided there, which can be expanded, - explains the head of the medical service. In order to provide quality assistance, a stabilization point near the frontline must be properly equipped and provided with everything necessary. Several premises, of which at least one should be warm and electrified, access to water and electricity supply - if not from a fixed network, then at least from EcoFlow or a generator. — There should be a table on which to lay the wounded. There should be a basic set of consumables that are used. These are basic surgical items, basic anesthesia equipment, a ventilator, a laryngoscope, an oxygen concentrator, explains the head of the medical service Mykhailo. — This is a MARCH protocol at maximum speed. If with the MARCH protocol for a soldier, all this is put in one first-aid kit, then here it takes up a whole room. There is everything needed to stop the bleeding, everything to secure an airway, both non-surgical and surgical. Next, everything to restore blood circulation, including blood heaters, blood itself, solutions, Oleksiy tells and shows the equipment and consumables. Medics emphasize that deeper in the rear, literally an hour's drive from here, it is possible to set up a stab post with much greater capabilities, but the critical point is the time during which the wounded will be brought there. So it's much better to have a less equipped -stab- 15 minutes from the positions than a perfect one - an hour and a half. The most common are blast injuries and shrapnel injuries of the limbs, concussions and closed brain injuries are also common. Bullet wounds are much less common, but there is a lot of combat stress. — A year ago, most of our wounded were due to mortar attacks or RPGs, there were less frequent drops and AGS, now almost all injuries are the result of drops and FPV drone attacks. At the same time, the main fighters are injured when entering the position, because once they have reached the position, they are relatively safe there, but the way to enter the position is very difficult, says Oleksiy. Since the evacuation from the positions is carried out when there is power for it, not one but several wounded may arrive at the headquarters at the same time. Sometimes there can be even more than 10 - one or two severe, a few more moderate and most lightly wounded, with contusions or battle stress. — We sort them all, take them one by one and provide assistance. Up to ten at the same time are single cases. On average, 3-4 injured people arrive, one of them may be seriously injured - we provide him with assistance first. In parallel, we also work with others, depending on how dangerous their injuries are, says Mykhailo. A warehouse with consumables and other necessary things is organized in one of the premises of the stabilization point. Among the purely medical -consumers-, neatly folded civilian clothes - underpants, T-shirts, sweaters, sweatpants - attract attention. Nearby on the floor are several pairs of rubber slippers. — These are all clothes for the wounded. Almost all of them arrive in torn, wet, dirty clothes, covered in blood. To get to the wounds, we have to remove these clothes from them, cut them off. And our task is to prevent hypothermia, to warm patients - we need to dress them in something so that they are warm, dry and comfortable. Because if he puts all his wet clothes on himself again, he will never get warm, explains -Donatello-. Civilian clothing for the wounded is provided by volunteers to the medical service of the 2nd International Legion. They also hand over sets of adaptive clothing, which can be easily put on the injured person with the help of special Velcro fasteners. — I have already seen that there was a state initiative with the creation of the -Package of the Wounded-. I wonder who will be provided with them. Because if they will be provided directly in hospitals that are 30-40 kilometers from the front line, then, in my opinion, this is not super cool. It is necessary to provide the most advanced -stabiks-, where for the first time a person's clothes are cut off and something must be put on him immediately. This package, like all medical care, should be as close as possible to the front lines, Oleksiy emphasizes. — When a fighter enters the hospital, we immediately start to keep in touch with him. Since we have many foreigners in the Legion who are not familiar with the Ukrainian medical system, we have developed a guide for them in four languages ​​on what and how to do it, says the head of the medical service. A sign in four languages ​​- in Ukrainian, English, Spanish and Portuguese - should help an injured foreigner not to get confused and lost. By constantly maintaining contact with the medical service, he is guaranteed to receive all necessary medical care and statutory compensation for injuries. - As soon as the wounded leaves us for the hospital, we call the representative of his company - the foreman or chief sergeant. They pack his backpack with his things - documents, phone, clothes - and take them to him so that he has all the necessary things and can travel with them, says the medic. The most important thing, he emphasizes, is for the wounded to have a phone with him and to be in contact with the unit. Then it will be possible to prepare and send him all the necessary documentation, as well as visit the fighter during treatment and rehabilitation. — Representatives of the medical service and representatives of the Legion regularly visit the wounded. It is very important to have contact with them, because in hospitals in Ukraine, usually few people speak English, and even more so, almost no one speaks Spanish or Portuguese. We try to take care of our fighters at all stages, Mykhailo emphasizes.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/20/peredovyj-stabik-z-kotom-na-donechchyni-chomu-pakunok-poranenogo-najpotribnishyj-poblyzu-nulya/	2025-01-19T20:39:53-08:00
Modernization will increase lethality: the high-tech destroyer of the US Navy will be equipped with ...	As informs the portal of the US Naval Institute, the work carried out will allow -Zumwalt- to remain one of the most technologically advanced and deadly ships in the US Navy, ArmyInform reports. Work, which began last August and is expected to run through 2025, is underway at Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Mississippi. As reported by the press service of the US Navy, the ship will be equipped with Conventional Prompt Strike hypersonic systems. This retrofit involves replacing the original Advanced Gun System (AGS) with four large-caliber missile launchers, each carrying three hypersonic missiles, for a total salvo of 12 missiles. Experts at the defense site at Army Recognition said that Ingalls Shipbuilding's Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII) division played a significant role in the modernization of destroyers of the Zumwalt type. On August 29, 2023, a $154.8 million contract was awarded for the modernization of the USS Zumwalt (DDG 1000), including the integration of a conventional rapid strike weapon system (CPS). This project follows previous contracts, including $10.5 million in January 2023 for planned modernization of USS Zumwalt and USS Michael Monsoor (DDG 1001). HII was also involved in equipping Zumwalt-class destroyers with advanced Mk 57 vertical launch systems under a $74 million contract awarded in April 2024. Leveraging nearly $1 billion in infrastructure investments, HII continues to improve the combat capabilities and technological sophistication of these U.S. Navy stealth warships. The Conventional Operational Strike (CPS) program, originally called Rapid Global Strike, is designed to give the United States the ability to launch high-precision conventional strikes around the world within one hour. CPS uses technologies such as hypersonic gliders and surface, air and underwater missile platforms. Potential delivery systems include missiles similar to intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), hypersonic cruise missiles and kinetic weapons launched from orbit. A key objective is to consider rapid response and capability scenarios other than nuclear strikes. Test milestones include the flight of the Advanced Hypersonic Weapon in 2011, the Common Hypersonic Glide Body tested in 2020, and integration plans for Zumwalt destroyers in 2024. Design measures are aimed at distinguishing CPS from nuclear systems to reduce the risk of misinterpretation by adversaries. Numerous defense enterprises are participating in the CPS modernization program. Lockheed Martin is the prime contractor responsible for final assembly of the rocket, which takes place in Cortland, Alabama, integrating components manufactured by Northrop Grumman and Dynetics. Northrop Grumman is building the rocket boosters and the payload module, while Dynetics is building the hypersonic glider. Program funding and oversight is managed by the DDG-1000 Program Office. However, the cost of these systems is causing some concern in the US. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the production and maintenance of 300 hypersonic missiles over 20 years could cost nearly $18 billion, an average of $60 million per missile. Critics say the costs could exceed the value of many potential targets. Proponents object, insisting that hypersonic weapons extend operational range and accuracy beyond the reach of conventional systems, providing an advantage in contested environments. USS Zumwalt (DDG-1000) is a guided-missile destroyer and the flagship of her class, named after Admiral Elmo Zumwalt. She has a displacement of 14,564 tons, is 600 feet long and is powered by an integrated power system that generates 78 MW, giving her a speed of 33.5 knots. Initially, such vessels were equipped with two 155 mm advanced gun systems designed for long-range land-based projectiles, but the abolition of the use of land-based ammunition removed the guns from the armament arsenal, leading to a transition from land attacks to surface warfare. The vessel has 80 Mk 57 Peripheral Vertical Launch System cells for various missiles, a radar cross-section designed to reduce detection, and an automation-oriented design for a smaller crew. Entered into service in 2016, the Zumwalt has undergone a variety of modifications, including the planned replacement of Advanced Gun Systems with hypersonic missile launch systems during a modernization period beginning in 2023. Zumwalt-type destroyers were conceived in the United States under the DD-21 program, launched in the 1990s, as a 21st-century solution to naval fire support previously performed by battleships. The program aimed to develop multi-role warships with a focus on land attack, surface warfare, and reduced radar detection, consistent with mandates from the US Congress to increase naval firepower. Due to rising costs and changing military priorities, the program was transformed into the DD(X) initiative, and the number of ships planned for construction was reduced from 32 to 3. At an estimated total program cost of $22.5 billion, the Zumwalt class of destroyers represents the transition to smaller, more technologically integrated fleets, as well as an attempt to balance technological innovation with fiscal and operational problems and a global race for hypersonic supremacy. In fact, hypersonic capabilities are now considered necessary by the United States to maintain strategic parity with rivals such as Russia and China, which have made significant advances in this area. China tested its DF-ZF hypersonic glider between 2014 and 2016, which is reported to be in service by 2019, along with other hypersonic weapons such as the DF-27 and YJ-21. Russia is developing similar technologies, including the Avangard hypersonic weapon system, which went into mass production in 2018, and the Oreshnik, recently used against Ukraine. In turn, it is reported that, according to the planned schedule, the first full-scale deployment of the Zumwalt should take place in the last months of 2026 or at the beginning of 2027. This major event will take place under the control of the US 7th Fleet and the US Indo-Pacific Command, confirming their leadership in this strategic step.

Day of commemoration of defenders of Donetsk airport: the second birthday of combatant Alex	The Day of Honoring the Defenders of Donetsk Airport in the system of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine is celebrated annually on January 20. The defense of Donetsk airport is thousands of stories of bravery and exploits, front-line brotherhood and mutual aid. ArmiyaInform offers its readers today the memoirs of Doctor of Historical Sciences, senior lieutenant of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Yevhen Lunyak. He defended DAP as part of the 1st tank brigade. The commander of his brigade at that time was the legendary tank driver -Adam- - Yevhen Mezhevikin, Hero of Ukraine. Today, Yevhen Lunyak, who continues to defend Ukraine, has prepared for publication the book -Front stories from Donbas-, which will soon be published in one of the capital's publishing houses. This is a collection of real stories collected by the author during the tragic and at the same time heroic vicissitudes of the modern Russian-Ukrainian war since 2014. until today. Evgeny Lunyak is a direct participant in most of the described events. The book will also include these stories&#8230; On November 30, 2014, in the midst of heavy fighting for the Donetsk airport, the 5th company of the legendary -cyborg- tankers of the 1st Separate Guards Tank Brigade (as it was called at the time) was tasked with going to the airport to fire at separatist positions in the old terminal and provide support to our DAP defenders. The departure was planned by the forces of four tanks (1st and 93rd brigades) under the command of Kombat Adam, Kombat Alex, Sturman and Company Commander Vano. At that time, the 5th tank company of 40 people had already lost 4 soldiers killed (Volodymyr Kundenko, Stanislav Krivonos, Yuriy Kostyuchenko, Volodymyr Titarchuk), 1 missing (Yevgen Savenko), more than 10 people were wounded, contused and injured. . 3 tanks were lost in DAP, 5 more combat vehicles were seriously damaged. Alex and Vano's crews were almost all officers. The tankers were hunted. The road to the DAP was now strewn with mines and closely monitored by the separatists. Unfortunately for our tankers, snow dusted the ground - and now anti-tank mines were completely invisible. Adam's tank went first, followed by Alex's tank, then Navigator, and last was Vano. As it turned out, Adam's tank drove through a dangerous area on the approach to the DAP. Alex was less fortunate. His tank hit a mine at the edge of the left track. According to the recollections of Vano, whose tank was riding behind, the left part of the 40-ton front combat vehicle was thrown into the air more than a meter, after which the tank fell, losing the ability to move, the front part was completely damaged. The commander of the tank Alex and his crew survived, you can say that they were born in a shirt, but all three received injuries. It was decided to continue the operation with Adam's crew, joined by Sturman, and evacuate Alex's damaged tank and crew, which Sturman and then Vano successfully did with their men. Since then, Alex and his friends (San Sanich and Tolyan) have remembered the date of this departure, when they were lucky to survive. They said that this day was their second birthday. The circling of the Terminator at the airport in our locations around Donetsk was talked about a lot and retold as a military anecdote or an anecdote, without knowing for sure the actors and the circumstances of the event. It was one of the night trips to the airport from Pisyk. I was told about this episode of the fighting for the airport by its participants, including the Terminator himself. Adam, Rotny and Terminator tanks participated in that visit. The tank of the latter, which according to the front line tradition bore its own name -Barsik-, was supposed to remain at the beginning of the runway to provide cover for a large convoy that was supposed to deliver food, weapons and medicine to the defenders of the old and new terminals. It seems that the plan was quite simple and straightforward. However, for some reason, -Barsik- began to operate according to a different program, which led to a great commotion in the separatist locations, not least because of the unpredictability and incomprehensibility of this tank's actions. Of course, as soon as the convoy began to approach the airport, the fighters of -Novorossiya- prepared for a fire attack on the objects that were on the runway. Their fire increased and became more accurate, but this time could not seriously damage our armored vehicles. As the three tanks successfully completed their task of escorting the column and turned around to return to base, Terminator's terrified voice came over the walkie-talkie: -Guys, I'm lost! I can't see anything!- -Barsyk- began to maneuver here and there along the runway. He sometimes approached the positions of the separatists, then moved away from them. Of course, they opened fire with all available weapons, but, fortunately, they could not cause serious damage to either the tank or the crew. -Guys, where am I?- - the Terminator's confused voice continued to shout over the walkie-talkie. It seemed to him that his tank was being pushed from all sides, and he did not know at all where he should go to leave the airport. It became obvious that -Barsik- had lost its way and could become the prey of the enemy, and its crew would face a sad fate. Adam, whose tank had already left the airport, commanded: -Barsik-, look, now we will give a line of tracers from a machine gun. Go to the tracers!- However, as the Terminator himself recalled, he saw these bullets from different sides, because the separatists also fired them. So I didn't know where to go. The Terminator kept asking for directions. His tank drove chaotically down the runway. Rotny ordered his mechanic Slavik to turn on the headlight on the tank. At the same time, he himself opened the hatch to look around. It was very risky, and how to find a lost tank with a frightened crew otherwise, he simply had no idea. However, the Terminator never saw the light of the headlights flashing from Rotny's tank. Adam gave him another clue. These were the lights of Donetsk at night. He used to say: -Look where the city is lit up and drive in the opposite direction.- However, the Terminator said that he could not see the lights of this metropolis either. Apparently, he was already in despair. But then Rotny, whose tank was just leaving the runway, had a life-saving idea. He asked the Terminator over the walkie-talkie if he could see the moon in the sky. The Terminator opened the hatch and saw the moon, which he happily informed Rotno. -Let the moon look in your eyes! Go straight!- — a new order came from Rotny. At that moment, the Terminator said that a tank had just passed him. It became clear to Rotny that his tank had passed Barsyk, which was at the beginning of the runway, and therefore quite far from enemy positions. Rotny ordered Slavik to turn back, drive up to -Barsik- and turn on the headlights. Now the Terminator saw Company's tank and confidently followed it to the base. Such circling around the airport caused the anger of Slavik, who was ready to give the Terminator a hard time, who, due to his own indolence, put his comrades in danger. However, first of all, Rotny said that in battle everyone can get lost and no one is immune to it. Secondly, the driver-mechanic of -Barsyk- Seryoh assured that he himself -got through-, although he had already been to the airport many times, but this time he was confused and could not find his way around. In the end, the Terminator and his adventures began to be ridiculed, which caused him a great mental battle. Terminator even moved to live in the locations of fighters of another brigade and did not come to the table of his company, experiencing such a failure, which, thanks to fate, ended happily. It was in this state that I found the Terminator a few days later in the Sands, he was glad of my arrival and the fact that I always treated him with respect and often called him by his first name and patronymic. Later, by order of Rotny, the Terminator moved to Tonenko. I think it was absolutely the right decision, and no one made fun of him here, and he was able to show himself well in household affairs, especially those related to cooking. *** Today, bloody battles on a scale that Europe has not seen since the Second World War continue in Donetsk region. In 2015, DAP became the symbol of the defense of Donetsk region against the Russian invaders, and now legends are being born in other cities of Donetsk region, where Ukrainian defenders are showing examples of resilience and courage to the whole world.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/20/den-vshanuvannya-zahysnykiv-doneczkogo-aeroportu-drugyj-den-narodzhennya-kombata-aleksa/	2025-01-19T20:17:56-08:00
Lies to order: propaganda invented a GUR sniper who shoots pensioners near Pokrovsk	In pro-Russian telegram channels and mass media, a video began to be widely distributed, where a supposedly Ukrainian sniper from the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine shoots civilians - elderly people who were walking on the road near Pokrovsk. The -news- emphasizes that this is a -special intimidation tactic- by the Armed Forces. To enhance the effect, the video was accompanied by -expert- comments from people with zero combat experience, but with the high rank of couch analysts. And, of course, all this is served under the sauce: -Look what they're doing!- 1. There is no evidence of the authenticity of the video. The video was shot as if it were another computer game. The angles are strange, the shot is blurry, and the moment of the shot is cut. For some reason, the camera -accidentally- ends up exactly where it needs to be. This is the typical handwriting of Russian propagandists, who still think that blurred shots add drama. 2. No geolocation. There are no location links on the video. No characteristic landmarks, no signs, no names of settlements. It seems that -Pokrovsk- appeared in this story by chance, or because the map of Donetsk region in the Kremlin ends with two or three familiar cities. 3. The GUR does not engage in such operations. The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine is an elite unit that carries out strategic tasks, not contrived actions of intimidation against civilians. Such -plots- can look believable only in Russian TV series, where logic has long been buried. 4. The people in the video do not look like civilians. The appearance of the -victims- raises many questions. The clothes are unnaturally new, the posture is confident, and the movements are too coordinated for elderly people who are supposedly going to a war zone. Perhaps these are the same -actors- who portrayed Ukrainian refugees from infiltration camps? 5. Stage shooting. The shots do not have any signs of actual shooting. There is no reload sound or realistic recoil. But there is a suspicious smoke and the learned movements of the -sniper-, who looks more like an actor with military props. 1. Denigrate GUR. Ukrainian special forces have already become a symbol of efficiency and strength. Therefore, the enemy is trying to label them as -killers of civilians-. Although the Russians themselves are shelling peaceful cities and villages of Ukraine every day. 2. To justify their crimes. By creating such fakes, the Kremlin is trying to divert attention from the real crimes of the Russian army. Like, -and you look at what the Ukrainians are doing.- It's a classic trick to blame the victim for his own sins. 3. To sow panic among civilians. Russian propaganda is counting on the fact that such videos will cause fear and hatred among the residents of the frontline areas. They need to divide Ukrainians, to fuel distrust of the army. But with this quality of -cinema- it is unlikely to work. The fake about the -GUR sniper- near Pokrovsk is another attempt by Russian propaganda to denigrate Ukraine. But even in this they lacked imagination and skill. But another primitive film was released for the domestic consumer, who still believes that Ukrainians are fighting to -intimidate the Russians-. And we are just fighting for our land. And while the Russians are mounting their productions, the Armed Forces of Ukraine are really working. And, believe me, it is far from pensioners.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/20/brehnya-na-zamovlennya-rospropaganda-vygadala-snajpera-gur-shho-rozstrilyuye-pensioneriv-pid-pokrovskom/	2025-01-19T20:08:42-08:00

It is noted that the enemy is trying with all its might to displace Ukrainian fighters in Kurshchyna. Russian troops change their tactics often — from small enemy groups to convoys of equipment. -They were headed for the replenishment -to the vans- - but the FPV 47 -Magura- brigade sent them straight to hell. Destroyed APCs, tanks, BMPs, ATVs, KamAZs, holes and dugouts where the Russians were hiding - this is the result of the work of three FPV crews in three days in Kurshchyna,- defenders of Ukraine commented. As reported ArmyInform, aerial reconnaissance of the 3rd mechanized battalion of the 47th brigade noticed in time and destroyed a group of Russian soldiers who were preparing for an assault .	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/19/na-kurshhyni-vorozha-grupa-pryamuvala-dlya-pidkriplennya-rosiyan-ale-yiyi-likviduvaly-bijczi-magury/	2025-01-19T10:57:50-08:00

For example, so that it covers both wounded servicemen and their family members in hospitals, as well as medical personnel who work in a constant stressful environment,- she noted. In addition, the President and his wife got acquainted with the project of creating barrier-free routes in the cities of Ukraine -Movement without barriers-, which is being implemented by the Ministry of Community and Territorial Development as part of Olena Zelenska's initiative. During this year, barrier-free routes with convenient entrances and approaches, transport, stops, sidewalks, public places will gradually appear in 12 cities and towns: in Kyiv, Odesa, Dnipro, Zhytomyr, Kropyvnytskyi, Lviv, Rivne, Poltava, Vinnytsia, Slavutychi, Ternopil, Buchi and Opishny. -Of course, the state and communities here cannot do without the cooperation of all objects on these routes — and this includes, in particular, businesses that are or will be included in our -Business Without Barriers- community: retail chains, banks, other institutions are already changing towards users and, we hope, will help smaller businesses do the same,- the First Lady concluded.

The group is currently working in the 156th Separate Mechanized Brigade. The purpose of the work is to check the progress of the formation of the brigade and provide comprehensive assistance in matters of organization and preparation for combat operations. -Currently, the military unit has completed additional staffing and started basic general military training according to the updated program,- the statement said. At the same time, the selection of personnel for professional training is carried out. The supply of weapons and military equipment continues according to the plan.

The spokesman of the Navy said whether Ukraine is threatened by Russian missile carriers that are in...	About it in broadcast of the national telethon -Edyni Novyni- on Sunday, 19 January, Navy spokesman Dmytro Pletenchuk said. -All the same, they will take out something for the protection of the base point. And, of course, we are monitoring this situation. We see everything that is happening,- Dmytro Pletenchuk said. To a journalist's request to explain what the connection is between the fact that Russia is taking missile carriers to the Black Sea and the fact that the launches will actually take place, the spokesman for the Navy answered as follows: -Here you always have to look up, because they are usually used during mass strikes together with other weapons systems: strategic aviation, OTRK, sea carriers of cruise missiles. And it is also necessary to look at the number: if we see more than one unit in the sea, and we know that an attack from the air is being prepared, for example, then, accordingly, we can count on the fact that, most likely, ships will also be used,- he says Dmytro Pletenchuk. The presenter also drew attention to the fact that the daily reports also include Russian missile carriers that are in the Mediterranean Sea. Therefore, the spokesman of the Navy explained why these ships are recorded and whether there were launches from the Mediterranean Sea: -The danger must be considered as always present. And this water area is the closest to us, and the Azov-Black Sea region and the Mediterranean Sea are interconnected. Of course, no launches were made. It should not be forgotten that the airspace of NATO member countries is in the path of tracking these missiles. Regardless of how they decide to use these missiles, this space is the sovereign territory of these states and it can be considered an attack on these states. Therefore, as a rule, they do not dare to resort to such actions, but it is also necessary to take this into account, because it is a danger,'' Dmytro Pletenchuk emphasized. As ArmyInform wrote, ships of the Russians are not allowed to their only foreign naval base in Tartus, which is in Syria, and they are forced to drift in the Mediterranean Sea.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/19/rechnyk-vms-rozpoviv-chy-zagrozhuyut-ukrayini-rosijski-raketonosiyi-yaki-perebuvayut-v-seredzemnomu-mori/	2025-01-19T09:05:14-08:00

He told this in an interview with Andrii Tsaplienko. -First of all, there is my order, which prohibits the transfer of highly qualified personnel who have undergone training and who specialize in aircraft maintenance. These are specialists on whom funds have been spent, who have experience and who, in fact, there is no one to replace,- said the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces. According to him, at the same time, Ukraine needs personnel at the front. He emphasized that it is necessary to increase the number of people in mechanized brigades. -Unfortunately, mobilization possibilities do not cover this need. Therefore, we are taking measures to reduce our logistics component, supply component, maintenance component within reasonable limits. Staffs know this task. They did the math,- he noted. As reported by ArmyInform, a special commission was created in the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine to study the state of affairs regarding the transfer of their military personnel to other branches and types of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Earlier in the General Staff The Armed Forces denied rumors about the transfer of Air Force engineers to infantry units.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/19/oleksandr-syrskyj-prokomentuvav-perevedennya-fahivcziv-povitryanyh-syl-v-inshi-rody-ta-vydy-zsu/	2025-01-19T08:52:46-08:00
- They do not have the resources to throw everything with meat - how the tactics of the Russians in ...	Major Viktor Tregubov, the spokesman of the Khortytsia operational-strategic group of troops, stated this on January 19 on the air of -Suspilne Novosti-. -Even in the Toretsk direction, we observed how people were driven to the fortifications with mines in their hands so that they would throw them with their hands at the positions of the Ukrainians, but in the case of Pokrovsk, we see that they are no longer going head-to-head,- he said. According to the spokesman of the -Khortytsia- OSUV, due to a lack of personnel, the Russians are trying to enter the city from the western side. -They understand that now they no longer have the resources that would allow them to fill everything with meat, flood Pokrovsk with waves of meat, as they once flooded Mariupol. We have come to the moment when the Russians for the first time, maybe since the war, did not have enough meat to just throw people around, to make a mat of people, on which the next ones walk,- he explained. According to Viktor Tregubov, this means that the occupiers have certain problems with their own resource, which seemed inexhaustible to them. Now the troops of the Russian Federation are beginning to fight more thoughtfully and economically from the point of view of personnel. We will remind, on average, 50-60 clashes per day take place in the Pokrovsky direction. The enemy trying to bypass Pokrovsk from the western side to capture the city. As reported by ArmyInform, the Russian invaders use improvised watercraft to cross the Oskil River in the Kharkiv region and accumulate their forces there for further attacks.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/19/u-nyh-nemaye-togo-resursu-aby-zakydaty-use-myasom-yak-zminylas-taktyka-rosiyan-na-pokrovskomu-napryamku/	2025-01-19T08:27:53-08:00
Pictures with their own history: the exhibition project - Airport opened in Kyiv. 242-	These are 24 works by the artist, volunteer, military serviceman Oleg Drobotskyi with the nickname -Artist-. He died in the spring of 2023 during the fighting in the Bakhmut district. Oleg Drobotsky created his paintings based on the photos of the famous journalist and photographer, author of the book -Airport- Serhiy Loik. And these pictures already have their own story. Three of them survived the occupation in Kherson: there they were hidden by Ukrainian patriots, and after the liberation of the city, they were transferred to the author's homeland. Oleh Drobotsky's parents, Mr. Igor and Mrs. Olga, were present at the opening of the exhibition on the eve of the Day of Remembrance of DAP defenders. According to his father, the idea to create a series of paintings based on the motifs of Serhiy Loiko's photographs originated in the -Artist- nine years ago. Since then, the exhibition has been in 10 regions of Ukraine - when its author was still alive. Mr. Igor also recalled that his son was killed when the Russians launched massive artillery fire at the position of the 67th Brigade. -Do you know what the soldiers of this brigade were like?... They were simply deranged. Strong They may have been inspired by the feat of the cyborgs and defeated the enemy with their motivation alone. The cyborgs had a crazy motivation, which was later imitated by the defenders of Azovstal, Bakhmut and other cities, who steadfastly held the defense,- says Mr. Igor. Also at the opening were representatives of law enforcement and law enforcement agencies, in particular, Minister of Veterans Affairs Nataliya Kalmykova. -When we talk about military and patriotic education, all the words sound quite formal. But it is precisely in such places, when we come and have the opportunity to touch the work of those who protected, defended, created - this is the living realization of military-patriotic education. In 2014-2015, DAP became a symbol of indomitability. Many of those who were then 12-13 years old are now defending the country in the ranks of the Armed Forces. And I am sure that it was the feat of cyborgs that became an example for each of these young men, a seed that later grew into powerful patriotism. Patriotism cannot be legislated or somehow created - it can only be woven through art, personal example. And today, unfortunately, every family has an example of a defender nearby,- Nataliya Kalmykova said during her welcoming speech. And the deputy head of the Department of Humanitarian Support of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, Oleksiy Serhiyenko, drew attention to the tenacity of the Ukrainian struggle for independence: -Every day, our soldiers demonstrate heroism and courage. The most important thing that unites our soldiers for centuries is that we never tire of defending our land, our Ukraine. And not once during all the historical battles have we encroached on other lands. And the whole world and the aggressor understand this. But our strength is enough. Our soldiers prove this every day. Today, as we stand in this hall honoring the heroism of cyborgs, our warriors are fighting under the whistling of bullets, shells, in danger, dying. And it is our sacred duty to remember everyone. And we will take revenge for each of our dead, for the grief of each family,- Oleksiy Sergienko said. A small impromptu musical performance was performed by Taras Topolei, the frontman of the -Antitila- band, who also joined the ranks of the Defense Forces at the beginning of the large-scale invasion. -Today we honor those who set an example of what is right. An example of how it works. How it should be done,- said Taras Topolya. Project -Airport. 242- was initiated by Iryna Zubkova, the sister of the Hero of Ukraine -cyborg- Ivan Zubkov, the organizer and founder of the annual commemoration and honoring of fallen -cyborgs-. -My brother as a commander and officer did not betray his oath to the end, stayed with his guys until the last minute at the Donetsk airport and died with them.

Roman Kachur will head the Sahaidachny National Academy of Ground Forces: what is known about him	Hero of Ukraine Colonel Roman Kachur was previously the commander of the 55th separate artillery brigade -Zaporizka Sich-. In 2022, the correspondent of ArmiyaInform recorded an interview with him, we suggest that he be recalled on the occasion of his new appointment. artillery-. Such feedback should be earned. As the combrig says about himself, -my hobby has combined with my professional activity. There are such lucky ones, and I am one of them. I love artillery, I do it, I do everything for its development at my level. The 55th Brigade sets the pace for the development of the artillery of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. All of the commander's awards are a credit to his team. This is the reverse process. The commander forms, teaches the team, sets the vector of movement.- Roman Kachur was born in the Sumy region, after school he entered the Sumy Institute of Rocket Forces and Artillery named after Bohdan Khmelnytskyi, who graduated in 2005. Since childhood, he dreamed of doing real men's work. He is from a new generation of Ukrainian officers, from those who never served a single day in the Soviet army. From 2014 to March 2018, he performed combat tasks as the chief of artillery of the 81st separate air mobile brigade. From March 2018 to the present, he is the commander of the 55th separate artillery brigade -Zaporizka Sich-. He considers trained personnel, weapons and military equipment to be the key to success. He speaks briefly about the training of his subordinates: - Day and night, at any time of the year and in any weather, we prepared for the active phase of the war. The preparation paid off. The high morale of the trained combat personnel, who have fully mastered military work, their artillery systems and means of reconnaissance, became the key to success, stopping the enemy in all directions and defeating him. Artillery is a collective kind of troops, collective work, so here the question is not about the sergeant or the soldier, but about the collective, the calculation of the gun, the means of artillery reconnaissance - everything works in a complex. Yes, in our work we combine NATO complexes with still Soviet developments of the system, and we also use the latest Ukrainian developments. About half of the personnel of the brigade - with the experience of the first phase of the war, for the rest - the -hot phase- began now, in February 2022. On more than one occasion, the Zaporizhia Sich gunners were among the winners of the competition for the best artillery (mortar, mounted, self-propelled, rocket, anti-tank) battery of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Regarding the requirements for subordinates in war, the brigadier confidently answers: - The requirements for subordinates are simple: honesty, decency, constant improvement of their professional skills and level of physical training. Well, to keep the high rank of soldier of the 55th brigade. Our units carry out round-the-clock fire damage to the enemy who set foot on our land, destroy the opponent. I do not follow the enemy's behavior. To me they are all whole, their behavior doesn't matter, they will all be destroyed. Units of the 55th brigade do not experience problems from the enemy's artillery. It also speaks to our training. We dictate our conditions for artillery duels, and as a result, the enemy withdraws his forces to longer ranges. The enemy is afraid of us. Now there is such a tendency that we begin to seek him out, lure him in order to impress him. To my question: -What was the most difficult thing for you personally from February 24 to today?-, Roman Volodymyrovych emphasizes: -There is nothing difficult except for the combat losses of comrades.- We do our work qualitatively and we enjoy it. Currently, we have received weapons from Western partners. It is already in operation, used for its intended purpose. The soldiers of the brigade master it in a very short time, up to one day, it is realistic. The latest samples are effective, only positive reviews. These are the French CAESAR and the American M777. We hit all possible targets, without exception: from the front edge to deep positions. Constantly, in which order we detect and destroy, in non-stop mode. We give priority to the enemy's artillery - so that it does not interfere with the destruction of the infantry, the destruction of strongholds, areas of concentration. We logically build a sequence of fire damage and -break them into molecules.- I have no doubts about the power of our brigade and the final victory of Ukraine over Russia in this war. Once and for all.

The Armed Forces explained why the number of women willing to join the army has increased	told the recruiting representative of the 141st OMBR motorized infantry battalion Mykhailo Chuplak. -If at the beginning of the large-scale invasion, the question of attracting women to the service was hardly discussed because of the long lines of men, then the situation changed later. After the hype among men subsided, women began to apply for these positions. They can replace men in some positions and do it successfully. That is why the percentage of women in the army has increased over the last three years,- he noted. According to the representative, they try not to recruit women to combat positions in order to avoid risks. The exception is combat medics. -Women have a higher level of stress resistance, are not afraid of blood and are quicker to calm wounded soldiers. This makes them indispensable in this role,- he added. Women are most often recruited into support and security positions such as cooks, accountants and drivers. At the same time, there are cases when women apply for combat positions, such as stormtroopers, machine gunners or infantrymen.

A Russian agent in the judicial system: the story of the exposure of a traitorous lawyer	informs the Security Service of Ukraine about this. In Kyiv, counterintelligence and SBU investigators exposed a lawyer who worked for the military intelligence of the Russian Federation. He not only recruited new agents, but also defended exposed accomplices of the enemy in the courts. The investigation established that the lawyer was recruited by an employee of the Russian game Vitaly Naumov back in 2015 during a personal meeting on the territory of Russia. After the beginning of the full-scale invasion, the lawyer actively cooperated with the enemy: he transferred data about SBU employees who were engaged in the investigation of cases against traitors, copied procedural documents and handed them over to the Russian special services. The attacker also helped the occupiers find a fire adjuster in Ukraine, and after his exposure, acted as a lawyer in court. He received monetary rewards for his actions through anonymous transfers. SBU officers documented the lawyer's crimes and detained him in Kyiv. During the searches, the phone he used to communicate with Russian curators was seized. The detainee was notified of suspicion under the article on treason committed under martial law (parts 1, 2 of article 111 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine).

The Armed Forces of Ukraine disclosed the details of the first laparoscopic operation to remove a ki...	He told about this in interviewArmyInform. -Typically, a modern combat trauma is a large incision where the surgeon makes a laparotomy (cuts open, for example, the abdomen and operates on the internal organs) or a thoracotomy (cuts open the chest and operates). We have started to implement minimally invasive surgery - when not an incision is made, but a small puncture, and the surgeon, watching the situation through a video camera on the monitor, operates with micro-instruments,- Kostyantyn Humenyuk said. He explained that at that time military medics implemented minimally invasive surgery (laparoscopy, thoracoscopy) for modern combat trauma. -And we are pioneers in the world, because we were the first to do it in combat conditions. In May 2022, I was in one of the military hospitals in the eastern direction. Then he performed a laparoscopic nephrectomy - laparoscopically removed the kidney, which was destroyed, with bleeding,- continues the chief surgeon of the ZSU. He said that in the past, with such injuries, an incision would be made on the abdomen, and the surgeon would remove the kidney with his hands, tying the vessels, etc. -I managed to do it laparoscopically: only small punctures in the stomach - and I could see all the internal organs on the monitor. I found that kidney, stopped the bleeding, removed it and saved the fighter's life. And you know: the next day, the same injured person arrived with a destroyed kidney. Having experience behind him, he performed the second operation much faster, because he knew all the technical points. Such an operation was carried out for the first time in the world, because then I looked through all the professional literature - but I did not find any examples. Then I asked myself why I was not told in the academy or universities that it is possible to do this (smiles). Therefore, it is military surgeons of the Armed Forces of Ukraine who are pioneers in the implementation of modern operations.- According to Konstantin Gumenyuk, now in mobile hospitals, surgeons also perform many such surgical interventions for modern combat trauma, namely laparoscopic and thoracoscopic. To the journalist's clarification, what guided the surgeon during the first such operation in the world, the officer replied: -I then started this laparoscopic operation - I went in, saw a large hematoma. And I had a choice: go to open surgery or continue laparoscopically. I'm not a gambling person, and it was definitely not gambling, I always weigh everything very much and take into account all the risks&#8230; But I just told myself I could do it. And with God's help, everything worked out. The operation lasted almost an hour and a half. Now we work on such cases for up to an hour.- You can read the full text of the interview with the chief surgeon of the Armed Forces at this link.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/19/u-zsu-rozpovily-detali-pershoyi-v-ukrayini-laparoskopichnoyi-operacziyi-z-vydalennya-nyrky/	2025-01-19T01:31:16-08:00

About 12,000 members. I gave a speech in a very large hall, I spoke very briefly about our surgical capabilities and how we save our boys. The hall applauded.

And he added that he has many new acquaintances. In particular, partners from other countries were very supportive — Israel, for example. They talked about their own challenges and scope of work. -But when I told that we can have up to 100-150 operations per day on just one direction of the front, they looked at me with wide-open eyes. Yes, we operate on wounded people with light, medium, heavy, and extremely heavy injuries. But the fact itself. Do you understand?- - said the chief surgeon of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

In 60 seconds, even on three wheels: how -Mexican- and -Khohol- tamed the predator -Husky-	ArmyInform talked about how to safely deliver soldiers as close as possible to the positions on the battle line and take them out from there, what dangers await an armored vehicle during a mission and how to protect it from enemy damage, as well as a unique -three-wheeled- rescue from enemy fire. paratroopers The driver of the 46th separate airmobile brigade of the Airborne Assault Troops of the Armed Forces of Ukraine with the call sign -Mexicanets- and his navigator, the machine gunner -Khohol-. A native of Poltava region has been in the -Mexicanets- army for more than a year - he was mobilized in September 2023. His father has been fighting since the first days of the -wide scale-, so the man had a reprieve for a while, but he was in contact with the local TCC and regularly updated the data. When the mobilization rules changed - arrived after the first phone call. The fighter was trained in Britain as part of the Interflex international training mission. He is satisfied with the training, although, according to him, some of what was taught by foreign instructors is unlikely to be needed in modern warfare. — We were sent to Britain for training, taught by Australian instructors. They taught skillfully, presented information clearly - I liked it. Although they teach according to the method, there are things that we do not use. But they listened to how our war was going on, and adjusted to it, tried to change the training so that we needed it, -Mexicanets- recalls. After basic combined military training, 15 of the best fighters of the combined training company were selected to take sergeant courses. They also underwent an advanced program in Britain compared to the BZVP, which also included courses in military leadership. — They look at who learns how, how they absorb information, and out of 200 people leave 15 for advanced training. At the sergeant's courses, they are already in command of the unit, each one in turn takes command and organizes the execution of the combat mission, says the soldier. After returning to Ukraine, the -Mexican- was appointed commander of the unit, he participated in battles in the Maryinka region. After getting to the hospital due to a hernia, he turned to the command with a request to be transferred to the position of a driver, which, based on his many years of civilian experience as a truck driver, was granted. -Khohol- is also in the army for the second year. A professional athlete, he also did not have any military experience and became a fighter of the 46th Brigade after the BZVP and training as a signalman. However, from the very beginning, -Khohol- was eager for combat tasks, so he soon became a machine gunner. - The machine gun is a heavy weapon. But I like it hard. He hits the enemy. That's why I saw myself here. I have skills and enough strength, so I am more needed here. And in general, I didn't come here just to -pat-, but to normally poke at the orcs, says the fighter. Khokhla's unusual appearance for a Ukrainian may surprise, but he is a native Kyivan from Darnytsia and almost the same age as Ukrainian independence - he is 33 years old. The Ukrainian language and the state of Ukraine are native to him, and he speaks in such a way that it is absolutely impossible to suspect him of being a foreigner. — Someone needs to defend the state. Therefore, we stand and will stand until the end. It doesn't matter that they (Russians - ed.) are healthy, big, how many weapons they have, how many resources they have. We have the land given by God, the truth is behind us and we will go to the end, he confidently asserts. As a -Khohol- machine gunner fought in different directions, he had to work against the enemy both from stationary positions with a machine gun on a mount, and from standard weapons on armored combat vehicles. Sometimes it was necessary to hit the occupiers at a distance of only 100-150 meters, which is extremely close for the heavy -Browning-. Now the fighter is in the position of a gunner in the crew of the Husky armored car, where he plays the role of a navigator and a machine gunner. The performance of combat missions and the lives of fellow soldiers depend on his endurance, courage, speed and accuracy. Since the spring of 2024, the -Mexican- was a driver, driving the -Cossack-. Later, the fighters -tamed- the Husky tactical support armored combat vehicle and since then have been providing front-line logistics on this highly maneuverable and well-protected Ukrainian foreign-made armored personnel carrier. The task of the -Husky- crew is to bring the fighters to the landing point and take them out during the rotation, evacuate the wounded and dead, deliver ammunition, water, food and everything necessary to the soldiers in the positions. The International MXT-MV armored car in the Husky TSV modification is the best for these tasks. — We deliver personnel to the positions, evacuate the -three hundred-, transport BC — we perform all the tasks of supplying the front line on the -Husky-. The passability of the car is excellent - a powerful engine, four-wheel drive, high ground clearance with regulation. Where there is a funnel - she jumps through it - says the -Mexican-. Comparing -Husky- with -Cossack-, the driver praises BBM of foreign production. He says that the -Cossack- only has wheel inflation, while there is no clearance adjustment - the chassis is all on shock absorbers, so it is more difficult for him to overcome potholes. -More maneuverable, faster and more energetic,- says the fighter about Husky. Another advantage of a powerful military vehicle is its capacity. Usually, in addition to the crew from the driver and the second number, 3-5 paratroopers can be accommodated in the cabin. However, if necessary, -Husky- can take on board 6-7 infantrymen, and in extreme situations - even much more. — At most, such a car took away 24 people, and I personally picked up 10 people, -says the -Mexican-, showing the small, but sufficient body of the car to accommodate a considerable load. They try to transport fighters in it only in case of urgent evacuation, because it is the least protected part of the armored car. -Husky- has strong protection, its armor easily withstands not only automatic and machine gun fire and debris, but also close bursts of mortar mines and artillery shells. The armored capsule reliably saves the crew and the paratrooper in the event of hitting an anti-transport mine receives a concussion, but remains unharmed. — They came under artillery fire more than once. Armor is strong, saves lives. Both 120 and 152 caliber can withstand a close gap - protection from debris is reliable. Mines were also hit and the capsule survived, the entire crew was alive, only contused, says the driver. In order to protect against FPV drones, the armored vehicle was additionally equipped with grilles-screens. Welded or bolted at a distance of 15-20 cm from the -Husky- armor, they are, according to the military, quite helpful, as they disperse the cumulative jet, reducing its penetrating power. — Lattices help a lot, because the momentum is lost, there is dissipation, and it hits the main armor only partially. They often have to be welded and twisted, because the -barbecue- cannot withstand shaking on a bad road - something often falls off, says the -Mexican-. Another level of protection is electronic warfare equipment against enemy UAVs. Several of them can be installed in the car so that they work and send a signal to the enemy at once on several frequencies. — We install 3‒4 REBs at different frequencies to protect ourselves and the infantry. -We turn them on when approaching a dangerous zone where enemy drones can reach,- says the fighter. - Logistics is determined by time - everything is always done in a gray, dark way. The task takes about an hour to an hour and a half to complete. It usually takes 30-40 seconds to stop the car, so as not to wind up. In a minute at most, you have to turn around completely, unload or load - and go fast, says the -Mexican-. -Husky- has infrared headlights that allow you to illuminate the road without exposing the car with bright light. However, usually the driver also uses a night vision device, looking at it continuously for 30-40 minutes. During the stop, the driver never leaves his seat in the armored vehicle, and the process is organized by the second number of the crew, who can perform various roles as needed, from the navigator to the machine gunner. It is he who knows the fastest and best way to place fighters and cargo in the Husky. — I always have an assistant, number two, with me. It constantly monitors, exits and helps to load or unload. He makes sure that all the people are seated so that no one is forgotten. And while driving, he is a navigator - looks at -Kropyva-, tells where there is a turn so as not to pass, - explains the driver. — I drive up, immediately turn the car around. Even before the stop, the navigator opens the door and prepares to jump out to quickly help someone get in or out. He distributes people by car so that there is no crowding and all this does not take a long time, says the -Mexican-. When the car moves, the second number is the last to jump into it almost on the move, because every second of delay can be fatal. And in just one minute, a powerful engine allows you to accelerate a multi-ton armored car to a speed of about 100 km/h. A vehicle near the frontline is always a prime target for the enemy. To put it out of order and destroy it, the occupiers try to aim first at the driver, because his damage will immobilize the car and allow them to finish it off with subsequent blows. -They hit the driver's seat if they can,- says the -Mexican-. — It's scary, of course, but what to do? During the night, we have to make 2-3 trips to drop in and take out our fighters and provide them with everything they need. Apart from us, no one will do it. However, -Husky- is not only a means of delivery and a target for which the enemy hunts. From fleeing prey, the armored car turns into a formidable predator when necessary. Its standard weapon — a universal 12.7 mm Browning machine gun — allows you to destroy the enemy at a distance of up to two kilometers. - There may be a task to move to the -front- and work on the enemy. The enemy is detected from the drones, they give us the coordinates - and we -take off-, fly away. We can shoot right on the move, if necessary - the main thing is to listen to commands on the walkie-talkie, -Khohol- says about combat work. Evaluating the survivability of the armored vehicle, he recalls the case when, during the approach to the position, the -Husky- on three wheels confidently took the crew out of fire. Then the enemy managed to hit the right rear wheel of the armored car, but the armored car reached the safe zone even though it had to drive literally on the rim. — They were given the task of taking the group out. When he climbed to close the door and flew into our rear right FPV wheel. Of course we were stunned, we got a slight concussion. But they closed the door and moved on three wheels. -Husky- took it out! - -Khohol- recalls enthusiastically. Fighters treat Husky with love and respect - almost like a living member of their friendly fighting team. It is taken care of, carefully checked and, if necessary, repaired with high quality before each departure, because the lives of fellows and their own depend on the health of the cheerful predatory armored car.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/19/za-60-sekund-navit-na-troh-kolesah-yak-meksykanecz-i-hohol-pryruchyly-hyzhu-haski/	2025-01-18T20:55:12-08:00
-Hood- over PT-91 Twardy, streaming and the enemy at 200 meters: -Dagger- about the features of tank...	The commander of the tank company 117 of the separate heavy mechanized brigade, senior lieutenant Oleksiy with the call sign -Dagger-, told ArmyInform about training in Poland, the advantages and disadvantages of the PT-91 Twardy, streaming from reconnaissance drones and the evolution of defensive structures, as well as the specifics of the use of tanks in Zaporozhye and Donetsk region. Oleksiy is an economist by education - in June 2022, he graduated from the National University of Bioresources and Natural Resources of Ukraine in Kyiv, having obtained a bachelor's degree. At the military department of the university, the young man studied to be a tank driver - this determined his combat path after the start of a large-scale invasion. — On February 24, 2022, we were supposed to have the day of the military department. Then the classes were postponed, but later continued. They completed their studies at the university in June, at the military department in August, and took the oath at the same time. In October, he was given the rank of junior lieutenant, he says. In January 2023, Oleksiy was mobilized and sent to study at the National Academy of Land Forces named after Hetman Peter Sahaidachny in Lviv. — If there was no military department, it would be much more difficult. I took something useful from there, because it provides the minimum necessary base from which to start. True, at the department we studied the T-64 more, and already at the academy we also started to master the T-72, - Oleksiy assesses the importance of initial training at the military department. According to him, it was useful even to older brothers who graduated from the department 20-30 years ago, although, of course, it was more difficult for them to renew their knowledge than those who graduated from the military department at the university recently. In February 2023, the young officer went to Poland to master the PT-91 Twardy and train personnel. The Polish military, he emphasizes, received Ukrainian colleagues hospitably and organized extremely intensive and useful training. — The Poles received us very well. They have a nice military town, very high-quality security there. They did everything to make learning as comfortable and productive as possible, Oleksiy remembers with gratitude. There were no problems with mastering new equipment, because the PT-91 Twardy is basically a T-72 with a number of useful modifications. According to him, the dynamic protection of ERAWA showed itself well, but the thermal imagers of the old generation caused complaints. In addition, some of them did not work on a full-time basis. — Twardy, in fact, it is the same T-72, just slightly modified. The gun and undercarriage are the same, but there is a thermal imager, a thermal sight, a more powerful engine, some differences in the turret. In general, this is a high-quality combat vehicle, characterizes the military Polish modification of the T-72. The tanker is very satisfied with the Tvardoy engine - compared to the T-72, it is significantly more powerful, thanks to which the armored vehicle -runs- much faster and more energetically. The young officer began his military career in August 2023 in the Zaporizhzhia direction, immediately becoming a temporary acting company commander. Before that, during training, Oleksiy commanded a platoon - they improved the skills of crews, maintained equipment, and maintained combat capability. — The battalion commander decided that I was the most prepared of all the platoon commanders to become a company commander. At that time, the company was already participating in hostilities, and I joined them. I had to -merge- into a new direction, because at that time I had no experience of commanding tank units directly during hostilities, the officer recalls. The specificity of the fighting in the south was the use of tanks as ersatz artillery to fire at the enemy from closed positions, since the terrain and the combat situation did not allow direct contact with the enemy. — The terrain in the Zaporozhye direction was not too favorable for a direct direct battle between the tank and the enemy. Therefore, they mainly worked from closed firing positions. It was quite effective - the tank was 6-8 kilometers away from the target on the front edge and like artillery fired in a hinged trajectory, the tank operator explains. True, artillery systems, he believes, are more effective because they have a larger caliber and a longer range, but tanks are also an effective means of fire, the presence of which should not be neglected. -Otherwise, it would just sit idle,- notes the tanker operator. -Without streams, it would be ineffective- The key to successfully hitting a target when firing from closed positions, the officer calls adjustments with the help of video streams from drones. — The crew arrives at the location, orients the car, attaches to the location, to the landmark. I am at the command post and coordinate them with the help of streams from drones. We find the target, calculate the output data for them. They practice and we can already see from the stream where they hit, where we need to hit and correct and I am already correcting directly, - he explains the organization of the combat work of the tank crew. Mainly, the tankers had to work on identified clusters and shelters of enemy infantry, they rarely had to deal with artillery positions or armored vehicles. -Without currents, it would be ineffective and quite difficult,- emphasizes the tanker commander. They also performed combat tasks related to offensive actions, during which tanks hit the enemy with direct guidance. — The guys left, they worked very well. In offensive actions, we supported infantry with tank firepower. Unfortunately, things did not always go smoothly, we also had losses. But in most cases, everything worked out, the tasks were completed, the officer assures. In addition to the active use of reconnaissance drones, another important innovation of the combat work of tankers in the Zaporozhye region was the development and installation of protective anti-cumulative superstructures on tanks - lattice or mesh structures, which were popularly nicknamed -barbecues-. — At first, our tanks had only dynamic protection units and on-board anti-cumulative screens. Then, based on the experience of hostilities in the Zaporozhye region from the fall of 2023, from November to December, we started installing additional protective elements with the help of volunteers, Oleksiy says. They tried to develop them in such a way that they did not prevent the crew from occupying places in the tank and leaving it in case of damage. Another important requirement was to maintain the maneuverability of the combat vehicle and the movement of the turret. Later, in the fall of 2024, factory designs resembling a hood also appeared. It does not limit the movement of the tank tower and the ability of the crew to leave the armored vehicle, and its only drawback is that in dense forest it can be broken by tree branches. — This car now has a factory-made protective structure. It's pretty effective stuff. Already here we tested it - there was damage by an FPV drone to the aft part of the tank and it was this net, this -hood- that saved it, - says Oleksii approvingly of the protective structure. The officer has a very negative opinion about the -sheds- that the Russians build on their tanks, noting that they limit the maneuverability of the machine, make it impossible for the turret to rotate, block the view and prevent the rescue of the crew from the damaged armored vehicle. Comparing combat work in the Zaporizhzhia region and in Donetsk region, the officer notes that the topography of the area and the experience accumulated over the past year, both by the Defense Forces of Ukraine and by the enemy, are a very significant factor. — In Zaporizhzhia, these are plains, very large fields cut by forest strips, and few villages. There are more settlements in Donetsk region and there are significant differences in altitude, much greater than in Zaporizhzhia - 200 meters high, then 130, 160, - says Oleksiy. Also, here you often have to engage in direct combat with the enemy, hitting infantry and shelters with direct fire. It is necessary to fire not only from a cannon, but also from a machine gun, sometimes at very close distances of 200-300 meters. -Under Pokrovsk, literally during all combat sorties, the crews had to work on enemy infantry at a distance of 200‒300‒400 meters,- the officer says. It is this use of tanks that most noticeably distinguishes the situation in Donetsk from Zaporizhzhia, where tankers in most cases performed the role of ersatz artillery.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/19/kapyushon-nad-pt-91-twardy-stryming-ta-vorog-za-200-metriv-kyndzhal-pro-osoblyvosti-tankovyh-boyiv/	2025-01-18T20:41:02-08:00
Inconspicuous and missile dangerous: Great Britain took up the development of the newest marine dron...	As informs the UK Defense Journal portal, the search for manufacturer companies to participate in the development will begin on January 22 2025 during the first meeting within the framework of the COOKSON Challenge Session project in London. Partners from NATO countries, -Five Eyes- states (interstate intelligence alliance) and some other interested parties are invited to cooperate, ArmyInform notes. -If you have experience with boats and ships, launch systems, surface-to-surface weapons, anti-aircraft systems, marine navigation with GNSS protection, sensors, integrators, autonomous systems or line-of-sight communications, this session can help you to interest,- said the Ministry of Defense of the United Kingdom. As the experts of the defense site IKK Defense Express (DE) told, at this time not only indicative characteristics of the future development, but also the date when the first prototypes should be shown - at the beginning of 2026. -Moreover, it is not easy to talk about innovative, but also mass development, because the conditions of the project include, in particular, the fact that in 6 months of serial production, it is necessary to reach the pace of two or three unmanned attack boats per month,- emphasized experts from DE. According to their findings, the future unmanned missile boat should have a cruising speed of up to 40 knots, a maximum range of up to 800 nautical miles, and a minimum patrol duration of 72 hours. At the same time, the platform must carry at least two missiles with a launch range of 30 to 100 kilometers, and must be able to operate even in conditions of active enemy electronic warfare. The UK Defense Journal, in turn, noted that the COOKSON project involves the creation of a small fast assault ship equipped with a modular payload and capable of operating in difficult conditions. The Ministry of Defense of the United Kingdom, according to British reporters, described the technical tasks of the project as follows: -The COOKSON system consists of a small, fast, low-visibility craft with &gt;2 unilateral effectors mounted on it, including a suitable launch system and supporting equipment. The COOKSON system must be able to travel to the delivery point via ground lines of communication (GLOC) (and) must fit into a 40-foot container, ideally even a 20-foot container.- The craft should be designed to be reusable across multiple missions, with a modular payload that provides flexibility for different operational needs. Once deployed, the system will operate autonomously or semi-autonomously to deliver payloads, conduct missions and return to friendly coastlines for rearmament and maintenance. In addition, according to the conclusions of DE experts, the future unmanned attack boat of the COOKSON project should have means of self-defense against enemy air targets. Here we are talking about large-caliber machine guns, MANPADS or other means. Also, this platform should be compact enough for convenient delivery, and missiles for this boat should be produced in the amount of at least 20 units per month. At the same time, what is particularly interesting, COOKSON is intended, first of all, to destroy coastal objects, and only then, in the second place, to destroy surface enemy targets. The project will rely on British industry, with the involvement of international partners to accelerate production and meet the needs of potential users. Britain is developing high-speed strike unmanned missile boats.

propaganda produces a fake about -Nova Bucha- in Suja	According to the version of Russian propagandists, the Ukrainian military is apparently planning to carry out a mass massacre of civilians in Suja (Kursk region). This story was peppered with drone footage taken somewhere in a garbage dump and comments from anonymous -experts- with a sofa instead of a podium. 1. Don't forget Bucha. Apparently, Russian propaganda remembered Bucha, because they still itch. The world remembers who actually committed war crimes in a Ukrainian city. It was not possible to get rid of it, so now the enemy is trying to transfer everything to Ukraine. But, as they say, a thief's hat is on fire. 2. Suja is a border town, but not a training ground for fakes. If the Russian army is afraid of guerrilla movements and drone strikes, this does not mean that the Ukrainian military plans to act like Russian soldiers. War in the 21st century looks different than in the textbooks of Soviet propaganda. But the Russians stubbornly live in 1943. 3. A fake without evidence is a classic of the genre. There is no evidence other than hysterical headlines in the Kremlin-controlled media. No satellite images, no intercepted conversations, no videos - just fantasy. Unless they will add some old photo and sign -here they are, Ukrainian fascists and what they are doing in Suja-. Because it is designed for fear and mass hysteria. Frightening Russians with mythical Ukrainian -punishers- is a traditional song of the Kremlin. But no matter how many times it is not twisted, words will not get better. 1. To justify the shelling of Ukraine. They said, you see, we are bombing Ukraine because they are preparing a -new Bucha- on our land. An old method of justifying aggression. 2. Strengthen mobilization. It is necessary to explain to the Russians why their sons continue to be dragged into the meat grinder. To avoid unnecessary questions, they are shown horror stories about -bloody dills-. 3. Distract from internal problems. When things are falling apart in the country, the best way is to invent an external threat. Russian propaganda copes with this task -perfectly-. 1. To ironize. Propaganda -throwbacks- do not withstand any criticism, so it is best to break them with sarcasm. 2. Don't behave. If someone seriously starts discussing the -genocide in Suja-, it's worth just calmly laying out the facts. 3. Spread the truth. The more people see the real facts, the less chance there is for fakes. The truth is on our side. -Nova Bucha- in Suja is another cheap thriller from Russian TV. But this script fails even before the first scene. Ukraine is fighting for its land, not for the fictional stories in the minds of propagandists. And if someone in the Kremlin is really afraid for their civilians, they better remember who started this war and why.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/19/rospropaganda-produkuye-fejk-pro-novu-buchu-v-sudzhi/	2025-01-18T20:01:15-08:00
The president insists that Russian ballistic missiles must be destroyed on its territory	He announced this during his evening video address on Saturday, January 18. According to the head of state, it is currently not enough to counter Russian missile attacks on the civilian infrastructure of ground-based air defense systems. -The blows were, in particular, ballistic. We continue to work for more air defense systems for Ukraine - modern systems that can shoot down such ballistics. And we are working to ensure that our Ukrainian army can actively act against enemy launchers, in particular, on Russian territory. I am grateful to all partners who support us in this,- the President emphasized, adding that -our long-range capability is one of the key tools for protecting life.- As reported by ArmyInform, Three civilians were victims of the Russian missile attack on January 18 in Kyiv, and three more were injured.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/18/prezydent-napolyagaye-shho-balistyku-rf-neobhidno-znyshhuvaty-shhe-na-yiyi-terytoriyi/	2025-01-18T10:57:11-08:00

A Ukrainian company helped the Russian Federation build nuclear laboratories — SBU	This was reported by the Security Service of Ukraine on Saturday, January 18. According to the investigation, already after the start of the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation, representatives of the specified company, which specializes in building materials, delivered a large-scale batch of ready-made profiles made of stainless steel to the aggressor country. -The occupiers used Ukrainian metal products to equip the office premises of the Russian Institute of Nuclear Research. -At its base, the Russians are developing projects of new types of missile weapons with a nuclear charge,- the report says. As noted, in order to hide international deliveries, the organizers of the outfit first sent the goods to a controlled company in the Middle East, and from there they re-exported them to Russian customers, although the financial statements of both companies were kept by the chief accountant of the Ukrainian enterprise. -During searches of the addresses of the company and the residences of the persons involved, mobile phones, computer equipment and documentation with evidence of criminal activity in favor of the Russian Federation were found. The owner of the manufacturing enterprise and three of his subordinates were notified of the suspicion under part. 1 Art. 111-2 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (assistance to the aggressor state). The perpetrators face up to 12 years in prison with confiscation of property,- the special service added. As reported by ArmyInform, SBU detained an engineer of the capital metro, who created an agent network that guided enemy missiles in Kyiv and Kharkiv.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/18/ukrayinska-kompaniya-dopomagala-rf-buduvaty-yaderni-laboratoriyi-sbu/	2025-01-18T10:26:15-08:00

The occupiers use ammunition equipped with poisonous substances	This was reported on Saturday, January 18, by the Support Forces Command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. They said that, in addition to conventional means of fire damage, the enemy uses munitions equipped with chemical substances, such as K-51 and RG-VO, which are means of fighting riots and are prohibited for use in the conduct of hostilities. In addition, among them there are dangerous compounds of an unknown type. -Since February 2023, the use of dangerous chemicals by Russians has become systemic. the Russian Federation grossly violates the rules of warfare, ignores the norms and obligations of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction,- the message reads. In particular, in December 2024, 434 cases of the use of such munitions were recorded by the units of radiation, chemical, and biological intelligence of the Support Forces of the Armed Forces. In general, since February 2023, 5,389 cases of the enemy's use of dangerous chemicals have been recorded.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/18/okupanty-zastosovuyut-boyeprypasy-sporyadzheni-otrujnymy-rechovynamy/	2025-01-18T09:16:37-08:00

About this on Saturday, January 18, reported in the department's press service. -Representatives of scientific institutions, military higher education institutions, as well as military units and institutions from the structure of the Ministry of Defense will be involved in this work,- Deputy Minister of Defense Brigadier General of Justice Serhiy Melnyk said, adding that Ukrainian specialists will form a joint program of activities and participate in meetings of the NATO Science and Technology Council (STB). According to Volodymyr Mirnenko, director of the Department of Military Education and Science of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, such cooperation is an additional opportunity to multiply our efforts in the field of security and defense. -The experience of Ukrainian scientists in combination with the modern innovative approaches of specialists of NATO member states should give a high-quality result for mutual use in the course of hostilities,- he explained. At the same time, we are talking not only about the military-technical and technological components, but also about the development of military science in general as a system-forming field of knowledge about laws, the nature of war, the preparation of the armed forces and the state for war, the forms and methods of its conduct. STO is a subsidiary body of NATO, created to meet the scientific and technical needs of the Alliance and partner countries through the exchange of scientific knowledge, technological developments and innovations.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/18/minoborony-ukrayiny-razom-z-nato-zajmatymetsya-naukovymy-doslidzhennyamy-u-vijskovij-sferi/	2025-01-18T08:59:08-08:00

Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine, Brigadier General of Justice Serhiy Melnyk told about this. -Basic military training will be included in all higher education institutions and will be implemented for our students, citizens of Ukraine, in the second year. Everyone — both men and women — falls under the study of basic combined military training. Therefore, both men and women must complete the theoretical course of basic military training. But the practical course of basic military training is mandatory only for our men,- he said, adding that if female students want to undergo the practical part of the BZVP, they must first register with the TCC. At the same time, the deputy head of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine reminded that the law does not provide for the mobilization of Ukrainian citizens aged 18 to 25. According to him, one of the main tasks at the moment is the training of future instructors. -To teach them all the comprehensive standards for methodical teaching of basic military training to our students. After that, we want to bring veterans who are unfit for military service into it. These are military personnel with combat experience. Engage so they can tell and teach our students right. And to introduce this course in all higher educational institutions,- Serhii Melnyk explained. As for the course itself, as the brigadier general emphasized, it involves -a lot of military training disciplines.- -For example, there, first of all, there will be psychological training, intelligence training, tactical training, fire training, rhbz training, combat use and survival of soldiers - there are quite a lot of complex subjects that we should teach our students and citizens of Ukraine. I also want to emphasize that it is mandatory for everyone and if students cannot pass the exam for some reasons, for example, if they pass it with an unsatisfactory grade, if they refuse to take the military oath, they will not be able to study at higher educational institutions in the future institutions,- the deputy minister noted. As reported by ArmyInform, for the preparation of each recruit during the BZVP more than 180 thousand hryvnias will be allocated.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/18/u-minoborony-ukrayiny-rozpovily-pro-kurs-bzvp-dlya-studentiv-yakyj-startuye-z-veresnya/	2025-01-18T08:43:40-08:00
The Defense Forces explained why the enemy attacked Borova and whether he had any success	The deputy commander of the 3rd of a separate assault brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Rodion Kudryashov. The officer explained that since Borova is a logistics hub of the Defense Forces, the enemy wants to capture it, which will make it impossible for the Armed Forces to have a presence on this side of the Oskil River. -Therefore, there is a fierce struggle for this village. All summer and autumn, the enemy tried to attack the front, that is, the line of responsibility of the 3rd OSHBr. There was no success. And now he began to move along the flanks, where in some places he went to the river bank. And from those directions it will try to move to the settlement of Borov,- said Rodion Kudryashov. According to him, this week the enemy resorted to numerous assaults, even in spite of unfavorable weather conditions. -Used a lot of equipment and a lot of infantry, all accompanied by a lot of artillery strikes. The enemy tried to break through the front edge, tried to advance again towards the settlement of Borov. During this week, the enemy had no success and suffered heavy losses. And the 3rd OSHBr replenished the exchange fund,- the Ukrainian defender noted. He also added that at the moment, in the Kharkiv direction, there is at least one enemy division opposite only one battalion of the 3rd OShbr. -This is three times the size of the brigade. Therefore, the enemy has an advantage not only in the number of infantry, but also in the number of weapons. And even with such superior forces, the enemy did not achieve any success this week, both along the line of the 3rd OSHBr and along the line of adjacent brigades,- the officer summarized. As reported by ArmyInform, trying to cross the Oskil's Russian troops use improvised watercraft.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/18/u-sylah-oborony-poyasnyly-chomu-vorog-pre-na-borovu-ta-chy-ye-u-nogo-uspihy/	2025-01-18T07:52:53-08:00

The 28th brigade explained that the occupiers are sending their soldiers without weapons towards our positions. The main goal of the -camel- is to run as close as possible to the positions of the Defense Forces and leave ammunition, mines or radios there, so that the assault groups can use them later. The Russian runner from the video was destroyed. In the Vovchansk direction, during an attempted Russian assault, a Ukrainian fighter captured six Russians. Hunters from 71 OEBR recorded the explanation of one of them on video. According to the occupier, his group jumped into the basement of the building and tried to knock out our soldier from there, but after they used up all the ammunition, our soldier captured a whole group of Russians. Azovets shot down an enemy FPV drone with the second shot. Soldiers of the reconnaissance platoon of the -Azov- brigade came under the crosshairs of an enemy attack drone while performing a combat mission. A scout with the call sign Fish managed to destroy the drone during a strike approach. None of his siblings were injured. These and other topics are discussed by our presenters - junior sergeant Volodymyr Kravchuk and lieutenant Yevhen Nazarenko.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/18/verblyud-nova-taktyka-rosiyan-znyshhennya-kolon-na-kurshhyni-6-polonenyh-strim-z-pryfrontovogo-mista/	2025-01-18T07:34:01-08:00
The metro engineer of the capital created an agent network that aimed enemy missiles at Kyiv and Kha...	This was reported by the Security Service of Ukraine on Saturday, January 18. As noted, the head of the enemy cell turned out to be an active engineer of the Kyiv Metropoliten utility company. According to the case materials, he was recruited back in 2015 in Moscow during a personal meeting with an FSB staff member. &nbsp; -A recruited agent was put on 'standby' and 'uncanned' after the start of a full-scale war via instant messaging. He was immediately instructed to create an agent network. The task of this group was to collect information about the locations and routes of movement of Ukrainian troops and their cargo, as well as launch missile and drone attacks on them,- the report says. At the same time, the perpetrator involved his own brother and mother, as well as several other acquaintances, in his agent activities. -A native of Kharkiv, who left the military unit after mobilization, and before that worked for Ukrzaliznytsia for 10 years, and is a driver of international road transport. The task of the deserter was to monitor the movement of military echelons of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and the driver, under the guise of work trips, to merge the coordinates of checkpoints and units of the Defense Forces,- the SBU said. Having received from his henchmen the necessary coordinates for the assignment of strikes, the person involved summarized them and handed them over to his Russian curator. -The resident personally launched missile strikes on Kyiv, which is confirmed by his intercepted conversations. SBU employees documented the crimes of the Russian agency and detained its resident in Kyiv. At the same time, a deserter agent was detained in Kharkiv. During the searches, mobile phones with evidence of work in the Russian Federation were seized from the suspects. Firearms were also found, which were sent for examination,- the intelligence service added. Detainees were notified of suspicion for h. 2 Art. 28, ch. 2 Art. 111 (treason committed by a group of persons under martial law in accordance with a previous conspiracy) and ch. 1, 3 st. 436-2 (justification, recognition as legitimate, denial of armed aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, glorification of its participants). The issue of reporting suspicion to a third member of the group - a driver of international flights who is hiding outside the border - is being resolved. The rest face from 8 years of imprisonment to life imprisonment with confiscation of property.

-Limited suitability- must re-pass the VLK before February 4 - clarification of the Ministry of Defe...	About this reported on January 18 by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. The Ministry of Defense explains why it is necessary to undergo a medical examination and what the consequences may be in case of violation of the requirements of the law. On May 4, 2024, the Law of Ukraine dated March 21, 2024 No. 3621-IX -On Amendments to Certain Laws of Ukraine Regarding Ensuring the Rights of Servicemen and Policemen to Social Protection- (hereinafter - Law No. 3621). This document excludes from the provisions of the legislation on military duty and military service such definitions as -limited fitness for military service- and -unfit for military service in peacetime, limited fitness in wartime.- Order of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine dated August 14, 2008 No. 402 -On approval of the Regulation on military medical examination in the Armed Forces of Ukraine-, which defines the procedure for conducting military medical examination military medical commissions (hereinafter - VLK). During the medical examination of servicemen and other persons (including conscripts and conscripts) of the VLK, resolutions of the following general content are adopted: =-_blank- rel=-nofollow- href=-https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/3621-20#Text->By law No. 3621, i.e. up to and including February 4, 2025. What is the procedure for conscripts to change their status? Territorial recruitment and social support centers at the place of residence of conscripted citizens of Ukraine organize a medical examination and clarify information. According to the Military Accounting Rules (appendix 2 of the Procedure, approved by the resolution of the CMU dated 30.12.2022 No. 1487) conscripts, conscripts and reservists must arrive at the TCC within the specified time in mobilization orders, summonses, orders, respectively, for military registration and determination of appointment for a special period, registration of military registration documents, passing a medical examination, referral to training for the purpose of obtaining or improving a military accounting specialty, conscription for military service or training (verification) and special meetings of conscripts and reservists. At this stage, passing a military medical examination is possible only with a referral issued by the TCC. In order to issue a referral, the TCC must summon the conscript with a summons. If there was no summons, then the conscript can personally apply to the TCC to receive a referral to the VLK. We also note that according to clause 3.8 of chapter 3 of the section II of Order No. 402 Resolution of the VLK of district, city TCCs and SPs on the degree of suitability of a conscript for military service under conscription during mobilization, for a special period and/or under the period of validity of the legal regime of martial law is valid for one year from the day of the end of the medical examination. Therefore, conscripts need to update their medical information annually. Failure to comply with the rule on timely passing of military training is a violation of the rules of military registration or legislation on defense, mobilization training and mobilization. According to Code of Ukraine on Administrative Offenses (KupAP) for this, a fine in the amount of one thousand to one thousand five hundred non-taxable minimum incomes of citizens - or from 17,000 to 25,500 hryvnias. If a person with the status of -Limited suitability- does not pass a re-examination by February 5, the electronic military registration document in Reserve+ will remain unchanged. However, if the TCC sends a summons to pass the VLC, and the conscript does not fulfill the terms of this summons, the -wanted- status will be displayed in Reserve+. The Ministry of Defense is implementing a reform of the VLK. At the first stage of its implementation, it will be possible to send a request for a referral to the VLC through the Reserve+ mobile application, receive a notification with details and go to the health care facility indicated in the referral, without the need to visit the TCC. This stage should be implemented in January. As reported by ArmyInform, the Ministry of Defense implements systemic reform of the military medical examination (MME) in the Armed Forces. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/18/obmezheno-prydatni-mayut-povtorno-projty-vlk-do-4-lyutogo-rozyasnennya-minoborony/	2025-01-18T06:31:38-08:00
The occupiers are trying to cross the Oskil on improvised watercraft — Viktor Tregubov	This was announced by the speaker of the Khortytsya operational and strategic group of troops on the air of the telethon. - Major Viktor Tregubov, answering the question whether the occupiers manage to gain a foothold on the shore controlled by the Armed Forces. -The Russians constantly, especially at night, try to cross the Oskil on one or another watercraft that can carry five to 10 people. These are different types of inflatable, motor and other boats. The only way they do this is to try to sit down somewhere in a forest plantation and wait for a new group until there is a certain number of them,- the officer said. At the same time, he noted that Ukrainian defenders -are dealing with this issue with the help of fpv drones and drops.- -They catch them and just blow them out of the sky. But some are caught, and some are caught less. That is why the zone in which they like to cross most of all is a zone of constant fighting. But these are not the same battles as, for example, under the same Pokrovsk. This is a completely different intensity, a completely different scale, but this is really an attempt by small groups to infiltrate across the river to create trouble for Ukrainians there,- explained spokesman Viktor Tregubov. As reported by ArmyInform, in OSUV -Khortytsia- also denied the information about the alleged battles for Pokrovsk.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/18/okupanty-namagayutsya-perepravytysya-cherez-oskil-na-improvizovanyh-plavzasobah-viktor-tregubov/	2025-01-18T06:12:06-08:00
They informed about the suspicion of the people's deputy, who made his -drivers- out of evasion	Data about this published on January 18 by the State Bureau of Investigation. Starting in July 2022, the People's Deputy sent letters on his behalf to the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine to grant permission for the departure of men in the guise of drivers who were supposed to accompany him across the border. 23 cases were documented when, on the basis of letters from a people's deputy, 18 men of draft age crossed the state border without him, because at the time of their crossing he was either already outside the border or did not leave the country at all. At the same time, sometimes he needed up to 5 drivers at the same time for trips abroad. Three of these -drivers- never returned to Ukraine. The People's Deputy was notified of the suspicion of organizing illegal transportation of persons across the state border using official position and official forgery (Part 2 of Article 332, Part 1 of Article 366 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine). The sanction of the articles provides for punishment in the form of imprisonment for a term of up to 7 years. The people's deputy was also handed a petition to choose a preventive measure in the form of detention, which will be submitted for consideration by an investigating judge. People's deputy and persons who traveled abroad in this way are being searched. ArmyInform reminds that it is better not to break the law or risk your life, but to use the aggregator of vacancies in the Armed Forces and recruiting centers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/18/povidomyly-pro-pidozru-nardepu-yakyj-robyv-z-uhylyantiv-svoyih-vodiyiv/	2025-01-18T05:52:34-08:00
OSUV - Khortytsia - denied the information about the alleged battles for Pokrovsk	This was told by the spokesman of the Khortytsia operational and strategic group of troops on the air of the telethon. - Major Victor Tregubov. According to him, although the Pokrovsky direction remains the hottest, battles with the Russian invaders are taking place to the south of the city. -We have to emphasize once again that we are not talking about the city - we are talking about small settlements to the south of it, which are not part of it or part of its agglomeration&#8230; The Russians still set themselves the goal of covering the city: they do not even try to enter the city directly. They are trying to cover it from the sides, advance west of it and cut the relevant logistics routes,- the officer explained. As Tregubov notes, Ukrainian defenders are currently focused on preventing the occupiers from doing this. -And it is around this that the direct battle is going on. Our task is to prevent the Russians from entering the west of the city, to prevent the Russians from getting hold of the settlements southwest of the city and to try to cut the logistical arteries that lead to it. There is no question of a threat to the city itself. The Russians are only trying to create a situation in which the Ukrainian troops in the city will be weakened due to the deterioration of logistics,- added the speaker of the -Khortytsia- OSU. As reported by ArmyInform, today in the Pokrovsky direction, every meter of advance is given to the enemy at a high price, since only in the area of ​​responsibility of one brigade about 300 die per day on average occupiers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/18/osuv-hortyczya-sprostuvalo-informacziyu-pro-nibyto-boyi-za-pokrovsk/	2025-01-18T05:39:40-08:00

The enemy uses meat assaults: assaults with infantry until they are wiped out - the 77th OAeMBr told...	Viktor Petrovych, a serviceman of the Dnipro Brigade, told about the situation there on the ArmyTV stream. — What has changed since the moment of our last communication? What is the situation in your brigade's zone of responsibility? — Due to extreme communication, the enemy has somewhat run out of armored vehicles. Currently, they are using meat assaults, that is, they are trying to attack our positions with infantry in waves. Previously, these were mass assaults with the use of armored vehicles. Then more than 10 units of armored vehicles were used twice. They have been repulsed and are now apparently restocking armored vehicles. But, nevertheless, the infantry is still used. — How actively do they break on the right bank of the Oskol River? That is, are they trying to cross, or are there no such attempts? — In our line of responsibility, no crossings have been made so far. We have destroyed all the water vehicles that have been abandoned there and they do not currently have this capability. In them, firstly, there is not a very wide wedge, and secondly, there is a very swampy riverbed and it is very wide, extremely difficult to wade through. That is, it is not enough to swim across, there is also a very wide strip of reeds and high banks. Well, in a word, it is difficult to move there. Therefore, so far no such attempts have been recorded, I have not been informed about them. — Mr. Viktor, can you tell us a little more about your visas, which are standing in front of you. Perhaps you know what these brigades, regiments and units are. Maybe there are some radio intercepts of them or communications with the captives? - At the moment I can't say for sure who is against us, but my comrade, who is now wounded, recorded and sent me a video showing all the chevrons he collected from the killed enemies . And there's storm-z, wagner chevrons, there's some of their widow chevrons. That is, in principle, there are a lot of different divisions, which, obviously, are not permanently here, but are like dowries. That is, let's say they form an assault company in another unit and attach it here to those who are standing here. And they storm until they are wiped out. Then the command takes them out of here, relatively speaking, the next ones are recruited. And the next ones are also sent to our positions until they are erased to zero. When massed infantry are used for assaults, fpv drones are most effective. When there are both mass assaults and in small groups, fpvs calculate the infantry well, hit them accurately, unlike artillery, which has a certain spread and with its help, it is quite difficult to catch a group of three infantrymen, relatively speaking. FPV is more efficient in this regard. They are also effective against moving armored vehicles, which are also difficult to hit with artillery. And in order to prevent the enemy from getting to our infantry, we need more fpv drones, we need a lot of components for them, we need a lot of material base in order to save the lives of the soldiers of the 77th brigade.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/18/vorog-vykorystovuye-myasni-shturmy-shturmuye-pihotoyu-poky-ta-ne-zitretsya-u-77-j-oaembr-rozpovily-pro-sytuacziyu-na-kupyanskomu-napryamku/	2025-01-18T04:57:14-08:00
A judge of the Economic Court of Kyiv was suspected of working for the Ministry of Defense of the Ru...	The State Bureau of Investigation reported this on January 18. It was established that as early as 2011, the aggressor country involved the then president, prime minister of Ukraine and a judge of the Economic Court of Kyiv, as well as heads of various branches of the judicial system, in subversive activities against Ukraine. The leadership of the Russian Federation has developed a plan according to which the defense capabilities and armed forces of the aggressor will be financed at the expense of the State Budget of Ukraine under the pretext of fulfilling the decision of the Economic Court of Kyiv to repay a non-existent debt. For this purpose, in 2011, the Minister of Defense of the Russian Federation addressed the leadership of Ukraine with a letter of assistance in repaying the debt of one of the economic entities in the amount of $405.5 million. And for the supplied natural gas back in 1996-1997. Our state had nothing to do with the debt of a commercial enterprise and could not bear responsibility for it. However, in 2011, the former leadership of the country began to emphasize in the mass media that Ukraine should repay the specified amount to the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation. In addition, a letter was prepared to the Security Service of Ukraine with a request to prosecute the head of the economic entity for allegedly transferring this debt to the state. Trying to artificially create grounds for direct financing of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation at the expense of the Ukrainian state budget, high-ranking officials involved the leadership of the judicial system and the judge of the Economic Court of Kyiv to recover $405.5 million in favor of the Russian Federation based on an illegal court decision. According to the scheme developed by the participants, in August 2012, the Ministry of Finance filed a lawsuit against the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine to the Commercial Court of Kyiv to collect more than 3 billion hryvnias from the state budget. The Russians were counting on the fact that back in 2004, the then Prime Minister, and later the President of Ukraine, promised to assist them in the implementation of these court decisions. However, due to the lack of contractual legal relations between the plaintiff and the defendant, the judge had to refuse to open proceedings in the case. Moreover, the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation did not attach any evidence to the lawsuit to confirm why Ukraine should pay this debt. However, the judge of the commercial court made an illegal decision and transferred the duty of gathering and providing evidence in the case to the defendant. According to this decision, the Cabinet of Ministers provided copies of correspondence between the heads of the governments of Ukraine and the Russian Federation in 1996. They were dated even before the business entity concluded the agreement that resulted in the debt, so these letters could not be evidence of both the existence of the debt and its transfer to Ukraine. In addition, the originals of these letters never existed, but the court ignored this fact. Despite the expiry of the statute of limitations and the absence of state guarantees for the company's debts, as well as the absence of evidence of the very fact of the existence in 2012 of the company's debt under the contracts of 1996-1997, the judge satisfied the lawsuit of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation and decided to collect from any account of the State Budget of Ukraine in favor of the Russian Federation more than 3.1 billion UAH Part of the funds were collected from Ukraine in order to implement the aforementioned illegal court decision in favor of the Russian Federation. After the beginning of the aggression of the Russian Federation against our country and the change of the state leadership, in 2014 another judge of the Economic Court overturned this illegal decision, but it was not possible to return the money unjustifiably collected in the interests of Russia. According to the investigation, these funds were used to finance the so-called svo. As reported by ArmyInform, the people's deputy of several convocations was notified on suspicion of treason.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/18/suddyu-gospodarskogo-sudu-kyyeva-zapidozryly-u-roboti-na-minoborony-rf/	2025-01-18T04:33:30-08:00

According to the investigation, the former deputy of the People's Republic, who was a member of the -Party of Regions- and -Opposition Bloc- for a long time, has been spreading Kremlin narratives since the beginning of Russia's armed aggression against Ukraine in 2014. In order to preserve the influence of the Russian Orthodox Church in Ukraine, which supports armed aggression against the country, the suspect spread the so-called ideology of -Russian peace-. With the help of the Patriarch of the Russian Federation, he became a curator for the Russian Orthodox Church in Ukraine. The suspect carried out his instructions and instructions in order to ensure that a significant part of Ukrainian society, who are believers of the UOC-MP, were under the direct influence of the leader of the Russian Orthodox Church. The People's Deputy also used the right of legislative initiative in order to hide the existence of a church-canonical connection and the entry of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church into the structure of the Ministry of the Russian Orthodox Church and to ensure the preservation of the Russian Orthodox Church's influence on the territory of Ukraine. The suspect gave an interview to the media, in which he made statements against other faiths operating in Ukraine, characterizing them in negative terms. His actions were aimed at inciting hatred and enmity on religious grounds. Before the start of the full-scale aggression, he left for the European Union on a charter flight, where he continued to work in the interests of the Russian Federation. As reported by ArmyInform, the TV presenter Medvedchuk was informed of the suspicion.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/18/narodnomogo-deputata-kilkoh-sklykan-povidomleno-pro-pidozru-u-derzhzradi/	2025-01-18T04:02:45-08:00
TV presenter Medvedchuk was informed about the suspicion	This was announced by the Security Service of Ukraine on January 18. The Security Service of Ukraine collected a large-scale evidence base and received the conclusions of independent examinations confirming the anti-Ukrainian activities of the ex-host of the sanctioned TV channels -Nash- and -NewsOne-, which belonged to Viktor Medvedchuk and Yevhen Murayev. According to the case materials, after the start of the full-scale war, the person involved created his channel on the video hosting YouTube, where he continued to spread the narratives of the Kremlin. To do this, the blogger regularly invited pro-Russian -polite experts- to his broadcasts, a large number of whom are currently hiding in the Russian Federation. During the interview, both the author himself and the guests of the studio repeatedly tried to justify Russia's armed aggression against Ukraine, as well as the war crimes of the Russians, in particular, missile strikes on the civilian infrastructure of our country. Another pro-Kremlin blogger was a frequent guest of the figure, who in February 2024 had already received suspicion from SBU investigators. Then the court chose a preventive measure for him - house arrest, but later the blogger continued his subversive activities in the interests of Moscow. Both figures publicly tried to discredit Ukraine in the international arena and shook the social and political situation within our country. Forensic-linguistic expertise initiated by the SBU confirmed the facts of crimes committed by both bloggers. Currently, the investigators of the Security Service have informed them about the suspicion under Art. 2, 3 Art. 436-2 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (justification, recognition as legitimate, denial of armed aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, glorification of its participants). The question of choosing a preventive measure in the form of detention for the accused is being resolved. They face up to 8 years in prison with confiscation of property. As reported by ArmyInform, a banker was detained in Kyiv /a>, who donated to the occupiers. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/18/televeduchomu-medvedchuka-povidomyly-pro-pidozru/	2025-01-18T03:42:06-08:00

I had shrapnel in my legs, three pieces. One still remained there because they could not pull him out. After that, I was transferred to another company and there was such a wave of emotions that I went home. - How long were you at home? - Almost a year. It was very difficult to overcome myself. Understanding that he's gone, but the boys are there&#8230; and my father will tell me how and what&#8230; Need help there or something? well, one day I arrived in the district, asked to be transferred to my father.

There have been more than one and a half hundred military clashes since the beginning of the day — G...	Operational information as of 22.00 January 17 was published by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The Russian invaders launched one missile attack on the territory of Ukraine using two missiles. In addition, 694 kamikaze drones were brought in to attack and more than 3,200 shots were fired at the positions of our troops and populated areas. In the Kharkiv direction, the enemy stormed the positions of our units in the Vovchansk area, the Defense Forces successfully repelled the enemy's attempt to advance. In the Kupyansk direction, the enemy carried out seven offensive operations near Golubivka, Stepova Novoselievka, and Kruglyakivka. Three clashes are still ongoing. With the support of aviation in the Lyman direction, the Russian invaders stormed the positions of the Defense Forces near Kopanok, Tverdokhlibovo, Makiivka and Terni 13 times. So far, three clashes are ongoing. On the Siverskyi direction, the enemy attacked in the direction of Bilogorivka, without success. Since the beginning of the day in the Kramatorsk direction, the enemy attacked in the Chasovoy Yar area and in the direction of Stupochky and Bila Hora, 24 attempts by the Russians to dislodge our defenders from their occupied positions were unsuccessful, two skirmishes are ongoing. 18 clashes took place today in the Toretsk direction. The enemy stormed the positions of Ukrainian units near Toretsk, Dilyivka, Krymsky and Shcherbinivka. One battle is currently underway. In the Pokrovsky direction, since the beginning of this day, the enemy attacked 64 times in the areas of Zelenyi Pol, Vodyanyi Drugo, Elizavetivka, Promenya, Lysivka, Shevchenko, Zvirovo, Udachny, Uspenivka, Srybny, Dachny, Ulakli, and Yantarny. Our defenders repelled 49 assaults, 15 more clashes are still ongoing. Today, according to preliminary data, 410 occupiers were neutralized in this direction, 173 of them irreversibly. Three motorcycles, ten pieces of automobile equipment and two satellite communication devices were also destroyed. In the Novopavlivskyi direction, Ukrainian defenders repelled one attack by the invaders in the area of ​​Velika Novosilka. Twice the enemy attacked our defenders in the Dnieper direction in vain. In Kurshchyna, the Defense Forces repelled nine assaults by the Russian invaders, three clashes are still ongoing. In other directions, there are no significant changes. Today, it is worth noting the soldiers of the 24th separate mechanized brigade named after King Danylo, the 68th separate hunting brigade named after Oleksa Dovbush, and the 110th separate mechanized brigade named after Colonel-General Mark Bezruchka, who effectively destroyed the enemy, causing him significant losses in manpower and equipment. As reported by ArmyInform, at the General Staff of the Armed Forces talked about the situation at the front and the hottest destinations. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/18/vidbulosya-ponad-pivtory-sotni-boyezitknen-z-pochatku-doby-genshtab-zsu/	2025-01-17T21:17:42-08:00
About the lost -golden hour- after the injuries, the world's first unique operation near Bakhmut and...	Today we meet the doctor who performed that unique operation. This is the chief surgeon of the Armed Forces, colonel of the medical service Kostyantyn Humeniuk. -I had a choice: switch to open surgery or continue laparoscopically. I am not a gambling person, and it was definitely not gambling, I always weigh everything very much and take into account all the risks&#8230; But I just told myself I could do it. And with God's help, everything worked out. The operation lasted almost an hour and a half. Currently, we process such cases for up to an hour,- says the officer. In 2017, he was the chief surgeon of the ATO, in 2018-2019 — the chief surgeon of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. He met the large-scale invasion at the front - and since then he spends a lot of time in the area of ​​hostilities, in direct contact with the doctors of mobile hospitals and advanced surgical groups. In addition, he works a lot with partners, having a number of foreign business trips. During one of these, in the USA, Konstantin Humenyuk (and, therefore, the entire surgical service of the Armed Forces) received a standing ovation, seeing only a part and fragments of the work of our military medics in saving the lives of defenders. Next is an ArmiyaInform interview with Kostyantyn Gumenyuk. — What was your area of ​​responsibility when the full-scale invasion of the Russians began in 2022 and what is it now? — The entire surgical service of the Armed Forces is my area of ​​responsibility, starting with all advanced surgical groups, military mobile hospitals, military medical clinical centers located in different cities of Ukraine. And accordingly, all wounded, traumatized and patients of a surgical profile are under my responsibility. With the beginning of the war, of course, their number increased significantly, and the load on the entire surgical service accordingly also increased. He met the war in Donetsk region, where he went a few days before the invasion - at that time, the 65th military mobile hospital was stationed in Chasovoy Yar. At 5 a.m., I woke up to do the traditional morning workout — but around the same time, the OOS headquarters was attacked. From then on, it began: a non-stop stream of ambulances, many wounded with modern combat trauma, in particular, in a serious condition - with amputations of the lower and upper limbs. Many had to operate in various mobile hospitals in Lysychansk, Bakhmut, Druzhkivka, Pokrovsk, Dnipro, Kharkiv; deal with organizational issues regarding the flow of the wounded and change their evacuation routes, taking into account that Kharkiv was already being shelled at that time. The issues of medical supply with blood preparations and medicines were also important. Subsequently, he was engaged in moving the Odessa military hospital to another region, after that he returned to the front. We had to work a lot in the operating theaters in Dnipro - the Mechnikov hospital, the military medical clinical center and other civilian hospitals received a large flow of wounded, for which I thank the civilian surgeons and all other doctors and medical personnel who saved our wounded. As the chief surgeon, I am responsible for the wounded from the moment of his admission to the advanced surgical group. This is my very first link. —The war, unfortunately, became an impetus for progress in various fields. How was this reflected in military surgery? What do you think has been the quantum leap for military medicine since the start of a full-scale invasion? What has become a game changer for military surgery? - It is worth understanding that the more operations there are, the more experience surgeons gain. The more a surgeon works with modern combat trauma, the more he understands all the complex life-threatening moments, what are the consequences of this combat trauma, and, accordingly, the mastery of operative interventions increases, this is very important. Yes, since 2014, since the time of the ATO/OOS, we have also been gaining experience. At that time, there was a relatively small number of wounded. Yes, we were wounded by various types of weapons and sniper fire, then we could quickly deliver the wounded to mobile hospitals, the -golden hour- was observed, which is very important. After a large-scale invasion, we have a large number of wounded for the entire surgical service of the Armed Forces. And then we clearly understood that in order to save all these wounded, there must be a tactic of Damage control surgery. This is a special tactic that was introduced by our American partners, they used it in Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan. Its meaning is that during surgery, the surgeon should perform a shortened stage of the operation precisely to save life, without performing the full scope of operations. This is especially true for the unstable seriously wounded. After stabilization of the condition, the final stage of the operation is performed. And this tactic has proven its effectiveness in severe wounds of almost all localizations, especially the organs of the abdominal cavity, as the heaviest in the war. And it was during a large-scale invasion that we saw that when we use Damage control surgery, the results are better. We now apply this tactic to almost all injuries. An extreme case was when a wounded man with a fragment in the heart, signs of hemopericardium and cardiac tamponade, which is life-threatening, was operated on in a mobile hospital, the tamponade was removed, and the wounded man was evacuated to the Amosov Institute in 9 hours. There, high-class surgeons using high-quality equipment performed an operation, removed the splinter and saved lives. This applies to any other complex surgical interventions. In case of injury, the task of the surgeon in the mobile hospital is to save life. The priority is a saved life! Restoration of blood loss begins already at the stabilization point of the brigade, followed by rapid evacuation. And it is precisely this tactic in interaction with clear and professional assistance at all stages that allows for high-quality results, and the survival rate of wounded soldiers is much higher. In addition, there is another complication: all gunshot wounds are infected. We also have the problem of antibiotic resistance in the treatment of soldiers, it is difficult to deal with sepsis, and severe pneumonia is starting as a complication of combat trauma. There are cases where surgeons perform unique operations, but the wounded may die from bilateral pneumonia or multiple organ failure. Such complications are frequent and can lead to fatalities, unfortunately. — When was the peak of the arrival of the wounded to the advanced surgical teams? What is the intensity and stage of the war? - Spring 2022. But in general, the front is changeable. It may be a little quieter in Donetsk region, and it may get worse in the Zaporizhzhia direction. Then everything quieted down in this direction, but the number of wounded in Kharkiv region increased. It all happens very locally. — The burden on both the advanced surgical teams and the hospital due to the full-scale Russian invasion was colossal. How did you cope with this challenge? — Due to the professionalism of the managers of all departments. These are the heads of mobile hospitals and leading surgeons&#8230; If we talk about the surgical service, everyone performed their functional duties, their work, and thanks to this, we managed to survive. In addition, many surgeons and operating room nurses came to the army for mobilization. This also saved the situation, especially when there was a large flow of wounded 24/7, when surgeons could not sleep for two or three days. - What dynamics do you observe in the context of the frequency of fatalities in case of combat injury, icomparing the spring of 2022 and the beginning of 2025? — Seasonality greatly affects the survival rate of our boys. Yes, hypothermia, frostbite, for example, aggravate a combat injury. If a wounded serviceman spent 2-3 hours in some cold dugout, then this general hypothermia will also affect the soldier's survival. What we have seen during this time is that the faster the wounded are transported from the battlefield to the staging area of ​​a brigade or forward surgical team, the better the survival rate. We now often talk about the -golden hour- - that a soldier must be taken to a surgeon within an hour from the moment of injury. In this case, the results of treatment and survival will be better. We currently spend over an hour on this - sometimes 6, 12 or more. Often, during speeches at conferences, foreign colleagues ask me: -How so?!-. It has to be explained that the wounded man can put a tourniquet on himself, but for several hours he is not evacuated from the battlefield, and the combat medic cannot reach him - shelling continues, drones overhead, etc. Therefore, the evacuation of the wounded to the advanced surgical group or the stabilization point of the brigade takes place at night or in the evening, when there are fewer drones and there is an opportunity to approach with armored vehicles. - Actually, in continuation of the topic. According to the NATO protocol, the wounded should be in the hospital within an hour. In our realities of war, this -golden hour- is being lost. Do we somehow adapt these protocols to our war? Do we develop our own? Please tell us how we are dealing with this. - Yes, even from the experience of the ATO/OOS, we saw that if a wounded person is already at the surgeon's place within an hour, the survival rate is higher, the number of amputations due to tourniquets would be significantly less . But now we have such a situation that a military man puts a tourniquet, a certain time passes, and he cannot loosen it, for example, because the battle is going on or there is no combat medic, or he died. Then it is no longer possible to save the limb, we perform amputations. — In this context, another question: what do you see as the real volume of interventions for a paramedic? Is it planned to expand the training of doctors, to allow them to perform certain interventions? After all, there are rare cases when a person cannot be evacuated from the battlefield for a day or more - Currently, there are many centers in Ukraine that conduct training in tactical medicine, prepare combat medics, senior combat medics. Such courses are also held on the basis of the Ukrainian Military Medical Academy. Plus there are training centers, public organizations that deal with this training. Currently, this training is qualified and of high quality. But it is clear that there are not enough specialists to train such a large number of people. But my personal opinion: every Ukrainian, starting from high school, should have the skills to provide first aid to himself and others. These classes in Ukraine should start from school. People need to know how to apply a tourniquet or stop bleeding. A person must be psychologically prepared for extreme conditions - we have shelling of cities every day, sometimes, unfortunately, with a large number of wounded. A person should know what to do if there is no tourniquet at hand (therefore, there is a belt or laces), how to stop arterial bleeding or how to free the upper airway and provide quality resuscitation. Therefore, as the chief surgeon of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, I believe that within the borders of the state, the issue of providing first medical aid should begin at school. — In one of your interviews, you said that military surgeons of the Armed Forces of Ukraine implement and develop modern surgical techniques, especially in minimally invasive surgical interventions. In May 2022, in a military mobile hospital, you performed a modern laparoscopic operation for the removal of a kidney for the first time in Ukraine in a gunshot wound with destruction of the organ. Judging by open sources, such an operation had no analogues in the world at that time. Tell me more. - Usually, a modern combat trauma is a large incision, where the surgeon makes a laparotomy (cuts, for example, the abdomen, and operates on the internal organs) or a thoracotomy (cuts the chest and operates). We have started to implement minimally invasive surgery - when not an incision is made, but a small puncture, and the surgeon, observing the situation through a video camera on the monitor, operates with micro-instruments. Therefore, we introduced minimally invasive surgery (laparoscopy, thoracoscopy) in modern combat trauma. And we are pioneers in the world, because we were the first to do it in combat conditions. In May 2022, I was in one of the military hospitals in the eastern direction. Then he performed a laparoscopic nephrectomy - laparoscopically removed the kidney, which was destroyed, with bleeding. Previously, an incision would be made in the abdomen and the surgeon would remove the kidney with his hands, tying the vessels, etc. I managed to do it laparoscopically: only small punctures in the abdomen - and I could see all the internal organs on the monitor. I found that kidney, stopped the bleeding, removed it and saved the fighter's life. And you know: the next day, the same injured person arrived with a destroyed kidney. Having experience behind him, he performed the second operation much faster, because he knew all the technical points. Such an operation was carried out for the first time in the world, because then I looked through all the specialized literature - but I did not find any examples. I asked myself then, why I was not told in the academy or universities that it is possible to do this (smiles). That is why the military surgeons of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are the pioneers in the implementation of modern operations. Even now, when I come to the mobile hospital, and there is appropriate equipment, and surgeons already perform many such surgical interventions for modern combat trauma - namely, laparoscopically and thoracoscopically. During one of the conferences abroad, when I talked about our experience, my colleagues simply did not understand how this could be done. Because if they perform such surgical interventions, then only in large basic hospitals, where there is equipment and a large team. But in our country it is done in combat conditions, where surgeons operate laparoscopically on the wounded. - What guided you when you performed the first such operation in the world? - I then started this laparoscopic operation - I went in and saw a large hematoma. And I had a choice: switch to open surgery or continue laparoscopically. I am not a gambling person, and it was definitely not gambling, I always weigh everything very much and take into account all the risks&#8230; But I just told myself I could do it. And with God's help, everything worked out. The operation lasted almost an hour and a half. Now we work on such cases for up to an hour. - Tell us about three unique operations of yours personally. - Not that they are unique - I will tell you about the most memorable ones. Once, a wounded man with a gunshot wound to the abdomen arrived at the mobile hospital, and the anesthesiologists were just about to give him anesthesia. And he opens his eyes and says: -Kostyantin Vitaliyovych, you operated on me in 2017, look, there is a scar on the side of my thigh, they took a bullet out of me.- And I did not remember him at all, even in which hospital he operated. It was so fate that he came to see me for the second time for surgery. Currently, he continues to serve on the front line. From the memorable still&#8230; You know, when there is a large flow of wounded, the surgeons do sorting: they determine who goes to the operation first, who goes to the second, and so on. And in civilian polyclinics, there are always disputes and quarrels about who will get to the doctor first. But among the wounded (severely wounded!) there is no such thing - they lie quietly. No one is saying that he should be saved first. There was no such case. And I have been to many sortings. They are concise: -Doc, as you say, you can see better.- Although I understand that waiting for you to be taken for surgery is psychologically very difficult. In many guys who wake up from anesthesia, I don't see fear in their eyes about not having, for example, a limb. He just says, -Amputation? And nothing could be done?... Well, there will be a prosthesis.- This cannot be expressed in words&#8230; They support me and help, in a big way, to communicate this difficult news. Many soldiers with prostheses continue to serve. I saw how one soldier's titanium prosthesis was pierced by a fragment. Such cases also happen. - Tell us about the three most unique operations in the army since the beginning of the full-scale invasion? - The first operation is a thoracoscopic operation for a gunshot wound to the heart and the presence of hemopericard and cardiac tamponade. The shrapnel entered the heart and hemorrhage occurred in the pericardium. As a result, the heart begins to work poorly, because it is unable to contract, blood accumulates in the heart bag. The wounded man suffocates, his neck veins swell. And at this time, the operation must be done quickly. And we went thoracoscopically - we made small punctures in the chest, installed a video camera, cut the pericardium, the blood came out of the heart, and it began to function normally. The wounded man's condition stabilized, and we sent him by helicopter to Amosov, where he was operated on and his life was saved. It was also the first such operation in the world. The second operation is the removal of the kidney, which I have already talked about. The third is when the fragment enters the large blood vessels, the inferior vena cava, or the aorta. These are large blood vessels and if the bleeding is not stopped in time, the person will bleed quickly. There was such a case when a fragment got into the inferior vena cava and got stuck in its wall. The surgeons saw this and asked me what to do. And this is a mobile hospital, and I understand that professional experience is needed, and that there is no threatening bleeding, you need to have a sufficient amount of blood, besides, other wounded people arrive. The military was stable, and we made an important decision: they made a tamponade, put drainage, quickly sent to the Institute of Shalimov, where it was operated. Life is saved. These are unique operations, but properly made decision - is also very important. It could be said that we operate there in a mobile hospital. But as the chief surgeon, I understand that the risk of bleeding was very high. And I understood that surgeons could not cope at that level, and we would lose life. Proper solution = saved life, and this is the most important thing. - How does work with partners continue? Do they come and take experience? What are their emotions when you talk about the experience of our combat doctors? About 12,000 participants. I had a performance in a very large hall, very briefly told about our surgical capabilities and how we save our boys. The hall applauded. And now I do not praise myself now - I was applauded not to me, but all the surgical service of the Armed Forces. I just put my hand on my heart and bowed. Many acquaintances of new ones. Partners from other countries were very supported by Israel, for example. They talked about their own challenges and volumes of work. But when I told that we can have up to 100-150 operations a day in only one direction of the front-I was looked at me with wide eyes. Yes, we have the wounded both with slight injuries, with medium, with severe, and extremely difficult. But the fact itself. Do you understand? .. - What is the most difficult operation you have performed? Lasted seven hours. Successfully. As for the wounded &#8230; When I operate guys, I do not allow myself to think that we will not handle somewhere. I clearly know that we will do everything. Yes, there are difficult cases where I see: 50 to 50, I ask myself how to do &#8230; At such moments, I never shy and call my senior colleagues, academics - and will always tell me. So now I say surgeons - call and ask. They even call at night, apologize who have woken up, but advise what to do with one wound. It is often the case that they need support or a hint. And they always get it from me. And I am proud to manage to today such a powerful professional surgical service of the Armed Forces. - What would you advise military doctors to prevent mental maintenance? Since we understand that such a load is difficult to withstand &#8230; - when I come to my colleagues, I always ask them what they do in my free time. Laughing answers that there is no free time. And if so - then fall asleep. Yes, monotonous work and constant load lead to psycho -emotional burnout. I ask them to watch beautiful movies. Be sure to play sports - necessarily! Sometimes the boys even order themselves small expanders, simulators, dumbbells, put tennis tables. Sport is a little distracting, and mental and physical activity should be combined. I advise you to monitor the webinars, new operations around the world. If possible, stroll in the open air. Well, key - communication with relatives and relatives. - What is your recipe to keep yourself mentally during this war? be able to separate from basic work and salvation. Be able to find joy in a little one: good music, good communication, a beautiful book, a beautiful movie. Sport. All in general leads to the fact that a person is distracted and there is no psycho -emotional and physical burnout. -what will be the completion of the Russian-Ukrainian war? I understand that options ( end of war. - Ed. ) can be very different. We really want our victory. But for me personally, the end of the war will be the moment when I get the following information: -Konstantine Vitaliyovich, no 200, no 300's.- This is the stop for me, definitely. So then we will operate in the boys hernia, appendicitis, cholecystitis or broken legs ( laughs ). We will continue to rescue both the military and the civilian population - but then all there will be non -adhesive injuries. - What will you do the first after the end of the war? Not even in the sea-but in any river: just swim, just sit on the shore of quiet and peaceful Ukraine.

Division-level breakthrough operation, late Soviet team and cementing -axis of evil-: expert on Nort...	Why did Russia resort to deploying troops from North Korea and for what reasons is it still hiding their presence there? Military expert Petro Chernyk answered these questions. -It is not a secret why this operation was organized. First of all, it is a diversion of troops from the strategic eastern bridgehead, especially in the Donetsk direction. And, of course, this debunks the myth that a non-nuclear country cannot attack a nuclear one. A nuclear apocalypse did not happen. But there is another very important and principled element in this operation: North Korean troops. They had a lot of questions at the beginning of their entry. A few months ago, the Russian Federation publicized this phenomenon that, they say, such forces will appear that will immediately knock out our troops from the territory of Kurshchyna. This did not happen. Therefore, the strategic question is being revised, whether these troops are so combat-ready and whether they are capable of performing the tasks assigned to them. We can definitely talk about it now from a certain experience. Now just a few analytical points. It was declared that it was used within the limits of up to 12,000 personnel (North Korean troops — ed.). First of all, these are mechanized units. Is it a lot or a little? This is a full division. The division, according to Soviet and current Russian standards, is 12,500 people. According to the classic statute, the same Soviet-Russian one, the division must break through brigade combat formations along a front of 10-15 kilometers, up to 30 kilometers in depth. The North Korean troops could not demonstrate anything like that. This is a very important detail. At most, if you scrupulously check and study their equipment, especially those already confirmed cases of their death, then this is the late Soviet Union, well, maybe a little improved. And let's not forget that combat experience is a very important detail. Our military is probably the most experienced military in the world at the moment—well, second only to the United States of America—but in the type of war we're fighting right now, especially in FPV drones. And here is another small cut. We recall that postcard of the North Koreans, where they tried to shoot down a drone as a bait, that is, a live person. What does that mean? This means that they are treated as biomass, and biomass cannot and will not perform any other option besides meat assaults. So, the summary. If the North Korean troops really had real combat potential, they would have organized at least one division-level breakthrough operation. This did not happen. Now a logical and understandable question arises: why is Russia beginning to hide the facts of their presence? But everything is elementary simple. Everything rests on strategic propaganda. It is similar to -we will take Kyiv in three days- and -we are at war with NATO-. And here it is the same: units on which a huge bet was made in the propaganda sense do not justify themselves. Therefore, this issue should be removed from the agenda. Plus, no matter how strange it sounds, there is also a certain geopolitical component of this phenomenon. What does it consist of? We have no doubt that the allies are conducting serious negotiations behind closed doors with both the Chinese and the Russian Federation regarding the fact that such a flagrant violation of the rules of international warfare is unacceptable. Because there was great geopolitics here for Putin - and not only for Putin, but also for China and for North Korea - this is the cementing of the so-called -axis of evil-. Therefore, they went into hiding and, in my opinion, will continue to do so. It is important for us to hold the bridgehead and to destroy as much as possible, both the occupiers - the Russians themselves - and the North Koreans. Why? Because it is a signal to world dictatorships that such frank adventures will have a certain value in terms of the destruction of their personnel.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/18/proryvna-operacziya-dyvizijnogo-rivnya-piznoradyanskyj-ekip-ta-czementuvannya-visi-zla-ekspert-pro-pivnichnokorejcziv-na-kurshhyni/	2025-01-17T20:44:18-08:00
Bridging the gaps: France to develop new long-range ballistic missile	According to data reporters of the French magazine Challenges, the implementation of this defense project will be the first such initiative since 1997 year, ArmyInform reports. This potential development reflects the growing global reliance on ballistic missiles, which have proven effective in various conflicts. The proposed missile aims to fill a gap in France's capabilities, as its current ballistic missile systems are exclusively submarine-based and designed for nuclear deterrence. In turn, the experts of the Dutch portal for the study of defense prospects Army Recognition reminded that currently the French Republic is armed there are no land-based ballistic missiles. Its only -ballistic- is the M51 missile, which is launched from a submarine and serves as a means of nuclear deterrence. Discussions between the French Armed Forces and the Directorate General of Armaments (DGA) were focused on creating a ground-based missile system that would be controlled from mobile platforms such as trucks. Early design concepts suggest that this missile may have end-phase maneuverability similar to other advanced systems, making it more difficult for enemy defenses to intercept. Historically, France developed several land-based ballistic missiles after World War II. Between 1946 and 1947, German engineers in France worked on the Super V2, a medium-range ballistic missile project with planned variants capable of a range of up to 3,600 kilometers and warheads weighing up to 1,000 kilograms. However, in 1948 this defense program was terminated. The S2, in service since 1971, was a two-stage, solid-propellant medium-range ballistic missile equipped with a 1.2 megaton thermonuclear warhead. In 1980, it was replaced by the S3 missile, which had similar characteristics and remained in service until 1996. In 1974, France introduced the Pluton missile, a short-range tactical ballistic missile with a range of up to 120 kilometers designed for nuclear or conventional warheads. In 1991, the Pluton was replaced by the Hades missile, which had a range of approximately 480 kilometers. The Hadès missile, designated as a pre-strategic nuclear deterrent, was decommissioned by 1997. This new program differs from the French Long-Range Land Strike initiative (FLP-T), which is focused on the development of a replacement for rocket artillery with a range of up to 150 kilometers. In contrast, the proposed ballistic missile would exceed 1,000 kilometers, offering additional strategic options for deep strikes in conflicts. However, funding remains a serious problem, as the French military budget is already allocated to such priority projects as the modernization of M51 missiles and the development of the ASN4G air-launched missile. This potential program could also align with the European Long-Range Strike Approach (ELSA), a joint initiative involving Germany, Italy, Poland, the UK and Sweden. If developed, the missile would complement France's current capabilities, such as Rafale jets and cruise missiles, increasing its ability to launch strategic strikes. Ballistic missiles are designed to deliver warheads over long distances using an arc trajectory. They are powered during the initial phase of flight, after which they move on a ballistic trajectory under the influence of gravity and air resistance. This design allows them to hit targets at different distances from short to intercontinental. Their high speed and height make interception difficult. Some ballistic missiles are equipped with multiple independent warhead units (MIRVs), allowing a single missile to deploy multiple warheads at different targets. These features underscore the strategic importance of ballistic missiles, as evidenced by their effectiveness in recent conflicts and their potential to close capability gaps similar to those found in France's current arsenal. On October 1, 2024, Iran launched 180 ballistic missiles at Israel, several of which penetrated Israel's multi-layered missile defense system and struck key military bases. In response, Israel launched airstrikes using Blue Sparrow ballistic missiles carried by F-15 fighter jets. Analysts consider these exchanges part of the first -ballistic battle- since similar events in April 2024. China has invested heavily in ballistic missile programs with systems such as the DF-21D and DF-26 capable of targeting installations in the western Pacific. In addition, the flight range of the DF-100 supersonic missile was increased to 4,000 kilometers. The South Korean Hyunmoo-V missile, which is detailed told ArmyInform, capable of carrying an eight-ton warhead to a distance of more than 3 thousand kilometers, targeting underground and strategic facilities in North Korea. North Korea has also tested an intercontinental ballistic missile, potentially a solid fuel, capable of reaching the United States. These developments underscore the growing importance of long-range ground strike capabilities in modern defense strategies. How is a ballistic missile different from a cruise missile.

Russian fake about the mobilization of Ukrainian rescuers: what did they make up this time	Propagandists are actively dispersing fake -documents- and fictitious orders that refer to sending rescuers to the front lines. The manipulation is supported by false comments on behalf of Ukrainian officials and -testimonies- of allegedly dismissed employees of the State Emergency Service. Their goal is to create the impression that the state leaves civilians defenseless in wartime conditions. 1. The State Emergency Service performs exclusively humanitarian tasks. The State Service for Emergency Situations is not part of the defense forces and does not have the authority to participate in hostilities. Its main task is to eliminate the consequences of shelling, rescue people, clear mines and provide first aid. 2. There are no orders for the mobilization of rescuers. No information about the mobilization or other changes in the work of the service has been published on the official resources of the State Emergency Service. Official statements of representatives of the State Emergency Service deny any assumptions about the involvement of rescuers in hostilities. 3. Russian propaganda systematically attacks humanitarian services. This is not the first case when the enemy spreads fakes about the State Emergency Service. Previously, there were rumors about a -mass flight- of rescuers from front-line cities, -weapons supply- under the guise of humanitarian aid, etc. The purpose of these information attacks is to destabilize the situation in the rear. 4. The lack of logic in the fake. In the conditions of constant missile attacks and terror on the part of the Russian Federation, the reduction of rescue units would be illogical and harmful to the country's security. On the contrary, the Ukrainian authorities are strengthening the State Emergency Service, providing it with modern equipment and technology. Such emissions are aimed at inciting mistrust of the authorities, undermining the morale of the population and devaluing the work of rescuers. They try to create the impression of chaos and disorder in the rear. As a result, citizens may begin to doubt the effectiveness of critical services and panic. How to counter fakes 1. Trust only official sources. Information should be checked on the official resources of the State Emergency Service, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and other verified media. 2. Do not spread unverified information. If you see suspicious news, do not repost it without checking. It is better to clarify the facts and make sure of their reliability. 3. Report fakes. Block accounts that spread false information and report them to social network administrators. Russian propaganda continues to use fakes as a tool of hybrid warfare. The enemy will not be able to sow panic among Ukrainians, because society has already learned to distinguish truth from lies. Ukrainian rescuers remain in place, fulfilling their noble mission of saving lives. And we must all support them without allowing the enemy to undermine our faith in the state and victory.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/18/rosijskyj-fejk-pro-mobilizacziyu-ukrayinskyh-ryatuvalnykiv-yak-vorog-manipulyuye-pravdoyu/	2025-01-17T20:10:59-08:00

-Samovolka-, injury and service with his father: the story of Denis Governor's return to the front	The story of the fighter was publicized on the page of the 13th Brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine -CHARTER-. After returning to the army, Denys turned to the command with a request to join the -Charter- brigade, where his father was already working as a driver of the -Novator- armored car. This decision became important for him - fighting together with his father was fundamental for him. -When you serve next to a loved one, it gives you extra support. We work in the same crew, one helps the other, we transport the infantry and evacuate the wounded together,- says Denys. He works on a Browning machine gun, covering his comrades. Despite the danger that is always present at the front, Denys and his father feel that their strength lies in unity.

He recalls cases when their armored car came under heavy fire, but thanks to quick actions and support of each other, they managed to get out of the most difficult situations. For the family of Governors, it is important not only to fight, but also to be together. The support they receive from each other gives them the strength to overcome the hardships of war. -My father and I are together, and this helps us keep up,- Denys concludes.

It works even under water — the Defense Forces received a new metal detector	About this reported on January 17 by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. The Trembita metal detector has earned positive feedback from Ukrainian deminers. With its help, metal objects and weakly electrically conductive materials are detected without reducing sensitivity in difficult conditions, for example, in mineralized soils. The metal detector is intended for individual use and has an appropriate degree of protection. It is sealed, shockproof and waterproof, so it can be used for underwater demining. Also among the advantages of the metal detector: — Ergonomic (speed of transition from compact to working condition). — Compact. — Lightweight (no more than 2.4 kg). - Easy to use (easy automatic configuration). - The time of continuous operation is not less than 48 hours. This indicator is higher than that of foreign counterparts. — Can show the presence of anti-personnel or anti-tank mines in the soil, identify the most common types of Russian mines, such as TM-62M, PFM-1, F-1, RGD-5, PMN-2 and many others. -Ukraine is currently the most mined country in the world. Our sappers use various means of detecting mines and unexploded ordnance. Among them is the Trembita detector, which not only meets world standards, but sometimes surpasses foreign analogues. This is confirmed by positive feedback from demining groups,- emphasized the head of the Main Department of Mine Action, Civil Defense and Environmental Security, Colonel Ruslan Beregulya. According to him, another advantage of the Trembita metal detector is the presence of the Pinpoint function, which is necessary to determine the exact location of mines or unexploded ordnance that the deminer is looking for. This not only facilitates the search, but also avoids physical exposure to dangerous war remains during their excavation. As reported by ArmiyaInform, during 2024 the defense department codified and put into operation in the Defense Forces of Ukraine, almost 30 samples of automotive equipment for movement in difficult terrain and off-road conditions. &nbsp; &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/17/praczyuye-navit-pid-vodoyu-syly-oborony-otrymaly-novyj-metalodetektor/	2025-01-17T05:53:54-08:00

- Meat stormtroopers - under concrete slabs and an attack on a tank with 6 FPV drones at once: comba...	-The main task of the tank units here is to stop the advance of the enemy's infantry, destroy enemy dugouts and shelters, destroy fire equipment, armored groups, and various heavy equipment of the Rashists. That is, to make the assault actions of the occupiers in the Kurakhovo district impossible as much as possible. Usually, on this part of the front, tanks work with -direct fire-. This is a very effective way of deterring offensive actions. The targets of the rockets, which are located at a distance of up to 4-5 kilometers from the tank, are hit. Recently, our tank crews have been carrying out combat missions, inflicting fire damage on the occupiers who were near the settlement of Zelenivka. The enemy suffers losses in manpower and manages to stop his advance to the Donetsk route. The enemy wants to enter this road at any cost, cut the communication and logistics routes for our units and create a new -bag- in Dachny. Just the other day, our tanks -dismantled- enemy infantry in shelters. Then it was possible to bury the -meat attack aircraft- under the concrete slabs of the hangar, which were about to carry out offensive actions. How many of them there were, of course, cannot be counted. But it was on this day that the Rashists from this village did not attack. Played to get ahead. We perform such tasks constantly, there is no such thing as a tank just standing in the waiting area. There is always plenty of combat work. Considering that the tank battalion was formed relatively recently, I think that the guys are well done. All are mobilized, of different ages and from different regions of Ukraine. Military tours continue, work is boiling day and night. There are no such tank duels now. Yes, it was more massive at the beginning of the invasion and in 2022-2023. But now the enemy is afraid to enter the line of fire, he perfectly understands the threat. And, in addition, today the occupiers feel a certain shortage of combat equipment. According to the extreme calculations of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the enemy lost about 9,800 tanks in the war against Ukraine. Tank battalion 157 of a separate mechanized brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine fights on T-64 tanks of various modifications. In combat, these machines have proven themselves in a very positive way. A 42-ton diesel tank with hundreds of millimeters of armor, three crew members and an automatic loader for the 125 mm main gun. Compared to the -72-, the T-64 has a simpler fire control system, and this gives a higher rate of fire. This is how it happens in battle: the one who fired and hit the target faster remained alive and won. More reliable undercarriage, but at the same time the engine is a little weaker than the T-72, T-80 and tanks of other modifications. The charging mechanism in the -64th volume- is a little more complicated, again, unlike the T-72. Here, the charging mechanism consists of three main parts. These are electric, hydraulic and mechanical. In the -72- it's simpler: electrical and mechanical. That is, there is no intermediate link - the hydraulic part. The 5TDF engine is generally very picky about temperature conditions. If the T-72 engine can be started without warming up at a temperature of minus 10-15°, then the T-64 must be warmed up. Sometimes it even happens that during higher temperatures it is necessary to warm up additionally. This is a problem at the moment. But in terms of other parameters and combat capabilities, this tank is almost not inferior to the T-72. About reservation, the tower in the -64th- is better protected, the armor body is almost the same. In terms of speed on the track, these two tanks do not differ in principle. But in hard-to-reach areas of the terrain, the T-64 still has better passability, it has tracks that -squeeze out- the swamp. The T-72 has a flat track, so it is heavier. Today, the T-64 remains the main battle tank of the Armed Forces. The maximum firing range of the cannon is up to 10 km, and the effective fire is 8.5 km. It is equipped with night vision devices, a thermal imager, which is integrated into the gunner's aiming system, and modern navigation and communication systems. The biggest threat right now is enemy UAVs. What exactly does the anti-drone protection of the T-64 tank consist of? There is passive and active protection against enemy FPV drones. Passive is a welded grill, -shroud-, protective -crowns- or they are also called -grills-. Active protection is, of course, electronic warfare systems. But as combat experience shows, now the enemy is actively using FPV on fiber optics. And, unfortunately, anti-drone protection is actually leveled off, so EW means can neither detect enemy FPV drones nor interfere with their work by suppressing radio communication between the remote control and the -fpvish- itself. Therefore, passive protection of the tank is currently playing a more effective role. In real combat, it saves the crew from destruction. The other day, the T-64 crew was working on a route and was attacked by 6 enemy FPV drones. They hit the motor-transmission compartment, because of which the tank stopped. But the -mangal- fulfilled its protection mission, the crew is alive. In our direction, the enemy is trying to use anti-tank missile complexes less. With what this is connected, perhaps with a shortage of anti-tank guided missiles. A tank without a crew is nothing. It's just a combat vehicle with armor and weapons. A trained and motivated crew is needed for a tank to effectively perform tasks in battle. The Training Centers of the Armed Forces carry out professional training of mechanics-drivers, gunner-operators and tank commanders. It lasts only 20 days. This is far from enough to professionally train the mobilized to drive a car and deliver targeted strikes at the enemy. Training should be increased and, most importantly, the quality of the training should be improved. Theory is great, but the practical component needs to be increased. This is especially true for driving and shooting. People of absolutely different age, psychotype and motivation come to us. Some grasp everything quickly, while others learn slowly. Some do not want anything at all: neither to know nor to learn. This especially applies to those people who came to us very recently. It can be seen that people do not fully understand why they join the army, that they need to protect the state and their native homes from an aggressor. The enemy will not stop himself, we must destroy him. Therefore, it is impossible to expect that, after professional training, a soldier who was previously a civilian will come and fully fight the enemy on tanks. Of course, we are trying to make up for certain shortcomings in his training on the ground, in the military unit. In order for the level of execution of combat missions to be better, and there were fewer losses. It also happened that such -specialists- came that they did not know how to fix even small technical problems. For example, the coarse fuel cleaning filter is clogged. Tankers are required to know the technical capabilities, operation and maintenance of the tank. And to constantly keep the combat vehicle in combat readiness. This is the Aziz. In modern warfare, tanks are a key element in both defensive and offensive operations. They provide mobile firepower and are well protected by armor. Some a la experts say that the role of tanks in the modern Russian-Ukrainian war has been somewhat downplayed, arguing that this is due to the scale and intensity of the use of UAVs. Especially FPV drones. But this is not the case. When a tank comes at you with anti-drone protection and EW plus it shoots and there are no anti-tank means to knock it down, it's very scary. This is a destructive force that is almost impossible to stop. Do not forget about shooting from closed firing positions. This is also an effective way to defeat the enemy, but at a longer distance. The tank can maneuver, change positions for strikes. But most importantly, it stops the advance of the enemy, who attacks continuously. This is colossal fire support for our infantry units. Ultimately helping to keep our frontline defenders alive. How many cases have there already been when using fire from tank weapons in interaction with drones and other technical means, columns of heavy armored vehicles of the enemy on different areas of the front were -dismantled- at a long distance. Tanks do this job effectively. One thing is a direct hit by a 125 mm projectile, then the equipment is completely destroyed and becomes inoperable, and another thing is drones, which carry a much smaller warhead and do not always manage to hit the enemy. Therefore, I would not be so categorical, unlike some experts. I have a counter question: how are you going to win back territories captured by the enemy, break through their defensive positions, and so on? The question, of course, is rhetorical! Tank Battalion Commander Stanislav is a 2018 graduate of the National Academy of Ground Forces. He is from Uzhhorod. Immediately after graduation, he got the position of tank platoon commander of the 17th separate tank brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. He met the Great War as a company commander in the city of Shchastya, Luhansk region. Then, with paratroopers, the 79th brigade held the defense of the city. For a short period of time, he was the deputy commander of the battalion, then he was promoted - he became the chief of staff of the tank battalion. In 2022, he performed combat missions in the Severodonetsk, Kreminnaya, Lysychansky Refinery and Lyman areas. Then the direction of the village of Velika Novosilka. He participated in the counteroffensive and the liberation of the territory of the right-bank Kherson region. Then again the defense of Donetsk region. Last year, he headed the tank battalion of the 157th separate mechanized brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/17/myasni-shturmovyky-pid-betonnymy-plytamy-ta-ataka-na-tank-odrazu-6-fpv-dronamy-kombat-zhulik-pro-boyi-pid-kurahovym/	2025-01-16T21:06:52-08:00
IRIS-T is not the only one: experts talked about the newest drone fighter from the German manufactur...	The manufacturer of these special equipment is the Diehl Defense company, which is well known in our country thanks to the IRIS-T air defense system developed by it, about which our editors have repeatedly told in their reviews. Researcher of military equipment and armaments, doctor of historical sciences, professor of the Department of Humanities of the National Academy of Land Forces named after Hetman Petro Sahaidachny Andriy Haruk told about the new complex for combating Russian UAVs in a comment for ArmiyaInform. - Andrii Ivanovich, what do you know about this complex, which is marked with the rather mysterious name Kinetic Defense Vehicles (-Kinetic Defense Vehicles-, in Ukrainian)? - It should be noted that this system, which is also known by the acronym -KDV-, is a fairly new product of German gunsmiths. It was first introduced less than a year ago, in February 2024, at the Enforce TAC exhibition. - In the very name of this special equipment, -sewn- and the determination of the mobility of this weapon. - The KDV is based on an extended version of the Mercedes-Benz G jeep, known as the Enok MBB, which ensures high mobility and cross-country ability. A remote-controlled Slinger (R400S) turret from the Australian company Electro Optic Systems (EOS) with a 7.62×51 mm machine gun is installed on the chassis. The mass of the module is 355 kg. This turret is versatile and can be equipped with a 12.7 mm machine gun, a 40 mm automatic grenade launcher, or a 30 mm M230 cannon. From 2023 It is supplied to the Armed Forces of Ukraine and installed on modernized M113 armored personnel carriers and armored vehicles of the Praktika company. The detection system includes the Diehl Defense electro-optical system with machine vision technology for automatic target detection with a 360° field of view and the EchoGuard radar of the American company Echodyne, capable of detecting drones of the Phantom 4 type at a distance of up to 1 km and Matrice 600 at a distance of up to 1.4 km. - What else did the German gunsmiths put in this device? - Thanks to the combination of optical and radar systems, the KDV effectively detects and tracks small UAVs in various conditions. The minigun provides a high density of fire, allowing you to effectively destroy drones. The design allows the system to be adapted to different requirements, including the replacement of the chassis and the combat module. - And who manages KDV? - The crew of the complex consists of two people. The calculation is housed in an enclosed rear cockpit with control consoles for the anti-drone system. A report posted on the official portal of the German government states that according to data for December 2024, Germany transferred to Ukraine 12 such systems. — Your expert opinion on this latest piece of equipment? To what extent is this weaponry promising? - The Kinetic Defense Vehicle is a good solution in the field of local combat against UAVs. The high-density minigun in combination with the EchoGuard radar and opto-electronic station allows you to effectively neutralize both reconnaissance and strike drones. And from the point of view of the modularity of the design, it is quite possible to mount such systems on Ukrainian chassis (for example, on Kozak armored vehicles). In turn, experts of the defense portal IKK Defense Express (DE), who also studied the Kinetic Defense Vehicle pointed out that the Diehl surveillance system looks like a rather interesting addition to the capabilities of the combat module from EOS, because it allows you to detect targets in passive mode without exposing yourself to the radiation of the surveillance radar. -It should be added that the armament of the Kinetic Defense Vehicle can obviously be changed at the request of the customer, and instead of a minigun, an automatic cannon can be installed there. The chassis can also be changed, the requirements for which are quite moderate, because the weight of the Slinger is 355 kg,- stated researchers from DE.

-Antichrist- on the coat of arms: -narrow- invented new sensations about Ukraine	On the coat of arms, in addition to the anchor and golden wheat, Russian -symbolism experts- saw something more sinister. For example, anchor lines form ancient satanic symbols, and the waves of the Black Sea are nothing more than a coded sign of the devil. A little more, and they would find there a secret QR code for a ticket to hell. I was especially pleased with the comments about the colors. Blue and gold? Of course! These are symbols of universal evil! Although, if you recall, these colors are also on the coat of arms&#8230; of Ukraine. But who looks at such trifles when it is urgent to save the world from -Satanists-. Russian propaganda seems to have taken a new course: if they fail to intimidate with missiles, they will try to demoralize with mystical horror stories. Because what could be scarier than a regional coat of arms with supposedly hidden signs of dark forces? Well, except that it's a Ukrainian FPV drone with hello on board. What's next? Will Ukrainian vyshyvanka be called clothing for occult rituals? And the borscht is an elixir of immortality created according to the ancient recipes of dark magicians? Oh, sorry, there was already borscht. Everything is simple. When the country is going nuts, prices are rising, and rights are disappearing, it's always convenient to distract people with stories about an -external enemy.- Especially when the enemy is not just -Nazis- (that record is already broken), but entire followers of the Antichrist! It immediately becomes clear why nothing works for them: evil itself is at war with them! While Russian propagandists invent yet another fairy tale, Ukraine continues to fight, work and keep order. The coat of arms of Odesa is a symbol of history, strength and freedom. And we will leave all this nonsense about the -seal of the Antichrist- to the conscience of those who see -Ukronazi Satan- even in a cloud in the sky. And you know what's the funniest thing? There is nothing to scare Ukrainians anymore. Because if we have not been broken by shelling, war and even Russian propaganda, then some invented -seal- certainly will not. And if someone really wants to see real evil, let them look in the mirror. P.S. And yes, next time throw something more original. Because the Antichrist is fed up with everyone.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/17/antyhryst-na-gerbi-uzki-vygadaly-novi-sensacziyi-pro-ukrayinu/	2025-01-16T20:10:37-08:00

Ice swimming for $8000: the violator's attempt to cross the border failed	About this informs State Border Service of Ukraine. The response group stopped two men - residents of Poltava and Chernihiv regions in front of engineering barriers. The third violator overcame the barrier and ran into the water. Having crossed a few meters, he turned towards the shore. Then he went into the water again and came back again. -The body shrinks, the lungs narrow, there is nothing to breathe, as convulsions take place- - these are the impressions of the attempt to overcome the icy Tisza River shared by a resident of Lviv Oblast, who was saved by border guards of the Mukachevo detachment.

Ruins instead of rails: public transport in the style of the Russian world	informs about this Center of National Resistance. It is noted that from February 1, 40 Russian rubles will cost a ride in public transport in temporarily occupied Luhansk. And this despite the fact that there is no such public transport in the city. Locals have already gotten used to the fact that you cannot count on a route, tram or trolleybus. Not having a schedule or enough suitable transport is the least of the inconveniences. After all, the fleet is destroyed and it is simply dangerous to ride city buses. And the lack of drivers, who are simply mobilized into the enemy's army, completely destroyed the functionality of public transport in temporarily occupied Ukraine. As ArmyInform reported, in the occupied territory of Luhansk the condition of the sewage system is close to emergency, but the occupiers did not give commands to the local utilities solve this problem.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/16/ruyiny-zamist-rejok-gromadskyj-transport-u-styli-russkogo-myra/	2025-01-16T11:22:39-08:00

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced this during his visit to Kyiv on January 16, reports site of the UK government. The Gravehawk air defense system was developed in a short period of time specifically to meet the needs of Ukraine on the battlefield. The project is jointly financed by Great Britain and Denmark. The innovative system, the size of a sea container, can be upgraded to use air-to-air missiles for ground air defense, that is, it can use Ukrainian missiles that are already in service with the Armed Forces of Ukraine. -In conditions of constant Russian bombing, the Gravehawk system will strengthen Ukraine's air defense, which will allow it to protect its cities, troops and critical infrastructure,- the statement said. The British government said two prototypes of this air defense system were tested in Ukraine in September, and 15 more will be tested this year. -We are increasing UK support to Ukraine until 2025. Our plan will increase Ukraine's military capabilities, expand our training offer, strengthen defense-industrial ties and increase pressure on Putin,- British Defense Secretary John Gealey said.

According to him, the intensity of the assaults depends on several main factors. -Of course it's the weather conditions. That is, we are dealing with chernozem. Chernozem, when such a relative warming occurs, becomes virtually impassable for wheeled machinery and accordingly makes it difficult for wheeled machinery to advance,- said Bohdan Petrenko. He noted that because of this, the enemy carries out assaults mainly with the help of small assault groups. -When combat clashes are not taking place, there is control from our side, from the drone side, in order to detect these remnants of these assault groups and destroy them in order to prevent their passage to our strong points at all,- explained the head of the communications department 48 separate artillery brigade. We will remind, the Defense Forces repelled five enemy attacks in the Novopavlovsk direction. The occupiers most actively tried to advance near the settlements of Vremivka and Kostiantynopol. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in the Vremiv direction the enemy doesn't spare his infantry.

Surrounded Mariupol, complex operations at headquarters and wounded from Kurshchyna: the story of an...	The Russians came to his home, his native Donetsk region, twice: in 2014 - in Horlivka, and in 2022 - in Mariupol. He is an anesthesiologist. During the siege of Mariupol, he rescued the wounded for 21 days. Later, he left the city on the coast of the Sea of ​​Azov - when the Russians entered the territory of the hospital where he worked. Now Yelizar Grankov is in the ranks of the 71st military mobile hospital in the Sumy region. Coordinator of the department of anesthesiology and resuscitation, intensive care. Together with their brothers, they rescue the wounded from the Kursk direction. The resident of the department of anesthesiology joined the ranks of the Defense Forces in June 2023. He managed to get the primary officer rank - junior lieutenant. ArmyInform talked to the doctor during his vacation and shortly before his new business trip - about working in surrounded Mariupol and how he left the city (on a scooter, imagine!); about how he joined the ranks of the Defense Forces and rescued the wounded in the Sumy direction; about why science and military medicine should walk side by side in the current Ukrainian realities. And not only that. - Doctors in Mariupol civil hospitals are probably the people who first felt the war, because they had to work with a large number of wounded civilians. How intense were those days for you? - We felt the war very quickly. Literally half an hour after the first massive strikes, 5-6 AM on February 24, 2022. And then three weeks of intensive work, 24/7. At that time, I worked in several public institutions: in the 1st hospital in the city of Mariupol, a regional hospital, and in one private hospital. The footage from the Mariupol hospital in the tape -20 days in Mariupol- was filmed in our facility. Journalists found refuge in us and worked. — Mariupol in the spring of 2022. What was the most difficult thing for a doctor in a surrounded city? - We ran out of drugs, but we were allowed to take everything from the hospital pharmacy, and pharmacists and pharmacists brought drugs from the nearest pharmacies. But still: there were not enough drugs for the volumes and the number of people who came. Too many people, too great a flow of wounded. —What is the scariest memory you have during this time? And what, on the contrary, is a warm memory from that time that warms you? - You know, there was actually a lot of different things. But the worst thing is to hide children&#8230; It will be remembered forever, until the end of life - when it is simply impossible to save a small child who was torn apart by shells, fragments, bullets. I don't know what could be worse&#8230; Among the good memories is working with colleagues. Yes, then everyone was tired - but they helped each other, insured, worked, despite the fatigue. We lived these difficult three weeks in Mariupol as one big family, which fulfilled the main task of our lives: to save. In the surrounded Mariupol, there was purely -pure- medicine, without any other unnecessary thoughts at all. Just like now in the army - together with your brothers, your team, you don't think about money or anything - you just stood together and did your job. —You were leaving Mariupol through Berdyansk, and in one of the interviews you said that you managed to successfully pass one of the roadblocks thanks to your mother. Please tell us more about this episode. How many roadblocks were overcome in total? — There were more than 20 roadblocks. Some were passed quite quickly, some had long checks, they almost got into their underpants. The most difficult checkpoint was, in fact, in Berdyansk, where the -DNRivtsi- were stationed. We were also put under machine gun barrels to be shot, and when they saw that I was born in Horlivka, they asked why I didn't fight for -Mother Russia-. At first I traveled from the city on a scooter. Drove on it to a roadblock outside the city - then it discharged. We wanted to catch up with the car where my wife and father were. But it didn't work out, I realized that I wouldn't make it. There was a rather depressed state. Then my brother and I found the minibus where our mother was - and it turned out that there might be places for us too. There were six other young men there. Agree, it is difficult to drive through roadblocks with such a composition(smiles - ed.). And so it began at the checkpoint in Berdyansk: they were clinging to tattoos, to the residence permit - to everything. And our mother said: -If you take them away, take me with them, with my sons.- So we were quickly let go with the -get the hell out of here- argument. Six of our fellow travelers remained. But that was the decisive moment&#8230; The scooter also left with us, it is still with my parents. The road from Mariupol to Dnipro took a day. - What was the trigger when you decided to take a scooter and leave Mariupol? - We have been under the Russians for three days - they captured our hospital. On March 9, the last journalists left us, and on the 12th, the Russians arrived. They were even in the operating room. I had enough for three days. Medicines were running out, shelling did not stop, FABs were beating. Well, the Russians came in - it was clear that there would be further filtering, everyone would be closely watched. And since 2015, I have been -excluded- from the DPR - I expressed my opinion a lot, let's say. That is why I decided to leave Mariupol. —You became a part of the Oscar-winning film -20 days in Mariupol-. Do you feel like a part of the weapon in the information war, which works for the benefit of the civilized world, telling the truth without embellishments and propaganda? - Understanding this media has never been &#8230; But if there is any help and it's a way to convey some of the truth about Mariupol, not obscured by Russian bullshit propaganda&#8230; They simply destroyed Mariupol. There was a terrible cauldron. And the tape did not convey the horror that was happening in the city. If there was an opportunity, it would be possible to shoot even more that would shock the world. Because from time to time it is necessary to get such a terrible truth of ours in order for it to be heard and seen. — What brought you to the ranks of the Defense Forces? After all, you initially worked in the maternity hospital in Dnipro, and this work, in your words, became -therapy- for you. Why did you decide to join the ranks of military medics? - Yes, seeing how life is born is wonderful. But in March 2023, I came to work at the Main Military Clinical Hospital, first as a civilian doctor in the cardiac resuscitation department, and three months later I was mobilized. Until then, he worked in the 4th hospital of Kyiv for seven months. Yes, I actually worked for the Ministry of Defense and was booked, but there was an opportunity to get an officer's rank in two months, and for that I had to mobilize. That is why I made this decision. - What is your impression of the courses of the military medical academy? - The general idea is ok, but I believe that few people take this course, although we have a lot of medics who do not have a military department. And they either do not go to the Armed Forces, or, having a medical education, are in the positions of sergeants. Such courses are a great idea. Although when I was studying, the teachers operated according to norms that existed even before the large-scale invasion. This, I believe, is an outdated approach, because during this time the battlefield has changed a lot, to put it mildly, in military medicine. There was a lot of outdated information when I was studying. I don't know how it is now, maybe there are already changes. But science has to keep up with real war. A banal example: now there are FPV drones on the battlefield, which did not exist two years ago. Therefore, the academy must also change very quickly, transform its approaches, introduce new information into educational courses. - They say that war is always a catalyst for some kind of change. How is this reflected in your work as an anesthesiologist, for example, now in Sumshchyna? What has changed for the better, and what has changed for the worse? - There is development. As an anesthesiologist, I worked in operating rooms, in various departments, with adults, with children, in intensive care units, with seriously ill patients, etc. That is, there was a structure to how you work. Then covid began - the structure of work changed radically. And so the war began. And here, too, medicine is actually completely different: with injuries, with massive defects, with tourniquet syndromes, with bleeding, lung injuries. This was something special in the non-war period, and it is, unfortunately, the absolute norm now, during the war. And it is necessary to adjust to this new norm - to save and treat completely different injuries and other patients. Yes, the hospital has cool moments in terms of possibilities, analyses. There you are treated both in the operating room and in the intensive care unit. And when you work abroad, then&#8230; you are constantly -travelling-. 2024 I spent almost entirely in -travel-. When you arrive at a point, you need to get to know the doctors, the chief, other battalions and brigades, and medics. Lots of communication. It also happened that when we arrived at the stabilization point, we had to start everything from scratch: find a place to live, how to arrange and prepare everything. This is not taught anywhere - it comes with experience. In addition, standing in the northern direction, where the seriously wounded, learned many manipulations. It was at the -stabik- that he discovered a new picture of his work as an anesthesiologist: this work is fast, and the result of this work is whether he saved or not. Only this price. I can be proud of the fact that, thanks to the work of our team, thanks to the number of people there, none of our wounded died, everyone was saved. We had the maximum efficiency. Yes, there were -two hundred- - but they were already brought to us as such. And we tried to get people from that world anyway. We have had several such cases. But, unfortunately, the dead cannot be revived&#8230; - Can you remember a case when a seemingly hopeless wounded man arrived, and you pulled him out of the other world by an invisible thread? - There are more than enough such cases&#8230; From what can be remembered&#8230; Once a soldier was brought in with a wound in the leg, the surgeon began to apply an anastamosis to him in order to save the limb&#8230; And at the same moment, a senior lieutenant, unit commander, was brought to us. He was in agony, just gasping for air, pale, bleeding. He was given oxygen. There was a wound to the chest. Intubated. Adrenaline turned on. Intensive work continued, but the lungs still did not work and he could not keep the pressure. We transfused him with blood, put plasma&#8230; All this lasted about an hour. We tried to stabilize him, while the surgeon simultaneously saved another wounded man and his limb. Before that, he also placed a drain in the wounded officer's chest. After some time, it was thanks to this drainage that we realized that there was internal bleeding - a hole in the lung. We fully stabilized this injured person only after the surgeon had sutured the vessels and tissues. Sent to Sumy. Later it turned out that the officer had six broken ribs and six bleeding arteries. Our surgeon sewed up five of them in the initial conditions. Military survivor. This is one of the cases. And there were many of them in the conditions of the stabilization point. Our surgeon even performed an open heart massage several times: he cut the ribcage and pumped it. But these are just those cases when, unfortunately, a dead person was brought to us. And it was already such a gesture of last hope: either it will start or it won't. - What advice would you give to civilians who are afraid right now? Afraid, including joining the ranks of the Defense Forces? How to overcome fear? God&#8230; Being afraid of an uncle from the Military Commissariat is not something to be afraid of in life. Absolutely not. And in open access there is a lot of information about how to learn something, understand or motivate yourself and join the ranks of the Defense Forces. People are tired of war. Unfortunately But this is a normal, natural reaction. A person does not want to fight for 5 years, does not want to fight for 10 years. Everyone generally wants a little, little triumphant war - that would be class! - You left home twice: in 2014 - Horlivka, in 2022 - Mariupol? What gives you stability and the strength to hold on, go forward? - Good question&#8230; But in this context, I ask myself more about something else: what gives my parents the strength to hold on? They are now in their 70s. She lost her home 11 years ago. Three years ago, they lost their second home. And for them, the motivation to live is family, grandchildren&#8230; Neither money nor housing is a motivation here. Yes, the Russians took my house, then they took my house a second time. But&#8230; life was not taken away? I continue to live. And you have to continue living anywhere. The main thing is to be in Ukraine. What motivates me is that the Russians do not come here and destroy everything here, kill my child and my wife. Because I saw with my own eyes what happens where Russia comes. I am motivated by the idea of ​​my Ukrainian world. And in order not to be under the -Russian rule-. - What will be the end of the Russian-Ukrainian war for you? - And this is a very good question&#8230; Okay, so a truce is called—how much? A month, two, a year, three? The threat will still hang over us as long as the Russian Federation and its ideology exist. As long as the government and ideological attitudes in the heads of the Russian Federation do not change, until they realize that it is not necessary to trespass on their own land - until then there will be a constant permanent threat. Because this is an absolutely frozen nation. Well, we will go to the borders, for example, in 1991 - but who will prevent the Russians from unexpectedly launching a hundred missiles at us? And come here again? The Russians must admit and say that Ukraine is no longer part of the -development- plans of the Russian Federation. And the guarantees of the Western world are also important. Although we understand that now the world is shaking in all directions&#8230; And no one really knows what will happen next.

Economic results of 2024 and forecast for 2025: expert opinion	The year 2024 - the third year of a large-scale war - passed under the sign of the stabilization of the Ukrainian economy. After falling by 29% in 2022, our gross domestic product (GDP) grew by an initial 5.3% in 2023 and is expected to grow by around 4% in 2024. Thus, the national economy was able to avoid further declines, but it will take several more years to reach the level of 2021. The main factor of stabilization is the timely arrival of foreign financial aid. At the end of 2023, the situation was as uncertain as possible, as the European Union and the United States constantly postponed the adoption of multibillion-dollar support packages for Ukraine. However, in February (EU) and April (USA), the votes did take place, and we were able to cover the budget deficit in the amount of $3-5 billion every month. We start 2025 with a much greater margin of confidence. Ukraine can expect to receive more than $13 billion from the EU (Ukraine Facility program), more than $19 billion from revenues from frozen Russian assets under the ERA 7 plan, $3 billion from the IBRD, almost $3 billion from the IMF, as well as $1 billion from Great Britain. During the year, these funds should be enough to compensate for the deficit of the state budget in the amount of 25% of GDP. The gradual transition of the Ukrainian economy to a military mode continues. During the large-scale war, the capacity of the defense-industrial complex (OPK) increased 20 times, and in general, more than 500 companies of various forms of ownership work in the industry. During 2024, the volume of current contracts for the purchase of weapons exceeded half a trillion hryvnias (almost $15 billion), about half of which were concluded with Ukrainian manufacturers. to more than $400 million. Currently, there are more than 300 defense tech companies operating in Ukraine, the largest market segments are drones (19%), robotics (13%), artificial intelligence (13%). The most dynamically developing defense technology sector is production of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Substantial government investments contributed to an increase in the production of drones by more than 100 times. By the end of 2024, almost 100% of UAVs purchased by the state will be manufactured in Ukraine. According to the strategy of the Ministry of Strategic Industries, in 2024 Ukraine should have produced one million FPV drones and two million drones of all types in general. Unlike Ukraine, which thanks to foreign support has not yet before the full transition of the economy to military rails, the Russian economy is now completely dependent on the war machine. Moscow is forced to apply extraordinary fiscal and monetary policy measures to keep the country in normal economic conditions. For example, to constantly raise the central bank's discount rate in order to reduce the level of inflation. In July 2024, the Ministry of Finance tried to increase tax revenues by 4-5% of GDP, but due to the negative reaction of citizens, this initiative was withdrawn. However, in September, the Parliament still adopted a less rigid package of tax changes: an increase in the military levy on salaries from 1.5% to 5%, an increase in taxes for individual entrepreneurs, etc. Increasing taxes by itself for any which conditions are a heavy blow to the economy. In times of a large-scale war, it will have a particularly severe effect, taking away a significant potential for growth from the national economy. Shifting the burden of war onto the shoulders of the citizens of a belligerent country has always been a last resort when it is no longer possible to finance the war through income from abroad. Probably, the government takes such a step, having realized that Ukraine is in for a significant decrease in foreign support, or it will not be enough in the future. It is not yet known whether the Cabinet of Ministers will be able to collect the planned amount of tax revenues in full. However, it will definitely have the following consequences: the tax base will decrease due to the shadowing of the economy and conflicts between business and administrative bodies will increase. According to various estimates, in 2025 up to 50% of our economy will be in the shadows. Risks for the Ukrainian economy remain unchanged throughout the entire period of a large-scale war. Conducting active hostilities inside the country, constant shelling of peaceful cities, problems with electricity supply lead to the following negative consequences: a reduction in the number of economically active population due to emigration, a decrease in the volume of domestic and foreign investment in Ukrainian business, a significant increase in the costs of doing business. The increase in the inflation rate in 2024 to more than 10% is precisely due to the fact that entrepreneurs need to spend significantly more than before. The National Bank predicts a decrease in unemployment to 10-12% in 2025 (it was 14% at the end of 2024), but this is primarily due to an increase in the labor shortage. Another risk is the instability of the hryvnia exchange rate, although Ukraine is now able to control the main monetary variables without extreme actions. In particular, thanks to foreign revenues, the National Bank has been maintaining a sufficiently high level of international reserves for the third year - $35-45 billion, which makes it possible to prevent significant changes in the hryvnia exchange rate. But in 2024, the NBU's currency interventions to support the exchange rate increased by 20% compared to the previous year, which means that it costs us more and more to keep the exchange rate from sharp jumps. Ukraine's national debt is 92% of GDP, and in 2025 will exceed 100% of GDP. This signals high risks for the debt sustainability of public finances. However, in relation to our own GDP, we owe less than most of the completely peaceful G7 countries: the USA, France, Great Britain, Canada, Japan. 2025, the Ukrainian economy begins with slogans of readiness to continue a large-scale war in the long term . The increase in defense spending should strengthen Ukraine's stability in the long-term resistance to the occupiers. Hopes for Western support remain key, but the government is already preparing for possible challenges caused by a potential reduction in foreign aid, even if these preparatory actions harm the national economy. Given Russia's colossal military budget, our allies must realize the inevitability of military realities in the center of Europe for many years to come. Even if the front line is frozen, the pursuit of weapons will continue, because Russia is not going to give up its territorial claims. At most, the resources of the entire West, which can be freed up thanks to the cessation of active hostilities, should be thrown into the maximum strengthening of the Ukrainian war machine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/16/ekonomichni-pidsumky-2024-go-ta-prognoz-na-2025-rik-dumka-eksperta/	2025-01-15T20:51:16-08:00
Never Sleep: The Pentagon has announced the deployment of a new AI-based aerial surveillance system	This advanced system, designed to protect strategic facilities such as the White House, the Capitol and the US Supreme Court, is a significant step in strengthening air security, ArmyInform reports. -This is part of a broader effort to prevent threats similar to the events of September 11, 2001, when hijacked aircraft targeted important symbolic and strategic facilities, including the Pentagon,- the United States Department of Defense emphasized. The new system, known as Enhanced Regional Situational Awareness (ERSA), combines advanced visual recognition cameras and lasers. It includes AI-based identification and tracking capabilities, offering significant improvements over older similar equipment. Manufactured by technology company Teleidoscope, this system replaces equipment installed in 2002, which itself was a post-9/11 replacement for previous technologies. ERSA cameras feature both electro-optical and infrared imaging, high-definition resolution, and features such as infrared coloration that improve target detection using thermal signatures. These capabilities are further supported by a laser rangefinder that accurately measures the distance and height of objects. According to US Air Force Master Sergeant Kendrick Wilburn, who directs operations at the Joint Air Defense Operations Center (JADOC), the system can automatically engage and track moving targets using machine learning algorithms. The more the system is used, the more accurate it becomes, improving its own overall efficiency. -If we need to verify some radar data that we can't say for sure what the object is, we can use the camera system as a viewing asset at that fixed location to assist our technicians in the verification process,- Wilburn noted. . If ERSA operators determine that an unidentified aircraft poses a threat, they can provide early warning to unauthorized air traffic by notifying the pilot of the need to change direction and leave the special flight rules area in the Washington metropolitan area. The system also includes a visual warning device using a red-green laser that alerts aircraft that do not respond to commands to immediately leave the Special Flight Regulations Area (SFRA). These eye-safe lasers help avoid the need to deploy expensive military aircraft to investigate potential breaches. Wilburn explains that these visual cues, which operators call -sparkles,- often prompt pilots to correct their course and, if necessary, contact the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). This advanced protection system was developed to solve the complex challenges of protecting urban airspace. Testing conducted in 2022 compared several camera prototypes, with the Teleidoscope emerging as the better choice due to significant software improvements. Two cameras are currently operational, with plans to deploy seven more cameras each year in future phases. The improvements made by the ERSA system have already changed the way air threats are identified and managed. Wilburn notes that the cameras are capable of detecting and tracking small targets, such as birds in flight, capabilities that were not possible with previous systems. In addition, the partial automation of the equipment allows operators to focus on more complex analytical tasks, such as assessing the intent of suspicious aircraft.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/16/nikoly-ne-splyat-pentagon-ogolosyv-pro-rozgortannya-novoyi-systemy-povitryanogo-sposterezhennya-na-osnovi-shi/	2025-01-15T20:36:38-08:00
More than 100,000 kilometers for the sake of support: how the patronage service of the 46th DSHV bri...	Captain Vadym Volynsky, senior officer of the psychological support department, told ArmyInform about the work of the patronage service of the 46th separate airmobile brigade of the Airborne Assault Troops of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. - The patronage service is a freelance structure of the brigade. Her main task is to work with wounded servicemen, visiting them in all medical, treatment, and rehabilitation facilities within the borders of Ukraine. An equally important task of the patronage service is to support the families of dead, missing and captured servicemen. The need for such a structure increased significantly after a large-scale invasion. The charity foundation -Angels- of -Azov- and the Third Assault Brigade became a role model. We monitor their work, try to adopt the best practices and implement them, based on our available forces, means and financial capabilities. The full patronage service of our brigade started working in February-March 2024. Before that, we had already worked with the wounded, but at first selectively in the nearest hospitals — we start working with the wounded by interacting with representatives of the medical service, medical company, and civil-military cooperation. Our psychologists from the combat stress control group, the psychological recovery group deal with all this. Representatives of our medical company provide them with lists of servicemen - who is being treated where, and they travel around Ukraine and visit the wounded. Usually there are two crews, in each of which one or two representatives of the brigade. In 2024, they covered more than 100,000 kilometers and visited more than 500 servicemen of the brigade in all corners of Ukraine. Representatives of the patronage service help to solve all problematic issues faced by the wounded - from providing basic household items to drawing up all the necessary documents. There can be a lot of problematic issues, but we try to solve them either on our own, or we already reach out to some public organizations, charitable foundations, volunteers who can help with this. We engage famous people, bloggers, and influencers to draw attention to wounded servicemen who need our help and support. — The main goal is to help and support a wounded serviceman. It is also a way to show that no one is left to fend for themselves. So that everyone feels: they are not forgotten, issues are resolved, and the team takes care of their own. The work of the patronage service has a very good effect on our soldiers, increases their morale and fighting spirit. Thanks to this, more servicemen want to return to their units and rejoin the ranks after being wounded. It also increases the reputation of the brigade, the Airborne Assault Forces and the Armed Forces of Ukraine as a whole. One of the components of comprehensive assistance to the wounded is the preparation of all necessary documents. A soldier reports a problematic issue, and we immediately call the deputy battalion commander for psychological support of personnel on the spot and try to resolve everything immediately. Accordingly, he further interacts with other representatives of other departments. It is usually possible to resolve everything within a period of one to three days. And then we send the necessary document by mail to the fighter where he is. This is such a bureaucratic procedure, but in the army there is really a lot of paperwork that someone has to do and do it well. — I will tell you how we worked in 2024. Together with representatives of civil-military cooperation, we compiled lists of the number of children in the families of dead, missing and captured fighters. We established cooperation with the management of the -Roshen- confectionery factory and, before the International Children's Day on June 1, held an event for children with animators and gifts: children up to 7 years old were given Lego sets, 8-12 years old - tablets, and 13-18 years old - mobile phones . Before the Day of Knowledge on September 1, a joint action with volunteers was also held - we sent school backpacks and stationery sets to children who were going to the first grade. Some were even able to be visited in person, and gifts were sent by mail to those we were unable to visit. The same was true for St. Nicholas Day on December 6, Christmas on December 25 and New Year on December 31. We are also in constant contact with the families of these three categories of servicemen - dead, missing and captured. The children and their relatives saw that the brigade remembers the service and feat of their sons, fathers, brothers and husbands, who gave the most valuable thing for Ukraine - their lives. — Work with the families of the missing is the most difficult, because it is the unknown that exhausts people. We provide the following advice: The psychological state of children depends on the mother or wife. It is important to take matters into your own hands and contact psychologists. Children feel their mother's condition. Keep them as stable as possible and pay attention to their emotions. We advise you to reduce the time spent in Telegram channels in search of loved ones. It is exhausting and mentally damaging. Instead, contact the units where the missing person served, relatives or witnesses to get more information. Many regions have free support programs for families of missing persons or prisoners. Many veterans' administrations and centers have support programs where families can get legal, psychological and practical help. We also provide contact information for such organizations. If you suspect that your loved one has been captured, contact the Red Cross or other humanitarian organizations that deal with prisoners of war. — It is possible to reliably confirm information about the serviceman's stay in captivity through the International Committee of the Red Cross. As practice shows, this is the only way to do it. It is there that they should confirm which person was recorded on the video found on the information resources of the occupiers. It is necessary to work with the families of the missing as much as possible, to be in constant contact with them. For this purpose, we hold various briefings, organize video conference calls, and work together with the Coordination Headquarters on matters of treatment of prisoners of war. This is done by our civil-military cooperation representatives. Also, the patronage service has pages on social networks, where we publish information about where to go for psychological help and support for family members of missing servicemen. This is also an important aspect of the job. - In a purely human way, I understand why people do this. They want to engage in some activity that they believe will have a result, will bring benefits. However, it is not really worth doing this, because no one will give you more information than a military unit, but this way you can cause serious damage to a soldier who is in captivity. It is a very bad idea to put a photo in open access, publish personal data - surname, military rank, position, unit or brigade in which a soldier serves. The release of such information does more harm than good. Having more information about the serviceman than he himself provided, the enemy will be able to find additional leverage and pressure on him. After learning about the rank and position, the occupiers will begin to demand from him to provide information of interest to them. Therefore, it is not worth publishing such ads, because they will only harm. — These people should be given psychological support, explained and convinced that sooner or later everything bad ends. Psychologists, representatives of the patronage service visit the families of prisoners, help them cope with tension, overcome despair. It is very important for people to see that they are not left alone with their grief, with their problems. Likewise, psychologists work with families of seriously wounded soldiers who have special needs and require special care. An important role is played by our chaplain service, which meets the spiritual and religious needs of such families, helps them not to despair and not to give up. This always has a good result.

Russia invented the fire - cottages of Ukrainian generals - in Los Angeles	One of the latest fakes claims that eight cottages belonging to Ukrainian generals, worth a total of $90 million, allegedly burned down in Los Angeles. This fiction was actively spread through various Russian media and Telegram channels. The information about the -burnt cottages- was first published by the Voenny obozrevatel Telegram channel on January 11, 2025. Subsequently, this -news- was picked up by such Russian media as Gazeta.ru, Lenta.ru, EADaily, Komsomolskaya Pravda, and Tsargrad. In their publications, they claimed that Ukrainian generals purchased real estate in the United States with funds received from Western financial aid to Ukraine. This information is completely baseless and untrue. The video shared with this fake is fake. No reputable media, including the United24 platform, published similar materials. In addition, the commander of the Ground Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Major General Mykhailo Drapaty, who was credited with commenting on this event, never made such statements. The main purpose of this fake is to discredit the Armed Forces of Ukraine and create a negative image of the Ukrainian military leadership. By spreading such fictions, Russian propaganda is trying to undermine the international community's trust in Ukraine and reduce the support provided by Western partners. This case is another example of the information war that Russia is waging against Ukraine. It is important to be critical of such -news- and to verify information through reliable sources so as not to fall prey to propaganda and misinformation.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/16/rosiya-vygadala-pozhezhu-kotedzhiv-ukrayinskyh-generaliv-u-los-andzhelesi/	2025-01-15T20:08:19-08:00

As he told himself on Facebook, the key topic of discussion became support of our country in 2025, particularly in the defense and technology sectors. -Special emphasis is placed on the need to strengthen Ukrainian air defense, which is critical due to constant attacks by ballistic and cruise missiles, as well as drones aimed at civilian and critical infrastructure,- the head of the Ministry of Defense emphasized, adding that together with representatives of intelligence, they informed Estonian partners about the situation at the front and key needs of the Defense Forces. In addition, the parties discussed the prospects of deepening cooperation between the two countries in the field of digital technologies, since Estonia, as a co-leader of the IT coalition, makes a significant contribution to the development of this industry in Ukraine. -We outlined the key areas where we need support, in particular, the financing of defense production. Margus Tsakhkna confirmed Estonia's readiness to support Ukraine and agreed with the idea of ​​using frozen Russian assets as a resource to strengthen our defense capabilities,- added Rustem Umyerov. As reported by ArmyInform, during the meeting with the delegation of the Latvian Sejm led by speaker Daiga Mierina, the Minister of Defense of Ukraine discussed production UAV for income from frozen assets of the Russian Federation.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/15/rustem-umyerov-ta-glava-mzs-estoniyi-obgovoryly-posylennya-ukrayinskoyi-ppo/	2025-01-15T12:02:10-08:00
Illegal tourists were detained near the state border with underage smugglers	About this informs State Border Service of Ukraine. As the border guards established, the detainees turned out to be residents of the Ternopil region. They planned to illegally cross the border with the help of two local residents, who received $9,000 for their services. Later, the border guards detained two more teenagers, 15 and 16 years old, who accompanied the violators to the border. Their task was to report to the main organizer of the illegal scheme, who managed the operation remotely. Administrative materials have been compiled in relation to detained illegal migrants. Due to the fact of an attempt to illegally transport persons across the state border of Ukraine, a notification was sent to the law enforcement agencies under Art. 332 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine. Information is entered in the Unified Register of Pretrial Investigations. Operatives of the Chernivtsi border detachment continue measures to establish the location of the organizer of the scheme. ArmyInform reminds that it is better not to break the law or risk your life, but to use the aggregator of vacancies in the Armed Forces and recruiting centers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/15/poblyzu-derzhkordonu-zatrymaly-nezakonnyh-turystiv-z-nepovnolitnimy-perepravnykamy/	2025-01-15T11:53:53-08:00
Patrolmen caught the occupant right in the toilet	The relevant video was published on its Telegram channel by the Khyzhak Brigade of the Patrol Police of Ukraine. The released footage shows how an FPV drone flies to the invader, who sat in a street toilet among the ruins of a settlement destroyed by the Soviet Union, destroying his improvised shelter. -The occupier wanted to brainstorm his actions on the pot, but the FPV of predators interrupted this meeting,- Ukrainian defenders noted. And although the Russian himself, unlike the toilet, unfortunately survived after the impact, however, thanks to the skill of the Ukrainian UAV operators, it most likely did not last long. As reported by ArmyInform, earlier the fighters of the 28th OMBr named after the Knights of the Winter Campaign showed how the UAV -Vampire- literally -splits the invaders into atoms-.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/15/patrulni-pidlovyly-okupanta-pryamo-u-tualeti/	2025-01-15T11:42:02-08:00
She paid taxes in the occupied Kherson region: another accomplice of the Russians was exposed	The Kherson Regional Prosecutor's Office informs about this. According to the investigation, in 2022 the accused, who held the position of senior state inspector of the Skadovsk State Tax Inspectorate of the State Tax Service of the Kherson region, voluntarily agreed to cooperate with the occupation authorities.

This was stated by the Chairman of the NATO Military Committee, Admiral Rob Bauer . -Today is the 1057th day of the war, which, according to Russia, was supposed to last three days. It will be three years next month... The reality is that the Kremlin has still not achieved any of its strategic goals while 700,000 Russians have been killed and wounded,- said Rob Bauer. He emphasized that due to the Russian invasion, Ukrainians face torture, rape, kidnapping of children and adults, complete denial of their identity, infiltration camps and mass burials. -The struggle for -freedom- is not a pathetic slogan here. This is what they do every day. -Sovereignty- is not an abstract term. This is the difference between when you decide your own destiny, or when it is indicated to you in Moscow,- the admiral explained. Rob Bauer emphasized that Ukraine needs and deserves NATO's full support, and this support is in the Alliance's political and military interests. -We must show the world that democracy can and will win. Our task is to strengthen the deterrence and defense of the Alliance and at the same time support Ukraine in its resistance to Russia's unprovoked aggression,- concluded the head of the NATO Military Committee.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/15/golova-vijskovogo-komitetu-nato-nazvav-vtraty-rosiyan-za-try-roky-vijny-proty-ukrayiny/	2025-01-15T02:18:48-08:00

The Defense Forces declared an advantage in the use of drones in the Lyman direction	This was told by the commander of the 63rd on the air of the telethon -Only News- of a separate mechanized brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Colonel Pavlo Yurchuk. According to him, in the Lyman region up to 90% of Russian equipment is destroyed thanks to drones and artillery. The Ukrainian military actively uses modern fiber-optic FPV drones, which ensure high accuracy of strikes. -Up to 80-90% of the enemy's equipment is destroyed by our drones and artillery. The enemy has not yet managed to achieve parity, our forces are superior in terms of the number and accuracy of the use of unmanned systems,- Pavlo Yurchuk noted. As for supplying the brigade with drones and artillery, there are almost no problems. The brigade commander noted that the supply of ammunition is also at an adequate level, although not ideal. The main problem remains the limited replenishment of personnel. However, as Colonel Yurchuk emphasized, even in such a situation, the Ukrainian army acts rationally, not wasting human resources thoughtlessly, as the enemy does. -We really need more people to better maintain the defense line. But even with thousands of soldiers, we will not use human resource like the Russians do. We perfectly understand that the enemy cannot be defeated with human resources alone,- Pavlo Yurchuk emphasized. As reported by ArmyInform, the enemy attacked in the Lyman direction 17 times.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/15/u-sylah-oborony-zayavyly-pro-perevagu-v-zastosuvanni-droniv-na-lymanskomu-napryamku/	2025-01-15T01:05:58-08:00

The enemy reduced the use of helicopters over the Black Sea after two Mi-8s were shot down	The spokesperson of the Navy of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, a captain of the 3rd rank, told about this on the air of -Suspilny- Dmytro Pletenchuk. -The intensity of the use of helicopters has decreased due to the fact that, given the new dangers, the enemy is drawing certain conclusions about their use. But they are still used, the enemy cannot completely abandon the anti-drone fight, but the intensity has decreased,- Dmytro Pletenchuk said. The spokesman of the Armed Forces Navy also noted that there is a season of storms in the Black Sea, which may affect the use of warships by the Russians. -The season of storms does not affect the possibility of going to sea, but rather the application. Because, as a rule, during strong sea waves, the carriers are not used specifically for striking,- he said. It should be noted that this morning, according to preliminary information, during a combined missile attack, the enemy used Kalibr missiles from the Black Sea. At that moment, there was one enemy missile carrier in the sea , capable of carrying up to four missiles.
