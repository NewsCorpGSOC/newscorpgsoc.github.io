Commanded a missile attack on Okhmatdyt: the suspicion was reported to the Russian general	About this informs September 10 SBU. He turned out to be Lieutenant General Serhii Kobylash, who at that time held the position of long-range aviation commander of the Air Force of the Russian Aerospace Forces. Subsequently, after the strike on Okhmatdyt, he was promoted and appointed commander of the Russian Air Force. This was announced by Deputy Head of the SBU Serhii Naumyuk during a working meeting with Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court Karim Khan and Prosecutor General Andriy Kostin. -During the period of the investigation, the SBU, together with the Prosecutor General's Office, carried out tremendous work. We interrogated 112 victims and 50 eyewitnesses, conducted explosive, forensic and other examinations, analyzed videos from surveillance cameras,- Serhiy Naumyuk said. As the investigation established, by order of Kobylash, on July 8, 2024 at 9 a.m. 15 minutes a Russian Tu-95MS missile-carrying bomber launched an Kh-101 missile at a children's hospital in Kyiv. According to the Deputy Head of the Security Service of Ukraine, the 22nd Guards Heavy Bomber Aviation Division of the Long-range Aviation of the Russian Aerospace Forces carried out the shelling of Okhmatdyt. -It was established that the enemy plane took off from an airfield near the Russian city of Olenegorsk, and the missile was launched over the Saratov region of the Russian Federation at a distance of almost 600 km from the border of Ukraine,- the report said. From the territory of Russia, the Kh-101 entered the airspace of our country in the region of Chernihiv Oblast and began to maneuver, constantly changing its flight path through the territories of four regions. This indicates that the missile was programmed to maximally -bypass- Ukrainian air defense and further hit the medical facility. At approximately 10:45, a Russian X-101 hit the department of intensive and efferent therapy of acute and chronic intoxications of the Okhmatdyt hospital. At the scene of the incident, law enforcement officers found the remains of an enemy missile with markings indicating that it was manufactured on the basis of the Russian Raduga design center in the second quarter of 2024. On the basis of the collected evidence, the investigators of the Security Service informed Kobylash about suspicion in absentia under Part 2 of Art. 28, part 2 of Art. 438 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (violation of the laws and customs of war, combined with intentional murder, committed by a group of persons according to a prior conspiracy). -Kobylash is currently suspected of committing other war crimes in Ukraine. In particular, attacks on civilian energy infrastructure were carried out under his leadership in 2022-2023. In March 2024, the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Kobylash precisely for these war crimes,- emphasized Serhiy Naumyuk. Since the perpetrator is on the territory of Russia, comprehensive measures are underway to bring him to justice for crimes against our state. We will remind you that on July 8, Russia carried out a massive attack on Ukraine. The enemy fired about 40 rockets of various types. One of the Russian missiles in Kyiv -po-dytyachij-likarni/->hit the building of the Okhmatdit Children's Hospital. As a result of the shelling, 2 people died, including a pediatric nephrologist.

Attacks in the style of Mad Max: Russian infantry climbs forward on buggies and motorcycles	The spokesman of the National Guards of Ukraine Ruslan Muzychuk. However, this does not mean that the Russians have a shortage of heavy equipment. It's just that it's regularly destroyed. -As for the Kharkiv direction, two weeks ago we saw two attempts of large convoys of equipment, where more than six units of armored vehicles were used, including tanks, BMPs of the enemy. But we can see that even along this section of the front it makes it possible to destroy such enemy forces and even convoys of equipment. They are destroyed quite quickly in interaction with units that use UAVs and with artillery units,- says the spokesperson of the National Guard. That is why the Russian infantry have to go forward on anything that has wheels. -We see that in order to ensure the advance of infantry groups and sometimes deliver logistics in this area, the enemy uses light vehicles, motorcycles and buggy-type equipment,- states Ruslan Muzychuk Yak reported ArmyInform, fighters of the Khortytsy Drive unit of the 2nd operational battalion assignment of the 15th -Kara-Dag- brigade of the National Guard filmed the defeat of the occupier, who was hiding at a public transport stop.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/10/ataky-v-styli-skazhenogo-maksa-rosijska-pihota-lize-vpered-na-bagi-ta-motoczyklah/	2024-09-09T23:19:50-07:00

15 km per day through enemy territory and the myth of strong intelligence of the Russian Federation:...	Military expert Petro Chernyk told ArmyInform about this: -The Kursk operation is actually very, very successful. I would call it (an operation. â€” Ed.) global order. And it is necessary to understand why it happened. The first point: this is really an attempt to divert the enemy's forces and means from the main Donetsk direction. Only at first glance, this issue is unrealized. But in reality it is not so. Why? Because the combat army reserves are between 10 and 15 percent. So, if the enemy has 600,000 personnel along the battle line, then the mandatory reserve: 60,000-70,000 is still engaged. This is a very important moment. Next, this is a completely and definitively dispelled myth that one cannot enter the territory of the enemy, because, they say, it is a nuclear country, and the apocalypse will definitely happen. However, the apocalypse did not happen. And the most important goal, and it is, in fact, very promising: sooner or later it will reach the negotiation process. We are well aware that there will be no direct conversation between Ukraine and Russia. But according to the grain agreement, when we, Ukrainians, signed certain agreements with the Turks and the UN, and then Russia signed certain agreements with the Turks and the UN, then such a scenario could happen. And at this point we have to have a very, very strong position-. If for the enemy, Donetsk region and Luhansk region are of principle, then Kherson region and Zaporizhia region are not so principled. And according to the principle of such exchange â€” i.e., we return Kursk Oblast to them, and they return Zaporizhia and Kherson Oblast to us â€” such a scenario is quite possible. From the point of view of the organization's tactics and strategy, the operation is brilliant. Why is it shiny? Because it is breakthrough. In the first days of the operation, our forces moved at a speed of up to 10 km per day, and in some locations up to 15. I must remind you that the enemy covered almost the entire dry the weather passes several kilometers in the direction of Pokrovsk. Therefore, our speed is incredible. And most importantly: there is a myth that Russia has very strong intelligence. If the Russians could not calculate and see such an operation, then their intelligence is very, very bad. Any war, and especially the current one, has only three main laws. This is the concentration of the enemy's forces and means, the coordinated work of the military branches, and the third law, it was fully implemented here and very qualitatively, this is the hidden management of the troops. Being able to assemble several shock combat brigades, move them efficiently, provide them with equipment and break through the border â€” this is really a sign of the great quality of our operational art.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/10/15-km-na-dobu-vorozhoyu-terytoriyeyu-ta-mif-pro-sylnu-rozvidku-rf-ekspert-pro-blyskuchu-operacziyu-syl-oborony-na-kurshhyni/	2024-09-09T20:30:37-07:00
Combat took 14 tankers and two marines out of the encirclement: the story of lieutenant colonel Grud...	&#8230;On February 23, 2022, a battalion of a separate tank brigade named after Kostyantyn Pestushka was raised due to an alarm, and Oleg took it to a designated concentration area. - To be honest, there was nothing to indicate that a large-scale invasion would begin. The relevant order was received, we went out according to the training plans. But on the morning of February 24, around 4 a.m., the connection was dead. Reports began from posts that explosions were heard and bright flashes were seen at the base camp. In addition, we used the Viraj-tablet air defense system. The operator called me to see what was happening, and there were about 30 planes on the radar. We understood that a serious war had begun, the officer recalls. Around 10 o'clock Oleg Grudzevych's tank battalion reached the border in the Volnovakha district. There, the tankers found the first hours of a large-scale invasion. It was very hot near Volnovakha - the Russians broke through the defense of one of the infantry battalions. â€” Our unit suffered its first losses there â€” the tank crew was killed. We went away with hard fights - pearls scattered like mad. According to intelligence data, there were convoys of 70 units, and 50, 30, 20. I remember how successfully one crew - an officer's crew - worked. The thing is that Major Serhii Brovkin, the deputy commander, was there for the gunner, and Captain Pavlo Grelya for the tank commander. So they destroyed two BMP-3 with one shot. The armor-piercing projectile pierced both cars of the Rashists, and it was so successful that they exploded one after another, inflating like bubbles. And the column did not even stop, the Rashists simply did not understand what had happened, says Oleg Grudzevych. He remembered the first days of the large-scale invasion as continuous battles, maneuvers, retreats, counterattacks, and at the same time the realization that the Rashists could be beaten. And he still cannot forget how the local population helped the Ukrainian soldiers. When our tanks simply ran out of fuel on February 27, volunteers from one of the settlements, which is currently temporarily captured, came to help. Farmers shared the fuel, pouring 200 liters into each tank. As Oleg recalls, he managed to gather his units, and on February 28, the tankers entered Mariupol on the territory of the Azovmash plant, where, together with the marines, they began fighting for the city. Oleg tells about those battles calmly, as if it were about ordinary work: - The schedule of the orcs was like a working day. It's dawn - they're on the move, small arms are working. It begins to pout - shooting battles stop, artillery and aviation begin to work. On the 13th, a mechvod (mechanic-driver. â€” Ed.) died. We tried to protect the team link, but still they had to take risks, there was simply no other strength. Already on the 2nd or 3rd day of the fighting, we moved to the basement. Battalions were still stationed around the city perimeter, tanks were moving out, there were constant skirmishes, Russian artillery and aviation were already in full swing. They calculated the location of headquarters on -Azovstal- and -Azovmash-, and aviation worked on them. Mines and -Hradi- were already flying to the plant. The Azov people came to us and said: -We don't understand their mathematics: 50 people attack every day from one direction. 20-30 turn around, they will lose a lot of equipment and tanks. The next morning it's 50 again.- The fighting continued at this pace until the end of March. On March 15, the tankers ran out of drinking water and food. Oleg thinks, then continues: - We started drinking water from the fire-fighting ponds that were at the factory. Water and green, but there was no way out. There was also no supply of ammunition and food, later we began to count literally every projectile for tanks, sukhpai. The ring was getting tighter every day, we were moving away little by little. Orcs were literally pelting us with cannon fodder. We had no news or communication, but we stood on the perimeter of the plant, holding Azovmash - 800 meters, in the roundabout. I had 2 combat-ready tanks left, mine and one more, and 2 or 3 vehicles were from the 36th brigade. They went to work in pairs. Scatter on all sides of the pearl. All the anti-aircraft gunners and tankers I had were already working as infantrymen, going on 8-hour shifts. I remember how on April 5, an enemy tank broke into the territory of -Azovmash-, but it was knocked out. Every evening, as soon as it got dark, the Russians came out and began to -pour- everywhere with a double frenzy. We understood that we would not last another week. Oleg recalls that the first attempt to break through the encirclement was on April 10. They tried to break through the territory of the Ilyich plant, but, unfortunately, the attempt was unsuccessful. The next day, another breakout attempt, this time successful. Two tanks that remained from Oleg's battalion with the remains of shells: one had about 20 shells in the conveyor, the other tank had 15. The unit left the factory. â€” Our plan was as follows: to the road, if there is an opportunity, we break through on equipment. When the tanks stop, then we blow up the equipment, and then we move on foot, in groups of 10-15 people. The connection was reset and checked. On April 11, around midnight, they started moving. Next to my tank was a -motolyga- (light armored multi-purpose transporter. - Ed.), people were sitting on it, including the wounded. I tell the officer that I will divert fire on myself. And I will not leave them alone. I give tasks to the commander, the mechanic. We were lucky that it was raining that night and there were no drones. I say to the commander of another unit that was with us: -While we are shooting for 30-40 minutes, stay a kilometer away from me. You see the transfer of fire - move behind us to the distance that we have advanced. And this is how we move - from border to border.- &#8230;The breakthrough was frantic - tankers opened fire, burned Russian equipment, the infantry also did their job. Then the tanks ran out of fuel and stopped. There were no shells either. Tankers took out night lights, radios, sights and destroyed everything they could. They took with them small arms, ammunition, grenades, remnants of sukhpay, water. They moved behind the rear of the Rashists. Today, few people can imagine what it is like to move in the enemy's environment. Expect a shot, a rupture, a mine detonation, a random meeting with the occupiers or local traitors at any moment. Oleg speaks sparingly about the exit. â€” Before the breakthrough, thanks to Starlink, I downloaded an offline map and took a normal one. We knew roughly where our units would be and how far we had to go. It was 138 kilometers straight, and all 175 to bypass the Rashisti. They planned the movement as follows: we walk at night, warm up at the same time, and hide somewhere during the day. The only thing that bothered me a lot was the cold. Although, perhaps, it saved us in the end, because the enemy also did not want to peek somewhere in such abominable weather. On the first day, the main thing was to get as far away from the abandoned equipment as possible. Population centers were bypassed. But we went to one, Znamenivka, not far from Anatolia - there was a bridge over the river near the reservoir. We came across a Russian DRG near the bridge. We -put down- one occupant, ran across that concrete bridge and lay down in a rather large landing. From 8 in the morning to 9 in the evening, they stayed in that landing. The opponent was afraid to comb her. For 4 hours, they drove next to each other, released only a few queues in our direction. Then we got somewhere - they probably thought that we had gone along the creek. We were very tired, because we had been out for the 3rd day. So, after resting a little in that landing, they filled up with water and moved along the river. There they ran into another group of Rashists. There was a short fight, one of them was definitely -killed-, but a bullet or two hit our fighter in the backpack. The soldier is running, the backpack is on fire, I shout to him: -Drop that backpack!-, and he: -Go away, there are grenades!- â€” -All the more, throw him to hell!-. He tore off that backpack and threw it away. We then broke away and went for several days without fire contact. Somewhere on the 6th or 7th day, they finished off the remaining sukhpai, began to look for sorrel, rummaged through garbage cans - they thought they would find something. On one of the days we almost got caught. We leave the next landing - and here our soldier noticed a tent 20 meters away, and some antennas there. They passed 300-400 meters. In the morning I already say: -Let's not go anywhere, because our legs hurt, our stomachs hurt, it's raining.- There are still about 40 kilometers to the front. Next is a quarry with sand, they thought to wait in it, and there were 20 Urals with Zetkas. We hear - somewhere behind, the generator started up, 400 meters away. I think they have come. It saved that the weather was bad, it was raining. So they lay near the quarry. Orcs were loaded with sand, no one else was seen until evening. Then they went very carefully - I sent a patrol of 2-3 people ahead. At 500 meters, if clear, they turned back, and we continued. Walked all the time with their phones turned off - I warned them to charge the power banks before leaving, and everyone turned off their phones except for me. I say - if I see someone's phone, I will shoot my knees! Of course, I wouldn't have done that, but no one was using the phones, because the Russians track cellular communications clearly. About 15 kilometers before the collision line, I see one -Life- strip appeared on my phone, but I couldn't make a call. On the 9th day, 2 -sticks- appeared on the phone. He called the brigadier general, he didn't recognize us at first, then he was happy. I got together with the unit commander who was ahead of us, and for the last 12 hours he helped us go. I remember how he tells us that there is a small area that will have to be run. And our legs are no longer carrying us, and our stomachs hurt, I was vomiting blood. The guys took my machine gun and backpack from me, they say: -We will deliver them, your task is to prove us.- And so they came&#8230; They cried because they almost didn't believe that we would make it. They have experienced so much&#8230; They came, fell down, we were given a cigarette and water to drink. He called his commander back, the next day our brigade came to pick us up. There were 16 people with me. Two of them are from the 36th Brigade. For this breakthrough from Mariupol and exit, in fact, he received the -Golden Star-. I do what I can, no more and no less. At the moment, we are temporarily on recovery, soon they will give a new command, because the Rashists must be beaten in order to return home as soon as possible. In addition to the -Golden Star- of the Hero of Ukraine, which was personally awarded to Oleh Grudzevych by the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyi during a visit to the unit, for the battles near Volnovakha and Mariupol, the officer was also awarded two orders of Bohdan Khmelnytsky III and II degrees.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/10/kombat-vyviv-z-otochennya-14-tankistiv-i-dvoh-morpihiv-istoriya-pidpolkovnyka-grudzevycha/	2024-09-09T20:19:14-07:00
-Dirty bomb-, biolaboratories and what are the Chechens doing here: what is the Kremlin mouthpiece c...	During the meeting of the Ninth Eastern Economic Forum on September 5, he again changed the goal of the war against Ukraine and stated that the main task of -his- remains the capture of the Donetsk region. He also called it a -sacred duty- of Russian soldiers to retake part of Russia's Kursk region, which is currently controlled by the Ukrainian military. Putin declared: -The invasion of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation into the border regions of the Russian Federation failed.- And this is despite the fact that the Armed Forces continue to perform all the assigned tasks in Kurshchyna. The Russian dictator also hinted that Russia did not refuse negotiations with Ukraine, but on the basis of -documents- agreed in Istanbul in 2022. It will be recalled that at that time the Russians demanded the actual capitulation of Ukraine. In the annexes to the Istanbul Agreements, Russia prescribed a number of restrictions for Ukraine, while no restrictions were foreseen for the Russians. This was said by the former US Deputy Secretary of State Victoria Nuland. -The Istanbul agreements prohibited Ukraine from having some weapons systems, so, in essence, Ukraine would be weakened from a military point of view, while there were no similar restrictions on the part of Russia: Russia was not required to withdraw, it was not necessary to have a buffer zone on the border, Russia was not it was forbidden to keep any weapons on the border. -Ukraine felt that this could be a trap, so after consulting with its allies, it withdrew from the negotiations,- said Victoria Nuland. Putin could get a castrated demilitarized country for nothing. He obviously liked this, so now Putin only creates the appearance of readiness for negotiations, and all he wanted and wants is the surrender of Ukraine. For this purpose, the Russian dictator is manipulating the ephemeral -Istanbul Agreements- in the Russian interpretation. Ukraine needs a just peace, according to the norms of international law, according to the Ukrainian Peace Formula, which the head of the Kremlin constantly avoids. In addition, during his speech at the forum, Putin continued to say that the current authorities of Ukraine are not interested in ending hostilities because they do not want to hold presidential elections. He was supported by the dictator's spokesman, Dmytro Peskov, who declared: -Zelenskyi's regime is de jure illegitimate, although in fact it continues its activities.- We will remind that, according to the Constitution of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyi remains the legitimate head of state and will exercise his powers until the moment of taking office as the new President, whom Ukrainians will elect in the elections. Zakharova, the representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, was also noted for another batch of disinformation published on the air. She stated: -Ukrainian criminals guilty of serious international crimes against their own and Russian citizens, as well as their accomplices, will be brought to court and they will suffer the deserved punishment.- As is known, during the war, Ukraine strictly adheres to all international conventions and rules of warfare, unlike Russia, which constantly violates them. Zakharova also emphasized once again that the alleged main customer and instigator of the aggression of the -Kyiv regime- is the -collective West-. The statements of the Russian propagandist are populist in nature and do not have any legal basis. In addition, they cannot withstand any criticism and have no limits to cynicism. It was Russia that attacked a sovereign state, kills Ukrainians every day and destroys entire cities. There is only one aggressor, whose name is Russia. But this does not prevent the terrorist country from constantly accusing Ukraine of preparing terrorist attacks. So, last week, the RIA Novosti channel published an interview with an alleged Ukrainian prisoner of war, who said that the Armed Forces of Ukraine were preparing ammunition with the banned chlorpicrin in a laboratory near Kramatorsk. Also, Russian propagandist Veselovskyi said: -Ukraine has already made a dirty nuclear bomb long ago and would be ready to use it, but it does not use it,- and a collaborator from the Russian Federation, Ganchev, said that the threat of attacks by the Armed Forces of Ukraine on the Kursk and Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plants will remain. Let us remind you that it is Ukraine that strictly adheres to the requirements of the international nuclear security regime, unlike the aggressor country, which constantly uses nuclear blackmail for manipulation and intimidation. In addition, Ukraine, as a signatory to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons, strictly adheres to its obligations. Therefore, all the statements of propagandists are fakes, in which only Russians believe. And with plots on its own television, the propaganda of the aggressor country tries to justify the aggression of the Russian Federation and to cultivate hatred of Ukrainians among its citizens. For example, on the anniversary of the terrorist attacks in Buinaksk, Volgodonsk, and Moscow (September 4-16, 1999), the story of propagandist Dmytro Kiselyov is being circulated in the Russian Federation, in which Ukrainians are equated with -Chechen terrorists.- According to Kiselyov, now Ukrainians resisting the Russian invasion are -doing the same thing- as the terrorists who blew up residential buildings in Russian cities. Propaganda directly threatens - the defenders of Ukraine will either be destroyed or a Russian prison, -where life is worse than death.- In fact, using the pretext of -fighting terrorism- to justify wars is a classic Kremlin tactic. According to many independent investigators, the FSB was involved in the terrorist attacks in 1999, in which more than 300 people died and which became the reason for the Second Chechen War. It is the terrorist country Russia that constantly uses terrorist methods and commits crimes against the civilian population in both Chechnya and Ukraine. To write the review, materials from the Center for Combating Disinformation at the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine were used.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/10/brudna-bomba-biolaboratoriyi-j-do-chogo-tut-chechenczi-pro-shho-znov-volaye-rupor-kremlya/	2024-09-09T20:10:59-07:00
Because it is the most long-range: the US Navy puts into service the AIM-174B air-to-air missile	The fact that the Indo-Pacific region has been chosen as the prime territory for the deployment of these weapons, in the opinion of Reuters agency analyst, can significantly change the balance of forces in the air, in particular in armed confrontation with China, ArmiyaInform reports. The missile was developed by a well-known American manufacturer in the field of aerospace engineering - Raytheon - based on the SM-6 system , making it currently the longest-range missile ever used by the US, and was officially commissioned in July. It should be noted that the Pentagon did not officially present the new charge. Therefore, defense sector researchers are only making assumptions about the capabilities of the new missile based solely on its external image. Photos of F/A-18E/F Super Hornet aircraft with a new type of armament have appeared online. The new missile program and its implementation may mark a scientific and technical revolution in the fight against air targets&#8230; and even more. Yes, by data by The War Zone, the AIM-174B is a new air-to-air missile. Its appearance marks a significant increase in the capabilities of the US Navy in the fight against air targets, although the use of new weapons may extend beyond the air sphere. As confirmed by Naval News, the missile, also known as SM-6 ALC (Air-Launched Configuration), has been officially adopted by the US Navy. Weapons photographed by air adjusters during RIMPAC 2024 maneuvers while which has not been officially announced. The sudden appearance of a new missile without a pre-presented development program in the press remains largely a mystery. This reflects well the ability of the United States to conduct secret programs and the ability of Americans to avoid leaking information to the press when necessary. There are many indications that the F/A-18s will receive weapons that could radically change the balance of power in the Pacific. As can be seen from the photos published on social networks, the missile is suspended on the underwing pylon of the BRU-32B/A type of the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet. A few years ago, visually similar weapons were spotted under another aircraft of this type. However, that rocket was painted orange, which could mean that it was just an experimental product, a mass-sized mock-up, or maybe just a flying target. All three F/A-18E/F VFA CVW-2s are attached to the aeroplane of the Carl Vinson aircraft carrier and apparently received the AIM-174B air defense system. In recent weeks, the new missiles have been spotted in a gray color with a white fairing, which is typical of production air-to-air missiles adopted by the US Air Force and Navy. The airframe of the rocket can also be seen in great detail in the pictures. On its case there is a spoken marking DATM-174B. The abbreviation means that the missile is special, test, the common designation of the combat missile is AIM-174B. The RIMPAC exercise also saw F/A-18E/F fighters with underwing pylon-mounted missiles bearing the NAIM-174B index, with the N prefix indicating modifications for special tests where no return to the original configuration is planned. The model number in the missile designation -174- and the geometric and aerodynamic exterior of the missile airframe reveal the mystery of the weapon's origin. RIM-174B is the ship-to-air missile designation, also known in the US Navy as the SM-6 (Standard Missile-6) Block IA. In the US Navy, it is used to combat aerodynamic and ballistic targets, and also has limited capabilities to attack surface targets. The AIM-174 is a variant of the SM-6 adapted for use on combat aircraft. A missile modified for air carriers can use the altitude and speed of its carrier as launch conditions. For this reason, it lacks the Mk 72 solid propellant booster used in the original RIM-174B, which is launched from the Mk 41 shipboard Vertical Launch System (VLS). The AIM-174B missile without the Mk 72 booster weighs 1,890 pounds Â± 14 lbs (857 kg Â± 6 kg). The missile's terminal velocity can reach Mach 3.5 (1,050 m/s) when intercepting aerial, aerodynamic, and ballistic targets at altitudes up to 110,000 feet (34,000 meters) or Mach 2.5 (825 m/s ) when hitting land and surface targets at a range of 200 nautical miles (370 km). The missile has an active AIM-120 AMRAAM air-to-air homing system for end-of-flight targeting, but, unlike the AMRAAM, is not equipped with an inertial system as the primary missile control system in the initial and mid-range of the flight path, but programmable GPS navigation system, which is more accurate and allows you to do without a radio altimeter when attacking surface and ground targets in flight at low and ultra-low altitudes. It seems that as a result of this modification, the weapon does not lose its aerodynamic parameters, in particular, regarding the launch range. In this aspect, an air-launched missile may even win against a prototype ship-based missile. Given that estimates of the launch range of the -traditional- ship-based RIM-174B range from 240 to 460 km, this means that the AIM-174B could prove to be the longest-range air-to-air missile in its class, surpassing the Russian P-37 (AA 13 Axehead in the NATO nomenclature), the Chinese PL-15 (CH-AA-10 Abaddon) or the European Meteor. AIM-174B â€” new missile -air â€” air- of the US Navy for long-range F-18 Super Hornets.

Heavy fighting in tracts and islands: the intensity of enemy assaults on the Left Bank of the Dniepe...	Captain Dmytro, the spokesman of the operational group of troops -Tavria- told about this on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyni- Lykhova - In three days - Friday, Saturday and Sunday - 30 combat clashes took place there. The opponent had no success. Today, since the beginning of the day, there have already been 7 combat clashes there, while they are not taking place in one place, but are scattered on different islands, tracts, on different areas, which are stretched over a considerable length of the Dnipro coast, he said. This is an atypical situation, because previously most of the enemy's ground offensive operations were carried out in Zaporizhzhia, namely on the Robotynsky ledge in the Orihiv direction. Now the situation has changed. â€” Over the course of yesterday, 13 enemy assaults were repelled in our entire operational zone, of which three took place in the Orichiv direction, none in the Gulyajpil region, and 10 attacks were repelled at once in the Dnieper direction. This is such an atypical activity, the spokesman noted. The military believes that the Russians want to oust units of the Defense Forces from their positions on the bridgeheads on the Left Bank of the Dnieper. â€” They want, so to speak, to do it in such a leap. There are no other explanations. But in principle, their activation is the greatest in the last couple of months after the end of the active defense of Krynok, when our units â€” marines and other units of the Armed Forces â€” moved to other designated positions on the Left Bank of the Dnieper, he said. Dmytro Lykhovii suggested that the intensification of offensive actions by the Russians on the left bank of the Dnieper is related to their concern about a possible Ukrainian offensive in this direction. â€” There was information that the Russians were waiting for our offensive there. There were active actions, in particular, by the special forces of the Main Directorate of Intelligence with amphibious landings on the Kinburn spit, on the Tendriv spit. So the Russians keep their contingent there also for defense reasons. But now we are dealing with an increase in the number of assaults on their part, the spokesman said. In general, the Russians did not relax their attention to the SSU-held bridgeheads on the Left Bank of the Dnieper, even when they transferred their units from other directions in the South in view of the Kursk offensive operation of the Defense Forces. â€” It can be said that after the start of the Kursk offensive operation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, when the enemy in a certain way transferred his units to threatened areas, in particular to Kurshchyna, he took most of these units from the Zaporizhzhia region. Whereas in Kherson Oblast, the number that was there actually remained. There, the Russians did not weaken the group. On the contrary, they conduct rotations at the front edge of their units, transfer -storm- detachments there in particular to maintain the intensity of assault actions, in order to be able to attack in the future, said Dmytro Lykhova. On the other hand, in other directions in the South, the number of assaults by the occupiers decreased. â€” If earlier most of the combat clashes took place in Zaporozhye, in the Orichiv direction, specifically on the Robotynsky ledge, now there are very few of them there. For example, yesterday there were three of them, none before that, today two have already happened since the beginning of the day. At the same time, the enemy is actively using unguided air missiles. In the Gulyajpil direction, there have been three weeks without significant changes, that is, there are no ground assaults, the spokesman said. Earlier, ArmyInform showed that our soldiers destroyed a warehouse of enemy watercraft in the South.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/09/v-urochyshhah-i-na-ostrovah-vazhki-boyi-zrosla-intensyvnist-shturmiv-voroga-na-livoberezhzhi-dnipra/	2024-09-09T10:28:16-07:00

This is discussed in the message of President Volodymyr Zelensky on September 9. -First of all, about the Donetsk directions. Thanks to all our units at the front, who ensure full implementation of the tasks and really steadfastly repulse the Russian assaults and restore our positions. This is important,- the head of state noted. According to him, it is also important to destroy as many enemy forces as possible. -The Pokrovsky direction, Kurakhivskyi - that is where the Russian army should lose as much combat capability as possible. I am proud of all our soldiers, who by their actions are teaching Russia to clearly know where its land is and where its neighbors are,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy emphasized. As reported by ArmyInform, the enemy continues to use special munitions equipped with dangerous chemicals against the Defense Forces.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/09/prezydent-rosiya-povynna-vtratyty-najbilshe-boyezdatnosti-na-pokrovskomu-kurahivskomu-napryamkah/	2024-09-09T10:00:51-07:00

Where is the most dangerous place in Kupyan Oblast and how evacuation takes place on the air -Suspilne Novosti- the head of Kup told Andriy Besedin of the Yansk City Military Administration. â€” The situation is very difficult in the settlements of Kivsharivka, Kupyansk-Vuzlovy, the left bank of the city of Kupyansk itself â€” Zaoskilya district, the central part of the city. Now there is no such place on the territory of the Kupyan community that we can say is safer, he said. Enemy artillery is practically non-stop, the Russians are striking with UAVs. However, even under such conditions, a significant number of local residents refuse to evacuate. â€” Unfortunately, evacuation is neglected, refused. Now more than 7,000 residents are on the territory of the community, 155 children remain on the right bank of the city of Kupyansk, said the head of the Kupyansk MBA. Employees of the Kupyan city military administration work with them every day, persuading them to leave the territory of the community, which has become deadly dangerous. â€” Now it is critical to leave the territory of the community to safer places. The whole algorithm is worked out, everything is created - from the hotline phone to the cities that can receive our people. If people want to come to the city of Kharkiv, they will be provided with compact accommodation and all the necessary services and conditions.

The Ministry of Defense is updating the food supply of the Armed Forces: the pilot project will be l...	About this reported in the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. The main task of the new approach is to ensure better quality of products supplied to the Armed Forces and to increase the efficiency of the supply process itself. It was introduced to potential suppliers, manufacturers and distributors. -From February 2025, two models will operate in parallel: the one under which DOT works now, and the new pilot model. This approach is used to ensure the stability of the system and the continuity of the supply process. Transformations in the food model for the military should increase the efficiency of supply and, at the same time, ensure compliance with high standards of product quality,- said Deputy Defense Minister of Ukraine Dmytro Klimenkov. The pilot will operate throughout the year and will cover such regions as the city of Kyiv and the Kyiv, Vinnytsia, Zhytomyr, Cherkasy, and Kirovohrad regions. The main changes concern the financial model of interaction with the supplier, the product model and the quality control process. The supplier will receive compensation for the cost of goods and a fee for services (warehousing and transportation) subject to the SLA. The marginal cost of the catalog will be determined and fixed. For most types of products (75%) through open procurement platforms, the DOT will choose manufacturers who will be contracted by suppliers. For the remaining categories, suppliers will independently identify subcontractors. DOT, in turn, can block them for quality inconsistency and for violating integrity norms. All products will pass through the distribution center and only then be sent to military units. This is an additional stage of quality control, to which DOT specialists will be involved. DOT will apply a -black list- to suppliers and manufacturers - a new tool to prevent participation in the process of providing food for the Armed Forces in future periods of those entities that have already violated contractual obligations . -The idea of â€‹â€‹the pilot model is to change the philosophy of interaction with suppliers and manufacturers due to the change in their incentives and the openness of the terms of cooperation. We see this approach as the basis of partnership. At the same time, our main goal is to ensure an increase in both the quality of products received by the Armed Forces and the efficiency of the supply process itself. So that, while observing the transparent rules of the game, all participants in the process are interested in ensuring a continuous and high-quality supply of the Armed Forces,- said Halyna Litosh, program director for the food sector of the DOT. Earlier, ArmyInform informed that The Kingdom of Sweden announced the 17th package of military aid to Ukraine in the amount of SEK 4.6 billion.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/09/minoborony-onovlyuye-harchove-zabezpechennya-zsu-pilotnyj-proyekt-zapustyat-nastupnogo-roku/	2024-09-09T07:52:03-07:00

Thus, the most intensive combat operations are taking place in Vovchansk, with the use of a wide range of weapons, starting with tactical aviation, which uses the heaviest, most destructive anti-aircraft missiles, he said. Other settlements in the north of Kharkiv Oblast also suffer from the terrorist actions of the Russian occupiers. â€” In particular, this is the settlement of Liptsi, which is almost destroyed, almost erased from the face of the earth. It is also a settlement of Hlyboke. In addition, the enemy is also shelling Kozacha Lopan and other settlements along the Ukrainian border, Vitaly Sarantsev said. He explained that the actions of the Russian invaders have practically no military objectives and testify to the enemy's intentions to terrorize the civilian population with the aim of sowing panic and despair. â€” The tactics of his actions show that the enemy does not need these settlements and the population that is located there. He acts indiscriminately, he does not have any military strategy in carrying out these attacks. His main intention is to destabilize the situation, sow panic among civilians and discouragement towards the military and political leadership of the country, towards the Armed Forces of Ukraine, he explained. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in Kharkiv Oblast, the enemy fired at Dergachi from an anti-aircraft missile system: one person was killed in the region, 16 were injured.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/09/prykordonnya-harkivshhyny-rosiyany-majzhe-sterly-z-lyczya-zemli-yaka-meta-okupantiv/	2024-09-09T04:11:32-07:00

In some places he tries to storm, but he does not succeed, the spokesman said.
