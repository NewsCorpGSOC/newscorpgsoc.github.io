The goal of the occupiers was explained on the nationwide telethon by the spokesman of Kharkiv Technical University, Colonel Vitaly Sarantsev. — Unfortunately, the picture of the entire border area is not much different from Vovchansk.

He acts indiscriminately, he does not have any military strategy in carrying out these attacks. His main intention is to destabilize the situation, sow panic among civilians and discouragement towards the military and political leadership of the country, towards the Armed Forces of Ukraine, he explained.
