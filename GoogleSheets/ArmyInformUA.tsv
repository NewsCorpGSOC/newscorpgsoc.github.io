An enemy shahed flew near the Khmelnytsky NPP during a night attack — ODA	About this notified head of the Khmelnytskyi Regional State Administration, Serhii Tyurin. The head of the region noted that Russia continues nuclear blackmail by directing missiles and drones towards Ukrainian nuclear power plants. Today's incident with the -shaheed- near the Khao NPP is another confirmation. -That is why the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyi, and all representatives of our state are so actively appealing to partners to provide Ukraine with modern air defense systems, so that we can protect not only ourselves, but also the entire continent from Russian terror,- he added. As reported by ArmyInform, tonight as a result of an anti-aircraft battle 61 attack UAV and one Kh-59 guided air missile were shot down. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/20/vorozhyj-shahed-proletiv-bilya-hmelnyczkoyi-aes-pid-chas-nichnoyi-ataky-oda/	2024-09-20T00:24:02-07:00
Broke the enemy's plans: a paratrooper held a position in Kurshchyna for a day alone	The story of a brave warrior was published by the command of the Airborne Assault Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. -Five of us entered the position, but after a while only three remained - two fighters had to withdraw to another position, and at dawn the attack began,- says machine gunner Volodymyr. It was very hot, because the enemy -poured- everything - heavy infantry weapons and artillery. Enemy drones hung in the sky almost constantly, some of which were conducting reconnaissance and adjusting fire, and others were dropping ammunition on the defenders of the position. -I saw how my brother suddenly bent down. I started calling him, but he didn't move. Later, he realized that his comrade was already dead, because a bullet or shrapnel had hit him in the head. And in a few minutes, the commander of the position was wounded, so he had to be urgently evacuated,- the machine gunner recalls. Volodymyr held the position himself for almost a day. As soon as the enemy's infantry started to move, they immediately opened fire, and the infantrymen were forced to retreat to their starting positions. Later, their own broke through to Volodymyr. Now he is sure that his faith helped him to persevere. -I am a person of faith, so I prayed that God would help me pass this test. And I also did what I had been taught for so long — I destroyed the hated enemy with my machine gun, carrying out the given order,- the fighter states. Earlier, ArmiyaInform told a story about a chef from the Russian Armed Forces, who turns burnt tanks into -candies-.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/20/zlamav-plany-voroga-desantnyk-dobu-samotuzhky-trymav-pozycziyu-na-kurshhyni/	2024-09-20T00:09:18-07:00

Also, the enemy attacked with 70 attack UAVs of the Shahed type (launch areas: Primorsko-Akhtarsk, Kursk, Yeysk — Russian Federation).

-Wings- with artificial intelligence: automatically bringing the enemy to destruction should be scal...	About this on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- told the commander of the BPAK shock battalion -Achilles- of the 92nd separate assault brigade named after the basket captain Ivan Sirk, captain Yuriy Fedorenko. — The state of Ukraine has made extremely strong progress in terms of the development, production and combat use of a number of drones, in particular the long-range -wing- type, he said. The military said that it is gradually possible to saturate Ukrainian units with such UAVs along the entire line of combat. — At the beginning of 2023, these tools were used exclusively by individual divisions. It was effective enough, but not as intense as the demands of the front required. Corresponding improvements were made, and most units of the Defense Forces today effectively use wing-type strike weapons, the Achilles commander said. He explained the benefits of AI-equipped drones. - Equipping with artificial intelligence - automatic proofing in this case - makes it possible to bypass the enemy's electronic warfare and, when capturing the target, enter it clearly. In this way, the effectiveness of the application increases many times, the officer said. He emphasized that such UAVs make it possible to destroy valuable enemy equipment, the loss of which not only costs the occupiers financially, but also critically undermines their combat capabilities. This deprives the occupiers of forces and means to conduct hostilities and, accordingly, helps save the lives of Ukrainian defenders. — They preserve life, give the opportunity to knock out, in particular, the enemy's anti-aircraft defenses. This is extremely important, because the less the enemy has anti-aircraft means, the more opportunities for our intelligence to fly further, said the military. Thanks to this, it is possible to detect the enemy on the distant approaches to his advanced positions in the deep rear. — The more we destroy the enemy in the areas of their accumulation, the less of them will reach the front line. These -wings- objectively make it possible to perform such a task at the expense of destroying anti-aircraft defenses, the commander of the Ukrainian drones explained. He noted that in this way it is possible to effectively destroy the occupiers, including across the line of the state border of Ukraine on the territory of the Russian Federation. ArmyInform previously reported that syurpryzy/->Ukrainian drones promise the enemy new unpleasant surprises for him already in the spring of next year.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/20/kryla-zi-shtuchnym-intelektom-avtomatychne-dovedennya-voroga-do-znyshhennya-slid-masshtabuvaty/	2024-09-19T23:57:15-07:00
Where and how buffer zones have already been created: foreign experience	What are buffer zones, how they were used during conflicts between other countries and whether they can guarantee security, ArmiyaInform tells. Zones created with the purpose of separating one territory from another are called buffer zones. In international relations, they are most often represented in the form of demilitarized zones. This is done with the sole purpose of stopping the killings and the possibility of striking neighboring territories. This practice is not new. Yes, after a series of wars, or as they were shamefully called in the international community, conflicts, such zones were created. On July 27, 1953, North and South Korea signed an armistice agreement and established a demilitarized zone along the entire border (248 km), 2 km wide on each side. On both sides of the zone there are minefields and there are significant groups of troops. On May 31, 1974, after the October 1973 war, better known as Doomsday War, a UN Security Council resolution created a 75 km long demilitarized zone near the Golan Heights between Israel and Syria. The UN mission monitors the territory's buffer status to this day. On August 16, 1974, after the end of hostilities between Cyprus and Turkey, a UN Security Council decision created a buffer zone 180 km long and up to 7 km wide, separating the Republic of Cyprus from the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. The UN mission monitors the ceasefire regime. On March 26, 1979, Egypt and Israel signed a peace treaty, according to which the Sinai Peninsula became a buffer zone where the deployment of armed forces was limited. On April 3, 1991, following Operation Desert Storm, the UN Security Council established a demilitarized zone along the border between Iraq and Kuwait. The zone is surrounded by barbed wire and is 200 km long. Until 2003, a UN mission was stationed in this zone. So, as we can see, the creation of such zones in some cases managed to stop the bloodshed. At one time, Israel was able to establish silence on the northern border for a while. It was in the 1980s, after the so-called First Lebanon War in 1982. In the late 1970s, the north of Israel became the target of continuous Palestinian terrorist attacks. Palestinian terrorists who infiltrated from the territory of Lebanon committed large-scale terrorist attacks in Israel - taking hostages and killing 21 schoolchildren in Maalota, an attack on bus passengers on the Tel Aviv - Haifa highway, which led to the killing of 38 Israelis. From the territory of Lebanon, the Palestinians, using MLRS received from the USSR, continuously bombarded the northern regions of Israel. An independent terrorist -republic- emerged on the territory of Lebanon, which is directly adjacent to the Israeli border, and was named after the main Palestinian terrorist organization -Fatahland-. Terrorist leader Yasser Arafat took advantage of the civil war in Lebanon and effectively seized power in the border areas. Tens of thousands of terrorists were concentrated in Arafat's territory of Lebanon, in numerous camps and training centers gang formations continued to be trained for further attacks on Israel, huge arsenals were created. Arming, training and political cover for Arafat's terrorists was led by the USSR. The Kremlin hoped, with the help of Arafat, to expand its influence in the Arab world, which was greatly shaken after the total defeat of the satellites of the USSR - Syria and Egypt in the wars of 1967 and 1973, and therefore did not skimp: a stream of Soviet weapons went to the Palestinians: tanks, artillery, small arms. According to the German magazine Spiegel, the Soviet weapons received by the Palestinians would be enough to arm a 500,000-strong army. The chief military advisor to the Syrian Defense Minister was Colonel-General Hryhoriy Yashkin, who arrived in Syria from the position of Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany. Thousands of Soviet officers were at all levels of command of the Syrian troops, from batteries and companies to the Syrian Ministry of Defense. Syrian troops under the command of Soviet military advisers occupied strategically important areas of Lebanon. The final straw that broke Israel's patience was the assassination of Israeli ambassador to Great Britain, Shlomo Argov, by Palestinian terrorists on June 3, 1982, after which he miraculously survived but was left disabled. -Shlom al-Galil- (Peace of Galilee) - that's how the General Staff of the IDF called the operation of Israeli forces in Lebanon, which began on June 6, 1982. During the lightning operation of the Israeli Air Force, almost all Soviet air defense systems and dozens of aircraft were destroyed. The ground operation also achieved its goal. The Israeli victory also marked the technical backwardness of Soviet weapons, which were significantly inferior to Israeli and American weapons, as well as combat technologies, and, in addition, showed all the viciousness of Soviet air warfare tactics and the construction of air defense systems. After the end of hostilities, a certain strip of South Lebanon remained under Israeli control - the IDF (Israel Defense Forces - Author) retained control over a 19-kilometer (12-mile) buffer zone, which was held, in particular, with the help of the pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army (SLA). In 1985, Hezbollah, a Lebanese radical Shiite movement sponsored by Iran, called for an armed struggle to end Israel's occupation of Lebanese territory. When the civil war in Lebanon ended and other rival groups agreed to disarm, Hezbollah refused to do so. Fighting with Hezbollah weakened Israel's resolve and led to the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Lebanon in 2000. But the truce did not last long - in 2006, the Second Lebanon War began, after which Hezbollah suffered significant losses, and the border was quiet for a while. But now, after the operation in Gaza, launched in October 2023 on the northern border, shelling continues again. Since the escalation of the conflict, more than 60,000 people have been evacuated from Israeli border towns and settlements inland. According to the data of the international organization Organization for Migration, which keeps records of migration flows in the world, approximately 90,000 residents from the Lebanese side left their homes in the south of the country. Hezbollah began using Burkan missiles against Israel, which can carry up to 500 kilograms of explosives and have a range of 800 to 1,200 kilometers, depending on the modification. According to many analysts, another war is only a matter of time. So, as we can see, the creation of buffer zones does not always guarantee safety.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/20/de-ta-yak-uzhe-stvoryuvalysya-buferni-zony-inozemnyj-dosvid/	2024-09-19T23:44:20-07:00

NATO anti-drone training: Ukraine took part for the first time	This was reported by the NATO press service. From September 10 to 20, more than 450 participants from 19 NATO member states and three partner countries gathered in the Netherlands to test the ability of commercially available counter-drone systems to work together. During NATO's annual C-UAS Technical Interoperability Exercise, more than 60 counter-drone systems and technologies, such as sensors, drone guidance systems, jammers and cyber interceptors, were tested in real-world conditions. Ukraine's first active participation in these exercises is part of the Ukraine-NATO Innovative Cooperation Roadmap, approved by the leaders of the Alliance countries and Ukraine at the Washington Summit. -Exercises such as C-UAS TIE provide a unique opportunity to jointly address pressing issues such as the autonomy and interoperability of drones, as well as to study Ukraine's combat experience in combating small unmanned aerial vehicles,- the statement said. The integration of counter-drone technologies into NATO's Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) is essential to strengthening the Alliance's deterrence and defense capabilities. At the 2024 Washington Summit, Allies took steps to further improve the readiness, response and integration of NATO's IAMD and agreed to support the development and implementation of an integrated air and missile defense architecture for Ukraine. As ArmiyaInform reported, the chiefs of general staffs of the armed forces of NATO countries held a meeting in Prague on September 13-15 to implement the decisions of the Washington Summit and discuss how The Alliance will strengthen deterrence and defense while increasing support for Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/20/navchannya-nato-z-protydiyi-bezpilotnykam-ukrayina-vpershe-vzyala-uchast/	2024-09-19T20:47:38-07:00
The enemy's factory of fakes has been exposed: what the enemy is lying about	Media workers received a leak of internal documents of the -Social Design Agency-, which works on behalf of the administration of the President of the Russian Federation and created almost 40,000 units of fake content in 4 months of 2024. Serhiy Kiriyenko, the first deputy head of the administration of the President of Russia, is called the curator of the agency's activities. Among the fake documents, in particular, a document allegedly from the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense was found: the order of the Deputy Ministry of Defense N. Kalmykova to the heads of units and departments of the Armed Forces not to confirm - information about the presence of prisoners of war for exchange on board- Il-76, which crashed in the Belgorod region of Russia in January 2024, and fake quotes from representatives of the IOU about the -insignificance of these losses-. The purpose of these fakes, according to the accompanying documents, is to accuse the Ukrainian military leadership of censorship and concealment of the truth about the disaster. In fact, the Il-76 was transporting S-300 missiles, which Russia uses to fire at Ukraine. And Russia used this incident to sow discontent among Ukrainians and undermine Western aid to our country. Also, in the -register of fakes and falsehoods- there is a forgery of the alleged order of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces Oleksandr Syrskyi equating the capture of military personnel with treason . The purpose of this fake, as stated in the description of the task of the Russian agency, is -discrediting the military-political leadership of Ukraine and demoralizing the Armed Forces of Ukraine-. In addition, among the agency's -accomplished tasks- are fake quotes from Oleksandr Syrskyi, manipulation of the population points and regions from which the fighters of the Ukrainian Armed Forces are allegedly called up the most. To split Ukrainian society, the Kremlin fakers actively used the difficult relationship between Volodymyr Zelenskyi and his predecessor Poroshenko, the mayor of Kyiv Klitschko, as well as the former commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces Zaluzhny. span> For according to the editor and presenter of Radio Liberty's -Schemes- project Nataliya Sedletska, this investigation is unique in that it exposes and documents in detail how thousands of fakes about the war in Ukraine were created, aimed both at Western audiences states, as well as Ukrainians. Some of them were shared by influential people and were even taken seriously.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/20/vykryto-vorozhu-fabryku-fejkiv-rf-pro-shho-breshe-vorog/	2024-09-19T20:19:43-07:00
What awaits Ukraine in winter: an expert on the Kremlin's missile and drone terror	Military expert Petro Chernyk told ArmiyaInform about this: -In a strategic sense, I do not think that this winter will be anything unique in terms of tactics from the Russians, especially missile and drone attacks. Yes, they somewhat managed to raise the total number of missile strikes. The last missile salvo by the enemy, which took place in August, was 127 missiles. I will decipher it, why you should not look in the direction of some absolute disaster, because they say that this is the biggest blow. Yes, he is the biggest. The previous one was in December of last year and had 102 missiles then. That is, they raised (rocket volley — Ed.) to 25 rockets. But if you take a calculator and multiply the carriers with which they can strike, then they have at least 20 Tu-95MS aircraft. And they can take on board up to eight Kh-101 missiles, so we already have 80 missiles. The Russian Federation has up to ten missile carriers of various classes in the Black Sea. For example, small missile ships of the type -Buyan-M-, -Karakurt- and the patrol ship -Vasiliy Bykov- are equipped with Kalibr missile systems. The Russians also have two more operational frigates of the Admiral Gorshkov type. Each carrier ship can carry eight missiles. If we add missiles from Tu-95 aircraft and ships, then we already have up to 160 missiles. Of course, there are also Iskander-M launchers and S-300 complexes, which the enemy has switched to surface-to-surface mode of operation. Let's add the coastal missile complexes -Bastion- and -Val-, etc. That is, if you put everything together, the enemy theoretically should have, well, at least 300-400 missiles. And what is not? And it won't. Why? The occupiers are at the highest point of missile production. Since they started somewhere in the middle of 2023 to produce 120-130 missiles per month, a maximum of 140, they are standing still. They cannot produce more. Indeed, in August of this year, the use of an abnormal number of Shahed drones, almost 800, was recorded. But even for this indicator, they will no longer come out. That is, as these last volleys took place, so they will continue to be. The hit rate on our side for -shaheeds- sometimes even reaches 100%, for rockets varies from 85 to 95 percent. These are very high figures. Good news for us. If until the middle of last summer, even autumn, the Americans produced 20-21 missiles for the Patriot air defense system, then it has already been confirmed that in August of this year they produced plus 20 missiles. And this is already 40 pieces per month. And production will increase. That is, our covering of the sky will increase. Germany will transfer 17 new IRIS-T systems to strengthen Ukraine's air defense. This is a strengthened division, it is very good. Let me remind you that the IRIS-T complex has an impressive accuracy rate of 95 percent. Each launcher has 8 missiles. That is, 10 systems - 80 missiles. Finally, we have F-16 planes. They have a unique AIM-9 Sidewinder missile on board. It is an American air-to-air missile with a short range of up to 20 kilometers. By the way, this is the most massive air-to-air missile in the world. More than 200 thousand of them were produced. Spain has announced that it will send to Ukraine a complete battery of the Hawk anti-aircraft missile system, which contains 6 launchers. One launcher is three missiles, the radius of application is up to 40 kilometers. Again, this is the most massive rocket that exists in the world in this class. More than 40 thousand of them were produced. We have to look carefully at this winter, of course there will be difficulties. The winter will not be easy, because our energy infrastructure is destroyed by 40-50 percent. But the absolute disaster that our enemy is counting on will not happen either. Why? After all, we get more than half of the electricity generation from nuclear power plants. Plus there is good news - this is the construction of another nuclear power plant in Ukraine. This is a powerful answer. Let's add here the so-called small generating capacities. Starting from the mass installation of electric solar panels and wind turbines and ending with ordinary generators for own households and institutions.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/20/shho-chekaye-na-ukrayinu-vzymku-ekspert-pro-raketno-dronovyj-teror-kremlya/	2024-09-19T20:13:35-07:00
What is the new DOT-Chain system and how to use it: step-by-step instructions	Among other things, the quality of execution of combat tasks by units, and the motivation of personnel, and globally, national security in general, depend on the speed, efficiency, quality of the supply of products to military units and the complete absence of a corruption component during these processes. So, a week ago, another digital product for the military was launched in Ukraine. On September 11, the State rear operator presented DOT-Chain, an innovative IT system for managing the rear needs of the Armed Forces. This IT system from the State operator of the rear should fundamentally change the processes of providing food to the Armed Forces. The system digitizes key processes: from product orders to invoice processing, thereby reducing delivery times by four. So now all the stages, from the application filled out by the head of food service to the payment to the supplier, are collected in one place. All necessary documentation and signatures of each of the parties are also collected in one place. Creation of DOT-Chain has become the largest digital project in DOT. A team of IT specialists of the State Rear Operator worked on the development for half a year. The Ministry assures that this innovative solution will be able to completely eradicate corruption. The budget for rear support of the Armed Forces currently amounts to 96 billion hryvnias. DOT-Chain's primary mission is to simplify processes, increase awareness, and strengthen support for both the military and suppliers. During the presentation of the system, Alyona Zhuzha, the IT advisor of the State Rear Operator, responsible for the project development, says the following about the key advantage: — After everyone learns to use the system and we work out all the processes in it, it is expected that we will be able to do even more reduce delivery time. Before that, 30,000 paper documents were generated to provide food for one military unit. This is just one week of one military unit. There is no need for that now. According to her, from now on the system shows all the statuses of procurement and delivery documents, and expense invoices are immediately uploaded to the system. At the same time, the State operator of the rear, having electronic signatures from the military unit and the supplier, can immediately pay the application. Information from the system will also be used by the Ministry of Defense to adjust the needs of the military in accordance with the data. See in detail in the video instructions step-by-step recommendations-tips on how to use the DOT-Chain system. At the moment, the functionality of the system extends only to food. In the future, it is promised to be scaled up for purchases of other categories of goods. — I'm sure that each of you has seen posts on social networks that somewhere there are problems with food, and somewhere the situation is critical. The DOT-Chain system allows us to understand exactly where the situation is in real time, to make decisions and take responsibility for what is happening on the ground, says the head of the State Rear Operator Arsen Zhumadilov. Changes brought by the DOT-Chain IT system:	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/20/chym-korysna-nova-systema-dot-chain-i-yak-neyu-korystuvatysya-pokrokova-instrukcziya/	2024-09-19T20:00:33-07:00

It was hardly possible to destroy anyone with that fire, but personal belongings, ammunition, special equipment and many other interesting things were definitely burned by the fire of revenge. Having personally been in the burning landing, I can say that there is not much pleasant there, there is nowhere to look, it is simply impossible to breathe, and the eyes constantly sting and water from the smoke. So I'm sure that the orcs liked it),- commented the pilot of -Sharp Kartuz- on the video.

-Grad-, a tank and a lot of transport — drones from the ground defense set fire to the Pokrovsky dir...	The video of combat operation appeared on September 19 on the unit's channel. Muramasa pilots note that the enemy is not stopping and moving forward. Sometimes he pauses to regroup and directs the main strike force towards the city of Kurakhove. During this pause, enemy aircraft and missiles destroy bridges and all important strategic objects of our cities. -At this time, we are working 24/7 to improve enemy logistics. It is not always possible to do this, there are many reasons. One of the essential ones is a powerful EW (both ours and the enemy's). But, despite this, we are good at cutting their logistics paths with drones,- the Muramasa pilots commented on their video. As reported by ArmyInform, the pilots of the Muramasa strike unmanned aerial vehicle complex company of the 109th separate brigade of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine destroyed a large number of various enemy vehicles.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/19/grad-tank-i-kupa-transportu-dronari-z-teroborony-zapalyly-na-pokrovskomu-napryamku/	2024-09-19T11:22:32-07:00

The Russians have a clown - our stormtroopers interrogated a captured traitor	The video of the conversation appeared on September 19 on the battalion channel. The prisoner, a native of Donetsk, rose to the rank of lieutenant with the occupiers. -Before you is a typical character who in 2014 chose the path of treason and became part of the so-called -Ruskov measure-. Now, as a result, he is in our captivity. He is a traitor for Ukrainians and cannon fodder for Putin-oriented Russians! To be captured by stormtroopers is to draw a lucky ticket! Replenishment of the exchange fund, which our battalion constantly conducts, will certainly help in the return of our Heroes from Russian captivity!-, the battalion commented on the video.

Drones of the Defense Forces told when it is possible to overcome enemy EW	An officer of the Separate Detachment of Special Purpose Unmanned Systems -Kryla- told about this on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- Omega- of the Special Purpose Center of the National Guard of Ukraine with the call sign -Storm-. He said that the Russian occupiers use various EW systems to suppress the control signals of Ukrainian drones. - Usually these are some mobile REBs in the form of backpacks. The infantry takes them for themselves, advances in a certain direction and tries to gain a foothold there, he said. However, such EW means require constant power supply, which is difficult to provide at the forward positions of the enemy. — Some logistics also work in them. They used their drones to deliver various batteries, food, so that their enemy force could hold out in a certain direction as long as possible. This is usually not very effective because constant power is required for these BERs. It can work for a certain time, and then, due to the fact that it is no longer working, it is possible to carry out various types of damage, the officer explained. At the same time, the enemy is also trying to strike Ukrainian defenders with the help of UAVs. — Recently, the number of applications of FPV drones has increased. But, taking into account the fact that we use REBs, their effectiveness drops to a minimum. In the same way, they are trying to calculate our EW system and use aerial reconnaissance drones. There are not so many of them in the directions, but they are also used, said the UAV operator. He emphasized that the fighters of the Defense Forces also do not stand still and use various types of EW as efficiently as possible to suppress enemy drones. Earlier, ArmyInform showed how Ukrainian drones destroy the enemy in Kharkiv Oblast in a variety of ways with the help of FPV, skids and -dragon- drones.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/19/koly-mozhna-podolaty-vorozhyj-reb-rozpovily-dronari-syl-oborony/	2024-09-19T11:07:03-07:00
About 40,000 Russian troops managed to be diverted - the President about the Kursk direction	He said this in an evening address on September 19. -Today there was a lot of work with the military, with special services.

But we do our best for the stability of our combat brigades. And a separate operation in the Kursk region. About 40,000 Russian troops have already been diverted in this direction,- he said. The President also noted that there is a replenishment of the exchange fund for Ukraine. -All these are important things that affect the overall situation of the war. I thank all our combat brigades, every soldier, sergeant, every commander for courage,- he summed up. As reported by ArmyInform, the MEPs urged to immediately remove all restrictions for of Ukraine on the use of Western weapons against legitimate military targets in Russia. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/19/vdalosya-vidvolikty-blyzko-40-tysyach-rosijskyh-vijskovyh-prezydent-pro-kurskyj-napryamok/	2024-09-19T11:05:58-07:00

During the day, snipers destroyed 20-40-50 people - company commander Serhiy Varakin	The conversation with the officer was broadcast on September 19 on the channel of the -Return Alive- foundation. The most valuable thing for Serhii is his subordinates, whom he gently calls family. In March, Serhiy Varakin lost a soldier for the first time in 9 years of service, an enemy FPV hit one of the company's pickup trucks. -I always tried to hold back - I'm a man. But sometimes you can't help it: you stand and roar,- Serhiy explains. The war is changing, which forces Serhiy Varakin, as a commander, to resort to non-standard solutions. One of these is the mastery of kamikaze drones by snipers. -If we can't get the enemy from the ground, then we will get him from the sky,- says Serhiy Varakin. As reported by ArmyInform, a sniper of the 77th separate airmobile brigade of the Russian Air Force with the call sign -Wolf- told how to prepare and what is important during combat work. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/19/v-den-snajpery-nyshhyly-po-20-40-50-cholovik-komandyr-roty-sergij-varakin/	2024-09-19T10:44:12-07:00
AK-74 for -noise isolation-: in Kharkiv Oblast, enemy soldiers are poorly trained and equipped	An officer of the Separate Detachment of Special Purpose Unmanned Systems -Kryla- told about this on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- Omega- of the Special Purpose Center of the National Guard of Ukraine with the call sign -Storm-. — If we take the trend of combat training of infantrymen, then in recent times these are usually people who signed a contract six months to a year ago. Of course, they had some training, they were not immediately sent to the front, he said. However, the level of education of the occupiers is extremely low, they have not mastered even small arms. -In most cases, they just use weapons to make some noise isolation so that we think they are trained in something,- the officer explained. The occupiers are primarily armed with AK-74 assault rifles, but they also have newer weapons. - In terms of equipment, in most cases there were no special forces or military personnel with greater experience.

-Tamara and I are behind bars as a couple-: two collaborators were detained - a teacher and an offic...	This was notified by the Security Service of Ukraine. Two collaborators cooperated with the occupation administrations of the Russian Federation in Luhansk region and Kharkiv region. One of the figures was the -deputy director of the lyceum of the LNR-, which the Rashists created on the basis of the captured school in temporarily occupied Luhansk. -According to the investigation, the collaborator obliged the lyceum teachers to teach the history of Ukraine exclusively according to the -methodology- of the Russian Federation, in which the facts of the formation of our statehood were completely falsified. The collaborator also praised Putin and the full-scale invasion of Russia, which she regularly spoke about in front of the school community,- the SBU said. In August of this year, the defendant arrived in Kyiv via EU countries to resolve social issues. She planned to stay hidden in the city for a while, and then return to Luhansk. SBU employees located her and detained her in a rented apartment. According to the investigation, the suspect is a 42-year-old resident of Luhansk region, who in 2014 went to cooperate with the enemy. Before being appointed to the -position-, she underwent -retraining courses- in Rostov-on-Don. Another collaborator was detained in Kharkiv region. -The accomplice of the aggressor turned out to be a 58-year-old resident of Kupyansk, who after the capture of the city joined the local occupation administration of the Russian Federation. There, she was appointed to a -position- where she drew up documentation on the technical maintenance of military barracks and the occupation authorities of the Russian Federation,- the Ukrainian special service added. So far, the investigators of the Security Service have notified both detainees (in accordance with the crimes committed) of suspicion under Part 2 and Part 3 of Art. 111-1 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (collaborative activity).

In his first battle, he defeated the enemy's armored personnel carrier - the story of the Phantom fi...	said about the soldier on September 19 Airborne assault troops of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. And although the soldier is still undergoing rehabilitation, he is already planning to return to the army, because in Bilogorivka, where he was seriously wounded, his comrades continue to fight the enemy. -It is extremely difficult to maintain the defense in Bilogorivka. Digging a trench there is a challenge with an asterisk, because there is almost no land - solid chalk that cannot be dug,- says Serhiy. According to the paratrooper, chalk not only makes it difficult to set up positions: it also poses another threat to soldiers. The fact is that fragments from mines and shells are not absorbed by the ground, as happens when a trench is dug in ordinary soil, but bounce off the hard rock and scatter chaotically in different directions, finding victims among our defenders. -My brother, who was standing not far from me, was hit by a shrapnel just like that when we were repelling an enemy assault,- Serhiy recalls. According to the brave paratrooper, the situation is complicated by the fact that the enemy considers Bilogorivka as the -key- to the defense of Siversk, so they will spare nothing to capture this village: bullets, artillery shells, mines and anti-aircraft missiles - all this deadly irony the enemy sends tons every day in the position of stable fighters. But no iron is able to break the will of the paratroopers of the 81st brigade to resist. The story of a brave fighter with the call sign -Phantom- is a vivid example of this. He will remember his first fight and what preceded it for the rest of his life. -At the position, we walked seven kilometers, carrying 45 kg of cargo. It was difficult, but there were still -flowers-. When the orcs started storming us, it became a real test,- says the paratrooper. According to the soldier, after the mortar shelling, with which the enemy -processed- the positions of the Ukrainian defenders, the assault of the enemy's infantry, supported by a tank and an armored personnel carrier, began. At the same time, the appearance of the tank was a surprise for the soldiers. -He descended from the tericon at neutral speed, so he could not be heard. When he started climbing the mountain, we couldn't see him then, but we already heard the roar of the engines and realized that something serious was going on. We saw the tank only when it left, as they say, -under our noses,- Serhii recalls. The unit went into battle. Serhii grabbed the RPG-7 grenade launcher and started firing at the armored personnel carrier, which also came within range of the shot, and his brother engaged the tank. -I don't remember when I knocked out an armored personnel carrier, because I fired five shots from a grenade launcher. I know for sure that I hit more than one cumulative grenade. I remarked about myself that I would shoot him, as if in a shooting range,- says Serhiy. The tank was also knocked out by a well-aimed shot of his comrades. The infantry was partially killed - only those who managed to escape in time survived. Recalling the first and subsequent battles in which the brave paratrooper participated, he says that he understood how important the professional training of a soldier is. -I was taught well at the training center: I could freely handle a machine gun, a machine gun, and a grenade launcher, so I felt confident in battles, because my actions were brought to automatism,- Serhii assures. Those who are still hesitating, the brave soldier understands a little, because he himself did not immediately join the army: he adjusted himself for several months, but in the end he made his conscious choice. But now he says that he needs to overcome his emotions: -Don't be afraid. Yes, it's scary, but we need to go to war, because we won't have a future if everyone doesn't come to their senses and go to protect their relatives, our Motherland. And before this war has come to your home, come to your senses and join the army, there will be work for everyone,- says the paratrooper.

Threat of ecological disaster: Russians mined dams in the Belgorod region	This was reported by the spokesman of the operative-tactical group -Kharkiv-, Colonel Vitaly Sarantsev. According to him, the Russians are not only actively building defensive fortifications around Belgorod, but also actively mining general and special purpose hydraulic structures. -This can be seen as a 'bookmark' for the future - if, for example, the situation changes dramatically and the Russians have to blow up dams to slow the advance of the Defense Forces of Ukraine,- he suggested. The spokesman also noted that the Russians could also use mines to carry out an -operation under a foreign flag- - to blow up dams in order to later blame the Ukrainians for this. -It can also be assumed that the Russian Federation is preparing provocations at hydrotechnical facilities in order to further accuse Ukraine of environmental and humanitarian consequences,- said the spokesman of Kharkiv Technical University. He added that such actions can be used to mobilize the local population of the Belgorod region and to divert the attention of Russians from internal problems. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in Kharkiv region, the occupiers were transferred -to foot fodder-, as a result of which Russian soldiers were poisoned due to a lack of quality provisions, and in Vovchansk, a third of the fighters in the enemy's assault groups survive - the enemy steadily loses up to 70% of its assault troops.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/19/zagroza-ekologichnoyi-katastrofy-u-byelgorodskij-oblasti-rosiyany-zaminuvaly-damby/	2024-09-19T08:34:38-07:00

From a miner to a hero-defender: the story of soldier Mykola Savinykh	on September 19 operational command -North- told about the fighter. At first, Mykola served as a mechanic-driver of BTR-80, where together with his unit he was on combat duty in the southern direction for almost half a year. Then he was in the Izyum direction of the Kharkiv region, where he held the defense and did not allow the enemy to establish a pontoon crossing across the river.

Espionage for the Armed Forces, the Russian IPSO, fakes: what is known about the General Staff	informs the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine about this. Experts examined about 27 thousand units of media content published from June 8, 2018 to July 26, 2024. In particular, in its activities, the channel focuses on the following operations: Analysis of the content of the enemy Telegram channel was conducted by the Strategic Communications Center in cooperation with the Cyber ​​Department of the Security Service of Ukraine and the Main Communications Department of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. It is noted that since 2014, the Russian Federation has been waging a hybrid war against Ukraine, which includes information operations. -Russian informational aggression includes campaigns aimed at discrediting the Defense Forces of Ukraine, falsifying the events of the Russian-Ukrainian war, and depriving Ukrainians of the will to resist,- the report says. Russia also carries out information manipulation and interference both openly and covertly, often masking its actions under the guise of Ukrainian initiatives. In particular, he creates pseudo-Ukrainian pages in social networks and messengers in order to subtly influence the Ukrainian audience. One such resource is the National Headquarters Telegram channel, which is moderated by Russian intelligence services and specializes in topics related to the Defense Forces and is aimed at the military. Therefore, -NachStabu- is part of the Russian information campaign aimed at weakening Ukraine through information attacks, and performs the role of an instrument of hybrid warfare.

A third survives: in Vovchansk, the enemy steadily loses up to 70% of attack aircraft	An officer of the Special Purpose Center -Omega Wings- of the National Guards of Ukraine with the call sign -Storm-. - As you can see the tactics of our enemy, he does not spare his manpower. The main technique is to move by 3-4 people. If someone is able to make it to a certain point, they are pinned and waiting for the next batch. Thus, for 20 people, only 7-6 people who hold a certain plot are able to reach. In this way, they accumulate their strength and spread across the front, he said. Accumulating in sufficient numbers for the next advance, the occupying soldiers try to move on, again losing about 2/3 of their personnel. - Since this is a city, the enemy tries to use the buildings. Lately, he has resorted to the tactic of single use of manpower. The enemy moves singly and accumulates at appropriate points in order to spread across the front and gain a foothold in certain areas of the terrain and push back our forces, the officer explained. In order to gain a foothold, the occupiers use basements and ruins of buildings, in which it is quite difficult for them to inflict fire damage. In order to deliver the personnel to the assault lines, the enemy uses fast maneuvering equipment - buggies. They are just as difficult to hit with drones. — There are also moments of movement on some kind of equipment. These can be buggies, quite maneuverable equipment, it is very difficult to follow. We usually try to use FPV drones, but it is very difficult at such a speed, where the equipment just flies by in a second and it is very difficult to catch it, - explained -Storm-. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that In Vovchansk, the enemy's rigging teams suffered losses.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/19/vyzhyvaye-tretyna-u-vovchansku-vorog-stabilno-vtrachaye-do-70-shturmovykiv/	2024-09-19T06:22:38-07:00

The man did it both out of ideological convictions and for money. He began collecting information for representatives of the Russian Federation no later than February 2024. He was promised to be paid for completing the received tasks related to the collection of data on Ukrainian defenders, but the accused never received the money. The man also acted out of ideological convictions — he was an active participant in pro-Russian chat rooms. There he left comments in which he called for the seizure of power and the -annihilation of the Nazis.- The illegal nature of the accused's statements was confirmed by the conclusion of the forensic linguistic semantic-textual examination. The man sent information about the deployment of units of the Defense Forces in the messenger in the form of text messages indicating the relevant coordinates. The enemy used the data collected by the man to plan targeted strikes on the territory of the district. Law enforcement officers exposed the man at the end of July this year.

As informsIOU, this was discussed at the meetings of the Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine for European Integration, Oleksandr Balanutsa, with representatives of the leadership of the Swedish Ministry of Defense, as well as research and educational institutions. -Ukraine strives not only to adopt the experience of our partners, but also to share its own best practices.

From now on, the main intelligence agency is also in art: a wall painting -The wise man rules over t...	The creation of the mural was initiated by the Suchasna Ukraine Charitable Foundation with the support of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. And the artistic project was realized by the artist Volodymyr Manzhos, recognized in Ukraine and the world. The artist depicted the successful operations of the GUR on the mural: — The story in my author's style about the activity of the GUR of the MOU in the Black Sea. We see here a personified collective image of intelligence - the GUR symbol, a sea drone, a surf as a reference to a sea drone, a battered -Russian warship-, the hand of someone wise ruling over the stars. This is the slogan of GUR, the author shared his idea. This is the seventh work from a series of his mural works about historical, fateful events in Ukraine. — I created my first job in India in 2015. Then there were jobs in Kyiv, Poland, and Paris. All these works in one way or another reflect the events we are witnessing. Finishing each of them, I sincerely believed that this was the last work of this series. And the next mural will reflect our victory, peace and prosperity. Therefore, now I wish that the next mural would be just like that, Volodymyr Manzhos concluded. The president of the -Modern Ukraine- Foundation, Volodymyr Havrysh, said that before the large-scale war, one of the initiatives planned by the benefactors was the murals of modern Ukraine. The goal then was to unify the country. Murals were to be created in each area to promote the idea that we are one. — But in 2022, a full-scale invasion began and we realized that in addition to systematic aid to the front (more than 150 million hryvnias have been provided to date), cultural diplomacy plays an important role. Today you see a mural that shows the power of Ukrainian intelligence, our defenders, destroying ships in the Black Sea. And the task of this presentation is also to collect 10 million in order to purchase the Magura V5, which will destroy naval targets, ships, so that the Ukrainian people live under the free Ukrainian sky, Volodymyr Havrysh said. He also shared plans to create murals in other countries. -These murals will be the gratitude of the Ukrainian people to all partner countries, the civilized world and the people who help Ukrainians today to resist and defeat the enemy,- the philanthropist noted. Andriy Yusov, a representative of the Ukrainian State Educational and Cultural Organization, thanked the author, the public, and volunteers for the implementation of this creative initiative. — This time the mural — owl, Magura, sea — is dedicated to the destruction of the enemy's potential on the Ukrainian sea and the liberation of our territories. Actually, it is not only support of fighting spirit. This is real art. We did not influence the creative process in any way, apparently, but conceptually, of course, this is joint work, - Andrii Yusov said. — Russian aggression is, of course, a terrible evil, but the struggle of the Ukrainian people continues. And it must be supported, supported by motivation. And, actually, such art projects are very important support. At the same time, despite the fact that we are talking about repelling Russian aggression at sea, this is a very bright artistic project, a bright picture, like the entire struggle of the Ukrainian people. The work of Volodymyr Manzhos is, without exaggeration, a cultural phenomenon. We are grateful that the Main Directorate of Intelligence is now both in art and on the streets of Kyiv. Andriy Yusov joked that today the largest owl in Ukraine has settled in Kyiv, and this owl is certainly inextricably linked with the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, with the work of special forces and group 13 - Magura V5 operators. He conveyed the thanks of the soldiers to the author and everyone present and emphasized how important such recognition of their work is. — But, in addition to the fact that it is a beautiful work of art, it is also a large charity fundraiser for Ukrainian Magura attack drones, which effectively destroy the enemy Russian fleet. That's why it's great when art helps the Security and Defense Forces, Andrii Yusov summarized. The ceremonially opened mural is a continuation of the -GURKIT from GUR- campaign, within the limits of which at the beginning of September the computer game -Gurkit on the Swamps- was presented, where everyone can try themselves in the role of the operator of a modern Ukrainian surface drone and donate to its purchase. At the presentation, a limited edition of the own brand was distributed based on the motifs of the mural with the author's signature, as well as an exclusive -skin- for Monobank cards and a themed merch drop of the SYNDICATE brand with an image of the mural. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/19/golovne-upravlinnya-rozvidky-vidteper-ye-j-u-mystecztvi-v-kyyevi-vidkryly-stinopys-mudryj-panuye-nad-zirkamy/	2024-09-19T04:41:36-07:00

Ukrainian howitzers -Bohdan- are financed from profits from the frozen assets of the Russian Federat...	This was spoke the Ambassador of the European Union to Ukraine Katarina Maternova in an interview - European truth-. According to her, the production of Ukrainian howitzers -Bohdan- has already been paid for with this money. Katarina Maternova reminded that half a year ago, the EU approved the scheme for using the income from frozen Russian assets - the interest -dripping- on them - for the benefit of Ukraine, and in August the first 1.4 billion euros were allocated from them. In particular, several member states received funding for new arms supplies. She emphasized that it is much more important that 400 million of this amount will go to Ukrainian defense enterprises. It was Denmark that came up with such a system. It was the first country to contract and pay for the production of Bogdan howitzers for the Armed Forces. -So, we poured 400 million euros through Denmark into the Ukrainian defense industry. Agree, this is quite a significant amount&#8230; And that's such exquisite justice, isn't it? With the funds of Russian frozen assets, you make howitzers,- the ambassador said. Katarina Maternova noted that Denmark contributed some of its own funds to the amount of 400 million euros of rockets and thus placed a large order at the Ukrainian military plant. According to the ambassador, in the next tranche of the frozen Russian assets, they want to pledge an even larger amount to finance the production of weapons directly by the Ukrainian defense industry. -From the next tranche, an even larger amount will go directly to the Ukrainian defense industry. Because you produce products of the same quality for less money, you do it faster, you have lower transport and logistics costs, and in addition, manufacturers pay taxes in Ukraine and help support the economy,- she said. The ambassador added that this is something she is particularly proud of, as she was one of the most ardent defenders of this idea.

-Orlan-, Zala, Supercam: why it is difficult to shoot down enemy reconnaissance drones	Why it is difficult to shoot down enemy reconnaissance drones explained on the live broadcast of the national telethon -Edyny Novyni- the spokesman of the National Guard Ruslan Muzychuk of Ukraine. — When we talk about shooting down, it is, of course, primarily the detection of such UAVs. This task is not the most difficult - to directly detect various types of aircraft, in particular, such as -Orlan-, -Zala- or -Supercam-. Another issue is their downing, because we see, for example, there was quite a lot of activity in Kharkiv Oblast last month, and on the northern border UAVs are used specifically for reconnaissance, he said. However, detecting an enemy spy drone is only the first step. After that, there is a danger that the process of shooting down a Russian UAV will capture another enemy aircraft, which will allow the occupiers to discover the positions of units of the Defense Forces and fire at them. - There is a possibility that another aircraft or with the help of other means can detect the place from which the strike was carried out - whether it was some kind of anti-aircraft system or, if the circumstances allow, small arms, - the spokesman explained. In view of this, it is not always possible to open fire and it is safe for soldiers of the Defense Forces units to shoot down an enemy drone. — Much of the work is now being done to land such drones with the help of electronic warfare. Now we also see that there are cases when our pilots-operators of FPV drones shoot down such enemy aircraft with the help of FPV drones in the air, Ruslan Muzychuk said. The spokesman also reported that last day fighters of the National Guard of Ukraine shot down two UAVs of operational-tactical level -Orlan- in the South. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that the enemy increased the number of flights reconnaissance drones in the Vovchan direction - in recent times, the occupation's air reconnaissance activity has increased here by 40%, and also explained, why the destruction of enemy reconnaissance UAVs is the key to reducing the number of strikes by KABams.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/19/orlan-zala-supercam-chomu-skladno-zbyvaty-vorozhi-drony-rozvidnyky/	2024-09-19T00:51:45-07:00

There, he was approached by a staff member of the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces (better known as the game) and offered cooperation. On the instructions of a Russian intelligence officer, the agent regularly went around the city and secretly recorded the location of the Defense Forces. Then he marked the corresponding coordinates on Google maps and sent a -report- to his Russian curator via messenger. SBU employees exposed the agent at the initial stage of his intelligence activity, which made it possible to secure the positions of Ukrainian troops in a timely manner. After documenting every step of the suspect's criminal actions, he was detained in his own apartment. During the searches, a mobile phone was seized from the agent, which he used to photograph military objects and communicate with the Russian game. On the basis of the collected evidence, the investigators of the Security Service informed him of the suspicion under Part 2 of Art. 111 (treason committed under martial law) of the Criminal Code of Ukraine. The criminal was remanded in custody without bail. He faces life imprisonment with confiscation of property.

A collaborator from Luhansk region fantasized about concentration camps in Kursk region	One of such -generators of lies- is the traitor of Ukraine, ex-director of the Luhansk regional state television and radio company Rodion Miroshnyk. He is known, in particular, for the fact that in August of last year he spread a false order of the commander of military unit A7052 (Kherson) regarding the creation of mobile crematoria for Ukrainian soldiers. Rodion Miroshnyk of the special assignment of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation published a report -on the situation of the civilian population in the populated areas of the Kursk Region captured by the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation.- According to his data, -the Ukrainian military has created concentration camps in the border zone-.

Miroshnyk's fantasies are another example of -mirroring- information tactics, when the Russians try to accuse Ukraine of war crimes similar to those they themselves have committed since the beginning of the war. As you know, the system of filtration concentration camps was invented and actively used in the occupied Ukrainian territories by the armed forces of the Russian Federation. They imprison and torture Ukrainian citizens who threaten Russian control over Ukraine, including anyone with pro-Ukrainian views. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/19/kolaborant-z-luganshhyny-nafantazuvav-koncztabory-na-kurshhyni/	2024-09-18T20:27:10-07:00
About the fried enemy tank and the capture of the Russian commander: the war of Kombat Olefirenka	The major of the Armed Forces of Ukraine told the correspondent about episodes of combat work of tankers in a large-scale war, as well as about the preparation of the unit ArmyInform . Artur Olefirenko currently commands the 1st tank battalion of the separate Siver tank brigade. He started his military career back in 2014. Then he served as a mechanic-driver and fought against the Russians near Luhansk. Later, he decided to become an officer and entered the National Academy of Land Forces named after Hetman Peter Sahaidachny. In 2019, after graduating from university, I took the position of tank platoon commander in the 1st separate tank Siver brigade. - All my service - from platoon commander to battalion commander - I have served in the First Tank and this I'm proud! - says Artur Olefirenko. At the beginning of the large-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, Artur Olefirenko commanded a tank company. They were on the border with Belarus. But later they received an order to retreat to Chernigov and take up defense there. The first tank defended the city together with the 58th brigade named after Hetman Vyhovsky, which fought on the approaches to Chernihiv. At that time, Artur Olefirenka had a group of four T-64BV tanks. I had to work almost around the clock. Huge convoys of Russian vehicles and the practice of tankers against the enemy were remembered. In one of the battles, Artur destroyed a Russian T-72B tank, as well as an enemy BMP. The infantry fighting vehicle burned down along with the crew and landing party. And the crew of the tank was captured. In this tank was the commander of tank battalion 35 of the separate Guards Motorized Rifle Brigade of the Russian Federation, Major Leonid Shchotkin. Schotkin's crew managed to distinguish themselves by shelling a residential building in Chernihiv, for which the Russian major was later sentenced to 11 years in prison. — After the loss of command, the fighting spirit of the Russians disappeared somewhere, and the offensive was stopped, - recalls Artur Olefirenko. For the defense of Chernihiv at that time, Captain Artur Olefirenko was the commander of the 8th tank company of the 3rd tank battalion - received the award -Honorary Citizen of the City of Chernihiv- and the Order of Bohdan Khmelnytsky III degree. After the battles for Chernihiv, the company underwent reconstruction and received Bulat tanks. And again into battle. They fought in almost all areas of the front — near Kharkiv, in the Donetsk, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia regions. — The battles for Lysychansk and Lyman are the most memorable. Then we worked together with paratroopers of the 25th and 81st brigades. There, the company shot down a large amount of Russian equipment — Russian BMP-2s and tanks were on fire, Artur Olefirenko recalls. In 2024, he took command of a tank battalion. - As for a commander, the main thing for me is the motivation of the personnel. So that the tankers understood each other with half a word, so that they were friendly. Our battalion is a big military family. Senior soldiers train the new arrivals, they are helped in this by the battalion management. And we give 100%. It happens that newcomers don't do everything right away, but over time they make up for it, - says Artur Olefirenko. According to him, many soldiers of the battalion who were in battles were awarded both departmental honors and state awards. Replenishment takes place both at the expense of training centers, and they themselves periodically select tankers. In any case, all newcomers undergo training even in the unit itself. - For us, the main thing is to expel the enemy from our Ukraine and for our children to grow up without war, - adds Artur Olefirenko.

Stalker goes to sea: US shipbuilders presented an unmanned surface ship	As stated on the portal of the American manufacturer, Swift Sea-Stalker The S3 is an unmanned (remote or autonomous) small unmanned surface vehicle (sUSV) with high endurance, a strong aluminum hull and a super-powerful diesel engine, according to ArmyInform. Designed for surveillance and interception missions, the S3 USV is designed to operate in difficult waterways in conflict zones, including the Gulf of Africa and South China Sea regions. The S3 can be operated remotely or operate autonomously, providing flexibility and efficiency in maritime operations. Equipped with four AGM-179 Air-to-Ground Missiles (JAGMs) combined in one installation, this maritime drone represents a significant advance in the US Navy's unmanned maritime capabilities. The maritime drone has a top speed of more than 56 km/h, an effective range of 1,000 nautical miles, and the ability to continuously perform tasks for about 40 hours, ensuring long-term operational capabilities. These features enable it to effectively monitor and respond to threats along its coastlines, increasing security at sea. The Yanmar 4LV230 230hp (3800RPM) engine provided for this craft is available in two different powerplants: propeller driven and jet powered. It complies with NATO standardization agreements (STANAG) 4586 and the protocol of the common architecture of unmanned aerial vehicles systems (JAUS). The Marine UAV is capable of carrying a maximum payload of 1,500 pounds (680 kg). For control, the Swift Sea-Stalker S3 drone is equipped with radar/EO/GPS/AIS/ and COTS sensors. Swiftships recently received a contract from the Pentagon to manufacture the S3 USV. -We are proud to support the US Department of Defense's mission to protect its waters and protect vital maritime interests,- Swiftships said. -The delivery of the S3 USV is a significant step forward in achieving future maritime security goals.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/19/stalker-vyhodyt-v-more-sudnobudivnyky-ssha-predstavyly-bezpilotnyj-nadvodnyj-korabel/	2024-09-18T20:10:09-07:00
The F-16 is invincible in air combat, but there was one exception	ArmyInform tells about which plane was able to confirm the downing of an F-16 during a real aerial battle. The circumstances of the incident were reconstructed, so the dogfight can be viewed on video. Reconstruction of air battle between Greek and Turkish fighter jets The battle took place on October 8, 1996 in the context of the Aegean dispute - a conflict between Greece and Turkey over sovereignty and adjacent rights in the Aegean Sea and airspace spaces above it. Read also: F-16s were in Ukraine long before August 2024: Americans piloted together with Ukrainians However, for a long time none of the parties officially recognized the fact, and only more than one and a half ten years later, Turkey acknowledged the loss of one of its F-16s as a result of a Greek fighter jet being shot down by a missile. On the other hand, Greece has never officially acknowledged the downing of an F-16 fighter of the Turkish Air Force. It is known from open sources that the incident occurred during the Greek-Cypriot -Nikiphoros- exercises and the simultaneous exercises of the Turkish Air Force. It is reasonable to assume that the exercises were deliberately conducted simultaneously to disrupt the armed forces of a neighboring country. Read also: How the F-16 shot down the Russian -Sushka-: about the historic battle and why Kursk is here During the Turkish exercises, four F4 Phantom bombers moved to the southwest in the area between the islands Chios and Samos of the Aegean Sea. The bombers were accompanied by a pair of F-16 fighters. When the Greek military saw Turkish planes on radar, they raised a pair of fighter jets to identify and intercept the identified targets. Ultimately, this led to the downing of one of the Turkish F-16s. Read also: Two F-16s collide during simulated combat, one pilot survives: from NATO history When a pair of Hellas fighters went out to intercept, one of the Turkish F-16s, according to some claims , entered Greek airspace in the area of ​​the island of Chios. One of the Greek pilots immediately attacked, firing an R550 Magic II -Mazhik- missile at the intruder. The Magic R.550 is a close-range air-to-air missile from the French company Matra. It was developed in 1965 to compete with the American AIM-9 Sidewinder missile. Read also: F-16 -stormed- so fast that slow electronics couldn't cope: test video explains everything Magic R.550 made compatible with Sidewinder launch equipment, so it could be launched, in particular, from F-16 fighters. However, this time the missile was launched by another air fighter. It was as French as the missile, the Dassault Mirage 2000, a fourth-generation multirole jet fighter. Developed in the 1970s by Dassault Aviation, it became the main combat aircraft of the French Air Force in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Read also: Accidentally flew into the air. The incident that could put an end to the F-16 project Greece purchased from France and put the Mirage 2000 into service in the late 1980s, so by the mid-1990s Greek pilots already had many years of experience operating these fighters. After the defeat, one of the Turkish pilots died, but the second was able to eject successfully. Later, he was picked up by Greek rescuers. In Turkey, the fact of the loss of an F-16 fighter as a result of a battle with a Greek Mirage 2000 was recognized only in 2012. This was done by Turkish Defense Minister Ismet Yilmaz. In response to a parliamentary inquiry, a Turkish official said that on October 8, 1996, a Turkish F-16D Block 40 was shot down by a Greek Mirage 2000 using an R.550 Magic II missile. Despite the fact that Greece did not recognize the fact that the F-16 was shot down by a Mirage 2000 missile, in Turkey, the relatives of the dead F-16 pilot sued the Greek officer who piloted the Mirage 2000. This caused one of the many exacerbations in Greek-Turkish relations, about which was written with indignation in the media of both countries. The French began promoting their Mirage 2000 fighter as -the only plane that can shoot down an F-16.- Earlier, ArmyInform reported that France will provide Ukraine with Mirage 2000 aircraft and provide staffing of the Ukrainian army brigade.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/19/f-16-neperemozhnyj-u-povitryanomu-boyu-ale-stavsya-yedynyj-vynyatok/	2024-09-18T20:06:00-07:00
Battle for Pokrovsk: about fortifications, enemy losses and what does the weather have to do with it	What are the possible scenarios of the development of events in this direction and will the Ukrainian defenders be able to crush the offensive potential of the occupiers? Military expert Petro Chernyk told ArmyInform about this. — Is the task before the Russians to seize the Pokrovskoe-Myronograd agglomeration in a strategic sense? Of course, there is such a task. Why? This is the next link in the strategy that they are considering - access to the administrative borders of Donetsk region and Luhansk region. Indeed, they are somewhere within 10 kilometers of Pokrovsk. In fact, the enemy already has full-fledged barrel artillery there. Let's say the D-30 howitzer has a strike range of 15 kilometers, while their longest-range systems such as Hyacinth, Msta B, Acacia work at 28 kilometers. Yes, indeed, heavy artillery duels are already taking place on this part of the front. — But there are several important nuances. Let's recall Bakhmut. The active phase of the Battle of Bakhmut is 10 months. That's a lot. One PVK -Wagner- lost about 22 thousand killed there. If, relatively speaking, the battle begins in September-October, it will be long-lasting, heavy and bloody for the occupiers. Why? The so-called wet weather season is approaching, rains are expected in autumn. The enemy will not be able to use heavy tracked vehicles, such as tanks, BMP from flanking positions, from the field. There will be only large infantry ramparts. And large infantry ramparts are very, very difficult even for Rashist infantry to move on a wet field. Also, mining the terrain on our side. This is all they have to go through. The expert adds that the same reasoning applies to Avdiivka. Avdiivka was stormed by the Russians for almost 10 years, starting in 2014, just as the war in Donbas began. And this year alone, the active phase of fighting for this Ukrainian city lasted more than four months. During this period alone, the Russian army lost almost 50,000 soldiers. Petro Chernyk emphasizes that battles can be lost. Even if we have to leave Pokrovsk, it will not be a disaster. — I really like historical parallels. The Battle of Poitiers is one of the greatest victories of the English in the Hundred Years' War, which was won in 1356 over the French. Then the English captured the French king, but in the end, England just lost the war. And there is one more nuance. The enemy now has a huge personnel problem. He is able to mobilize up to 30-32 thousand per month, but he can't do more at the moment. During this summer alone, the Defense Forces of Ukraine destroyed more than 107,000 Russians. And here, as I call it, the pre-emptive extermination of even 2-3 thousand enemy personnel is a very important and principled issue. I do not cancel the battle for Pokrovsk. It (this battle. - Ed.) is extremely important, but I don't think it will be an easy walk for the occupiers. Perhaps the battle for the Pokrov-Myrnograd agglomeration will be the battle that will ultimately undermine the combat potential of Russian troops. How the Germans once undermined their strategic offensive potential during the ten-month standoff with the French at Verdun in 1916. Of course, time will tell. — In the spring, the government allocated more than 20 billion hryvnias for the construction of fortifications of defense lines. Defense lines continue to be built near Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad. The expert adds that -this is a continuous process.- Of course, the construction of fortifications, with problems, with human factors, mistakes and the like, is not without this, but they are still being built. And the enemy will have to reckon with it. — In addition, the process of saturating the units of the Defense Forces with weapons is currently underway. Chernyk says, at the beginning of the Great War, the Americans produced 14,000 shells of 155 caliber per month. And now they have already confirmed that now, for the fall, they reached the figure of 50 thousand shells. This is a very good step forward. Also, the Czech armed initiative to help Ukraine was fully operational. — Recall that at the beginning of the large-scale invasion, the ratio of artillery volleys was 1 to 10, 1 to 15, and sometimes 1 to 20. Now even the Russians say that there are moments and locations when we (Ukrainian Defense Forces . — Ed.) in parity, and sometimes there are more artillery volleys than they have. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/19/bytva-za-pokrovsk-pro-fortyfikacziyi-vtraty-voroga-ta-do-chogo-tut-pogoda/	2024-09-18T20:00:05-07:00
They were scared by a drone, shot with a machine gun - a trap for the enemy from our fighters	The video appeared on September 18 on the group's channel. The assault group of Russians hid in a barn. Our FPV drone flew there. After the explosion, those Russians who could walk ran away. Two invaders ran right at our machine gun and were shot at close range. As reported by ArmyInform, the pilots of Tactical Group -Adam- made a selection destruction of Russian attack aircraft that never reached our positions.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/18/nalyakaly-dronom-zastrelyly-z-kulemeta-pastka-dlya-voroga-vid-nashyh-bijcziv/	2024-09-18T12:07:34-07:00
The Russians use UAVs for delivery in the Kharkiv Region: the Armed Forces oppose	Vitaliy Sarantsev, the spokesman of OTU -Kharkiv-, told about this on the air of the nationwide telethon -Edyny Novyni- . — The opponent is trying to apply it. In particular, this was also the case in Vovchansk, when with the help of drones they deliver provisions and ammunition to blocked servicemen on the territory of the Aggregate Plant. They also tried to provide those units that perform tasks near Lyptsi or Lukyantsi, he said. The spokesman explained that these are mostly UAVs capable of carrying a certain load weighing up to several kilograms. Thus, the enemy is trying to carry out logistical support measures, that is, to deliver water, provisions, and ammunition. -However, it is going very badly for him, at least in the direction of Hlyboky-Lyptsy, because there we have strengthened certain measures and, in connection with this, logistical support of the enemy's forward positions is almost not happening,- the spokesman said. He noted that he will not reveal all the secrets live, but noted that the Defense Forces are effectively countering the enemy in this regard. At the same time, the occupiers intensified aerial reconnaissance with the aim of finding new supply routes, places of possible basing and setting up positions, as well as identifying units of the Defense Forces and subsequently inflicting fire damage on them. — As for the location and the direction of Liptsi-Hlyboke, we notice a certain lull in the enemy's activity there, but this does not mean that he has abandoned his intentions. He is strengthening there, he is carrying out fortification equipment for his positions, he is bringing in additional personnel there, - Vitaly Sarantsev said. This means that the enemy has not given up its aggressive intentions and plans to resume offensive actions. — The most difficult situation remains in Vovchansk itself, where fighting is constantly going on where the enemy is trying to advance in different areas of the city. In particular, in the areas of high-rise buildings, he is trying to carry out assaults in some places with the support of light armored vehicles. However, he does not manage to do all this, said the spokesman of Kharkiv OTU. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in the Vovchan direction, the occupiers increased the number of reconnaissance drone flights, increasing air reconnaissance by about 40% compared to the previous period.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/18/bpla-dlya-postachannya-zastosovuyut-rosiyany-na-harkivshhyni-zsu-protydiyut/	2024-09-18T11:57:01-07:00

But the assault of the Russians ended before it had even begun. First, the enemy was hit by FPV drones and drops. Those who remained alive tried to escape, but in vain. One of the invaders decided to pretend to be dead, but our drones did not believe him. Then the Russian -helped- himself with early demobilization with his own machine gun. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the 24th mechanized brigade named after King Danylo filmed the remains of Chasovoy Yar, which the Russians continue to storm and erase from the face of the earth with all possible types of weapons: artillery, mines, rockets, kamikaze drones and anti-tank missiles.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/18/forsuvaly-kanal-potrapyly-na-toj-svit-znyshhennya-voroga-bilya-chasovogo-yaru/	2024-09-18T11:46:10-07:00
Mines are dropped from drones: the Armed Forces explained why the Russians mine the area in the Khar...	Does this indicate the enemy's refusal of offensive operations on the air of the nationwide telethon -Edyny Novyny- explained the spokesman of OTU -Kharkiv- Vitaly Sarantsev. — They are not mining a continuous territory, but are conducting reconnaissance of possible routes for the advancement of our forces, and on these possible routes they are dropping mines. They are dropping a PFM-1 mine, the so-called Petal, he said. Recently, the fighters of the units of the Defense Forces also discovered new anti-personnel mines, which were probably made in an artisanal way. - Recently, it was noticed that they are trying to use a new type of ammunition - a mine, the body of which is made on a 3D printer. It is made of plastic, that is, it does not have increased electromagnetic sensitivity. Inside it is filled with TNT, has a detonator, the spokesman said. It is precisely such mines that the Russian occupiers scatter on the routes of the possible advance of units of the Defense Forces. — This is done with the help of UAVs. I won't say it's a systemic thing, but it means the opponent needs more time to prepare for a counterattack. In this way, they are trying to restrain the possible advance of units of the Defense Forces, Vitaly Sarantsev explained. At the same time, he emphasized that the Russian occupiers have not given up their aggressive intentions. They move and accumulate personnel, reform and reformat assault groups, attempt to establish a system of command, communication and supply in order to build up forces and resume offensive operations. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that occupiers began to scatter anti-personnel mines of a new type in the north of Kharkiv region, which in principle, the actions are similar to the prohibited PFM-1 -Petal- mine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/18/miny-skydayut-z-droniv-v-zsu-poyasnyly-navishho-rosiyany-minuyut-misczevist-na-harkivshhyni/	2024-09-18T11:32:09-07:00

When the smoke after the heavy smoke cleared, it turned out that there were no bodies of the occupiers left at the site of the explosion. The pilots had to search for their remains in the bushes.

Transferred -to foot feed-: in Kharkiv Oblast, the occupiers poisoned themselves due to a lack of pr...	The reasons for the mass poisoning of the Russian occupiers on the air of the national telethon -Edyni Novyni- explained the spokesman of OTU -Kharkiv- Vitaly Sarantsev. — The reasons are quite simple. For several days, the personnel of the enemy, who are in the forward positions, will not receive either provisions or water. Because of this, he is forced to switch to foot feed, he said. Forced to feed themselves, the occupiers often consume poor-quality water and food. - He is forced to drink water from streams or from wells. Earlier, we reported that in some places the enemy does not take away their dead, due to which there is a complication of the sanitary-epidemiological situation, the spokesman explained. So the situation is complicated by the fact that in some places the enemy does not evacuate irreversible losses, so the bodies of the dead Russian soldiers decompose and poison the area. — A certain amount of something gets into the ground, into the water. This is all the enemy is trying to consume. This leads to the fact that the personnel who drank or used this water, where there are other needs, develop gastrointestinal disorders. There are no corresponding medicines either. This worsens, in addition to everything else, the enemy's morale, which is why we note cases of more frequent surrenders, - said Vitaly Sarantsev. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that massed stomach disorder knocked off the feet of the occupiers in Kharkiv Oblast and that zdavatysya-v-polon/->logistics -in manual mode- forces the Russian invaders to surrender as prisoners.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/18/perevely-na-pidnozhnyj-korm-na-harkivshhyni-okupanty-potruyilysya-cherez-nestachu-proviziyi/	2024-09-18T10:49:12-07:00
An analogue of the forbidden -Lepestka-: the occupiers are installing new mines in Kharkiv Oblast	This was notified in Kharkiv OTU. These are pressure mines that have a body printed on a 3D printer. Inside the case is a detonator and a plastid charge. -In terms of size and principle of action, the new mines are similar to the PFM-1 -Petal- mine banned by international conventions. Their small size and unpredictable nature make them extremely insidious,- Kharkiv OTU emphasized. There are currently no reliable data on the scalability of the production of these mines in the Russian Federation. It can be assumed that the appearance of such mines may be the result of the private initiative of individual manufacturers. Despite the relative ease of making such mines, they pose a serious threat to the lives of our defenders. In connection with the new danger in the -Kharkiv- OTU, they called for increased caution in the combat zones and in the liberated territories. Earlier, ArmiyaInform reported that the Armed Forces of Ukraine explained why are Russian inhumans executing Ukrainian prisoners.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/18/analog-zaboronenogo-lepestka-na-harkivshhyni-okupanty-vstanovlyuyut-novi-miny/	2024-09-18T10:44:16-07:00
From raising children to aiding the occupiers: a kindergarten worker was convicted in Kharkiv	This was notified in the Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office. An employee of one of the Kharkiv kindergartens has been an active participant in pro-Russian chats in the Telegram messenger since September 2023. There, the woman wrote comments in which she denied the armed aggression of the Russian Federation and discredited the defenders of our state, claiming that they are the ones who strike the civilian infrastructure of the regional center. In addition, while communicating with an acquaintance who lives in the Russian Federation, the woman gave him information about the locations of the Ukrainian military on the territory of Kharkiv. This information was not published in open access. Law enforcement officers exposed the woman at the end of March this year at her place of residence and seized evidence of her illegal activities. The accused was awaiting trial while in custody. During the trial, she fully admitted her guilt and repented of what she had done. The court found the woman guilty of disseminating information about the location of military formations formed in accordance with the laws of Ukraine, committed under martial law, as well as manufacturing and disseminating materials that contain denials of armed aggression by the Russian Federation against Ukraine. The court sentenced the woman to 5 years in prison. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that a Russian policeman and his Ukrainian posipaka will be tried in Kharkiv Oblast for that during the occupation they tortured Ukraine's defender.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/18/vid-vyhovannya-ditej-do-posobnycztva-okupantam-u-harkovi-zasudyly-praczivnyczyu-dytsadka/	2024-09-18T10:34:53-07:00

The authors of the gun convoys with explosives: traitors from Luhansk region will be sentenced in ab...	This was notified by the Security Service of Ukraine. There, they collected the evidence base for three more collaborators who cooperate with the Russian Federation on the temporarily captured part of the territory of Luhansk region. We are talking about Yevgeny Katsavalov, the head of the occupation administration of the -MNS LNR- and his two -deputies- - Vitaly Kucherov and Roman Kochetov. After their appointment to -positions- in 2023, the individuals involved began to follow the instructions of the Kremlin regarding the logistical support of the occupation groups of the Russian Federation fighting on the eastern front. In particular, they organized the transfer of combat FPV drones from Russia to the occupiers on the front lines. To disguise military routes, the collaborators carried out the transportation of UAVs by trucks under the guise of -humanitarian aid- for the civilian population of the frontline areas. At the same time, enemy accomplices transported ammunition and military ammunition to the Russian troops in such -gumconvoys-. -In addition, the collaborators organized the production of explosive devices for drones, which the Rashists use to attack advanced units of the Defense Forces of Ukraine. Collaborators often -report- about this during speeches on the airs of rosZMI, where they also call on the civilian population of the temporarily occupied areas of Luhansk region to support the war against Ukraine. For his cooperation, Putin awarded Katsavalov the rank of -Lieutenant General of the Internal Service- by decree, the SBU said. On the basis of the received evidence, the investigators of the Security Service informed all three collaborators in absentia about the suspicion under Part 5 of Art. 111-1 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (voluntary occupation by a citizen of Ukraine of a position related to the performance of organizational-administrative or administrative-economic functions in illegal authorities created in the temporarily occupied territory, including in the occupation administration of the aggressor state). Comprehensive measures are underway to bring perpetrators to justice for crimes against our state. As reported ArmyInform, the Security Service detained another FSB agent in Donetsk region.

A new food supply model for the Armed Forces: what is known	The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine informed about this on September 18. The principle and goal of the new model is to reduce logistics in delivery and increase quality control. The MOU studied the practice of partners from Great Britain and involved expert opinions from other NATO agencies, the USA and Canada in order to implement the best practices in the Ukrainian model. -We are introducing a two-tier quality control system. The additional stage is at the distribution centers,- said the Deputy Minister of Defense. According to him, representatives of the DOT, the Ministry of Defense and suppliers check the quality of products. Only after that they are sent to military units. -For the first time, the State operator of the rear will select producers of 75% of the catalog food product through so-called signal tenders on the Prozorro system. That is, those products that are most often used are ordered by military units,- Dmytro Klimenkov said. According to him, these are meat, fish, canned goods, cereals, dairy products, etc. Suppliers will sign contracts with manufacturers. -DOT-Chain will implement a so-called black list, where suppliers who do not properly fulfill their contractual obligations will be noted,- he added. This model will be launched as a pilot project from February 2025 and will operate within a year in Kyiv, Vinnytsia, as well as in Zhytomyr, Cherkasy, Kyiv and Kirovohrad regions. No additional funds are required for this pilot project. It will be implemented exclusively with the money provided for the purchase of food products for the Armed Forces of Ukraine. One of the goals of this model is transparent reporting. Each stage of the procurement and supply process will be recorded in an electronic system. All processes and responsibilities of each party will be written there: from the customer to the contractor, from the application to the fact of delivery. -This will allow, first of all, to monitor and quickly respond to challenges and problems. The second is that it will contribute to the prevention of corruption, it will increase the responsibility of each party, and most importantly, we will receive information, analytics on the volumes and terms of supply,- Dmytro Klimenkov explained. As reported by ArmyInform, DOT-Chain is a unique digital system for managing food supply processes for the army. The system shortens the product supply cycle by 4 times and improves quality control.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/18/nova-model-postachannya-harchovyh-produktiv-dlya-zsu-shho-vidomo/	2024-09-18T09:24:34-07:00

Overwhelm -Orlana-: how we manage to destroy Russian UAVs	Military expert Petro Chernyk answered this question. — The enemy has now begun to lose many more unmanned aerial systems, especially high-altitude ones, which fly at an altitude of several kilometers. First of all, it is about their most massive reconnaissance unmanned complex -Orlan-10-, the expert notes. And he adds that a really breakthrough moment happened in the middle of this summer: - Our radio electronic struggle increased by an order of magnitude. The phenomenon consists in the fact that we managed not only to increase the production of the required amount (of REB means - Ed.), but also to greatly reduce its cost. The breakthrough did happen. And the state should be thanked for the fact that, by law, a number of restrictions were removed from the components that come to Ukraine. The second reason for the increase in the enemy's losses of operational-tactical UAVs is the improvement of the operation of portable anti-aircraft missile systems of various classes and types. — These are the same FIM-92 Stinger or excellent RBS-70 complexes, which have proven themselves very well&#8230; And we should mention one more unique thing - kamikaze drones: we have learned to use them to climb to great heights to enemy UAVs and destroy them, says a military expert. And he concludes that the three components he listed are what allowed our Defense Forces to raise the enemy UAV destruction rate so high. But Petro Chernyk advises not to be enchanted: — Because in the area of ​​radio-electronic warfare, the enemy has the second school in the world. He also knows how to work with REEs. And microelectronics can be obtained on world markets. He learns and learns quite quickly&#8230; At the same time, the expert notes that the level of destruction by our Defense Forces of such a number of operational-tactical level enemy UAVs is a truly unique phenomenon that has not yet occurred in this war. — If I had been told a year ago that it would be possible to approach the Orlan-10 with the help of another drone, and a smaller one, it would have only made me smile.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/18/zavalyty-orlana-yak-nam-vdayetsya-nyshhyty-rosijski-bpla/	2024-09-17T20:33:14-07:00
29 months of captivity. The history of the struggle, capture and return of the Hero of Ukraine Vikto...	During the battles for surrounded Mariupol, on April 11, 2022, Viktor Ivchuk was awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine by the Decree of President Volodymyr Zelenskyi. And the very next day, April 12, Ivchuk was captured by the Russian Federation. The story of the officer's combat journey and resilience, 29 months of captivity and his return home is in the ArmyInform material. A military man originally from Vinnytsia. Studied at Mykola Pirogov Vinnytsia National Medical University. 2014 year. An officer in the 95th separate airborne assault brigade of the Armed Forces participated in battles in the east of our country. At that time, he was the head of the medical service. The fighting was heavy and intense, so Ivchuk, together with his comrades, provided first aid to wounded soldiers and civilians, and carried out their evacuation. On July 27, 2014, during the assault on the Savur Tomb, the officer received a shrapnel gunshot wound to the right hand. But, despite this, he organized a real special operation, thanks to which it was possible to evacuate 60 wounded from the battlefield. For this, Ivchuk was awarded the Order of Bohdan Khmelnytsky III degree. For several years, he held the post of deputy head of the military hospital in Dnipro, while simultaneously studying for a master's degree at the Ukrainian Military Medical Academy. A month before the beginning of the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation, Colonel Ivchuk was transferred from Kyiv to Mariupol and appointed to the position of commander of the 555th military hospital. The hospital continued its work even after February 24, 2022, despite constant shelling by Russian troops. Until March 16, when the last building of the institution was destroyed by bombing at the same time as the Mariupol Drama Theater, where hundreds of civilians were hiding. Thanks to the efforts of hospital doctors, hundreds of lives of the defenders of Mariupol and its residents were saved. They worked despite everything, although operations had to be carried out under fire, in basements, in helmets and body armor. In March 2022, a bomb hit the hospital - the facility was targeted by the enemy. All the medical personnel, together with the wounded, divided into two groups. The first one was to join the Ukrainian military at Azovstal. The other, including Commander Viktor Ivchuk, went to the Ilyich metallurgical plant. On April 11, 2022, the head of the Mariupol military hospital, colonel of the medical service, Viktor Ivchuk, was awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine with the award of the -Golden Star- order. -On April 11, 2022, by the decree of President Volodymyr Zelensky, my husband was awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine. In the morning, I received telephone greetings, and I knew nothing about the decree - it was not at all before that. The next day I received a message from an unknown number: -We are being taken prisoner.- I had a mixed feeling. On the one hand, she was happy that her husband was still alive, albeit in captivity. At that time, no one even imagined what Russian captivity was. On the other hand, it was very infuriating that the occupiers, contrary to the norms of international humanitarian law and the Geneva Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners of War, forcibly deprived the doctors of their freedom. They should have let them go! But no. They said they would trade them for their military,- recalls Victoria Ivchuk. The wife remembers the last phone conversation with her husband at the beginning of April 22nd - he was saying goodbye to her and her son. What followed were 29 long months of enemy captivity. According to his wife (and she was told this by military men who had been released from captivity earlier), the leadership of the colony in Olenivka allowed our medics, including Viktor, to treat and care for the wounded, whom they took out of Mariupol. But when the terrorist attack happened, they were not allowed to join the victims. People were burning alive, but no one was saving them. And a year after that tragedy in Olenivka, his wife Viktoria received a letter with a stamp of the Russian post office on the envelope. In the envelope was a piece of paper with a few lines: -I'm fine.- She recognized Victor's handwriting. But there was no date in the letter - it was difficult to understand when it was written. As it turned out later, shortly after the prisoners were taken from Olenivka to Stary Oskol, the colony distributed to everyone the same pieces of paper with the identical text: -Everything is fine with me.- Victoria, together with the families of captured and missing doctors, created the public organization -Military Doctors of Ukraine-, which included relatives of prisoners from Kherson region, Donetsk region, and Kharkiv region. Together, they gathered all the information related to the prisoners, which was transmitted by the relevant authorities. The NGO cooperates with governmental, human rights and public organizations. Has its own site. In June of this year, Victoria and other women, whose relatives defended Mariupol and are illegally held in Russian torture camps, had an audience with the Pope and asked him to facilitate the release of Ukrainian prisoners of war. During the meeting, Victoria Ivchuk presented the pontiff with a symbolic medical gown with photos of captured doctors. The officer returned to Ukraine after the exchange on September 13, 2024. His son, wife, parents and brother were waiting for him. Photos from Victoria Ivchuk's personal archive and from open sources	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/18/29-misyacziv-nevoli-istoriya-borotby-polonu-j-povernennya-geroya-ukrayiny-viktora-ivchuka/	2024-09-17T20:21:49-07:00
Wounded in battle: about payments to defenders during treatment	ArmyInform explains when and what wounded defenders can receive and why payments may stop. By the way, currently all social guarantees also apply to those military personnel who perform combat missions outside Ukraine - on the territory of the aggressor state. In the event of injury to a military serviceman, the payment of financial support for the last position held for the entire period of treatment is preserved. Currently it can continue not more than 12 consecutive months. Here we are talking about the time a military man spends in hospitals or hospitals, as well as medical leave. This usually takes several months. If there is a need for longer treatment, then no later than 4 months after the start of treatment, you need to undergo VLC. It is on the basis of this decision that the payment of financial support should continue in the future. Tip: During the entire period of treatment or medical leave, stay in touch with your immediate commander and report any changes. Our own experience shows that this prevents payment problems. This payment is included in the list of additional rewards. In the army, it is better known as -combat-. She is also a wounded soldier assigned. But there are certain nuances. When is it paid? Now about the nuances. The basis for this payment is a certificate about the circumstances of the injury (injury, contusion, mutilation), so-called form 5. It must be provided in a military unit. And it must be stated that the injury is related to the defense of the Motherland. If there is no such wording in the certificate, then the money will most likely not be credited. The certificate must also state that the serviceman was wearing personal protective equipment, did not commit a criminal offense, did not attempt to injure himself, and was not under the influence of alcohol or drugs. All the listed items are grounds for refusing to pay additional compensation. One more nuance. After discharge from the hospital, the -combat- 100,000 should continue to be paid only if you are sent on leave for treatment due to a serious injury. This should be spelled out in the conclusion of the VLK. If the injury is not serious, then the payment of 100,000 is stopped. It is also worth remembering that this additional reward is calculated in proportion to the number of days. That is, as well as -combat- (for example, if you were in the hospital for 20 days, then the additional reward will be approximately 65 thousand hryvnias). If additional reward after wounding is not paid, then a report should be written in the name of the commander for inclusion in the order for payment of additional reward and a copy of the certificate of wounding should be attached to this report. If the payment is refused, and you consider it illegal, you can contact the hotline of the Ministry of Defense or lawyers. Case law shows that, as a rule, military personnel are still credited with all guaranteed benefits, if there are grounds for this. Wounding of servicemen is one of the grounds for the payment of material assistance for solving social and household issues. This is defined by decision of the Minister of Defense dated September 16 January 2024. Such assistance may be paid once a year in the amount of a monthly allowance. More about how to get this help can be read here. If the injury resulted in disability or partial loss of working capacity, in this case you can also count on one-time cash assistance. Its size depends on the established disability group and the subsistence minimum for able-bodied persons, which is revised every year. If the disability occurred as a result of an injury during the performance of military service duties, then the following payment amounts have been established in 2024: One-time assistance is provided not only in the event of injury during the performance of military service duties, but also , who received a disability during military service as a result of illness or injury. The amount of the benefit also depends on the set disability group: A one-time benefit is provided in case of partial disability. The Medical and Social Expert Commission (MSEK) must establish the degree of disability in percentage. The amount of payment will depend on the established degree. For servicemen who are partially disabled due to injury (contusion, trauma or mutilation), illness during the performance of military service duties, the basic amount from which the amount of payment will be calculated is 211,960 hryvnias. For example, if the MSEK established a 20% loss of working capacity for you, then the one-time benefit amount will be UAH 42,392. Finally, one more piece of advice: keep all medical documents (form No. 100, conclusions of VLK, MSEK, certificate on the circumstances of the injury, etc.). Without them, it will be very problematic to prove your right to payments later.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/18/poranennya-v-boyu-pro-vyplaty-zahysnykam-pid-chas-likuvannya/	2024-09-17T20:13:59-07:00
There is fake creativity in the swamps again: screenshots of fake orders of the Ministry of Defense ...	So, recently, a photo of order No. 274t dated September 4, 2024, allegedly from the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, has been circulating on the Internet, in which, with the aim of -following European values-, they order to create special conditions of service for -servicemen representing LGBTQ+-. Also, full-time psychologists of military units are supposed to conduct testing of personnel for belonging to these communities. The so-called document is fake, as is its content. First, the -order- does not meet the requirements of official record keeping. Secondly, the Chief of the General Staff cannot sign the order of the Ministry of Defense. Thirdly, the content of the fake document contradicts at least the Constitution of Ukraine and several laws. In addition, this is not the first time that Russian fakers have tried to ridicule and humiliate LGBT+ representatives, including the military. In the face of a large-scale invasion, Russia describes itself as a territory for everyone who believes exclusively in -traditional values.- And Ukraine is trying to be shown as a country where the authorities are forcibly engaged in -LGBTzation- of citizens. In this way, the aggressor country demonstrates its disdain for the democratic system, opposing it to the -Russian measure-.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/18/na-bolotah-znovu-fejkokreatyv-v-soczmerezhah-gulyayut-skriny-pidroblenyh-nakaziv-minoborony-pro-lgbt/	2024-09-17T20:00:25-07:00
-Russian peace- in action - the occupiers continue to bomb Suja	The video appeared on September 17 on the unit's channel. The footage shows burning civilian houses, in which the civilian population could well be. But the Russians do not stop it at all. -Russians are destroying their city of Suja again.

-I will not step back-: Stalin's order is read to the occupiers in the Kharkiv region	About this in an interview for ArmyInform told the spokesman of the -Kharkiv- OTU, Colonel Vitaly Sarantsev. — In the Kharkiv direction, cases are known when the commanders of the occupiers read order No. 227 in front of the formation, using it as an additional motivational tool, he said. According to the spokesman, this indicates that Russians identify the events of the Second World War with modern aggression against Ukraine. They believe that they are continuing the heroic struggle against fascism and Nazism. - They connect all this into a single whole with modern events. This simplifies the perception of the conflict by Russians, as they are forced to believe that Ukraine is not a victim of aggression, but a continuation of the same -fascism- that their grandfathers fought against, Vitaly Sarantsev explained. More about it read in ArmiyaInform's long interview with Vitaliy Sarantseva.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/17/ny-shagu-nazad-stalinskyj-nakaz-zachytuyut-okupantam-na-harkivshhyni/	2024-09-17T10:44:16-07:00

The Armed Forces explained why Russian inhumans execute Ukrainian prisoners	About this in an interview for ArmyInform told Colonel Vitaly Sarantsev, spokesman of the Kharkiv Technical University. The occupiers closely monitor the reaction of Ukrainians to the war crimes of the Russian military, collect comments, and then show their own servicemen what they are called to do with them in captivity. — The case with the 155th Marine Infantry Brigade of the Russian Federation, when they put the head of a Ukrainian soldier separated from his body on a stake and bragged about it on video, proves just that. Of course, this provoked quite outrageous comments on social networks, with calls for the same treatment of Russian prisoners. The propagandists of the Russian Federation collect all these posts (made, in particular, not by Ukrainians themselves, but by Russian bots) and use them for information and propaganda work both among civilians and among the Russian military. In this way, they show, they say, this is what will happen to those who surrender to captivity, the spokesman explained. In addition, the Russians hope to provoke or stage similar war crimes already on the part of the Ukrainian military in order to influence both the Russians and Ukraine's foreign partners with the goal of depriving Ukrainians of international support. More about it read in ArmiyaInform's long interview with Vitaliy Sarantseva.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/17/u-zsu-poyasnyly-navishho-rosijski-nelyudy-strachuyut-ukrayinskyh-polonenyh/	2024-09-17T10:03:44-07:00

Instead, those servicemen who were freed due to such rotations are redirected by the Russian command directly to conduct offensive actions. At the same time, conscripts who perform special tasks to ensure logistics on the territory of the Russian Federation are in the same risk zone as any other servicemen of the Russian army. — We inflict fire damage on the enemy, wherever he is.

They are promised a powerful social package so that they have already moved to another status and they can be involved in directly conducting hostilities, the military explained.

Logistics - in manual mode - in Kharkiv Oblast forces the occupiers to surrender	Vitaly Sarantsev, the spokesman of OTU -Kharkiv-, reported this on the -Suspilne Novosti- broadcast. Cases when the enemy surrenders in the Kharkiv direction have become more frequent. Yesterday, there were two Russian prisoners in the north of Kharkiv region, and today four occupiers surrendered. — The adversary is forced to find new routes for logistics, to change logistics methods. If earlier he used the technique in some places, now he does all this exclusively in manual mode, that is, he carries everything by hand, he said. This situation arose as a result of the successful actions of the Defense Forces, primarily fighters from the UAV units, who broke the supply chains in the enemy's near rear with the help of bomber drones and kamikaze drones. — An opponent who has been in advanced positions for a long time does not receive adequate support. We manage to break the logistics chains and, accordingly, they sit without food, without water. Of course, this in a certain way affects their moral and psychological state and they prefer to surrender themselves to captivity than to return to their commanders, to the inhumane treatment that is organized in them directly in the places, the spokesman explained. The military emphasized that the motivational measures for the personnel of the Russian occupying forces by the enemy command have the opposite effect to what the Russians wanted. — They only contribute to the enemy losing faith in the military and political leadership and, accordingly, they choose the right path for themselves in terms of surrendering, — Vitaly Sarantsev concluded. The spokesman said that cases of desertion of the Russian military are currently observed in several areas of the Kharkiv direction - in the Vovchansk region, near Hlyboky and Lukyantsi. -The personnel have a certain percentage of demoralization and refuse to follow orders, refuse to carry out combat missions, refuse to carry out special tasks of casualty evacuation or logistical support,- he said.

Institute for the study of war and media: the Armed Forces explained how to avoid distorting the fac...	On this emphasized the spokesman of OTU -Kharkiv- Vitaly Sarantsev in an interview with ArmiyaInform. — The Institute for the Study of War is an authoritative resource that analyzes the situation based on open data. However, its reports are often based on a large amount of information from various sources, which may change or be incomplete. At the same time, ISW does not distinguish between official and unofficial sources and very often uses propagandistic Russian materials in its analysis, he said. Voiskovy emphasized that credit should be given to the Institute's analysts, because they always refer to sources of information, providing a list of everything they used during the preparation of the report. At the same time, he noted that the Ukrainian media often unjustifiably perceive the Institute's messages as a definitive fact, thus presenting society with a distorted picture of events. — This undermines our work, the work of the official communication channels of the military-political leadership of the state, the work of communicators of the Armed Forces and Defense Forces as a whole. We are conducting a defense operation in which every action, including informing the public, must be subordinated to the interests of defense. Using unverified information, even taking it from such a powerful resource as the Institute for the Study of War, one can unknowingly play along with the enemy, the spokesman emphasized. More about the information space of modern war read in the great interview of Vitaly Sarantseva ArmiyaInform. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that Ministry of Defense officials held a meeting with the delegation of the Institute for the Study of War, emphasizing that The Institute for the Study of War is one of the well-known analytical centers whose work helps the world see the real state of affairs during the Russian aggression against Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/17/instytut-vyvchennya-vijny-ta-media-u-zsu-poyasnyly-yak-unykaty-perekruchennya-faktiv/	2024-09-17T00:38:37-07:00

A cavalcade of diplomats to China, the Taliban and why the collapse of the Russian Federation: an ex...	These questions were answered by military expert Petro Chernyk. — The process of finding a formula for exiting this phase has begun. The most striking sign and argument for this is the so-called summit in Switzerland. A lot of countries gathered there, they simply wouldn't have gathered if they didn't understand some logic of the development of events, says the expert. And he notes that this process cannot be fast: - I really like historical parallels. Let's say the Americans have been negotiating with the Taliban for more than a year. Agreed, but it lasted over a year! This is despite the fact that the stakes in Ukraine and the US stakes with the Taliban are completely out of proportion. Chernyk calls the huge cavalcade of diplomats from Europe to China a second serious sign that the process of finding a way out of this war has begun. — And most importantly, Lavrov recently made a series of statements that they do not need foreign territories, that they are fighting for some Russian people who speak Russian, for the so-called Russian peace. But could there be a trap (in possible negotiations. — Ed.)? Maybe, says a military expert. And he notes that history knows many similar cases: - The brightest, the closest to us, is the Cyprus problem of 1974. Then the Turks invaded Cyprus, formed their own republic, which no one recognizes. And two large countries, primarily the United States and Great Britain, resolved this issue. But the conflict was not resolved by itself, there is no solution to it until now. Can something similar happen with the Ukrainian issue? According to Petr Chernyk, maybe. — I really don't like the word -freeze- because our conflict cannot be frozen for such a long time. There is a high probability that some new demarcation formula will be found. Of course, no one recognizes those territories in the civilized world. A large international contingent is also possible. Why not? It is only important that there are not many Russian proxies there, because they are, say, on the African or Latin American continents, the military expert emphasizes. According to him, in the future, as soon as Russia enters a breathing mode, sanctions may be partially lifted from it, and the possibility of the next Russian-Ukrainian war is only a matter of time: - But again, there is one more very important nuance. This is dangerous and not the best scenario for us, but the Russians have not achieved the most important goal. They did not liquidate Ukrainian statehood. Ukrainian state to be&#8230; And we will truly calm down only when the Russian Federation breaks up into 25-30 states, their nuclear weapons are taken away, they are cut off from free resources in Siberia, and the population that will remain around Moscow undergoes the so-called sanitization - ideological cleansing. The same as the Nazis went through after World War II. Chernyk names our further accession to NATO or the formation of a direct military alliance with the USA as an option. — If this does not happen, even if we find a very acceptable formula for us, then the issue of the Russian-Ukrainian war will only be a matter of time. As Bolshevik Lenin said: -Losing Ukraine is like losing your head.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/17/kavalkada-dyplomativ-do-kytayu-taliban-ta-do-chogo-tut-rozpad-rf-ekspert-pro-ryzyky-myrnyh-peregovoriv/	2024-09-16T20:30:32-07:00
How reports are prepared at OTU -Kharkiv-: about Telegram, news reports from the front line and the ...	The modern war of Russia against the Ukrainian people and the state of Ukraine is sometimes called the most documented and represented in the media in the history of mankind. Media coverage of hostilities plays a colossal role in shaping public opinion about the war in Ukraine and abroad, and influences public attitudes and policies of foreign partners. ArmiyaInform spoke with Colonel Vitaly Sarantsev, spokesman for the operational-tactical group -Kharkiv-, about the information component of modern warfare. The first part of the interview: Kharkivshchyna as a friend of Syria: the spokesman of the OTU -Kharkiv- called the most despicable purpose of the application KABs. — On the Telegram channels of Ukrainian units and individual military units, and following them in the Ukrainian media, videos are often shared not only of destroyed equipment or positions of the occupiers, but also of liquidated enemy personnel. On the one hand, this is a demonstration of the effectiveness of the combat work of the defenders of Ukraine. On the other hand, there are accusations about the inhumanity of the distribution of such videos, and in some cases they even try to talk about violations of international law, laws and customs of war. How justified are such criticisms of the Ukrainian military? Can the published video recordings be used against the Defense Forces of Ukraine? - Several main points should be taken into account here in order to maintain a very shaky balance between the appropriateness of placing this or that publication and the impropriety, so to speak. On the one hand, the video that demonstrates the effectiveness of our defenders is a kind of message to society that the army is fighting and winning. This is also a kind of report to our citizens who help the Defense Forces with donations. Also, these videos show the average Russian occupier that he could be the next victim. At the same time, posting on information resources video clips depicting the bodies of the dead or the suffering of the wounded may be considered a violation of international humanitarian law, in particular, norms on respect for human dignity or rules for treating the wounded. Everyone who is involved in the work in the information sphere, be it television, news sites, or channels in social networks, has a special responsibility for how they talk about war, because the constant promotion of such content can lead to the desensitization and normalization of violence in society. It should be remembered that every word, every photo, every video frame has weight, especially in wartime. Before disseminating any information, the media person should be aware of its potential consequences. Can it be used by the enemy and how? Will it harm the morale of our defenders? Will it cause panic among civilians? We must be responsible for every word, because not only our reputation, but also the fate of the country depends on it. — I agree, but sometimes one gets the impression that accusations of inhumanity or violations of international law against the Ukrainian military are excessively scrutinizing, especially against the background of what the Russian occupiers openly indulge in and brag about — murders, torture, indiscriminate shelling, or even special targeting destruction of residential buildings, educational and medical facilities, energy facilities etc. One gets the impression that the aggressor is allowed to do everything - he and the aggressor, his crimes have already become a general characteristic of the occupier, and therefore no one is interested. Whereas Ukrainians are forced to fight -in white gloves- - there is such meticulous, increased attention to us. - Indeed, a certain cognitive disparity is visible: on the one hand, we feel the war crimes of the Russian Federation, which has already become the norm for everything of the world, and on the other hand, increased demands are being made to Ukraine regarding compliance with international humanitarian law. For many, this gives rise to a sense of injustice and double standards. But it should be remembered that one of the rules of International Humanitarian Law is non-reciprocity or non-response to wrongful actions of the enemy. This means that respect for the laws of war does not depend on the actions of an enemy who does or does not follow the same rules. The laws of war must be respected at all times, regardless of the actions of the enemy. That is, if the Russians shelled Okhmatdyt, it does not mean that we have the right to shell some children's hospital in the Russian Federation. The rule -an eye for an eye- does not apply here. Therefore, our task is to spread true information about the war and the crimes of the Russian Federation, involve foreign media, involve international organizations in the investigation of these war crimes. In any case, we must adhere to international humanitarian law, even in spite of provocations by the enemy, because, among other things, this is also an important factor in obtaining international support, including military aid. - One more related question. The Armed Forces of Ukraine are hitting enemy positions, including across the border, on Russian territory. But sometimes we get the impression that our territory is being hit regularly, constantly, a lot, and we do not strike back or hit very little, because we were forbidden by the Western allies, we were not given ammunition, etc. Is it even necessary to talk about the fact that the armed forces are also inflicting fire damage on the territory of the Russian Federation? - The enemy must be destroyed wherever he is. Russia has attacked us and is waging an aggressive war of aggression under a fictitious pretext. the Russians seek to destroy the Ukrainian state and the Ukrainian people. We know how cruel the enemy is in his actions, without any moral and ethical restraints. Therefore, it should be destroyed, in particular, on its own territory. According to international law, every state has the right to self-defense. Russia is the aggressor and is fully responsible for all the destruction and casualties on both sides. And of course we have to talk about it. — Quite often, Ukrainian media disseminate information about the situation at the front with an appeal to foreign sources, which are perceived as more authoritative and reliable than Ukrainian ones. For example, reports citing the daily reports of the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) as a primary source have become very popular since the beginning of the large-scale invasion. At the same time, it is not difficult to notice that in many cases the institute's report is reduced to a simple recording and transfer of information from open sources, including official data of the Defense Forces of Ukraine — operational information regarding the Russian invasion of the General Staff of the Armed Forces, information messages of operational-strategic and operational-tactical groups troops, speeches of officially authorized spokespeople, etc. Why is this happening, why do our media people often cite ISW as a primary source even where the institute's report simply repeats official reports? - The Institute for the Study of War is an authoritative resource that analyzes the situation based on open data. However, its reports are often based on a large amount of information from different sources, which may change or be incomplete. At the same time, ISW does not distinguish between official and unofficial sources and very often uses propagandistic Russian materials in its analysis. To the credit of its analysts, they always cite the sources of information, providing a list of everything they used in the preparation of the report. But some of our media probably need to be scolded in this matter, because they perceive the information reported by the Institute as a given. For some reason, it is believed that if certain information is published by ISW, then it means that it has real confirmation and acquires official status. As a result, they sometimes present society with a distorted picture of events. I believe that this is unacceptable. In addition, it undermines our work, the work of the official communication channels of the military-political leadership of the state, the work of communicators of the Armed Forces and the Defense Forces in general. We are conducting a defense operation in which every action, including public information, must be subordinated to the interests of defense. Using unverified information, even from such a powerful resource as the Institute for the Study of War, can unwittingly play along with the enemy. - Can you open the veil of secrecy a little, how a regular daily information message is prepared in Kharkiv OTU? - During the day, we receive information from the areas of the front, from all the brigades that perform combat tasks in our operational-tactical group . Of course, we also work in units during trips. We work with data provided by intelligence. It should be taken into account that the war is very dynamic, the course of hostilities is very fluid. Therefore, in order not to harm our troops, certain information, of course, does not go to the general public, but we organize other information into a daily summary. We may provide some information with a delay, for example, it refers to those moments when we have made some progress or reached new milestones. — And do you take information from any Russian propaganda resources? Do you monitor them? - Of course. Monitoring of the information space, including that of the enemy, continues around the clock. We intercept all information related to the course of hostilities. We, of course, analyze how the enemy presents news and what he talks about. Now we can conclude that the depopulation of Ukrainians — and not only the military, but also civilians — on Russian propaganda resources has reached the point where calls for the total genocide of the entire Ukrainian people are already being presented as something completely commonplace and something that should not arouse in Russians no objections. -Nazis- for Ukrainians is perhaps the most moderate option, there are many much worse ones. The use of such radical images not only incites hatred, but also creates a hostile atmosphere that makes genocidal actions against Ukrainians acceptable in the eyes of Russian society. — But these media can be read by Ukrainian media professionals and ordinary readers. What advice would you give them when they accidentally or purposefully go to an enemy resource? How to work with the information received from there? - The most important thing is that you don't have to go there at all. There are many interesting and useful information resources, both domestic and foreign. Russian ones do not belong to them. But if you still got there, then I advise you not to fall into -betrayal-, because the entire information module on Russian propaganda resources is built in such a way that it can cause panic in an unprepared reader. It should be understood that these channels are propaganda, that they present a distorted reality, and it will be very difficult for an untrained reader to read this or that information. In general, it is important to maintain critical thinking and observe certain rules of safety and media hygiene. —Most of the Russian propaganda resources available to the Ukrainian reader work on the Telegram platform. Since the beginning of the large-scale war, there has even been a certain phenomenon of the so-called Zyu-voenkors, who, of course, are not any military correspondents, but act purely as propagandists of the aggressive war of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, providing its media support. Telegram is very popular in Ukraine, but it has a lot of frankly manipulative channels and hostile propaganda, so it is increasingly believed that it can be dangerous for the national security of Ukraine. So what to do with Telegram in Ukraine? - In my opinion, we should not abandon Telegram or ban it. Banning such platforms may resemble the actions of authoritarian regimes, where control over information is used to suppress dissent. However, its status needs to be determined. Is it messenger or media? If it is a media, then its activities must comply with Ukrainian legislation that regulates the media sector. This means that it must comply with requirements regarding the reliability of information, countering propaganda and protecting national security. This issue needs to be clearly defined at the legislative level to avoid abuse and to ensure both freedom of speech and safety. In addition, a clear definition of the status will make it possible to establish who is responsible for the content that is distributed through Telegram channels. In general, in matters of the functioning of not only Telegram, but also social networks, Ukraine should -show its teeth- more often. We must have strong legislation and tools to monitor, regulate and, if necessary, control platforms that can be used to undermine our country's sovereignty or spread harmful information. —You mentioned the Kursk region, and in continuation of the information topic, I also want to ask about the Russian prisoners of war who were captured by the Defense Forces. It is noticeable that Russian propaganda has strengthened allegations that Ukrainians treat prisoners cruelly, on the one hand, and is trying to increase hatred of the Russian military among Ukrainians, on the other. - This is true. The case with the 155th Marine Corps Brigade of the Russian Federation, when they set the head of a Ukrainian soldier on a stake and bragged about it on video, proves just that. Of course, this provoked quite outrageous comments on social networks, with calls for the same treatment of Russian prisoners. The propagandists of the Russian Federation collect all these posts (made, in particular, not by Ukrainians themselves, but by Russian bots) and use them for information and propaganda work both among civilians and among the Russian military. In this way, they show, they say, this is what will happen to those who surrender to captivity. Such work with the Russian military has certain fruits - some of them prefer to self-destruct - shoot themselves, blow themselves up with a grenade or even strangle themselves with an Esmarch tourniquet - than surrender to captivity. - But at the same time, there are reports in the Ukrainian media from brigades about how wounded Russian servicemen surrender as prisoners - Yes, this happens, and it has been happening, in particular, in our direction, since May more than 50 Russian occupiers surrendered as prisoners. Among the vivid cases, there was a report from the -Charter- brigade about how Ukrainian fighters, with the help of a drone, threw water and a note with instructions on how to surrender to a wounded Russian to a wounded Russian. Then he was taken to Ukrainian positions by drone, and everything was fine with him. In general, Ukrainians treat prisoners in a civilized manner, this cannot even be compared with the conditions in which our prisoners of war in the Russian Federation find themselves - it is enough to compare the appearance of prisoners during exchanges. —In fact, sometimes it is very surprising when Russian propagandists and Russian users of social networks are outraged by reports about the rescue of Russian soldiers, about the fact that they are being taken prisoner. Why does it cause such hatred in them that the Ukrainians saved their military man? - Here, probably, it is a matter of their mentality as a whole. Heroic death is cultivated in Russia. This goes back at least since World War II. A prime example is Stalin's infamous Order No. 227 -let's take a step back.- Surrender is considered something shameful, if a person surrendered even wounded and unable to continue fighting, they still consider him a traitor and a criminal, even his closest relatives disown him very often. This attitude towards prisoners in Russian society also prompts their soldiers to die or lay hands on themselves, but not to surrender. The Russian command constantly warms this attitude. It is in our Kharkiv direction that cases are known when the commanders of the occupiers read order No. 227 in front of the formation, using it as an additional motivational tool. This, by the way, shows that the Russians identify the events of the Second World War with the events that are happening now. They believe that they are continuing the heroic struggle against fascism and Nazism, etc. They connect all this into a single whole with modern events. This simplifies the perception of the conflict by Russians, because they are forced to believe that Ukraine is not a victim of aggression, but a continuation of the same -fascism- that their grandfathers fought against. The very reports about our humane treatment of Russian prisoners destroy the image of bloodthirsty -Nazis- they created for Ukrainians. When it turns out that this is not true, it makes them extremely angry. This breaks the picture that Russian propagandists have been creating for their fellow citizens for decades about Ukraine and Ukrainians. — In your opinion, do the Ukrainian media cope with keeping the propaganda blow from the Russian Federation and at the same time competently informing the Ukrainian society? Do we win this war information or do we lose more? On the one hand, most Ukrainian media resist the flow of misinformation by the Russian Federation. For example, factual initiatives and independent journalistic projects significantly reduce the impact of Russian narratives within the country and beyond. It is also worth noting a certain increase in the level of media literacy of Ukrainian citizens. On the other hand, Russian propaganda, which has huge financial resources and media platforms, continues to be a threat, especially at the international level. As for the question of whether we win the information war, the answer is difficult. In many aspects, Ukraine has won important victories, in particular in shaping a positive international image and coverage of the truth about Russian aggression. However, Russian propaganda still affects certain audiences, especially in the west and in countries where Russian media have a strong position, so we all have a lot of work. By the way, literally it became known that the USA, Canada and the United Kingdom have launched a joint diplomatic campaign against sources of Russian influence in the world. In addition, the United States has imposed sanctions on the Russian propaganda channel of Russia Today and one of the main mouthpieces of the Kremlin Dmitry Kiselev. You can only congratulate these decisions, as this is another step towards our victory.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/17/yak-gotuyut-zvedennya-v-otu-harkiv-pro-telegram-vidosy-z-peredovoyi-ta-instytut-vyvchennya-vijny/	2024-09-16T20:19:49-07:00
the Russian IPSO attacks: why does the enemy lie about payments for the status of a child of war	Yes, since the beginning of September, a video has been circulating there, which talks about the alleged entry into force of the new law No. 4995 on the status of -children of war-, according to which from September 1, 2024, children will receive 15 thousand hryvnias each month for three years. The video shows the website of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine and screenshots from the Diya portal about the status of a child of war. The service identifier is 01199. In fact, this information is not true, it is distributed with the aim of misleading the public and increasing the degree of social tension in our state. Law No. 4995, which is referred to in video, was adopted back in 2017 and concerns the provision of housing for families of fallen ATO soldiers. In addition, according to with the service identifier 01199, it is indeed possible to obtain the status of -child of war-, but this only applies to persons who are citizens of Ukraine and who were less than 18 years old at the time of the end of the Second World War (September 2, 1945). State Propaganda Russia's apparatus uses TikTok to broadcast Kremlin narratives, spread disinformation, and IPSO. At the beginning of 2024, the social network even introduced restrictions on the distribution of content from the accounts of Russian propagandists. One of the most famous examples of Russian IPSO in TikTok, which is aimed at demoralizing Ukrainian society, are videos with allegedly Ukrainian military personnel and demotivating comments in them. . Text messages or a voiceover blame the Ukrainian authorities for all problems, not the Russian Federation, which is waging a terrorist war against our country. In this way, the enemy is trying to create a split within the society. In some cases, the Russians decorate real Ukrainian videos from the front in their own way, in others they try to pretend that they are showing servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, applying stickers in the form of chevrons, etc. The peak of the next wave of distribution of such videos coincided with the beginning of the mobilization campaign, so their goal was and remains the disruption of mobilization. Research shows that almost 20% of search results on TikTok contain fake or information that misleads users. Because of this, several countries around the world have already taken the initiative to ban this social network.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/17/rosijske-ipso-atakuye-navishho-vorog-breshe-pro-vyplaty-za-status-dytyna-vijny/	2024-09-16T20:12:29-07:00
Two in one: Poland has developed the newest UAV — a scout that can be an artilleryman	As claim the developers of the aircraft from the Polish company WB Electronics, this UAV significantly expands the user's situational awareness, while giving him the ability to safely observe rapidly changing situations on the battlefield or in other environments, ArmyInform reports. One of the main features of X-FRONTER is the use of a military-grade encrypted communication line to control it. This technology provides stable communication protected from jamming attempts, which allows the drone to effectively perform reconnaissance and strike missions at a distance of several kilometers from the operator. With this level of protection, infantry units can rely on the X-FRONTER to conduct surveillance and precision attacks in difficult combat environments. The X-FRONTER is capable of carrying a small explosive payload, including thermobaric, fragmentation, and cluster warheads. This ability makes it not only a reconnaissance tool, but also an effective means of inflicting point strikes on the enemy. In addition, the design of the drone allows it to be easily adapted for different missions, including additional modules such as: infrared markers, devices for installing smoke curtains and other technical innovations. Another important technology implemented in X-FRONTER is the capability for swarm operations. This drone can work in a group with other drones, dividing tasks among themselves. For example, several X-FRONTERs can perform reconnaissance, while other drones equipped with explosives act as mobile artillery, striking the enemy. This greatly expands the tactical capabilities of infantry on the battlefield. The design of the drone from the Polish manufacturer in the folded state resembles a PET bottle in size and shape, which allows you to easily carry it with you. The drone is capable of reaching a speed of up to 60 kilometers per hour and a height of up to 300 meters. In the unfolded state, the X-FRONTER is quite a classic quadcopter, that is, a four-rotor aircraft with symmetrically located -shoulders- around a cylindrical fuselage. Its -hands- with stationary engines and propellers are hidden right in the hull, thanks to which both transportation and preparation for flight take place quickly and without problems, and the absence of protruding elements prevents them from being damaged during transportation. Flight time is up to 40 minutes, which gives infantry units considerable operational flexibility. This flight duration allows the drone to perform long missions, providing reliable support to troops in various situations. X-FRONTER is a versatile tool that can significantly increase the combat capabilities of infantry units. Thanks to its compact size, high mobility, encrypted communication and the ability to operate in swarms, this drone becomes indispensable for a wide range of tasks on the battlefield. The Polish developer presented a new compact and deadly X-FRONTER infantry drone.

The Defense Forces spoke about the tactics of the Russians in the Lymano-Kupian direction	Officer Andrii Otchenash, commander of the Kara Nebesna UAV crew of the Rubizh brigade, told about this on the broadcast of the Yedyny Novyni telethon. According to him, the enemy moves mainly by infantry, and much less often by vehicles. -They use a huge number of personnel. In some places, technology is used, but not as brightly as it was before. They understand that as soon as they use a large amount of equipment, it will be destroyed immediately,- said the officer. He explained that the Russians are trying to move in small groups, accumulate at certain points and carry out further offensive actions. -For example, a group of 10 Russians moves, four arrive. They hide in dugouts, where it is more difficult to get them. Next comes the next group. They are all waiting to be replenished until they are collected enough for assault actions,- the officer noted. As reported by ArmyInform, today in the Kupyansk direction the enemy ;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=traficsource->carried out seven assaults near Sinkivka and Lozova.

He provided the occupiers with transport and fuel: the director of the agricultural company will be ...	The Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office informed about this. The director of an agricultural enterprise located in the village of Bily Kolodyaz of the Kharkiv Region became an accomplice of the occupiers and handed over to them the automobile equipment of the agricultural company controlled by him and the fuel for it. Since March 2022, the head of the enterprise deliberately established contact with representatives of the aggressor state and handed over the premises of the elevator building along with the equipment and other material assets available at that time to the enemy. In June of the same year, the occupiers appointed a man to the position of -temporary administrator of the Branch of the Joint-Stock Company -Gosudarstvennaya provodlovstvennia zernovaya kompaniya Ukrainy Belokolodezyansky elevator-. The enemy's helper ensured the operation of the enterprise and organized the reception, drying, shipment and temporary storage of agricultural crops. In addition, the accused gave instructions to subordinate employees to refuel motor vehicles that were on the company's balance sheet, which he later also handed over to the armed forces of the aggressor state. An accomplice of the enemy performed his duties until the moment of deoccupation. Currently, he is hiding from Ukrainian law enforcement officers, he is declared wanted. The man will be tried in absentia for aiding the aggressor state. He faces up to twelve years of imprisonment with deprivation of the right to hold certain positions or engage in certain activities for a period of up to fifteen years and confiscation of property.

The Russian soldier who shot two residents of Buchi was declared a suspect	This is stated in messages of the National Police. At the end of March 2022, an armed occupier detained a 75-year-old unarmed local resident without reason. Together with the hostage, he broke into the house of another Buchi resident without warning and demanded to give him alcohol and drink with him. The 63-year-old owner replied that he does not drink alcohol. The occupier did not accept the refusal and searched the kitchen, as a result of which he found alcohol, got angry and shot both residents of Buchi with automatic fire. The men died on the spot from their injuries. At that time, the sister and wife of the murdered owner were hiding in the next room and witnessed the murder of their family member and neighbor. They also told the investigators that later the Russian military came to them and buried the body of the owner of the house in the yard, and the body of another man was taken outside the territory of the house - a few weeks later his son found his body covered with leaves. The investigators of the National Police established the identity of the murderer. He is a 26-year-old native of the Altai Territory, a sniper of the 27th separate detachment of special forces -Kuzbass- (military unit 6607, Kemerovo) of the National Guard of the Russian Federation. Under the procedural guidance of the General Prosecutor's Office, he was informed of the suspicion of violating the laws and customs of war, combined with intentional murder (Part 2 of Article 438 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine). He faces life imprisonment for war crimes committed on the territory of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/16/vijskovomu-rf-yakyj-rozstrilyav-dvoh-meshkancziv-buchi-ogolosyly-pro-pidozru/	2024-09-16T08:22:26-07:00

Strengthened by 40%: the enemy intensified aerial reconnaissance in the Kharkiv region	The enemy's goal was explained on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- the spokesman of the OTU -Kharkiv- Vitaly Sarantsev. - Enemy air reconnaissance increased by about 40%. He spends her both day and night. It should be noted that the adversary can thereby fulfill two purposes. The first is the identification of units of the Defense Forces with the subsequent task of fire damage on positions and our forces and assets. The second issue is reconnaissance of movement routes for own units. He monitors this or that area and tries to draw up an optimal route for moving both personnel and equipment, he said. Another task of enemy air reconnaissance is to find routes for safe movement in the nearest enemy rear for the purpose of establishing logistics. — He is trying to find new routes for logistical support activities. Because our FPV drones do not allow us to live peacefully, do not allow us to move peacefully for any purpose - whether for assaults or for delivering provisions or ammunition to advanced positions, the spokesman said. Despite this, the Russians are still trying to use equipment for logistical support and personnel transportation. Defense forces effectively counter such attempts. — Yesterday evening, the enemy tried to bring personnel to Vovchansk with the help of vehicles. But the equipment was discovered, it was damaged and it was partially destroyed along with the crew and the landing party that it was carrying to reinforce units in Vovchansk, Vitaliy Sarantsev reported.

On the air of the national telethon -Yedini Novyni- the spokesman of OTU -Kharkiv- Vitaly Sarantsev emphasized this. — First of all, of course, it is the destruction of the carriers of these ammunition. This is the first. And the second, more important, I believe, is the destruction of the airfield infrastructure in the range of the weapons that we are now asking from our partners, he said. Strikes on enemy airfields with long-range weapons from Western partners can significantly change the situation for the better for Ukraine. — Destruction of airfield infrastructure, destruction of airstrips, destruction of warehouses with ammunition, warehouses with PMM — this, of course, would greatly improve our situation and greatly weaken the offensive capabilities of the enemy, he explained in detail.

The Armed Forces explained why the Russians do not dare to attack ships in the grain corridor	This was noted by the spokesman of the Navy of Ukraine, Captain 3rd Rank Dmytro Pletenchuk, on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyni- . — The incident took place outside our grain corridor, our corridor is operating in a stable mode. Most of it, as you know, passes through the territorial waters of the member countries of the North Atlantic Alliance. Accordingly, the Russians do not dare to do such pranks in these waters, he said. In addition, grain carriers usually sail under foreign flags. Among the leaders who use the services of the Ukrainian grain corridor, China is on the first place and Spain is on the second. — We had a similar case last year. Over time, of course, it will become clear whether this was a targeted attack or not. However, this does not change the fact that the Russians targeted a civilian vessel, regardless of whether it was the result of the irresponsible use of inappropriate weapons or a targeted attack, the spokesman emphasized. Russians hit a civilian ship with wheat from Ukraine for Egypt with the Kh-22 Burya anti-ship missile. - This is a rather outdated type of weapon. It is anti-ship, but given that it was immediately designed for a nuclear warhead, an error of 50 kilometers was not a problem for it. But when it is used with another warhead, it can become a problem for it - not only for it, but also for everyone who is in the radius of flight of this missile, Dmytro Pletenchuk noted. He reminded that this missile should be called -50 for 50- - launched more than 50 years ago, it may not hit the target, deflecting at a distance of more than 50 kilometers. The spokesman also noted that the Russians launched a missile from a Tu-22 strategic aviation bomber. -This shows that the Russians do not dare to come close to our coast using tactical aviation,- he emphasized. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that withdrawal of Russian ships from the port of Novorossiysk is connected with the threat of use of long-range weapons by the Defense Forces of Ukraine, which could hit ships at the base's location.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/16/v-zsu-poyasnyly-chomu-rosiyany-ne-navazhuyutsya-atakuvaty-sudna-u-zernovomu-korydori/	2024-09-16T01:03:24-07:00

-From fire to flame-: the Russians made an unpleasant choice in the Black Sea	Such a well-founded assumption was made by the spokesman of the Navy of Ukraine, Captain 3rd rank Dmytro Pletenchuk, . - This may indicate the fact that at some point the Russians felt uneasy at their base of Novorossian and had to choose, as they say in Russia, -from fire to flame,- he said. The occupiers had little choice - either to stay at the base, where they could be hit by Ukrainian long-range weapons, or to go out to sea, where Ukrainian naval drones stalk enemy ships. — As a result, they chose to go out to sea, where they can meet Ukrainian drones. Why did they make this choice? We'll probably find out sometime soon. But most likely, their choice was not very pleasant, the spokesman suggested. Obviously, it became even more dangerous for the occupier ships to stay at the base in Novorossiysk than to go to the open sea. - The tactic of hiding at the Novorossiysk base for the past many months is understandable, because it is easier to organize defense there than in the open sea. Therefore, such a choice leads to similar conclusions, Dmytro Pletenchuk noted. On the other hand, he emphasized, it is hardly possible to claim that going to sea is connected with the possible use of ship-based missile weapons by the Russians. Earlier, ArmyInform explained, what could threaten the mass withdrawal of Russian missile carriers to the Black Sea, and reported that due to logistical problems, the occupiers will increase the transport load on the emergency Crimean Bridge.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/16/yz-ognya-da-v-pol%d1%8bmya-u-chornomu-mori-rosiyany-zrobyly-nepryyemnyj-vybir/	2024-09-15T23:15:55-07:00

Mobilized in Britain: -cloak-coat- and -dragon fire- on -forest exercises- Interflex	We are camping near the lake. In the morning, fog hangs and swirls on the surface of the water. Today is the last day of the -forest- trip, and we are finally lucky - for the first time in three days, the rain subsided, and then the rain stopped. As soon as the sun rises over our -Sherwood- forest, thick steam rises from the ground, grass, trees and wet clothing. The rays burn as mercilessly as the cold rain poured down before it. Such is the climate and weather of the British Isles in the middle of the sea. For the next lesson, instructors gather at our branch on the lake shore. We wait for several minutes until the other departments come up - they are a little further, so they have to go longer. At this time, we are quizzed to find out how well we remembered the content of yesterday's lessons. I catch myself thinking that it is easier to do the task correctly than to explain how and why exactly you do it. It's not a language barrier - our translators do an excellent job. The point is in the nature of the memorization itself - it happened at the bodily level of muscle memory, so in order to realize it, it is necessary to first reproduce the sequence of actions. Some rush not to tell, but to show. Instructors do not deny that in battle you need to do, and not explain how you do it. Doing the task is better than talking about it, and the teachers are happy with the students, which is what they wanted. In the end, the whole platoon gathers on the shore and we are shown the content of the next lesson. The instructors remind once again that a good soldier must always take care of himself. Good health and physical fitness, sufficient sleep and rest, adequate nutrition and comfortable living conditions determine the combat effectiveness of personnel, and therefore the effectiveness of combat missions. The instructors note that in the rain we all got soaked. In addition, they explain, during the hostilities we will have to overcome water obstacles one way or another, which is why we were gathered on the shore of the lake. So now there will be hands-on training with elements of immersion in reality and we will be taught how to dry quickly even if we get wet even worse than we already got wet in the rain. The hint becomes more than transparent - we guess that now at least part of the lake will have to be waded along the shore. -Hell, I think, why get up an hour before the official climb and dry my uniform - I'd rather sleep.- The next thought is about where the children's clock goes - I have an ordinary office clock and in the rain it has already fogged up from the inside from excessive moisture, although the hands are still moving. Diving would leave him no chance of survival. The intrigue is intensifying, but we still haven't received an order to swim across the lake or even enter it. Realizing exactly what we are afraid of, the instructors look at each other conspiratorially and smile. I watch how the second hand crawls behind the fogged glass, and I decide to drown the watch for good. The house, the mountains and the barn burned down - we had to buy a waterproof one. I don't want to get into the water in a dry form, but I'm already mentally ready for that. Everything is resolved unexpectedly - another one of the instructors just swims up to us from the depths of the lake. For at least 20 minutes, he watched us from the cold water near the shore. Now, using his own example, he will show us how to quickly dry thoroughly soaked clothes and shoes. We will dry our already wet uniforms - there is no need to get into the lake for this. The technology of self-drying is simple - we have already described it and shown it a little earlier. In about the same way, I dried myself before waking up. However, the instructors now show and describe important details that we might not have paid enough attention to. The basic things you need for drying are a fire source and dry fuel, ours is FireDragon - -dragon fire- or -dragon fire- as you prefer. It is desirable to also have some kind of stand on which you can place a mini-fireplace, but in extreme cases, an ordinary stone or a fragment of a brick will also do. The most interesting element is the -cloak-coat-, which we just called - a poncho, a tent, a cape, and a cover. The variety of names is due to the versatility and multi-functionality of this rectangular sheet. With the help of a -cloak-coat-, you can arrange the simplest shelter - a mini-tent or a cover. You can simply cover your gear and supplies with it, or wrap yourself in it. A camouflage-colored waterproof -cloak-coat- is necessary so that no one notices you during a stop. It is able to protect both from a heavy downpour and from the scorching rays of the sun. And during drying, the -cloak-coat- helps to create a special microenvironment around the fighter dressed in thoroughly soaked clothes, in which the high temperature allows for rapid warming, and the intense evaporation - to expel moisture from the clothes. The main thing is to be careful not to burn the -cloak-coat- with -dragon fire-. But this is already a matter of vigilance and the minimum necessary skills. The instructor easily advises on this, as long as his colleague explains the best way to dry the shoes. Read also: The General Staff showed what equipment Ukrainians receive during training in Great Britain Finally, we they ask if we noticed the newcomer from the lake before they invited him out. We did not notice - under some branches hanging from the shore and natural debris, the instructor was extremely well camouflaged. Careful local camouflage will be one of our next lessons. The Interflex Intensive continues with another action-packed day.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/16/mobilizovanyj-u-brytaniyi-plashh-palto-ta-vogon-drakona-na-lisovyh-navchannyah-interflex/	2024-09-15T20:20:18-07:00
Combat Boat 90: the expert talked about the advantages of combat boats that Ukraine will receive fro...	The purpose, tactical properties and combat capabilities of the SV90, as well as the likely scenarios for the use of these boats, in particular in the Azov-Black Sea region, were told to the ArmyInform correspondent by the officer of the Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, retired captain 1st rank, candidate of military sciences Stepan Yakymyak. It is known that these boats are the best in their class, as evidenced by their use by many countries, including the United States. It is no secret that the so-called -great maritime power- of the Russian Federation also at one time purchased several samples of such boats from a Swedish manufacturing company and built one and a half dozen such boats. Swedish SV90 combat boats were produced in different versions and for various tasks, but during their design and creation, the main task was the rapid deployment and landing of amphibious assault groups on the coast. This is evidenced by the special bow gear, the ability to transport a relatively large number of people in a special protected room and the small draft of the boat (0.8 m), which allows a direct approach to the shore. According to Stepan Yakymyak, these boats are primarily capable of quickly and safely delivering personnel over considerable distances and covertly evacuating them. — For example, in the conditions of hostilities on rivers 2 km wide, a group of six such boats can transfer a company of paratroopers in full equipment from one bank to another within 1.5-2 minutes. In sea areas, this unit can be overturned by the same group of boats over a distance of more than 400 km in about ten hours with the mandatory condition of providing combat support for this group and support, primarily from air strikes, Stepan Yakymyak noted. Other advantages include increased maneuverability and the ability to approach directly to different types of coasts (rocky, sandy, marshy, etc.). — In addition to amphibious, assault, and special operations, combat boats of the SV90 type, if used by the Defense Forces of Ukraine, can be used to lay mines, to perform patrolling tasks, transport troops and property, and evacuate the wounded. Also, these boats can perform tasks in the protection of sea and river communications and in combat support of forces operating in river and sea areas and on the coast. In the case of operations along the sea coast and ensuring greater stealth of operations, the task of transferring several special-purpose groups to the coast controlled by the enemy can be successfully accomplished. When using such boats, it is necessary to carefully plan reconnaissance, surveillance and cover them from the air against the strikes of UAVs and enemy fighter-bomber aircraft. So, the range of tasks, taking into account the actual areas of operation of the Defense Forces of Ukraine on rivers, estuaries and the Black Sea, is actually very wide. However, as Stepan Yakymyak adds, a much larger number of such boats is needed, which is due to the scale and scope of the areas of military operations and the combat capabilities of the enemy. If their number is sufficient, they could perform up to 40-60% of the main combat tasks of the surface forces of the Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine at sea and rivers. By the way, about the options for the use of these boats told the spokesman of the Navy, captain of the third rank, Dmytro Pletenchuk.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/16/combat-boat-90-ekspert-rozpoviv-pro-perevagy-bojovyh-kateriv-yaki-otrymaye-ukrayina-vid-shvecziyi/	2024-09-15T20:09:33-07:00
Stolen icons, hanged children and a shot train: fakes about Kurshchyna, with which the Kremlin scare...	In August, screenshots of ads allegedly posted on the OLX service appeared on z-channels. They depict Orthodox icons that were allegedly taken by the Ukrainian military from the Kursk region. The most common selection published by Telegram scammers includes five allegedly stolen icons. >Estonian resource provereno.media found the originals of these images. As it turned out, the icons come from Konotop, Zaporizhzhia, Kyiv, Kremenchuk and Lviv Oblast. One technical detail unites all the fake images: the top line shows the location — Kursk Oblast and Kursk. But everyone who uses the Ukrainian OLX service knows that only Ukrainian regions can be selected there. Kyiv and Kirovohrad regions, as well as Crimea (ARC) are represented on the site under the letter K. The purpose of spreading this fake is obvious — to accuse the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of looting. ArmyInform already wrote about the -reflection- tactic, which Russian propagandists actively use when talking about Kurshchyna. This is how they try to accuse Ukraine of war crimes similar to those committed by the Russians in 2022 in Buch, Mariupol, Izyum and other Ukrainian cities and villages. Recently, propagandists have been terrorizing their citizens with particularly brutal -units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine- , formed from Georgian, Polish, French and American mercenaries-, who -hanged 8 children in a barn-, or that -The command of the Armed Forces during the attack on the Kursk region ordered to shoot a passenger train.- In Ukraine and in the West, such lies no longer work, because many representatives of foreign, influential and truly independent media have already visited the occupied Armed Forces territory of the Kursk region. In their reports, foreign media persons claim that they did not see traces of -atrocities- similar to Russian prisoners, as well as to civilians — that is why Moscow is so nervous about uncontrolled mass media in a territory it does not control. In addition, it was the Kremlin that refused to provide a humanitarian corridor for the evacuation of civilians from the territory of Kurshchyna, which is controlled by the Armed Forces of Ukraine. That's why many questions about Putin and his managerial vertical arise already in Russia itself. After all, the Kremlin dictator uses Russian citizens in the war only as consumables.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/16/vykradeni-ikony-povisheni-dity-ta-rozstrilyanyj-poyizd-fejky-pro-kurshhynu-yakymy-kreml-lyakaye-svoyih-gromadyan/	2024-09-15T20:00:59-07:00

Volodymyr Zelenskyy told the details of Ukraine's victory plan	The head of state told about this in interview CNN. -I will personally speak with Joe Biden before the Peace Summit about how to strengthen us so that we are in a strong position. Because diplomatic solutions are good if you are strong. Otherwise, Putin will not even participate in this. And I think that under other circumstances they would not be interested in stopping the war,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. The President noted that victory for Ukraine means being very strong and being ready for strong diplomacy. -And that is why I have prepared several points. Four of them are the main points. Plus one that we need after the war. I will share them with President Biden. It is about security, geopolitical location of Ukraine, very strong military support of Ukraine. And about the fact that we should freely decide how to use this or that thing. We are talking about decisions on economic support,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. He added that he is ready to accept proposals for this plan from Joe Biden's team if they strengthen the peace plan and Ukraine's position. -I think it will be fair and proper to share this plan with both candidates for the presidency of the United States - Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. And a lot also depends on the decisions of the US Congress, so we would like to share with Congress as well. After these steps, we are ready to share the plan with everyone,- said the President of Ukraine. Earlier, Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Ukraine is asking the United States to grant permission to use long-range weapons to attack Russian airfields, but not received it yet.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/15/volodymyr-zelenskyj-rozpoviv-podrobyczi-planu-peremogy-ukrayiny/	2024-09-15T09:11:35-07:00
Vovchansk is under fire control: the occupiers are hiding in the woods	A military man with the call sign -Stig- told about this on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- - officer of the 2nd separate detachment of the Special Purpose Center -OMEGA- of the National Guard of Ukraine. — The city is almost completely destroyed, there is not a single whole building. We are right now in the suburbs of Vovchansk, so I can confidently tell you that there is not a single whole building in the city, he said. The degree of destruction of Vovchansk is catastrophic - the battles are taking place right in the urban development. — The city is completely under fire control both from the enemy's side and from our side. Right now, an artillery duel is going on, the city is being covered by enemy artillery, our artillery is working, our strike drones are working, the military said. The occupiers do not stop trying to advance and gain a foothold in the city ruins. — The enemy is trying to advance with reconnaissance groups, small infantry groups to some new positions. However, it faces resistance from the Security and Defense Forces and loses its offensive potential. But he will not stop trying to move forward through the city, the officer said. At the same time, the occupiers cannot set up positions in the city, so they mostly entrench themselves in the surrounding forests. - They try to hide mostly in the forests. Very good vegetation here, very good terrain from the point of view of shelters. Therefore, most of them hide in dense forests. -Unfortunately, this is a problem, because even in winter, if it is a coniferous forest, it is very difficult to recognize and hit the enemy,- explained the Ukrainian drone commander. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in Vovchansk, the occupiers are resorting to single infiltration tactics , and fights in the city take place just inside high-rise buildings a>.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/15/vovchansk-pid-vognevym-kontrolem-okupanty-hovayutsya-v-lisah/	2024-09-15T08:58:16-07:00

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said this in interview with CNN. -Everyone is waiting for the decision of the US and after that they make their decisions. We would love to use this weapon and attack aircraft on military bases. Not civilian infrastructure, but military bases,- emphasized Volodymyr Zelenskyi. The President emphasized that planes from these airfields are used not only for launching missiles, but also for anti-aircraft fire. -These planes drop 4,000 guided aerial bombs every month only in the east of Ukraine. With these guided bombs, they destroyed 80% of our energy infrastructure,- the head of state said.

The key to reducing the number of KAB strikes is the destruction of enemy reconnaissance UAVs	A military man with the call sign -Stig- told about this on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- - officer of the 2nd separate detachment of the Special Purpose Center -OMEGA- of the National Guard of Ukraine. — The enemy makes very extensive use of strike and reconnaissance drones. There are already fewer reconnaissance units, but there are more and more shock units, he said. He noted that combating the enemy's reconnaissance UAVs helps reduce the number of UAV strikes. — In the Vovchan direction, the activity of the use of anti-aircraft missiles has decreased a little over the last week or two, because the Russians lost a lot of long-range reconnaissance UAVs, which corrected the use of tactical aviation, including when using anti-aircraft missiles. In the last two weeks, they have not used the KABs much. And for the last week, reconnaissance UAVs do not even fly into the deep rear during the day, - said the military man. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that the number of downed enemy reconnaissance drones in Kharkiv Oblast has exceeded a hundred, however polotiv-rozviduvalnyh-droniv/->occupiers are trying to increase aerial reconnaissance in the Vovchansk region.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/15/zaporuka-zmenshennya-kilkosti-udariv-kabamy-znyshhennya-vorozhyh-rozviduvalnyh-bpla/	2024-09-15T08:21:45-07:00

Pointed Russian missiles at Kharkiv: the enemy informant was sentenced	The sentence became known from the sentence of the court register, the identity of the convicted installed Kharkiv Anti-Corruption Center (KHAC). According to the HAC, it is about Yuriy Panfilov, who was accused of disseminating information about the deployment of the Armed Forces and justifying Russian aggression. The court recognized the man as an informant of the Russian special services, who adjusted Russian airstrikes against the critical infrastructure of Kharkiv. Among the main targets of the enemy were strategically important enterprises, in particular the defense-industrial complex. For greater effectiveness of missile and drone attacks, the Russians expected to receive from Panfilov the geolocation of Ukrainian air defense. In case of receiving such information, the invaders hoped to -bypass- the air defense systems of the Armed Forces of Ukraine or carry out a targeted attack on them. To collect intelligence, the convict found the places of -arrivals-, and then took hidden photos and videos there. The man forwarded all the information he received to several chat rooms of pro-Kremlin Telegram channels controlled by the special services of the aggressor country. Also, in September 2023, he videotaped the consequences of the Russian shelling of the state-owned enterprise Kharkiv Armored Plant. The convict began transmitting data to the enemy in the fall of 2023. Before that, Panfilov distinguished himself by publishing posts and comments on Facebook in which he tried to discredit Ukrainian defenders and admired the aggressor state. In addition, he denied that residential buildings in Kharkiv were being shelled by the aggressor state, and he called the tragedy in Buch, which was staged by the Russian military, a theater and a fake. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that law enforcement officers reported the suspicion to the Russian general, who ordered the capture of -Kharkiv in 5 days-.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/15/navodyv-rosijski-rakety-na-harkiv-vorozhyj-informator-otrymav-vyrok/	2024-09-15T07:33:10-07:00

What is escalation when we are fighting a fully conventional, all-out war? Absolutely all types of weapons that exist in the world have already been used. Well, how else can the situation be escalated?- said the head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Kyrylo Budanov rejected the seriousness of the suggestion that the president of the Russian Federation would provide much more aid to countries and groups in the Middle East with the aim of escalating the war there. -How can he help when he himself asks for help from others? How will it help globally? Yes, you can send a special forces unit, no problem. You can transfer, for example, 50 MANPADS. But what next? Everything is fighting here, the entire Russian army, everything that is produced goes directly from the assembly line to the front. Everything they buy - by the way, no one gives them anything for free - everything goes to the front. How will they help?-, the head of the GUR of the Ministry of Defense argued his position. -Globally, they cannot do anything as long as the war in Ukraine continues,- Kyrylo Budanov concluded. As reported by ArmyInform, from the summer of 2025 in Russia serious problems will begin in the economy and there will be a need for mobilization, which can undermine the socio-political situation in the aggressor country.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/15/nachalnyk-gur-mou-vvazhaye-mifamy-zayavy-rosiyi-pro-novu-eskalacziyu/	2024-09-15T06:52:07-07:00

These conclusions with reference to secret Russian data in the framework of the discussion panel during the 20th meeting of the Yalta European Strategy (YES) shared Head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, Lieutenant General Kyrylo Budanov. The head of the GUR of the Ministry of Defense pointed to the fact that Russia predicts that -all their problems will begin in the summer of the 25th year-, as both the financial and economic factor and the socio-political factor will combine. According to him, the Russian Federation is currently struggling with the deterioration of the economic situation, because it understands that the recession, which is already noticeable and painful, continues. According to the head of the Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense, the issue of shortage of personnel in the army is becoming more and more acute in Russia. -During this period (in the summer of next year 2025, - ed.) they will face a dilemma: either to announce mobilization, or somehow it is necessary to reduce the intensity of hostilities a little bit, which may ultimately be critical for them,- the Ukrainian leader said military intelligence. Kyrylo Budanov believes that -war fatigue exists in Russia, no matter what anyone says, because the war has already affected a large section of the Russian population.- He said that the Russians are frankly happy that the aggressor has already managed to capture more than 30% of the territory of our country, and they are also satisfied with the high salary in the Russian army. However, the number of volunteers is decreasing, which has prompted an increase in one-time payments upon signing a contract to 2 million rubles (equivalent to $21,993). The head of the GUR of the Ministry of Defense added that the socio-psychological state of the population of the aggressor country was also affected by Ukraine's efforts to transfer hostilities to the territory of Russia, deep into it.

This is what the officer told on the air of the Espresso TV channel. -Now the Russians don't have much choice regarding logistics to the occupied Crimea. Ferries are not operating. When they will work is not clear. One ferry is at anchor, and the other is waiting for repairs. Therefore, they do not have much choice. There is currently no verified information that the Russians have launched a railway through the temporarily occupied territories to Crimea. That is why the logistical load on the Crimean bridge will increase. This is a process that cannot be avoided,- said Dmytro Pletenchuk. According to the spokesman of the Navy, the Crimean bridge needs repair, and due to the increase in logistical load, it will begin to collapse even more. -the Russians will be forced to increase transportation through the Crimean bridge.

This is from the head of the Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defensesaid during a panel discussion within the XX meeting of the Yalta European Strategy (YES). -As the head of intelligence, I can directly say: the fact that they deliver ballistic missiles there is unpleasant for us, but it is not the volumes, but in terms of ammunition, it is critical for us,- the head of military intelligence emphasized. -Unfortunately, I can say that we cannot do anything about it yet. This is such an unfortunate truth,- stated the head of the GUR MOU. According to Kirill Budanov, the stockpile of weapons inherited from the Russian Federation from Soviet times is running out. And the current volume of manufactured aircraft and armored vehicles cannot have any decisive importance on the battlefield. Another issue is the production of weapons of mass destruction, in which the occupiers have advanced, added the head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications. For example, as Kyrylo Budanov emphasized, the Russian Federation has made significant progress in the production of Iskander missiles, and the production of guided aerial bombs, which are a huge problem for Ukraine, has also increased. -I will not scare anyone, several times, let's say so,- summed up the head of the GUR MOU.

However, -you have to look at things realistically-, so the head of military intelligence would focus on long-range strikes against the enemy. -Ukraine was a little weaker, that must also be recognized. And it's the fact that it's been almost three years of full-scale, and ten years of our war in general, and we're still holding on,- he said. The head of the GUR MOU noted that at the beginning of the Russian Federation's large-scale aggression against Ukraine, -we were definitely dealing with one of the most powerful armies in the world,- and the Russians failed to break us. -This is despite the fact that Russia has a large stockpile of weapons and equipment accumulated during independence, inherited from the times of the USSR and received from other states, such as the DPRK. Our ability to transfer hostilities to the territory of Russia — here I would place more emphasis on the ability to strike deep into the territory of the Russian Federation. This is the first. And on the very philosophy of it. It changed the outlook a little,- said the head of the GUR MOU. Kyrylo Budanov drew attention to the fact that the myth of their invincibility and security was destroyed for the population of the aggressor country after the strikes of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on objects deep in Russia. This greatly affected their social and psychological condition. He noted that previously Russians were convinced that their country was one of the strongest in the world, but this myth was destroyed with the first explosions in Moscow. As the head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications noted, -he undermined the entire foundation.- Kyrylo Budanov believes that this is the main achievement of these long-range strikes - breaking the faith of the people that they live in safety. When asked by the moderator of the discussion whether more such strikes are needed, the head of military intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine answered that -while the war is going on, everything must be done to the maximum. And when you can do more, you have to do more.- As reported by ArmiyaInform, on September 11, 2024, Nobody, Chimera, Aratta, Raven Group units and the 2nd special operations unit named after Vladyslav Peleshenko of the GUR of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine with the support of -Group 13- and the 10th mobile border unit -Dozor- of the State Border Service of Ukraine They carried out raid near the coast of Crimea.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/15/pislya-udariv-zsu-po-obyektah-vglyb-rosiyi-dlya-naselennya-krayiny-agresorky-zrujnuvavsya-mif-pro-yihnyu-neperemozhnist-i-bezpeku-kyrylo-budanov/	2024-09-15T02:50:43-07:00

The US Army intends to conduct another test of hypersonic weapons by the end of 2024	According to information profile resource Defense News, the head of the procurement department of the US Army, Doug Bush, made a corresponding statement. ArmyInform reports. Common Hypersonic Glide Body (C-HGB, -Common Hypersonic Glide Body-), which is a universal projectile developed jointly with the US Navy, was successfully tested at the beginning of 2024. The Navy envisions using the munition to be launched from ship-based launchers, while the US Army plans to integrate the munition for a land-based launch station. Defense News reports that the US Army has long worked with Leidos' Dynetics with the goal of creating an industrial base for the Common Hypersonic Glide Body, which will enter the armament of both the ground forces and the Navy. Previously, American private business had never been involved in the development of hypersonic weapons. -Following the Navy tests, we need to make sure that we have a full end-to-end test as close as possible to an operational test that will be successful,- Bush told reporters at a Pentagon briefing. The official also added that it is necessary to have confidence that weapons can be safely transferred to a unit that -may have to go to war.- The Army has yet to conduct fully successful trials. But, as Bush said, the military hopes that such a test will take place this year. If the tests are successful, the service will be able to transfer the hypersonic unit to the first unit as an initial operational capability as early as next year. Hypersonic missiles are capable of reaching a speed of Mach 5 (about 6,000 km per hour). The glider unit can maneuver at altitude, which makes detection by anti-missile systems difficult. According to the Pentagon, the battery of the ground complex consists of a command and staff vehicle and four heavy transporters with two containers on each with hypersonic missiles. The project range of the missile is 2775 km. The first US Army unit to receive hypersonic weapons (with the exception of universal munitions) was the 5th Battalion, 3rd Regiment, 17th Field Artillery Brigade at Joint Base Lewis-McChord (Washington State). The unit is part of the 1st multidisciplinary task force. The delivery took place two days before the scheduled commissioning date at the end of the 2021 fiscal year. The C-HGB consists of a warhead, a guidance system, cables and a protective heat shield. In August, Lt. Gen. Robert Rush, director of the Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office, said the Army was -really close- to deploying hypersonic weapons. But he cautioned that more tests would need to be conducted before any decision could be made about the future of the ground-based hypersonic missile. In May 2024, the US Navy conducted flight tests of an industrially produced missile in Hawaii. The tests were highly anticipated after a series of failed or aborted Common Hypersonic Glide Body tests. In 2023, the army and navy had to interrupt flight tests three times due to problems with the preparation of the missile for launch. As General Rush pointed out, it usually takes about ten years to develop missiles, but the hypersonic weapons program took only five years. According to him, it is necessary to make sure that -everything works-. If a decision is made to introduce a new weapon, there are strong strategic reasons for this.

In the Vovchansk direction, the enemy is increasing the number of reconnaissance drone flights	About this in broadcasts of the national telethon -Edyni Novyni- on September 15, the official representative of OTU -Kharkiv- Colonel Vitaly told Sarantsev. -This intensification of the use of enemy UAVs can be attributed to two factors. The first is to identify the location of positions of the Ukrainian Defense Forces for further strikes and intensification of further offensive actions. And the second is to work out routes for the movement of our own forces,- said Colonel Sarantsev. At the same time, according to the spokesman of the Kharkiv OTU, it is in the Vovchansk direction that there has been an increase in the number of desertion cases in the ranks of the occupying forces from the side of the soldiers of the invaders' army. -We have received information that such cases have become more frequent. Russian soldiers refuse to obey the combat orders of their commanders. Thanks to the successful actions of the Ukrainian military, which disrupted the logistics of the Russians, some of their units remain without the most necessary supplies: food, water, and ammunition,- Vitaly Sarantsev emphasized. At the same time, he emphasized the fact that in the Vovchan direction, the rotational actions carried out by the enemy do not always lead to the strengthening of the Russian army.

Under the condition of attracting investments, the potential of defense production of Ukraine can re...	About this he said during a panel discussion at the Yalta European Strategy forum. Rustem Umyerov noted that Ukraine is able to significantly increase the production of military equipment and weapons, but for this, the support of foreign investors is needed. According to the Minister of Defense of Ukraine, the key needs of Ukraine remain timely financial and military assistance. -Last year we planned our production capabilities and determined how much we could jointly produce in the private and public sectors. Then our potential was 7 billion dollars. In 2025, we can triple this indicator,- said Rustem Umyerov. According to IOU estimates, under the conditions of additional financing, the potential of defense production can reach 20 billion dollars. -We are ready to open joint ventures with you. We can introduce you and connect you with any of our leaders to work together. This will give us the opportunity to increase our capabilities as well,- the Minister of Defense emphasized. He also emphasized that the capabilities of Ukraine's defense industry significantly exceed the amount of investments that the country can provide on its own. -Ukraine has already gained recognition in the world thanks to its courage. However, we have also excelled at being creative in difficult circumstances. The Ministry of Defense is ready to open joint ventures with partners. This will allow us to significantly increase our production capacity,- added Rustem Umyerov. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Rustem Umyerov took part in the European Defense Roundtable organized by the Munich Security Conference, and discussed with representatives of allied countries ways to counter the Russian threat.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/15/za-umovy-zaluchennya-investyczij-potenczial-oboronnogo-vyrobnycztva-ukrayiny-mozhe-dosyagty-20-mlrd-ministr-oborony/	2024-09-14T21:11:11-07:00

-Double blow-: on the army and the economy. Expert on the consequences of damage to enemy refineries	What is the effect of these attacks, how will it affect Russia's economy and its ability to continue to maintain the Russian Army's combat capability to wage a war of aggression against Ukraine? Military expert Petro Chernyk told ArmyInform about this: -We will divide this issue (strikes on the oil industry of the Russian Federation - ed.) into two parts. The first is the political and ideological part, and the second is purely technical and economic. In the political part, the myth that it is impossible to strike on the territory of Russia is finally dispelled. That is, a nuclear state cannot be struck, because it is not known what will happen. There is already the experience of the successful Kursk operation, and we have been hitting their oil industry for a good year and no nuclear apocalypse has happened. So, it turns out that it is possible to inflict fire damage on a nuclear state. To be fair, this is not the only case in history, as there are some experts who say it never happened. But, as it turns out, a similar situation has already happened, in 1982 non-nuclear Argentina attacked nuclear Britain, and Britain did not respond with nuclear weapons. By the way, the same Soviet Union survived an attack from the Chinese on Damansky Island in 1969, and no disaster happened either. That is, this ideological factor that it is possible to carry out complex strikes on their territory not only for military purposes, but especially for oil purposes, is very important.- We understand that as long as Russia sells oil abroad, as long as it lives as a country. That is, 40% of their budget is formed exclusively thanks to revenues from the oil and gas sector. The more strikes there, the less they will sell oil to foreign markets and receive hard currency. In this context, it is important to note that the Iskander-M missile has 27 foreign-made parts in its configuration. The Kh-47 -Kinzhal- missile has 130 foreign-made parts. And their most massive reconnaissance drone -Orlan-10- is half-equipped with foreign-made parts. That is, the less currency the Russians have, the less they will be able to purchase the necessary parts from which weapons will be made. Plus, fuel itself, as such, is one of the key aspects in today's war between the Russian Federation and Ukraine. After all, this is a war of military equipment, primarily heavy. Let me remind you that a T-90 tank consumes up to one ton of fuel and up to 100 kilograms of lubricant per day. If the enemy has around three thousand tanks along the demarcation line, then the Russians need three thousand fuel, in particular diesel, per day. Plus, the most elementary thing that worries us at the moment is enemy aviation. The same Su-34, Su-25, Su-24, Su-30 and so on. And plus enemy helicopters can also refuel with aviation kerosene. That is, to provide all this equipment, the occupiers need a lot of fuel resources. The most powerful blow that the Defense Forces of Ukraine inflicted was when an oil depot in the Rostov region of the Russian Federation burned for more than 9 days. There, first of all, tanks with aviation kerosene burned out. Of course, it is still a little early to say that the Ukrainian strikes will really affect their entire oil-refining sector of the Russian economy. After all, they have 30 large factories and 50 small ones, which is a lot. And in the area of ​​oil refining, Russians are definitely among the top three countries in the world. But the fact that this process (destruction or damage to enterprises of the oil and gas industry of the Russian Federation - ed.) is increasing and that each time they have fewer and fewer resources, for example, for oil processing, this is extremely important today. I will give an interesting example. If today there is a question of buying microelectronics, it can, of course, be bought on world markets in such a way that no one will understand who is buying it. Because it can be implemented, relatively speaking, through 5-10 procurement chains. Let's take a company from Iran. It ordered the necessary microelectronics from somewhere, say, Mexico, and the documents show that it is for household appliances. Then it (microelectronics - ed.) was taken and bought from the Americans and it got back to Iran. Who will control them? This is impossible to do. However, if a company in Paraguay were to come to Denmark, France, Germany and say -sell us the oil equipment- that has now burned down in Russia, it will become obvious to everyone who is the ultimate beneficiary and who is the ultimate buyer. Therefore, Russians will no longer be able to buy the necessary equipment on these global markets. And they cannot produce them themselves, especially atmospheric-vacuum pipes, where the distillation of oil and corresponding oil products takes place. Therefore, this (hitting Russian oil and gas industry enterprises - ed.) is simply a fantastic, wonderful, asymmetric response to our enemy. It (the answer - ed.) should grow and it will eventually give results. My favorite historical parallel. Hitler's Germany really fell when the Americans and the British destroyed 12 German plants for the production of synthetic gasoline. That's when things got bad for the Germans. Sooner or later, things will get bad for the Russians too.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/15/podvijnyj-udar-po-armiyi-ta-ekonomiczi-ekspert-pro-naslidky-urazhennya-vorozhyh-npz/	2024-09-14T20:30:27-07:00
Church Laundry Lies: Enemy Propaganda Does Not Fear God	Recently, fake information began to spread in social networks and on various pro-Kremlin Telegram channels that a laundry was allegedly opened in Lutsk in a church selected by the MP. As -evidence-, a photo of the church is attached, at the entrance of which the inscription -Clean - and Laundry- can be seen. StopFake investigators discovered that this is a photo of the bell tower of the Greek-Catholic Church of the Sending of the Holy Spirit in the city of Terebovlia, in the Ternopil region. A social laundry was opened there last year. According to notification of the Terebovlia City Council, the Greek Catholic parish was the winner of the mini-grant within the framework of the project -Development of social services for community cohesion to support IDPs and vulnerable groups at the parish level-. Parishioners monitored the situation in the community, drew up a map of needs and identified vulnerable categories of the population. They came to the conclusion that there is a need for a social laundry in Terebovla. After all, there are many seriously ill people in the community who need such a service and cannot take their clothes to Ternopil or Chortkiv. That is why they decided to implement such a social initiative. But the Russian agitprop decided to use this initiative to create another fake about the alleged -oppression- of the Moscow Patriarchate of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church and the -religious apocalypse- in Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/15/brehnya-pro-pralnyu-u-czerkvi-vorozha-propaganda-ne-boyitsya-boga/	2024-09-14T20:11:20-07:00
What is known about one of the first F-16 pilots: the story of the fallen officer Oleksiy Mesia	&#8230; The year is 2022. ZSU pilots Oleksiy Mes and Andriy Pilshchikov meet with American government officials to convince them: the Ukrainian army needs fighter jets. To strengthen the position of the pilots, they were then joined by Hollywood actor Sean Penn. &#8230; 2024 year. Already on board the F-16 in the sky of Ukraine, Oleksiy Mes repels a massive Russian combined air and missile strike. He destroyed three cruise missiles and one attack UAV — saving Ukrainians from enemy weapons. But, unfortunately, at the cost of his own life. What kind of officer was Mes and how he helped our state to become stronger and more effective in beating the enemy - in the ArmyInform material. Born on October 20, 1993 in Shepetivka, Khmelnytskyi. There he studied at a local school, which he graduated with a gold medal. Subsequently, he studied at the Kharkiv National University of the Air Force named after Ivan Kozhedub. Graduated from university in 2016. It is interesting that Mes and Andriy Pilshchikov with the call sign -Jus- were peers and studied together at KhNUPS. And died with a difference of 1 year and 1 day. -This is our issue, of which the whole of Ukraine and the Air Force are proud. I was lucky to be the instructor who gave him a ticket to the sky on the MiG-29 aircraft,- said Brigadier General Serhiy Golubtsov, Chief of Aviation of the Air Force Command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, at Oleksiy's farewell. Back in 2014, Mes went to Norway - at that time he was studying in the fourth year of KhNUPS. Told partners about participation in the OOS, exchanged experience, etc. And then there is the military service under the contract. He was enrolled in the personnel of the military unit in the position of squadron support commander - deputy commander of the operational group. In September 2022, the pilot was awarded the medal -For military service to Ukraine- - for personal courage and selfless actions shown in the defense of the state sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, loyalty to the military oath. The nickname -Moonfish- (-Fish-moon-) Mes got because of one of the curious cases, about which the man chose not to tell. As of June 2022, Mes was the commander of a squadron of Ukrainian MiG-29 fighters. At the age of 29, he had the rank of lieutenant colonel. Mes lobbied for the transfer of F-16 fighters to Ukraine. Pilots traveled to the United States, talked with the media and officials. He was fluent in English and could equally argue the need to protect the sky. -Moonfish- became the real face of Ukraine's F-16 lobbying campaign. Yes, back in June 2022, Ukrainian pilots flew to Washington to meet with members of the US Congress. There they spoke with Senator Mark Kelly, a former pilot and astronaut. After all, Moonfish was one of the first eight Ukrainian pilots to learn to fly the F-16 in Denmark in the fall of 2023. In September 2023, the Armed Forces wrote that an officer with the call sign -Moonfish- was undergoing F-16 training in Great Britain. He is one of those pilots called media. And after Juice and Moonfish met in Washington with Republican Congressman Adam Kinzinger, he introduced the Ukraine Fighter Pilots Act to the US House of Representatives. Moonfish was also one of the first Ukrainian pilots who went to the United States to learn how to fly the F-16. In September 2023, his training moved from the simulator cockpit to a real F-16 aircraft. At one time, Mes told about the training of Ukrainians on Western fighter jets on the air of a national telethon: -I would compare our planes that we have in our arsenal with the F-16 - it's like switching from a push-button phone to a 16th iPhone.- On August 26, 2024, the Russians launched another massive air-missile strike. Pilot Mesy on board the F-16 managed to destroy three cruise missiles and one attack UAV. -Aleksii saved Ukrainians from deadly Russian missiles. Unfortunately, at the cost of his own life. Oleksiy Mes was a strong and devoted soldier, a high-class pilot, a leader on earth and in the sky, a good friend, a loving son, father, husband, patriot of his country,- said the message of the Air Force Command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The soldier was buried on August 29. During the farewell ceremony, a pair of MiG-29 fighter jets paid tribute to the fallen pilot - Mesia's native MiGs, on which he began his pilot career. The pilot is survived by his wife Yulia, daughter, mother, father, sister. -His name was Oleksiy Mes, and he was the best pilot in Ukraine. He managed the entire F-16 project, he actually replaced the functional air attaché, he was a very funny guy and he loved his daughter very much. He was an excellent student who wanted to be a nuclear physicist and defended a research paper at the National Academy of Sciences about some incredible technology in dentistry,- recalls the officer, public activist Melania Podolyak. By order of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, lieutenant colonel Oleksiy Mesy was posthumously awarded the military rank of colonel. The reasons for the crash of the F-16 plane piloted by Oleksiy Mes are currently being investigated.

Hopelessness forces the occupiers to surrender: in Kharkiv Oblast, the number of captured Russians h...	Colonel Vitaly Sarantsev, the spokesman of Kharkiv OTU, told about this on the air of the national telethon -Yedini Novyni- . — The number is growing little by little. We report this in our daily summaries. This indicates that the enemy's personnel understands the complete hopelessness of their position and it has begun to dawn on them that in order to save their lives, they still need to raise their hands and surrender to the Ukrainian military, he said. The military emphasized that Ukraine strictly adheres to all norms of international law regarding the treatment of prisoners of war and called on Russian soldiers to surrender. — Unlike the Russians, we respect international humanitarian law. We treat prisoners normally and nothing terrible awaits them in captivity. Therefore, of course, we tolerate the enemy's decision to surrender and call on those who have not yet made a final decision to take an example from their comrades, the spokesman said. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that fighters of the 13th Special Forces Brigade -Charter- of the National Guard of Ukraine once again captured Russian servicemen in the Kharkiv direction.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/14/bezvyhid-zmushuye-okupantiv-zdavatysya-na-harkivshhyni-pobilshalo-polonenyh-rosiyan/	2024-09-14T12:03:52-07:00
Russians are fighting with people at public transport stops in the South	spokeon the air of the national telethon -Yedini Novyny- about the terror against civilians, which the invaders staged in the South of Ukraine. a> spokesman of the -Tavria- OUV, Captain Dmytro Lykhovii. — the Russians are already overstepping their bounds when they just plainly go to war with the civilian population just because they can. Over the course of yesterday, in addition to Kherson, they shelled 9 more settlements in the Kherson region. As a result, one civilian was killed, and 7 more civilians were injured, he said. Three more civilians were killed today as a result of an attack on an agricultural enterprise in Gulyajpilsk community in Zaporizhzhia. Also, civilian houses, private buildings, high-rise buildings, a school, a hospital canteen, a bus, and civilian cars were damaged as a result of enemy shelling. — In fact, they are fighting with public transport stops when a drop drone or an FPV drone or an impact drone flies there. Since he can't go back, and they don't see military goals there, they just attack civilians, in violation of all the Geneva Conventions, the spokesman said. The response to the terror of the Russian occupiers against civilians should be strengthening the means of radio-electronic warfare, strengthening anti-aircraft defense, and strengthening countermeasures against Russian UAVs. Also, the line of combat should be pushed as far away from Kherson as possible, so that the Russians have as few opportunities as possible to shell the regional center. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in Kherson two people were injured as a result of the Russian shelling.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/14/iz-lyudmy-na-zupynkah-gromadskogo-transportu-voyuyut-rosiyany-na-pivdni/	2024-09-14T11:49:56-07:00
In the north of Kharkiv Oblast, the enemy was terrorized by FPV drones	Colonel Vitaly Sarantsev, the spokesman of Kharkiv OTU, told about this on the air of the national telethon -Yedini Novyni- . — The extreme activity of our FPV drones prevents the enemy from making any movements, providing logistical support to units. The enemy there in the forward positions does not receive provisions or water, does not replenish ammunition stocks, he said. As a result, desertion and refusal to obey orders are becoming more common among enemy personnel, because it is extremely difficult for the occupiers to carry out any tasks due to the effective actions of Ukrainian drones. At the same time, the spokesman noted that the Ukrainian defenders do not have a complete advantage over the enemy in the use of drones - it is more about parity. — Both sides quite actively use this type of ammunition. We have 30 to 40 strikes per day, which are done precisely with the help of FPV drones. Therefore, it is difficult to say about any advantage in the air, it would be more correct to note that this is a certain parity in this armament, said Vitaly Sarantsev. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that ->in the north of Kharkiv Oblast, Ukrainian drones put the invaders on starvation rations, resulting in extremely high losses Russian soldiers increasingly resort to desertion.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/14/na-pivnochi-harkivshhyny-voroga-zakoshmaryly-fpv-dronamy/	2024-09-14T11:32:53-07:00
Summonses are being prepared to be served automatically: what is known	the head of the Department of Information Technologies of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine Oleg Berestovy told about this in DOU Podcast. -How are subpoenas being issued now? They are written out by hand, printed, and then the stack of paper comes to the head of the TCC, who must sign them, put a seal, and then the summonses are distributed. This is an inefficient process. That is why we have now created a function so that the summons can be generated in the -Oberig- registry, signed with the electronic signature of the head of the TCC, and not even printed directly in the TCC. It will go immediately to centralized printing, from there to Ukrposhta, it will deliver it, and we will have information on where the summons is located: whether it was delivered or not, whether it was lost somewhere, how long it took for delivery, etc.,- explains Oleg Berestovy . According to him, the process will be transparent and -it will allow the military-political leadership to have more relevant information than is available now.- -In order to understand the -funnel-, at which stage we are and what needs to be decided in order to expand the -funnel- in the end,- emphasizes Oleg Berestovy. And he adds: -Accordingly, when you sign this summons with an electronic signature, there won't be any signature signature; and you should be sure that you were not sent some kind of phishing or something, and that your TCC did indeed sign this subpoena. Therefore, Rezerv+ will have a function: how to use a QR scanner to check whether the head of the TCC really signed this summons, whether it is legal, valid, legal and no one else signed it on the way to the bus stop. This is a function that will allow to protect a person as a conscript.- Also, Oleg Berestovy emphasized once again that there will be no summons to Reserve+. -We are not planning this. We have a backlog until the middle of spring - there are no subpoenas. But we are planning to develop functionality to at least slightly automate and civilize the delivery of summons with the help of Ukrposhta and certain automated processes on the backend,- summarized the head of the IT Department of the Ministry of Education and Culture. As ArmiyaInform wrote, users of the Rezerv+ application will be able to check the authenticity of the written summons received from the TCC and SP.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/14/povistky-gotuyutsya-vruchaty-avtomatychno-shho-vidomo/	2024-09-14T11:15:56-07:00

Our calculations, thanks to impeccable coordination and high skills, skillfully use advanced technologies - as a result, -Baba-Yaga- strikes enemy positions with maximum accuracy, even in conditions of limited visibility,- the detachment commented on the video. As reported by ArmyInform, -Baba Yaga- buried the Russians in their hideout in the Pokrovsky direction .	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/14/strashnyj-son-okupantiv-yak-praczyuye-rozrahunok-bombera-baba-yaga/	2024-09-14T10:50:33-07:00
The stigma of the captive: why Russians choose suicide over captivity	The reasons for the reckless behavior of the occupiers on the battlefield on the air of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon explained by the commander of the BPAC shock battalion - Achilles- of the 92nd separate assault brigade named after the basket chieftain Ivan Sirk, captain Yury Fedorenko. According to him, Russians surrender only when they have no other choice and they cannot even commit suicide - shoot themselves or blow themselves up with a grenade. One of the main reasons for this behavior of the occupiers is intimidation by Russian propaganda, which tells about the fictitious abuses that Russians allegedly suffer in Ukrainian captivity. - This shows that the Russian occupier has very, very much, and, I will emphasize once again for the third time - very much! — the propaganda machine is working powerfully. They either do not see or do not want to see how, for example, exchanges of prisoners of war take place. What Ukraine gives - with such well-fed faces, polished teeth and in the body, so-called. That is, they deal with people. And who are given to us — tortured, murdered, emaciated, where the occupier deliberately works to deprive them of their health and, as a result, after release from captivity, so that a person loses his life as well, - said the military man. As a result, Russians are simply afraid to surrender. Having believed the false propaganda, they believe that the Ukrainians will mock and abuse them. — Accordingly, the propaganda machine in the Russian Federation works in such a way that the occupier is objectively afraid to surrender, because he thinks that we do not follow international rules and norms, in particular the convention. That we will face. This is not true, - Yuriy Fedorenko emphasized. The second reason for the reluctance of Russian soldiers to surrender is even more interesting. It consists in the fear of returning to Russia for exchanges and being condemned and abused already there. -It is scary enough for the enemy to surrender, because he understands that even after the exchange, he will be abused already on the territory of the Russian Federation,- explained the commander of the Ukrainian drones. This is what forces the occupiers to choose suicide between captivity and suicide. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in the Kharkiv direction, the Russian command involves military personnel in the conduct of hostilities.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/14/tavro-polonenogo-chomu-rosiyany-obyrayut-samogubstvo-zamist-polonu/	2024-09-14T10:43:02-07:00
In the Zaporozhye direction, the enemy lacks forces for assault operations	The reasons for the decrease in the offensive activity of the enemy in the Zaporizhzhia direction on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyni- explained the spokesperson of the OUV - Tavria- captain Dmytro Lykhovii. - The number of combat clashes and assaults on the part of Muscovites can be counted on the fingers of one hand. For example, today until 4 p.m. they were not there at all. Yesterday, there were also none for the whole day, and in the three previous days there were only four of them, he said. The reason for the relative calm, compared to a number of other directions, is a significant lack of resources and reserves for the occupiers to storm in several directions at the same time. — Of course, Pokrovsky and Kurakhiv directions in the Donetsk region are now a priority for them. In addition, they have a huge area of ​​responsibility and, for many reasons, they need to transfer units to the Kursk direction, where they strengthen their forces in order to somehow respond to the offensive of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the spokesman said. In view of this, the occupiers were forced to transfer their forces from the Zaporozhye direction to other, more important for them directions of hostilities. — From the Zaporizhzhia region a few weeks ago - you can say she acted as a donor - they partially took units at the level of battalions, regiments, and brigades. That is why they are undergoing a certain reorganization, such an operational pause, Dmytro Lykhova said. At the same time, this does not mean that hostilities in Zaporozhye have completely stopped. The calm there can only be considered relative against the background of other directions. — The enemy is actively using all types of damage — artillery, missile weapons, attack drones, anti-aircraft missiles. Yesterday, 10 guided aerial bombs and 50 unguided aerial missiles flew in the direction of Orihiv. Today, the enemy has already carried out 2 airstrikes in the direction of Orihiv, closer to Zaporizhzhia, and, unfortunately, the civilian population and civilian infrastructure are suffering. Three civilians were killed today as a result of an attack on an agricultural enterprise in the Gulyajpil community, said the spokesman of the -Tavria- OUV. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that ->in the South, the occupiers rush to the Dnipro - attack with a whole zoo of brigades and regiments.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/14/na-zaporizkomu-napryamku-vorogu-brakuye-syl-dlya-shturmovyh-dij/	2024-09-14T10:33:24-07:00
One step before assaults: how conscripts are used in the Russian army in the Kharkiv direction	Exactly how the Russian command uses them on the air of the national telethon -Yedini Novyni- explained the spokesman of the OTU -Kharkiv- Colonel Vitaly Sarantsev. — The adversary began to use conscripts, this is indeed confirmed by intelligence data and other sources. But this does not mean that there are massive use of military personnel and that they throw them on assaults. These are conscripts who perform logistics tasks, serve as drivers or perform some other task, he said. Currently, there are no conscript soldiers of the Russian army directly on the contact line in the assault units in the combat zone. -But they are located in territories that border on non-attacked areas, they perform territory control tasks, communication tasks and many other tasks that are not directly related to the conduct of hostilities,- explained the spokesman. At the same time, he noted that the personnel of enemy units involved in hostilities in the north of Kharkiv Region have an extremely low level of training and motivation. In particular, we are talking about servicemen of the Russian Federation, who replenished the losses in the Vovchansk region. — They don't have enough experience, they don't even know how to orient themselves in a certain way in the local area. This indicates that the adversary is already trying to squeeze everything he has into this direction that is important to him. He tries everything to plug his holes both in defense and in those units that engage in active offensive actions, Vitaliy Sarantsev emphasized. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in the Kharkiv direction, the Russian occupation forces began to recruit conscript soldiers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/14/za-krok-do-shturmiv-yak-vykorystovuyut-strokovykiv-v-armiyi-rf-na-harkivskomu-napryamku/	2024-09-14T10:18:06-07:00
Digital recruiting will be launched in Ukraine: the first details from the Ministry of Defense	the head of the Department of Information Technologies of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine Oleg Berestovy told about this in DOU Podcast. -Now, for example, it is possible to sign contracts directly with military units. For this function, we are currently doing digital recruiting in Reserve+. We want to gamify this story a little - there will be swipes, a match with brigades (smiles - ed). But first there are more urgent tasks - and then we will gamify,- said Oleg Berestovy. The pre-release stage of digital recruiting, according to the head of the IT Department of the MoU, should be -from week to week.- As ArmyInform wrote, as of the beginning of September 2024 -profesiyi/->there are about 4,000 vacancies in the Defense Forces of Ukraine. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/14/v-ukrayini-zapustyat-czyfrovyj-rekrutyng-pershi-detali-vid-minoborony/	2024-09-14T10:03:08-07:00
Mass withdrawal of Russian missile carriers in the Black Sea: the Navy explained what this threatens	The spokesperson of the Navy of Ukraine stated this in -Suspilne.Novyny- air captain 3rd rank Dmytro Pletenchuk. -Probably, if the eighth missile carrier was not currently undergoing repairs in Novorossiysk, they would have taken it out to sea as well. But I can't say that this somehow affects the security level now,- he said. However, according to him, these are missile carriers, so the threat of their use remains. It should be taken into account. -But it was also preserved when they were directly at the Novorossiy base. Because it is a matter of a few hours to go to an external raid and shoot. This does not affect the overall distribution of forces and the situation. At least I haven't seen such reasons yet,- assured Dmytro Pletenchuk. The spokesman of the Navy noted that later we will find out the real reasons why the leadership of the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation made such a decision. He explained that Russia usually uses Kalibr from the Black Sea in order to maximally load Ukrainian air defense units. -The technical characteristics of these missiles actually no longer allow them to be used as a separate weapon. That is, the Ukrainian air defense has learned to fight them skillfully. The last shot down of the use of such missiles was 100%. There were more than 20 of them,- the Navy spokesman recalled. As reported by ArmyInform, on September 14, the occupiers took an unusually large number of ships into the Black Sea, including Caliber carriers. In the Black Sea there are 16 enemy ships, 7 of which are carriers of Kalibr cruise missiles with a total salvo of up to 48 missiles. There are 5 enemy ships in the Mediterranean Sea, four of which are -caliber- carriers with a total volley of up to 24 missiles.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/14/masove-vyvedennya-rosijskyh-raketonosiyiv-u-chorne-more-u-vms-poyasnyly-chym-cze-zagrozhuye/	2024-09-14T09:53:25-07:00

This is how a variety of Russian security forces from different structures of their occupation army are involved in solving certain tasks on the Left Bank of the Dnieper and on the islands, Dmytro Lykhova said. The spokesman suggested that the aim of the occupiers is to get closer to Kherson in order to further increase the shelling of the city. Earlier, ArmyInform reported on a sharp escalation in difficult terrain near the Dnipro: 60 enemy assaults took place over the past week.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/14/na-pivdni-okupanty-rvutsya-do-dnipra-atakuyut-czilym-zooparkom-brygad-i-polkiv/	2024-09-14T09:42:11-07:00

Polish tanks crush the Russians – PT-91 Twardy successfully repulse -meaty- assaults	This is discussed in the ArmiyaTV story. The PT-91 Twardy battle tank is a licensed version of the Soviet T-72M1, which was produced in Poland. It is noted that, unlike the Soviet prototype, -Twardy- received several modernizations. According to the commander of the vehicle, when the Russians once again resort to meat assaults, it is the -Twardy- that drives them away, equipped with new armor and a modern fire control system. In particular, Polish developers installed new gun stabilizers and a gunner's thermal sight. One of these tanks was given the call sign - -Grandfather-. When asked by a journalist how the PT-91 Twardy differs from the T-72, one of the crew members answers: -The difference is in the engine, it is more boosted and more powerful than the 72's. Well, you can see for yourself by the active armor: this is not -Kontakt-1-, not -Kontakt-2-. This is Polish armor, which they patented here,- says the army man. Our military learned to manage these units in Poland for 40 days. The targets on which our tankers work are mainly enemy infantry. -They arrange enemy assaults, attack with infantry. They crawl like locusts. Therefore, on foot. -Shooting- with a high-explosive fragmentation projectile is a -hooray,- comments a military man. As ArmiyaInform wrote, today Ukraine celebrates the Day of Tank Troops of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.

The Ministry of Defense is preparing to launch automated postponements of mobilization	the head of the Department of Information Technologies of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine Oleg Berestovy told about this in DOU Podcast. -Automated deferrals are a hot topic. I understand that this is necessary, first of all, out of respect for those people who need it. And for release from work, which can not be done in the TCC. For example: people with disabilities. If the state knows about you that you have a certain group of disabilities and you are not suitable for service a priori, then why reconfirm, regularly pass the VLK? It is necessary to regulate both normatively and technically. We are working on it. We know how to do it, and in the coming weeks we will approach it,- said Oleg Berestovy. Also, according to him, automated deferrals will apply to guardians of three or more children. And also — deferrals for people who are studying, getting their first higher education. In addition, Oleg Berestovy called online military registration another important and popular function. As ArmyInform wrote, at the end of August the Verkhovna Rada supported in general draft law No. 11391 on expanding the range of conscripts who have the right to postpone conscription for military service during mobilization.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/14/minoborony-gotuye-zapusk-avtomatyzovanyh-vidstrochok-vid-mobilizacziyi/	2024-09-14T08:22:52-07:00
We are fighting for the security of the entire European continent — Rustem Umyerov	He informs about this14 September in social networks. -We are fighting for the security of the entire European continent, and our needs remain the same. First of all, this is an acceleration and increase in the amount of military aid: equipment, projectiles, long-range ammunition, mines and demining means, EW systems, spare parts,- he said. According to him, a critically important topic is the strengthening of Ukrainian air defense forces to protect critical infrastructure from Russian terrorist attacks. -We need not only more air defense systems, but also a reliable supply of ammunition for them,- Rustem Umyerov emphasized. He recalled that in August, Ukraine used F-16 aircraft for the first time to repel a massive air attack. The Minister of Defense of Ukraine hopes for the expansion of pilot training programs and the timely replenishment of the stocks of guided air missiles. -Also, more and more of our partners share the position of giving Ukraine the opportunity to strike with long-range Western-made weapons at military facilities on the territory of the Russian Federation. I thank the organizers and participants for their constant support of Ukraine on the way to victory,- he summarized. Earlier ArmyInform reported that the Minister of Defense of Ukraine met with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Lithuania.

by Russian air defense systems — across Russia: as a result of the Kursk operation, the enemy is she...	Vadim Mysnyk, the spokesman of OTU -Siversk- drew attention to this on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- . — During the past day, the enemy carried out 82 shellings on the territory of Chernihiv and Sumy regions. And on the territory of the district of the Kursk region, which is controlled by the Defense Forces, there were 127 shellings, including 37 anti-aircraft missiles, he said. This indicates that one of the tasks of the Kursk operation has been achieved - the enemy is forced to strike more intensively on its own territory, instead of shelling Ukrainian settlements. True, the Russian aggressors did not completely abandon the tactics of shelling the Ukrainian border. For this purpose, the enemy mainly uses weapons that can strike from deep within the territory, because units of the Defense Forces of Ukraine do not allow him to approach the border. — As for the Sumy direction, there are certain results of the Kursk operation. The enemy is trying to increase the intensity of shelling, but we also take our measures in response and do not allow him to hit our territory, the spokesman emphasized. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that Defense Forces forced the enemy to practically abandon the use of DRG in Sumshchyna, their zajmayutsya-drg/->detected with the help of UAVs and other technical means of monitoring the area. Therefore, Russian saboteurs on the northern border focused on mining area. Instead, thanks to the Kursk operation, Ukrainian defenders are able to significantly strengthen border protection in Sumshchyna /a>.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/14/rosijskymy-kabamy-po-rosiyi-vnaslidok-kurskoyi-operacziyi-vorog-obstrilyuye-vlasnu-terytoriyu/	2024-09-14T07:52:31-07:00

Suicide on the battlefield: Russians shoot through -akhmat-	How is this related to the frequent suicides of Russian soldiers on the battlefield in the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon broadcast explained the commander of the battalion of shock air defense systems -Achilles- of the 92nd separate assault brigade named after the basket captain Ivan Sirk, captain Yury Fedorenko. The military said that the professionally trained -Akhmatians- do not fight on the front line. Instead, the appearance of -akhmat- units in a certain direction indicates a low level of motivation and discipline among regular Russian occupation troops. - Where -Ahmat- appears - there are problems in the troops, which they have to solve at the expense of a system of coercion, humiliation and destruction of servicemen of the Russian occupation forces, actually carrying out punishment directly on the battlefield, he said. As a result of such a system, it is easier for Russian soldiers to shoot themselves than to retreat without completing the task, because in the near rear they will be abused, tortured or even executed by the -Akhmatians-. — That is why you can often see a video published on social networks, when the occupier, having received an insignificant injury, for example, to the lower limbs, commits suicide by shooting himself in the head. It is easier for him to die on the battlefield than to return without completing the task to the rear. This result is ensured by the -Ahmat- unit, Yuriy Fedorenko explained. He noted that the Russian soldiers had only two options left - either to die on the battlefield or to be executed by the -Akhmatians-. - How long will the Russians tolerate that this very unit can do whatever they want with them, like with dolls - it's their choice, to die in Ukraine or at the hands of the -Akhmatians-, - concluded the drone commander. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in Kharkiv region, the Russians attack with -barracks- according to the Donetsk scenario, but the Defense Forces destroy 90% of the enemy's armored vehicles and 60-70% of the infantry.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/14/samogubstvo-na-poli-boyu-rosiyany-strilyayutsya-cherez-ahmat/	2024-09-14T02:50:42-07:00

-Fin- and his Norwegian Leopard: battles in Zaporizhzhia, tricks of the Russians in the East and the...	During the war, -Fin- worked in the banking sector for the third year, before the large-scale invasion of Russia. After the mobilization, he took part in the Kharkiv operation, fought in Zaporozhye during the counteroffensive last year, and now he is in Donetsk region, together with his comrades, destroying the enemy on Leopard 2A4 tanks. -Fin- was among the first tankers who started working on German tanks that arrived in Ukraine last year from Western partners. ArmyInform tells its story on the occasion of Tank Troops Day. — I encountered a large-scale invasion at home in the Buchansky district of the Kyiv region. Heard how they started bombing Gostomel airport. The first explosion occurred at approximately 5:30 am. -Then I ran out into the street, and within a few minutes I learned from the news that the war had begun,- the serviceman recalls. -Fin- studied banking and graduated from the military department as a tank platoon commander. After studying, he worked in a bank, and already in October 2022 he was mobilized and assigned to the tank platoon commander, then still in the 4th tank brigade: - At first, they worked with T-64 and T-72 tanks. These were our main tanks, working in the Kharkiv direction. Later, -Fin- was offered to go to study on foreign equipment, while at first they were not even informed that it would be Leopard tanks. - Later we were already informed that we were going to study on foreign equipment, namely on Leopard 2A4 tanks. The training took place in Poland for about 40 days. -Fin- assures that this term is enough to master new tanks, because all servicemen already had significant combat experience. — Many who passed through Bakhmut took part in the Kharkiv operation. Tanks almost all go the same way. And it was very easy for us, as we just started studying, adds -Fin-. In Poland, he was trained on a Polish tank, and when he returned to Ukraine, he got one of the Leopards that Norway gave him. Currently, a whole tank coalition of countries is working, which transfers tanks of various modifications to Ukraine. — Tanks from different countries are slightly different in equipment, have different machine guns. There is also a difference in the devices, -night lights-, some of which have rear view cameras. But in general, the differences are not such that they cannot be understood or require additional training, explains -Fin-. His unit has been working at Leopards for a year and a half. -Fin- received one of the first such tanks that arrived in Ukraine. — I had my first combat use on this tank during a counteroffensive in the Zaporizhzhia region in 2023, the settlement of Mala Tokmachka. They went on the attack, started working. The enemy fired heavily at us, using FPV drones a lot. In the end, we completed the task and retreated to more advantageous positions to save the lives of the crew, save the equipment, the tank remained intact, - recalls -Fin-. After such an attack, many traces of artillery shells remained on the equipment. Tankers say that the Russians, on the one hand, are afraid of the Leopards, but on the other hand, they also hunt them, consider Western equipment a priority target. — There were cases of drone strikes, the commander of a tank with the call sign -Chechen- was killed in mine. He was hit by a -lancet- directly in the commander's hatch, he died on the spot. The crew survived, but the commander died, says -Fin-. Currently, the tanks of the 33rd brigade are performing combat tasks in the eastern direction and are holding back the advance of the Russian invaders. — the Russians are constantly trying to trick us. But we are not the first day in the war, so we know their tricks. -Leopards- are used precisely in tank battles, we engage in direct fire so that the target is 2.5-3 kilometers away, - notes -Fin-, and about Russian -analogovnet- tanks, such as the T-90M -Proryv-, says the following: — Tanks are all destroyed, all are burning. The key is knowing where to shoot. Crews are officially paid for each destroyed unit of enemy equipment. It's also an added motivation to destroy them more. — One of the crews destroyed two BMPs at once. They left and worked very quickly. -Leopard- has an excellent sight, sees far, plus speed. They just saw two BMPs in an open area and immediately stopped them with two shots. After that, they immediately rolled back -into a hole- so that neither artillery nor drones could catch up. We work at speed: there is a task, there is a goal, we worked quickly and hid, explains -Fin-. He adds that the Soviet tanks, which are also in the armed brigade, mainly work from closed positions, that is, as artillery and cover. — Nowadays, we often conduct training, because we do not know what will await us in the future. We may have to ford or ford a river. Bridges are often blown up, and we have to be ready for that, says the tank company commander. Currently, the 33rd brigade is also actively recruiting, in addition, experienced commanders can already train new arrivals themselves. — There is still a lack of highly qualified personnel, namely tank commanders. We have guys who were anti-tank fighters who joined us. We ourselves trained them on the training grounds, and now they skillfully perform combat tasks. That is, they were anti-tankers, but they became tankers. Tankers who work on foreign equipment constantly exchange experience in the operation of tanks and their use in combat operations. — My colleague studied in Britain on Challenger tanks, and we constantly exchange information about what we or they are better at, what are our weaknesses. We support the contact. -Fin- emphasizes that an important quality for a tanker is the ability to work in a crew. — The crew is one unit, they must work together. There has to be trust between them in order to move out and complete the task. And you also need perseverance to study, to learn the technique. Constantly working and training. There are no longer any height requirements. -I have a platoon leader who is 192 cm tall and he's quite comfortable,- adds -Fin- with a smile.

Distinguishes drones from birds: what is known about the radars that the Netherlands will transfer t...	As reported ArmyInform, the corresponding contract was arranged by the Ministry of Defense of the Kingdom with Robin Radar Systems in The Hague. Robin Radar Systems radars are designed to detect small drones, distinguishing them from other objects such as birds. A unique feature of certain radar samples from the Dutch manufacturer is their ability to work while driving on a vehicle, which ensures increased operational capabilities. The mobile nature of these radars makes them difficult for adversaries to detect and neutralize, providing continuous detection of air threats. These radars will play a crucial role in countering Russian drone attacks, providing a significant defense capability for Ukraine. The MAX, ELVIRA and IRIS radars offered by Robin Radar Systems provide advanced drone detection and tracking solutions suitable for a variety of environments. With its 360-degree 3D coverage, the MAX radar can detect and track thousands of moving objects simultaneously, providing real-time updates and accurate data through rapid rotation. Designed for airports and wind farms, it is particularly suitable for environments where flight safety is critical. ELVIRA, a 2D radar specifically designed for drone detection, uses advanced technologies such as micro-Doppler classification to effectively distinguish UAVs from other objects while offering easy integration with command and control systems. Robin Radar Iris® is a short-range X-band 3D radar designed for drone detection and identification. It is a frequency-modulated continuous-wave radar with two independent radio frequency systems, two pairs of antennas diametrically opposed to transmit and receive. IRIS is a lightweight 3D radar that deploys in less than 15 minutes and can detect drones at speeds of up to 100 km/h, making it ideal for rapid deployment in the field. The weight of these radars is 29 kg, they deploy in 15 minutes and provide a circular view, the instrument range of which is up to 5 km. The systems can detect UAVs weighing 3 kg from a distance of 4 km and 1.4 kg from 2 km. -This three-coordinate radar operates in the X-Band range, that is, at a wavelength of 3.75-2.5 cm and at a frequency of 8-12 GHz. The beam width is 6 degrees and the scan speed is 1 second, the analysts said. -As for the ability to work while driving, speeds up to 100 km/h and angles up to 10 degrees are allowed.- Also exists project integration of Robin Radar's IRIS with OpenWorks Engineering's Vision Flex CUAS optical autonomous surveillance system, which increases the effectiveness of target detection and recognition. Experts from IKK Defense Express believe that these small-sized installations will be an ideal addition to the work of small fire groups , which are engaged in identifying targets. They can also come in handy for cover from threats during marches, experts emphasize. In the context of the war in Ukraine, where drones are increasingly being used for reconnaissance and attacks, these radars will help provide valuable capabilities to counter the aerial threat. Their ability to quickly detect, track and classify drones will allow Ukrainian forces to better anticipate and neutralize drone attacks, strengthening their defenses against airstrikes.

Throw a shadow on NATO to hide its hybrid attacks: how and why Russia lies about UAVs	The purpose of this narrative is obvious — to show the Russians as if they are fighting against the entire -Western world- and to accuse Ukraine's partners of escalation. Information is being actively circulated in the Russian information space that the territory of NATO countries is allegedly being used by the Armed Forces to launch UAVs. For example, during the drone attack on the Murmansk region on September 11, Russian information launderers spread the news that one of the Ukrainian UAVs had arrived from the territory of Norway, a NATO member. The Kremlin has long sought to involve NATO in a war in order to lose not only Ukraine, but the entire -collective west-. According to the Kremlin dictator, such a reason for the unsuccessful completion of -svo- should have satisfied the domestic Russian audience. That is why Russian drones and missiles have repeatedly invaded the airspace of at least five NATO member states and two other European states. Moldova, which is particularly suffering from the consequences of Russian attacks, has repeatedly recorded cases of missile and drone debris falling on its territory, and Romania even activates the air alarm signal during Russian air attacks and has built shelters in border areas. On September 7, the Russian-Iranian -shahed- fell for the first time in Latvia, as a result of which the country announced the strengthening of air defense on its eastern borders. It is no secret for Ukraine that Russia has been waging a hybrid war against the entire civilized world for a long time. This is manifested in cyber attacks, systematic violation of airspace by fighter jets, particularly over the Baltic Sea, aggressive propaganda through the media and the church, funding of pro-Russian organizations and individual politicians. And the West's accusations of escalation, which periodically come from the Russians, are just an attempt to shift responsibility for their actions onto someone else.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/14/kynuty-tin-na-nato-shhob-pryhovaty-svoyi-gibrydni-ataky-yak-i-chomu-rosiya-breshe-pro-bpla/	2024-09-13T20:13:32-07:00
Utility discount in a few clicks: how to issue a discount remotely	ArmyInform tells who can use this service and what needs to be done. Previously, beneficiaries had to submit several applications. The first is about registering a war veteran, and the second is actually about assigning a benefit for housing and communal services. Currently, one application is submitted. And it's simplified. The point is that a significant amount of data is now collected automatically through electronic information exchange between public registries. By the way, family members of a veteran can apply for benefits. This can be done both by those who have already retired from the ranks of the Defense Forces of Ukraine, and by those who are still serving. For the latter, such an option can come in handy, because it is not so easy to personally visit various government institutions during service. Vacations are not big enough to waste time on. The result of the application review can be tracked in the section -My applications- - -application status-. Currently, the benefit for the payment of housing and communal services is provided in cash. By default, the Pension Fund can open an account in Oschadbank and inform the beneficiary about it. And the beneficiary must sign the bank account agreement. If you want the money to be transferred to an account in another bank, you need to apply to the territorial body of the Pension Fund. For registration, you need to provide your account, where the money will be deposited. It usually takes some time for registration and billing. But later the money comes. In general, the benefit involves the following process - you pay the full amount for housing and communal services, which are indicated in the payments. But you receive funds on the card in the form of compensation. It should be remembered that if you do not pay for the utility bill, the benefits may stop. We would like to remind you that the discount on the payment of housing and communal services is not the only benefit provided to the participants of hostilities. More about social guarantees read here. If you have not yet registered the status of a combatant, but there are grounds for its registration, we also wrote about the options how UBD can be issued now.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/14/znyzhka-na-komunalku-v-dekilka-klikiv-yak-oformyty-pilgu-dystanczijno/	2024-09-13T20:00:45-07:00
In Poland, the NATO-Ukraine JATEC Center - Ministry of Defense officially started its work	About this reported on September 13 by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. The decision to create JATEC was approved at the NATO summit in Washington in July this year. The center is located in the Polish city of Bydgoszcz. -The joint center with NATO will help Ukraine not only to implement procedures, approaches and standards, but also to share its own experience. Interoperability is one of our main goals and we are taking concrete steps for it. We have submitted our proposals for the implementation of the projects and are waiting for substantive decisions,- Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Stanislav Hayder commented on the event. Assistant Secretary General of the Alliance Thomas Goffus, Commander of the NATO Strategic Command for Transformations General Philippe Lavin, First Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Polish Armed Forces, Major General Karol Dymanovsky, Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine for European Integration Oleksandr Balanutsa took part in the negotiations in Poland. The parties legally established the creation of the Center and outlined its main tasks, structure, roles and functions of the management team. The work of JATEC is aimed at achieving interoperability of the security and defense institutions of Ukraine with the relevant institutions of the Alliance, improving the quality of education, increasing the analytical component and training personnel. The parties agreed that the establishment of the Center should be formally completed in October-November of this year. -The opening of a joint center with NATO is a real step towards the integration of Ukraine into the structure of the Alliance. Membership in NATO is not a political slogan, but the implementation of specific projects. We are gradually moving towards becoming a full-fledged part of the bloc, and the opening of JATEC brings us closer to this,- Oleksandr Balanutsa said during the event. Another topic of negotiations is ensuring the work of the Center, namely the need to provide resources from NATO for the implementation of measures and the development of an information and communication network. Representatives of Ukraine and NATO also agreed on the need to launch projects within the framework of JATEC as soon as possible. In particular, the Ukrainian side handed over a list of 70 projects for joint work and suggested which of them should become priorities. As reported by ArmyInform, the Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Stanislav Hayder during a meeting in Kyiv informed experts of the European Union about the course and results of reforms in the field of defense.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/13/u-polshhi-oficzijno-rozpochav-robotu-czentr-nato-ukrayina-jatec-minoborony/	2024-09-13T12:11:01-07:00

Exposure, suspicion, special investigation: law enforcement officers in the Kupyan region worked har...	The law enforcement officers exposed a 49-year-old woman who worked as a clerk in the occupation administration. During the capture of the village of Dvorichna in the Kupyan District, a local resident voluntarily supported the Russian invaders. She assumed the position of -executive chief specialist of the paperwork sector of the Dvurechan territorial administration of the Temporary Civil Administration of the Kupyan district of the Kharkiv region.- The woman organized the documents and their further verification, formed cases and handed them over to the leadership of the occupation administration. Also, an official of the occupation administration was engaged in the formation of applications from local residents for further payment of -material aid- in Russian rubles. After the liberation of the district from the Russian invaders, the accomplice of the occupiers tried to avoid legal responsibility, but she was exposed. Also, the prosecutor's office in absentia notified about suspicion due to the fact of collaborative activity to a 37-year-old man who helped invaders to -legally take- Ukrainian enterprises into the property of the Russian Federation. During the occupation of the city of Kupyansk, he voluntarily agreed to cooperate with the Russian invaders, and in July 2022 he deliberately assumed the position of -executive chief specialist of the Department of Economic Development of the Military-Gradient Administration of the Kupyan District of the Kharkiv Region.- The man, on the instructions of the occupation leadership, carried out an inventory of communal and state enterprises, and also drew up -reports- based on its results. On the basis of these -documents-, the occupiers have already illegally transferred captured Ukrainian enterprises to the property of the aggressor state. Before the de-occupation of Kharkiv Oblast by the Defense Forces of Ukraine, the collaborator fled to the Russian Federation together with the Russian military. Law enforcement officers raised the issue of declaring him wanted. Also, the prosecutors completed a special investigation and sent to the court an indictment against the Kupyan city council member for the fact of collaborative activity. During the occupation of the city by the armed forces of the Russian Federation, she voluntarily cooperated with the Russian occupiers. In July 2022, the invaders appointed a woman to the position of -and. at. chief physician of the communal enterprise -Kupyanskoe territorial medical association- of the Ministry of Health of the Kharkiv Oblast Regional State Administration. Before the large-scale invasion of the Russian Federation into Ukraine, the woman worked as a cardiologist, so she had relevant work experience and skills that she used when working for the invaders. The newly minted -leader- coordinated the work of subordinate employees, followed the instructions of the occupation leadership and even managed to appear in a Russian propaganda video.

Putin's subject spied on the Armed Forces in Kharkiv: -shtirlitsa- will be tried	This was reported by the Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office. In addition to official work in a banking institution, the man additionally spied for the benefit of the Russian Federation. Recruited by the Russian intelligence services, he established contact with a person who, in his opinion, had access to the state secret service in order to collect classified information. These data were necessary for the enemy to launch strikes on documentation storage sites with the aim of destroying them and, as a result, opposing the recovery of critical infrastructure that had already suffered from shelling by the aggressor state. In addition, the man collected information about the deployment locations of personnel and military equipment of Ukrainian defenders on the territory of Kharkiv. While moving around the city, the accused recorded, including with the help of a video recorder, the location of the armed forces. He transmitted the collected intelligence information to his curator via Telegram. The data obtained from the spy is necessary for the enemy to plan massive attacks. Thanks to the concerted and coordinated actions of the law enforcement officers, the spy was exposed and arrested in July 2024. During the search of his place of residence, mobile phones, flash drives, computer equipment, a video recorder, etc., as well as a passport of a citizen of the Russian Federation and an improvised explosive device were seized. The Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office approved and referred to the court an indictment on the facts of espionage, dissemination of information about the movement, movement, location of the Armed Forces, committed under martial law, with the purpose of providing such information to the state, which is carrying out armed aggression against Ukraine, as well as on the fact of acquisition, carrying and keeping an explosive device without a statutory permit. The man will be held without bail.

The President of Ukraine answered whether the operation in Kurshchyna was a mistake	He told about this during his participation in the 20th annual meeting of the Yalta European Strategy. Volodymyr Zelenskyi also noted that thanks to the Kursk operation, it was possible to stop the enemy in the Kharkiv direction and slow down the advance of the Russians in the Donetsk region. After the operation in Kurshchyna, the backlog of the Armed Forces of Ukraine for shells near Pokrovsk decreased from 1:12 to 1:2.5. -In Kurshchyna, the Russians began their rapid offensive. About 60-70 thousand people want to apply. We know about 40,000 are already there,- the President noted. The President noted that it is a pleasant fact that not only Ukraine is talking about the deoccupation of its territories, but also Russia. In addition, Volodymyr Zelenskyi answered the question whether the Kursk operation was a mistake. The head of state recalled the Russian offensive in the Kharkiv direction, which is also a very important center of the eastern part of Ukraine. -You saw that they broke through our defenses, wanted to capture Kharkiv, in addition to their official messages regarding the construction of some buffer zones along our entire border, and they would not have finished with the East,- noted Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The President noted that we later received intelligence from our partners. -In the north of our state, starting from Sumshchyna, from the east to the north of our state, plans were being prepared to create appropriate buffer zones, and with one or another military success, they wanted to capture the centers of these regions. This is what the Kursk operation gave,- the head of state summarized. In the opinion of Volodymyr Zelenskyi, the operation gave the results that everyone was counting on. -The enemy has been stopped in Kharkiv Oblast, its advance on Donetsk Oblast has slowed down, although it is very difficult there, and there is still a long way to positive things there. However, they withdrew their forces from Kharkiv Oblast, Zaporozhye and other groups that were preparing in the north for the occupation of our territories. The enemy began to move all this to the Kursk direction. This is what happened,- added the President.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/13/prezydent-ukrayiny-vidpoviv-chy-bula-operacziya-na-kurshhyni-pomylkoyu/	2024-09-13T07:09:04-07:00

Enemy armored assaults have become more frequent in Kharkiv Oblast: how to counter them	How this can be countered told on the air of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon, the spokesman of the Kharkiv OTU Vitaly Sarantsev. — Last day, the enemy tried to storm the units of the Defense Forces in Vovchansk and used two BMPs for support. Both machines were detected already during the approach to our positions and were hit by fire from FPV drones. One of the cars was destroyed, the other was damaged, he said. Despite heavy losses of the occupiers, they do not stop trying to storm in the future, which indicates the importance of the Kharkiv direction for the Russian military and political leadership. In order to continue the offensive, the invaders are trying to change tactics and approaches to carrying out combat missions. On the other hand, the Russians are not sending any significant reinforcements to Kharkiv region and are forced to storm with available forces. — The enemy conducts constant rotations, accumulates forces that carry out assaults in the city itself. He rotates these units internally and is constantly trying to strengthen them. As for any global accumulation, it is currently not observed either in the direction of Vovchansk or near other settlements, in particular Hlyboky, Lyptsi or other locations on the Russian-Ukrainian border, the spokesman said. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that ->in Kharkiv Oblast, Ukrainian drones put the occupiers on starvation rations.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/13/vorozhi-broneshturmy-pochastishaly-na-harkivshhyni-yak-vdayetsya-protydiyaty/	2024-09-13T06:26:23-07:00

As a border guard - Schumacher - overtook enemy drones on bends	About Andrii with the call sign -Malyuk- said on September 13 on the website of the State Border Service. The first rotation of -Malyuk- — to the combat zone in the Kharkiv region. There he had to drive various armored and non-armored vehicles, deliver and pick up personnel from positions, transport the wounded, deliver ammunition and necessary property to the soldiers, etc. -With a night vision device, he drove at a speed of 120-130 km per hour at night. When the enemy FPV drones started to fly, it was even necessary to drive at a higher speed so that they did not catch up,- -Malyuk- recalls. Adrenaline, says the border guard, was over the top. However, they went to any challenge. And if at full speed in the dark they flew into ravines from enemy anti-tank vehicles and shells, then they simply pulled out the car, repaired it and drove on. Previously ArmyInform told about 43-year-old Serhiy, a soldier of the 78th separate airborne assault regiment and his experience of brutal battles in the Toretsk direction.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/13/yak-prykordonnyk-shumaher-na-virazhah-obganyav-vorozhi-drony/	2024-09-13T05:57:48-07:00

The head of state noted that while Ukraine is waiting for the delivery of promised air defense systems, primarily Patriot, from partners, Russia continues to strike our country. After all, the Russian dictator does not need any long-range permits for this. -Anyone who simply sees on the map where Russia strikes from, where it prepares forces and keeps reserves, where it locates military facilities and what logistics it uses - anyone who sees all this obviously understands what long-range Ukraine is for,- - the President emphasized. Volodymyr Zelensky also noted that the other day he discussed this in detail with US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken and British Foreign Minister David Lammy. According to the words of the Head of State, after this meeting, there can no longer be any open question about why Ukraine needs sufficient long-range. -I want to emphasize: enough. Not enough to simply say that there is a solution. Long-range enough to change the course of the war and force Russia to seek peace. And we very much hope for our partners, we hope for the result from our partners. At least we are working on it,- added Volodymyr Zelenskyi. As reported by ArmyInform, the EU will send interest from frozen Russian assets to strengthen Ukraine's defense.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/13/prezydent-ukrayiny-nam-potribna-dalekobijnist-dlya-zminy-perebigu-vijny/	2024-09-13T05:48:04-07:00

Without food and water in the trenches: the drones put the occupiers on starvation rations	reported who and how exactly deprived the occupiers of the basic necessities for conducting hostilities, on the broadcast of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon spokesman of OTU -Kharkiv- Vitaly Sarantsev. -Such simple problems have serious consequences for the enemy, because those units that are in advanced positions cannot carry out their tasks efficiently, cannot go on assaults, cannot carry out tasks related to the engineering equipment of their positions,- he said. The lack of an established stable supply of provisions, water and, in some cases, even ammunition has a negative impact on the combat capability of enemy units. Such a situation was created thanks to the skilful combat work of Ukrainian drones, which broke the logistical chains of support in the enemy's near rear. — The prerequisite for this is the effective actions of our FPV drone operators, who skillfully search for the enemy's movement routes and cut all the logistics chains as precisely and accurately as possible. They destroy everything that approaches the positions, no matter how the enemy tries to carry out these support tasks either on foot, using motorized vehicles, or using cars, the spokesman said. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in Kharkiv Oblast, the occupiers suffer from Ukrainian drones.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/13/bez-harchiv-ta-vody-v-okopah-dronari-posadyly-okupantiv-na-golodnyj-pajok/	2024-09-13T05:23:56-07:00

Free pallia: no money was earned, only a suspicion of 10 years in prison	The Security Service of Ukraine informs about this. -This time, the occupiers remotely involved two Odesa residents, an immigrant from Luhansk region and a resident of Izmail district, before committing arson. Among them are three minors. All of them were looking for -easy money- in Telegram channels, where they got into the field of view of the special services of the Russian Federation, -said SBU employees. In order to carry out enemy tasks, the participants at various times found potential -targets- and then coordinated them with their Russian supervisors. After the arsons, the attackers recorded the fire on the cameras of their own phones and sent a -video report- to representatives of the Russian special services. According to such an algorithm, the perpetrators destroyed 6 official cars of Ukrainian defenders, but never received the promised money from the occupiers. Criminals were arrested -on hot pursuit- in various districts of Odesa. During the searches of the homes of the detainees, incendiary devices and mobile phones with evidence of subversive activities for the benefit of the Russian Federation were seized.

According to the investigation, a 26-year-old junior inspector of the border service from Volyn established a channel for the systematic transfer of conscripts to Poland through official checkpoints.

Overloading and the storm factor: what can paralyze Russian logistics in Crimea	The spokesperson of the Navy of Ukraine, captain of the third rank Dmytro Pletenchuk, told about this on the air of -Suspilne.Novyny-. The main conclusion is that the occupiers have constant technical difficulties with the operation of the -illegal construction-. It cannot be loaded, but the occupants have no other way out. -First of all, this is due to the consequences of fire damage, the enemy cannot load it, but on the other hand, he does not have much choice. The cases of exploitation of car fuel tanks have become more frequent, that is, they have become overturned more. This information is being verified. But it fits into the general picture of the situation that arose due to the lack of ferry connections, which was the main logistical tool for ensuring the grouping both in Crimea itself and in the south of our country,- said Dmytro Pletenchuk. Another factor is added to everything else - the spokesman of the Navy of Ukraine states - soon the beginning of the season of storms in the Black Sea. And this will only increase the problems for the crossing, to protect which the Russians are forced to keep in the area. serious air defense forces.

The end of a saboteur's career: a man from Chernihiv who helped destroy his own city was detained	notified the Security Service of Ukraine. The perpetrator adjusted missile strikes on the regional center and prepared a series of arsons at Ukrzaliznytsia facilities. The priority targets of the enemy shelling were the base points of the Ukrainian troops involved in the defense of the northern borders of Ukraine. According to available data, the occupiers planned to use Kh-59 air missiles to carry out fire damage. The Russian special service also tried to find out the locations of enterprises that fulfill a state defense order. To perform these tasks, the FSB remotely recruited a 44-year-old employee of a local factory. -The man came to the attention of the Russian special services because of his anti-Ukrainian comments in Telegram channels. According to the instructions of the occupiers, the figure went around the area, where he secretly recorded the location of the Defense Forces. He forwarded the information he received to his Russian curator via messenger via a specially created chatbot administered by the FSB,- SBU employees said.

-Sarayami- according to the Donetsk scenario: what makes Russians submissively -canned in cans-	The battalion commander told about the peculiarities of storming -barracks- according to the Donetsk scenario on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- of shock air defense systems -Achilles- of the 92nd separate assault brigade named after the basket chieftain Ivan Sirk, captain Yury Fedorenko. — The first armored vehicle that goes in their assault column is mostly an old modification tank, roughly like the T-72. It can be without a tower, without ammunition. It is used precisely as a carrier. From above, it is actually covered with a -barn-. Anyone who has ever seen a barn or an old house knows how it will look made of metal, said the drone commander. In front of this armored vehicle are trawls designed to remove mine barriers, both anti-personnel and anti-tank. — Between the body of the tank and between this -barn-, which is welded on top, there is an assault infantry. Behind the tank, 2-3 BMPs are moving, similarly covered with -sheds- on top. Between the body of the BMP and this very -barn- is the assault infantry, the soldier continued. It is difficult to understand why the Russians meekly accept certain death. — Frankly speaking, I do not know what the Russian occupiers are telling the military and how they are forcing them to climb into this structure that is being built, because it is certain death. Most of the conscious people who are involved in the military affairs understand this, including new recruits of the Russian Federation. But the system of coercion in them works perfectly and the occupier is more afraid of his own than going to the battlefield to certain death. Therefore, one way or another, they are -preserved- in this -can-, said Yuriy Fedorenko. Next, assault actions take place - Russian -barracks- rush in the direction of the positions of the units of the Defense Forces. — At high speed, the main task is to jump to our advanced positions. -Tanchyk makes a pass and BMPs fly behind him to rush the infantry and then move on to shock-assault actions with the aim of displacing us from advanced positions,- said the commander of -Achilles-. The military said that drones saw such sheds for the first time in Donetsk region. There, they were used most in the Avdiivka region, in the Bakhmut area and in other places. Losses among the personnel of the enemy during such assaults are colossal. — 90% of vehicles are currently destroyed by Defense Forces on the battlefield either immediately or after damage. Up to 60-70% of the assault infantry, which moves on such equipment, does not reach the line of advance, Yuriy Fedorenko said. The military said that during the past day, Achilles fighters managed to destroy 4 units of armored vehicles - one tank and 3 BMP. In general, even more enemy equipment was burned on the field, because the gunners and drones of other units also worked well on it. Since the beginning of September, the -Achillesians- have already destroyed 25 units of the occupiers' equipment. However, the droners are in no hurry to relax - the occupants still have enough -dances- and -beh- left. -This indicates that the enemy still has the opportunity, unfortunately, to carry out shock-assault actions and deploy its lightly armored and armored vehicles,- noted Yuriy Fedorenko. Earlier, ArmyInform showed how the long-range -helmeted- Achilles - hit exactly under the turret of a Russian tank and defeated -Grad - in Belgorod region, and the all-seeing -Achilles- saw and eliminated the occupiers and shot a full yagdtash of enemy equipment in Kharkiv Oblast.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/13/sarayamy-za-doneczkym-sczenariyem-shho-zmushuye-rosiyan-pokirno-konservuvatysya-v-blyashanky/	2024-09-13T01:51:18-07:00

Latest pirates: Russians strike civilian ships with strategic aircraft	About this on September 13 on the broadcast of the -Edyny Novy- marathon, commenting on the rocket attack by the Russians on a ship transporting grain to Egypt, said the spokesman of the Navy of Ukraine Dmytro Pletenchuk. -This did not happen in the area of ​​our control, not in the maritime corridor. The ship left it and went on a different route.

Dmytro Pletenchuk noted that the use of a TU-22 bomber against a peaceful vessel of strategic aviation is particularly shocking. -The level of use of weapons raises many questions. To use weapons, which I tentatively call 50 by 50. These missiles are 50 years old from the moment of their use, and for these missiles to deviate by 50 kilometers is a normal phenomenon. Therefore, these are absolutely irresponsible actions.- - stated the spokesman of the Navy of Ukraine.

The situation is especially cynicized by the fact that, in the case of the shops, the propagandists show footage of the soldiers of the Soviet Union engaged in their usual looting business - only not in Ukraine, but in their -native- Kursk region! At the same time, the representative of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Maria Sakharova, calls on international structures -not to turn a blind eye to the terrorist acts of the Kyiv regime on the territory of the Russian Federation.- This tactic, typical of Russian propaganda, is called -mirroring.- Propagandists make the same accusations against Ukraine that we once made against Russia, in particular regarding the events in Buch. That is, they often do not even invent fakes, but simply copy news items from Ukrainian news. The average Russian who consumes this information willingly believes it, because he would have behaved the same way in a foreign country (which the Ukrainians were able to see many times) — he looted, shot, raped. Therefore, Sakharova's appeal to international structures is completely hopeless. After all, apart from unspoken accusations of crimes, the Russians cannot provide any evidence of illegal actions by the Armed Forces. It is Russia that systematically uses terrorist methods of warfare and violates international humanitarian law, while Ukraine protects its territory and citizens from the aggressor. Regarding the war crimes committed by the Russians in Ukraine, a significant evidence base has been collected, both Ukrainian and independent world media wrote about them and continue to write about them. Therefore, the Russians use -reflection- primarily to divert attention from their failure in Kurshchyna and the inevitable defeat in the war that they themselves started.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/13/rospropaganda-vidzerkalyuye-informacziyu-pro-kurshhynu-do-chogo-tut-bucha/	2024-09-12T20:22:16-07:00
Howitzer M101A1: the history of the gun — the record holder	This extraordinary howitzer certainly deserves a more detailed account. The correspondent of ArmiyaInform talked about it with Andriy Kharuk, a well-known weapons researcher, author of a personal profile art blog, doctor of historical sciences, professor of the Department of Humanities of the National Academy of Land Forces named after Hetman Petro Sahaydachny. The first part of the conversation was published by last week, and today we bring to your attention the second part of the conversation. — In addition to the modernization of the gun itself, as far as is known, the cartridges for it also underwent changes&#8230; — After the refusal in 1934 to use shrapnel in the ammunition of American 105-mm howitzers only two types of projectiles remained - high-explosive M1 with a mass of 14.97 kg and smoke. Already during the Second World War, an armor-piercing projectile, an aiming projectile (with colored smoke) and a cluster fragmentation projectile (used primarily in the Pacific theater of war) were adopted as weapons. The M1 projectile had two modifications - standard and -deep penetration- (with a reinforced case, but with a reduced charge mass). TNT or -composition B- - a mixture of TNT and RDX - was used for the equipment. The explosive mass for the standard projectile was 2.3 kg (for -composition B-) or 2.177 kg (for TNT); for a deep penetration projectile - 2.087 kg or 1.93 kg, respectively. The armor-piercing projectile weighed 13.25 kg and was equipped with a mixture of pentrite and TNT weighing 1.33 kg. The charge was profiled to form a cumulative jet. The initial speed of this projectile was 381 m/s. It could penetrate armor 102 mm thick at a distance of up to 1,800 m. Howitzer loading is semi-unitary (cases with charges were transported separately from shells, but were connected before loading). Seven variable shells were used for firing. — Mr. Professor, I ask you to clarify the marking system of this howitzer, because some informative sources create confusion in these markings. — In 1962, the M2A1 howitzer on the M2A1 carriage was given the designation M101 , and on the carriage M2A2 - M101A1. In both cases, barrels of two modifications could be used - M2A1 or M2A2, as well as anti-recoil devices of one of five modifications - from M2A1 to M2A5. Sights were improved and included: Elbow M16A1D telescopic sight for direct fire (3x magnification, 13° field of view); panoramic sight Panoramic M12A7S (4x magnification, field of view - 10°); quadrant M4A1. Ammunition, as before, consisted of semi-unitary shots, but their range was expanded and included the following types of shells: — This howitzer— no only an old-timer and a participant in many military campaigns, but also one of the record holders for the number of copies produced. - Mass production of howitzers at the Rock Island Arsenal continued until 1953, the total number of M2A1s produced was brought to 10,202 units. However, in the following years, the production of M101A1 howitzers was periodically renewed to fulfill export orders. The last such order (for 133 howitzers) was received in 1981 from Indonesia, the company fulfilled it by November 1983. —From the historical perspective and tactical and technical features, Andriy Ivanovych, let's focus on the direct service of this weapon. Which units of the US Army were they sent to? - In the late 1930s, the US Army began transitioning its infantry divisions to a new, -triangular- structure. The artillery of such a division was to consist of three divisions of 75-mm guns and one division of 105-mm howitzers (12 artillery systems in a division). Since there were no serial samples of 105-mm howitzers yet, the old 155-mm howitzers M1917 of the Schneider system were introduced in the division instead of these guns. Following the German Blitzkrieg in France, the US military decided to replace the 75 mm guns with 105 mm howitzers, leaving the division with a division of 155 mm howitzers - this was the organization of divisional artillery throughout World War II. — But, in addition to saturating each unit with specific guns, they needed to be managed successfully. How was this process organized? - An important innovation was the organization of a Fire Directio Center (FDC) in each division. It made it possible to focus the fire of the division on one target, and after it was hit, quickly transfer it to the next one. Central control equipment provided communication with batteries and forward artillery observers, as well as producing data for setting sights. In 1941, fire control centers also appeared at the division level. In 1937, the US Army had only 25 field artillery divisions. By December 1941 (the moment the United States entered the war), their number reached 142, and by 1945 exceeded 700. 264 of them had M2A1 howitzers: 161 divisions (147 as part of divisions and 14 separate) in the European Theater of War, 71 (respectively 62 and 9) in the Pacific and 32 in the US territory. In 1942, M2A1 howitzers appeared in the Marine Corps - one division of such guns was introduced into the divisional artillery regiments along with three divisions of 75-mm howitzers. By the beginning of the large amphibious operations on Saipan and Guam, the artillery regiments already had two divisions of 105-mm and 75-mm howitzers, and by the time of the landing on Iwo Jima in 1945, three and one, respectively. — As far as is known, during the Second World War this weaponry, along with others, was also prepared for export. How were these deliveries organized? - The main recipients of American aid under the Lend-Lease program - Great Britain and the USSR - did not show much interest in American artillery systems, making do with their own artillery systems. The USSR did not receive any such howitzers, the British were given only 16. The American howitzers were much more needed by China and Free France, which received 476 and 239 M2A1s, respectively. Another 223 units of these howitzers were transferred to a number of Latin American states that entered the war on the side of the Allies, but they were used in battle only by the Brazilians, who sent an infantry division to Italy that had three divisions of 105-mm howitzers. — And what was the fate of the use of these guns after the Second World War? — 105-mm howitzers were quite widely used during the Korean War, and on both sides of the front, both by the US and of the Republic of Korea, as well as parts of Chinese volunteers who fought on the side of the DPRK. The last campaign of the US Army in which the M101A1 howitzer was widely used was the Vietnam War. Their main task in this war was the direct support of infantry units, howitzers were relatively rare in divisions. Much more often, they were used in battery, underwater or even separate artillery installations. The use of howitzers of the 1st Division of the 7th Artillery Regiment as the armament of the LCM-6 landing craft became quite exotic. Later, AMMI pontoons mounted from standard sections were used as floating batteries. For two M101A1 howitzers, a pontoon measuring 27.45×8.66 m was used, on the edges of which ammunition storage was located, in the center - living quarters, and between it and the artillery bunkers - howitzer positions (all this was protected by armor sheets). Each battery had at its disposal three AMMI pontoons and five LCM-8 landing craft (three of them served as tugboats pushing pontoons, one as a fire control center, and another one carried additional ammunition). Since 1966, new 105-mm howitzers M102 began to arrive to replace the M101A1. The old systems were gradually transferred to the Allies until the end of 1969. South Vietnam received 730 M101A1 howitzers (only 60 of the new M102 systems were delivered). A year later, the South Vietnamese army had forty divisions of 105-mm howitzers (thirty in infantry divisions, seven separate and three airborne), as well as a hundred separate M101A1 platoons in fortified positions. Losses were also considerable, especially during the repulse of large-scale offensive operations. So, for the period from March 31 to April 10, 1972, 81 howitzers were lost. — Meanwhile, in the US Army itself, these guns were abandoned far from immediately. — In the US Army and Marine Corps, the M102 was never able to completely replace the old 105-millimeter guns. In 1983, the M101A1 took part in the last combat operation in the US Army — the invasion of Grenada. In 1985, the US Army had (mostly in the National Guard and Reserve) six M101 howitzers and 494 M101A1s. It wasn't until the 1990s that both the M101A1 and M102 were replaced by the new 105mm M119 howitzers. — During the so-called Cold War, the United States was an active supplier of its weapons to allies and partners. Surely, foreign armies were also interested in this proven weapon? — In the postwar years, American 105-mm howitzers entered the arms of the armies of several dozen countries — primarily NATO members (Belgium, Denmark, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Turkey , Germany, France). Non-aligned Austria and Yugoslavia also received them, and after the collapse of the latter, newly independent states. In Canada, Australia and New Zealand, the M101A1 replaced the British-style 25-pounder. If in Australia and New Zealand the American howitzers have already been replaced by the licensed version of the English L118, then the Canadians in 1997 modernized their 105-mm howitzers (replacing the barrel with a longer, 33-caliber one) and under the C3 designation they keep a certain amount in spare parts. The basic version of the M101A1 was designated in Canada as C1 and was produced under license in the 1950s. In Latin America, the countries that did not operate American 105-mm howitzers are easier to think of: Costa Rica and Panama. In the rest of the states of the region (from Mexico in the north to Argentina in the south, as well as the islands of Haiti and the Dominican Republic), these howitzers are in service. Their number varies from country to country and ranges from a few units to several hundred (for example, Brazil has more than 250). In Africa, M101s are less common, but even in this region, you can name a good dozen countries that have received these systems. Ethiopia, Libya and Liberia received 105-mm howitzers as military aid from the United States, and Mozambique and some other states received them -inherited- from the colonialists. In the Middle East, M101 was used by both sides of the Israeli-Jordanian and Iranian-Iraqi conflicts, and was used in the armies of Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen. American 105-millimeter guns are quite widespread in Indochina and the Far East (Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, Burma, the Republic of China, the Republic of Korea, Japan). In Japan and Taiwan, M101A1 howitzers were produced under license. In several countries, these howitzers have been modernized (for example, by turning into self-propelled guns, as in the Republic of Korea), but the modernization of the M101 is a topic for a separate story — Well, and a few words, Mr. Professor, about the present of these howitzers. — M101's career is gradually coming to an end. But even in the 21st century, this howitzer continues to serve to protect democracy. Ukraine received 18 such howitzers in September 2022. Their path to our Armed Forces was winding: the Americans at one time gave these howitzers to Denmark, and in 2002 they gave them to Lithuania, and twenty years later, the Lithuanians gave the M101A1 to Ukraine. The Ukrainian M101A1 made its combat debut in November 2022, and this howitzer was officially adopted by the Armed Forces of Ukraine on August 28, 2023. 71 separate hunting brigades are known to use these systems. In one of its previous materials, ArmyInform told about the service of these guns in the Armed Forces of Ukraine and how they are evaluated by our garmaty.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/13/gaubyczya-m101a1-istoriya-garmaty-rekordsmenky/	2024-09-12T20:11:21-07:00
How many rockets are needed to bring down the Crimean bridge: an expert on air defense of the Russia...	Military expert Petro Chernyk told ArmyInform about this. — Today, there is a question as to what the air defense of Crimea is in terms of cover by anti-aircraft missile systems. Indeed, at the moment it is much denser and better than the cover in Moscow, the military expert notes. According to him, almost all complexes are concentrated in Crimea, starting with a small radius of action, that is, for example, such as OSA, to the most modern S-300, S-400. And there is already confirmed information that their very rare S-500 complexes, of which there are 16 units in total, will be deployed there. This complex declares a target interception range of up to 600 kilometers at a speed of 3,000 meters per second - here we are talking about the target. Chernyk reminds that the speed of ATACMS missile is 1500 meters per second. — Why does the enemy act in this way? Because there is a problem with the Crimean Bridge. We are well aware that in order for the Crimean bridge to fall, it must be attacked by no less than 60-70 ballistic missiles. These are the same ATACMS. Or, let's say, now there is news that the development of our Ukrainian ballistic missiles of the Grom-2 type continues. In fact, there is nothing new here, but this work is ongoing, the expert adds. Chernyk says that there must be a large number of drones in this component: - And the total salvo for the bridge to really fall should be no less than 100-120 units of the appropriate equipment. the Russians are well aware that as soon as the bridge falls, Crimea will suffocate in terms of logistics. 90% of everything that is transported to Crimea is transported by rail. Petro Chernyk notes that it is becoming more and more difficult for the enemy to deliver (cargo. — Ed.) by barges. — Especially since we already have very good news that we even started sinking barges. Therefore, the enemy concentrated a huge amount of everything in the Crimea. At the same time, over the past six months, we have at least 5 cases of confirmation of the destruction of both the radar systems that provide the same S-400 anti-aircraft missile systems, as well as the destruction of the launchers themselves. And, so far, there is no confirmed information that the old ATACMS, which entered service in 1989, were successfully intercepted by the air defense system of the Russian Federation in Crimea, the expert emphasized. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/13/skilky-raket-potribno-shhob-upav-krymskyj-mist-ekspert-pro-protypovitryanu-oboronu-rf/	2024-09-12T20:00:52-07:00

During the meeting, they discussed the implementation of the bilateral security agreement signed in February this year in Lviv, as well as ways to develop cooperation in the field of joint production of weapons. Volodymyr Zelenskyi also thanked Denmark for its participation in the reconstruction of Ukraine, in particular for patronage over the reconstruction of Mykolaiv and the region.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/12/vyrobnycztvo-zbroyi-ta-potreby-zsu-volodymyr-zelenskyj-zustrivsya-z-delegacziyu-parlamentu-daniyi/	2024-09-12T11:43:31-07:00
In the Limansky direction, the enemy is increasing the use of systems -Solntsepok-	A serviceman of the 60th Separate Mechanized Brigade, Bohdan, told about this on Army TV. -The enemy is trying to increase the pressure, but they have problems that they cannot solve, first and foremost is the morale of their soldiers,- he said. The serviceman also said that it is very common among Russians to use Esmarch tourniquets instead of tourniquets for wounds, even among special forces. As reported by ArmyInform, the occupiers the positions of the units of the Defense Forces in Zaporizhzhia are heavily bombarded with artillery, airstrikes, strike drones and drops from copters. In view of this, the Ukrainian defenders must move and set up new positions in other places. This was the case, in particular, in the Orihiv direction.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/12/na-lymanskomu-napryamku-vorog-zbilshuye-vykorystannya-system-solnczepok/	2024-09-12T11:31:21-07:00

The citizen was notified of suspicion of unauthorized distribution information on the deployment of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (Part 2 of Article 114-2 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine). -According to the investigation, in March 2024, a resident of the village Tatyanivka of Sviatohirska TG communicated via Viber with her friend, who left for the Russian Federation after the full-scale invasion of the occupiers. During numerous conversations, the man spread military information to her. He learned these data during walks around the settlement, as well as from neighbors. In particular, in the text messages, the suspect indicated the locations of the bases of the armed forces and the location of Ukrainian military units in the village,- the prosecutor's office said. Currently he has been remanded in custody. The sanction of the article provides for punishment in the form of imprisonment for a term of 5 to 8 years. How reported ArmyInform, the counterintelligence of the Security Service thwarted new attempts by the military intelligence of the Russian Federation to get up-to-date data on the defense of Zaporozhye.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/12/lyubyv-progulyanky-ta-lystuvatysya-z-rosijskoyu-rozvidkoyu-teper-za-gratamy/	2024-09-12T11:19:47-07:00
Seven people were injured as a result of airstrikes in Kharkiv and its suburbs	This was notified in the State Emergency Service. As a result of the shelling, residential buildings were damaged, and there are injured people. In one of the private houses, two women and an 11-year-old child were blocked due to damage to the front door. Emergency workers helped people get out. Rescue workers, pyrotechnicians and psychologists of the State Emergency Service worked at the scene. The Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office reported that from 16:45 to 17:00 Russian troops carried out a series of air strikes on Kharkiv and its suburbs. The occupiers also struck the territory of -Ekopark- in the village with an air munition. Forests of the Malodanyliva community. There were no injuries at the scene of the impact. Trees and a fence were damaged. From the recovered debris, the law enforcement officers have previously determined that the enemy used the FAB-250 from the UMPK for shelling. As reported by ArmyInform, at noon on September 12, the occupiers shelled the village of Borov, Izyum district, Kharkiv region, for the second time in a day. The occupiers targeted the rescuers of the State Emergency Service, who were eliminating the consequences of the previous shelling. As a result of repeated Russian shelling 2 people died, another 7 were injured, including 3 rescuers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/12/sim-lyudej-postrazhdaly-vnaslidok-aviaudariv-po-harkovu-ta-peredmistyu/	2024-09-12T10:56:26-07:00

Captain Dmytro Lykhovii, spokesman for the Tavria Military Academy, told about this on the air of the national telethon -Yedini Novyni- . — Positions are exposed to significant combined fire intensity. Even taking into account the fact that there is a fairly wide gray area, and the battles are of a positional nature, our units have to leave some positions because they are simply burned out, destroyed, he said. In view of this, the Ukrainian defenders must move and set up new positions in other places. This was the case, in particular, in the Orihiv direction. — The statistics of damage to Russian personnel and Russian equipment testify to the increase in the intensity of hostilities. Yesterday, 69 people were destroyed or disabled in other ways - these are irrevocable, sanitary and captives together, the spokesman said. Also, 42 units of weapons and military equipment of the Russian occupiers were destroyed and damaged in the operational zone of the -Tavria- air defense system. — There is something to brag about here, because in the Gulyajpil direction, where hostilities have not been taking place on the ground since mid-August, we managed to hit one tank and 3 armored fighting vehicles, Dmytro Lykhovi noted. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in the South, Ukrainian FPV drones destroy reconnaissance drones of the occupiers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/12/na-zaporizkomu-napryamku-posylylys-vorozhi-obstrily-syly-oborony-oblashtovuyut-novi-pozycziyi/	2024-09-12T10:23:40-07:00
46 units of enemy equipment: the paratroopers repelled four waves of assaults during the day	A video of the successful work was published on the brigade's Facebook page. -On September 12, the Russian occupiers thought of setting another record. Four waves of assaults from 5:45 a.m. to noon on the positions of the battalions of our brigade should, according to the enemy's plan, break through the defense of the Ukrainian paratroopers,- the brigade reported. Tanks, armored personnel carriers, infantry fighting vehicles, infantry on motorcycles - in general, the occupiers used 46 units of armored and not so vehicles. -And the record was set! Such a number of destroyed and damaged enemy equipment in one day in the direction of responsibility of the 46th brigade has never really happened,- the post says. Out of 46 targets, the paratroopers destroyed 15 units (9 BMPs, 2 tanks, 2 armored personnel carriers and 2 motorcycles) and disabled 11 BMPs with accurate fire from all available means of destruction. -Whoever of the enemies managed to nudge their heels in time, consider them lucky - they will live longer.

Cruise missiles -minimaly-: an American start-up offered the Pentagon a new ammunition	The startup Ares Industries, named after the Greek god of war, was only founded in May 2024. However, on the portal of the California startup center Y Combinator the other day there was posted a message that the engineers of this company have already started flight tests of compact and inexpensive cruise missiles from this manufacturer, ArmiyaInform reports. The missiles are being developed primarily for use against ships and will, according to Ares, be -ten times smaller and ten times cheaper- than any currently known model. Anti-ship missiles now weigh more than a ton and cost several million dollars each. Ares plans to sell its rockets for $300,000 per unit. Ares Industries details its developments in a release. The entire summer was spent building several prototypes and testing them in the Mojave Desert. As a result of these tests, the first batch is already being prepared for the delivery of operational missiles to customers, which is planned to be carried out by mid-2025. According to Ares representatives, cruise missiles should be compatible with existing launch platforms and move at a high subsonic speed (the speed of sound is about 1,200 km/h). Developers want to focus on land and ship options, that is, those that are launched from vehicles or warships. In the future, airborne versions and variants with a longer flight range will also appear. Ares does not provide any information about the range of the first version, only stating that it is several hundred miles (that is, no less than 322 kilometers). This California-based startup's rendering shows anti-ship missiles similar to Lockheed Martin's AGM-158C LRASM. Long-range anti-ship missiles (LRASM) have stealth characteristics. Individual cruise missiles can communicate with each other and use artificial intelligence to bypass air defense measures. Their range is 370 kilometers. The updated version, which is planned to be introduced by the US Navy in 2026, is expected to have a range of 950 kilometers. However, AGM-158C LRASMs are quite expensive. The price per unit is about $3 million.The US Navy and Air Force together want to buy more than 1,000 AGM-158Cs by 2030. Ares Industries believes that its anti-ship missiles could hypothetically be used against China in the Pacific Ocean. However, recent conflicts in the Middle East have shown that American weapons are too expensive. Current US anti-ship missiles are designed to attack destroyers. However, it makes no sense to attack smaller frigates or even drone boats with millions of dollars worth of remotely controlled weapons. In a possible conflict in the Pacific, the United States would launch thousands of anti-ship missiles a week, depleting the stockpile in days. -We cannot produce enough anti-ship missiles to counter China,- the company said. Another benefit of Ares Industries' approach is the ability to perform so-called saturation attacks. During such group attacks, the enemy's defense systems are suppressed by a huge number of missiles and drones. However, the weapons with which these attacks are carried out must be correspondingly cheap. And size plays a role, too. Warships have limited space in their missile launchers. For example, if an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer's Mk-41 launcher has room for 96 LRASM cruise missiles, it can at least theoretically carry and launch 960 smaller Ares missiles instead. Then a single destroyer could hit the enemy fleet with nearly a thousand anti-ship missiles. The goal is not only to cause material damage to the enemy. In the second wave of attacks, larger rounds and cruise missiles may be launched. They have a better chance of achieving their goal, because the air defenses are already weakened by Shahed drones or need to be reloaded with ammunition and anti-aircraft missiles, and therefore are not yet ready to repulse an enemy attack. The Pentagon's profile program also shows that the US wants to increase the production of small and cheap weapons. As part of this initiative, thousands of small unmanned autonomous drones will be developed by 2025 and will use artificial intelligence. Defense companies, especially startups, are also joining this trend. Anduril Industries, a company created by Oculus co-founder Palmer Luckey, recently announced that it will build a -hyperscale- manufacturing facility to create large-scale autonomous weapons systems such as drones or autonomous underwater vehicles. <iframe loading=-lazy- title=-What Do The Navy's Ship-Launched Missiles Actually Cost?- width=-640- height=-360- src=-https://www.youtube.com/embed/47BDvAuKRHc?start=271&amp;feature=oembed- frameborder=-0- allow=-accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write ; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share=-strict-origin-when-cross-origin- Comparative evaluation of the US Navy.

Counter-intelligence of the SBU exposed attempts by the Russian Federation to obtain data on the def...	About informs Security Service of Ukraine. The enemy agent turned out to be a local IT specialist who worked for a staff member of the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces (better known as Gru). On the instructions of the occupier, the suspect set up an -observation post- in his own apartment to covertly monitor the locations of the Defense Forces. To do this, the informant purchased and installed tactical binoculars with a high magnification, a rangefinder grid and a compass in the apartment of a multi-story building. With the help of specialized optics, the person involved hoped to detect the positions of air defense and Ukrainian artillery, in particular HIMARS rocket artillery systems. The attacker also tracked the routes of military convoys and the location of Defense Forces fortifications. He transmitted the information he received to his Russian curator through an anonymous chat in the messenger. According to the informant's coordinates, the occupiers planned to carry out a new series of missile and drone strikes on the front-line territory of the region. The security service exposed the enemy henchman early and detained him in his own apartment. Prior to that, comprehensive measures were taken to secure the locations of Ukrainian troops. During searches of the detainee's premises, optics and a mobile phone, which he used in his criminal activities, were seized. -Investigators of the Security Service informed him of the suspicion under Part 2 of Art. 114-2 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (unauthorized dissemination of information about the movement, movement or location of the Armed Forces with the possibility of their identification in the locality with the purpose of providing such information to the state that is carrying out armed aggression against Ukraine),- the message says. The perpetrator is in custody. He faces up to 8 years in prison. The special operation was carried out by SBU employees in the Zaporizhzhia region under the procedural guidance of the regional prosecutor's office. As reported by ArmyInform, life imprisonment threatens the spy who gave away the positions of the Ukrainian artillery.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/12/kontrrozvidka-sbu-vykryla-sproby-rf-otrymaty-dani-pro-oboronu-zaporizhzhya/	2024-09-12T03:39:55-07:00
Creation of technical requirements for turnstiles according to NATO standards: a new development of ...	It is about this informs September 12. -Within the limits of this process, the Department of Health of the Ministry of Defense (DOH) focused on the established requirements for tourniquets of the rotary and lever type, occlusive thoracic bandages, as well as methodologies for assessing their compliance with international standards,- the report says. To implement this task, the Ministry of Defense actively cooperates with international partners, in particular with the NATO Combat Trauma Committee (CoTCCC). The DOZ is studying the best practices of NATO member countries, initiating requests to the defense attaché at Ukrainian embassies regarding the quality standards of hemostatic tourniquets. On the basis of the received data, the department analyzed its own capabilities for the development of technical and functional requirements for mechanical products to stop bleeding. In addition, the Ministry of Defense has applied to the NATO Science &amp; Technology Organization to receive a grant to create a laboratory for testing and testing of tourniquets and first aid equipment. -Providing our army with modern, standardized medical equipment is at the top of our priorities. Our task is to make pre-medical care on the battlefield as effective as possible by adapting and implementing advanced international standards,- said Oksana Sukhorukova, head of the Health Department of the IOU. According to her, the development of requirements for turnstiles and their certification according to NATO standards is key to their strategy. -It's not just a procedure, it's about our commitment to providing every soldier with real-time, life-saving tools on the frontline,- she noted. Another important step was the adoption of order No. 436 dated June 29, 2024 -On approval of the Volumes of pre-medical care provided during hostilities and training of Security Forces and Defense Forces on a tactical basis.- According to it, the skill of using a tourniquet is mandatory at all levels of training in home care. The Ministry of Defense also cooperates with the Main Department of Doctrine and Training of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on updating the training programs of servicemen. In particular, the Department proposed to make changes to the basic military training program (BZVP), which will contribute to increasing the effectiveness of the training of servicemen in the field of pre-medical care. As reported by ArmyInform, earlier the delegations of the Ministry of Defense and NATO ->discussed speeding up the promised aid to Ukraine from allies. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/12/stvorennya-tehnichnyh-vymog-do-turniketiv-za-standartamy-nato-nova-rozrobka-minoborony/	2024-09-12T03:27:44-07:00
-Your family will leave you, son-: Russia throws conscripts into battle in the Kharkiv Region	This was reported by the spokesman of the operative-tactical group -Kharkiv-, Colonel Vitaly Sarantsev. The next step may be the start of a large-scale mobilization campaign in the Russian Federation. — The significant losses suffered by the enemy in the Kharkiv direction, more than ten thousand people only in our operational zone in four months, forced Russia to look for additional resources to continue the war. Russian legislation does not prohibit enlisting conscript soldiers for combat operations after they have completed four months of service, so it is possible to predict their appearance in other areas as well, he noted. According to the spokesman, this may indicate a lack of military personnel in Russian units, as a result of which the military command is forced to use less experienced soldiers for combat missions. Voyskovyi added that Russian propaganda had already warmed up society to such a development, tested its reaction, which predictably turned out to be zero, so the next steps should be expected - the start of a large-scale mobilization campaign in Russia. ArmyInform previously reported that in the Kharkiv region, Russia is fighting with poorly trained soldiers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/12/rodyna-tyebya-brosit-synok-rosiya-kydaye-v-bij-strokovykiv-na-harkivshhyni/	2024-09-12T03:12:18-07:00

The First Ukrainian-Polish Forum of Defense Industries was held within the framework of the exhibition. The delegation of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry was headed by the Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Oleksandr Serhiy. Its composition included specialists in separate clusters of weapons and military equipment of the Ground Forces and the Air Force. The Ukrainian delegation held a number of meetings with representatives of military departments of individual countries and world defense concerns. Within the framework of the international arms exhibition, technical discussions were held with the world's leading manufacturers of weapons and military equipment from the USA, Norway, Finland, France, Australia, Great Britain, Poland and other countries. The Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine thanked the Allies for their large-scale support in the fight against Russian aggression and informed about the urgent needs of the Defense Forces of Ukraine to strengthen their capabilities on the ground and in the air. Among the priorities are air defense systems, unmanned systems for various purposes, means of radio-electronic warfare, ammunition and individual components for their production in Ukraine. The issue of organizing the repair of foreign samples of weapons and military equipment in Ukraine was also discussed. -I heard assurances from many of our partners regarding the continued support of Ukraine in the war with Russia. According to the results of the meetings with the representatives of the defense departments, in particular, Norway and Canada, the issue of preparation and conclusion of agreements on cooperation in the field of armaments was agreed upon,- said the deputy head of the defense department at the end of the trip. According to the words of the Deputy Minister of Defense, there was a conversation about the need to intensify work to meet the needs of the Defense Forces of Ukraine, as well as regarding the implementation of important projects for the long-term support of our army. -In view of the situation on the front lines, significant volumes of weapons production at Russian military-industrial complex factories, the supply of ammunition to the Russian Federation from North Korea and Iran, the Kremlin seeks to further destroy and kill. Therefore, we need to significantly strengthen the capabilities of the Defense Forces. Russian terror must be stopped by the powerful response of the Ukrainian army and the important decisions of our allies,- Oleksandr Serhii noted. According to our allies, Russia's war against Ukraine has become the greatest challenge to modern security policy. Russia continues to wage war and threatens not only Ukraine. Consolidating the efforts of democratic countries, increasing military aid to Ukraine is crucial in view of today's threats. In order for our army to be stronger in the fight against the aggressor, we ask our allies to create joint military enterprises, as well as to buy weapons for the Armed Forces from domestic manufacturers. Every euro invested in Ukrainian -defense- enterprises is an investment in European security. As reported by ArmyInform, the delegations of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine and the USA discussed the expansion of defense cooperation.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/12/mizhnarodna-pidtrymka-dlya-ukrayiny-obgovoreno-novi-ugody-pro-spivpraczyu-v-sferi-ozbroyennya/	2024-09-12T02:20:08-07:00

The head of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs lied again: about what this time	This happened after participation in the Strategic Dialogue between the Russian Federation and the Cooperation Council of the Arab States of the Persian Gulf. The head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation said: -We never wanted someone else's land. We wanted people who are part of the -Russian world- to be treated humanely. This absurd and false statement by Lavrov shows that the Russian government is generally detached from reality and lives in its own -bubble-. The whole world knows that the Russian Federation is an occupier and an invader. If Russia did not seek to seize someone else's land, then why did it change its own constitution to include six administrative-territorial units of Ukraine? Moreover, Russia cynically destroys precisely those regions where the Russian-speaking population mainly lived. According to the Office of the Prosecutor General, during the period of the large-scale invasion, as of September 10, almost 150,000 crimes of aggression and war crimes against the Russian Federation, more than 18,000 crimes against national security, and more than 2,000 crimes against children were registered. I wonder if, according to Lavrov's sick logic, after the liberation of part of the Kursk region, where the government of the Russian Federation refused to ensure the interests of its own citizens, Russia itself has the right to be territorially intact?	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/12/ochilnyk-mzs-rosiyi-znovu-zbrehav-pro-shho-czogo-razu/	2024-09-11T20:20:55-07:00
Leading cities and what will be new in the fall: how the recruiting campaign in Ukraine continues. I...	What are the most in-demand positions today? But in the end, do recruiting centers solve the problem of the lack of people in the army? ArmiyaInform asked about all this during a blitz interview with Oleksiy Bezhevets, the authorized representative of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine on recruiting issues. — A few numbers: how many open recruiting centers do we have as of the beginning of September? What cities are in the plans? — The network is developing. We currently have 34 recruiting centers. Kraynaya was opened in Uman, before that there was Chernivtsi. There are, of course, plans to open new recruiting centers. As always, we do not announce the city: first we open, then we talk about it. But about 10 more such centers are in the process of preparation. Currently, we have literally a few regions left in Ukraine where centers are not yet present. And in all these regions, preparatory work is underway. Moreover, we are talking not only about regional centers, but also district ones, where the local authorities, in cooperation with us, have decided that it is advisable to do this. Therefore, by the end of October, at most in November, there will not be a single region of Ukraine without a Ukrainian army recruiting center. At the end of autumn, there will be at least 40 of them, as I can see from the dynamics at the moment. As for statistics, more than 16,000 people applied to recruiting centers as of the beginning of September. That is, all these people received counseling. Yes, there are a certain number of people who could not find vacancies for one reason or another: either quite specific requirements, or a specific profile of the corresponding candidate, which may not be suitable for military service, or some other specific characteristics. After all, the part determines whether the candidate is suitable for the vacant position and whether the part wants to see a person with the corresponding characteristics in him. Therefore, we are now simultaneously launching the process of reviewing the status of those candidates who have not been selected for vacancies, but who have taken the initiative and voluntarily decided to join the ranks of the Defense Forces. The goal: to work additionally with everyone who has expressed a desire, but has not yet been able to become a military serviceman. We also have an active communication campaign, which will now be intensified in various channels: outdoor advertising, additional online activities, etc. Information influence plays a role because coverage and communication with communities gives us an influx of new candidates interested in positions in the military. When these communication activities subside and new information waves roll in, people forget that there is such an opportunity and live in their information bubble. Our task is to enter this information bubble and tell people about the unique opportunity to choose a position and part on their own. And then help make a choice, don't miss the chance, because the mobilization processes are ongoing. —Which city shows the most effective result in the context of people's appeals to the recruiting center? — We have four such cities: Kyiv, Lviv, Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia. By all indicators, these are the leaders, although there are also small cities, such as Shostka. This is a small town that has organized all these processes in a cool way, and they have great results. From the point of view of the efficiency of the centers even in small cities, this is already a definite plus, they perform their work, spending minimal resources and performing very important functions for the state. Yes, let even one recruiter work there. But if he recruits even 10 volunteers motivated to protect the Motherland of people, then this is already arch-class. And if there is already such an opportunity in a small community, and people have been helped, it is important. Because every person is a separate destiny. And we helped define and shape this destiny so that a person finds himself in the protection of the Motherland. —Which recruiting center and where was the most difficult to open from an organizational point of view? Is there resistance from local authorities in this process? And which region is the friendliest? We have wonderful people, and each region really has its own specifics (smiles. Ed.). Yes, there are nuances during the opening. Someone has different standards, approaches in work, business processes, communication culture, etc. Yes, in some places the processes were more complicated, in some - the processes went as quickly as possible. There are centers that we open literally within a week, and there are regions where preparation takes months. And it seems the same result, but the effort spent on this process is many times more. —What are your expectations-forecasts for the recruitment campaign of autumn 2024? — We continue to open centers, several per month. Maybe there will be an opening every week. Now we will see the dynamics in the degree of readiness. Up to 10 recruitment centers are planned to open in the next three months. We are also planning online activities at the same time: the process of creating a recruiting center in online mode is underway. This is a recruiting model where recruiters will proactively and exclusively online communicate with people and offer them certain vacancies in the Defense Forces. That is, we are talking about the proactive position of the center: we see a person who is looking for a job, his resume is posted on a website with vacancies. And we are the first to call and offer service in the Defense Forces and a position that is as close as possible to the position a person is looking for. Also, by the end of September, we plan to launch a hotline so that people can call, consult, voice complaints, etc. We hope to maintain the momentum in terms of volunteer requests in the fall, and it will only grow. We also want to provide physical support for candidates at all stages of registration to the ranks of the Defense Forces. We are currently discussing this with one of the recruiting centers of the Armed Forces centers. We are currently working out the details of how it should work and what it will look like. This is done so that the person is calm that there is a military man next to him, who will guide him -by the hand-, relatively speaking, through all the rooms, help with all the questions that have arisen: regarding VLK, processing documents, personal affairs, etc. And it will be a soldier -in the system- who communicates in the same language with other soldiers. We hope to launch such a service soon. Let's start with Kyiv and the region. In addition, we are preparing an approach to certain categories of people who, for example, are suitable for military service, but with certain restrictions. Such people now have the opportunity to join the service. And for such military personnel, we are developing a mechanism for creating a list of vacancies where, according to the law, they can serve, there are units that are ready to accept such people and ensure that these people actually return to military life. Such a separate initiative is also currently being developed. We will also go further in the future. Perhaps we will start with Kyiv: so that a person who decides to recruit can come to Kyiv, he will be provided with temporary housing and food while he solves organizational issues. And specialists will help her to complete documents at the TCC, and so that she can go to the training center to learn military affairs in a calm manner. In addition, the approval of changes in normative documents, Cabinet resolutions, which provide for the possibility of military units to directly register a recruit without the participation of the TCC, for the period of martial law, is currently ending. This is an exception in order to simplify the process of a person entering the army as much as possible. I hope that by the end of September these changes will be accepted and will come into force. —How many vacancies in the Defense Forces are we talking about as of the beginning of September? — According to our internal database, it is about 4,000 vacancies. Plus the online database on four online job search platforms — about 10,000 more. Yes, the mosaic of vacancies in the Defense Forces is huge. And a quality search gives a cool conversion: a person who applied and is eligible for military service can actually find a good job for himself. —Which professions/positions are currently the most in demand? — Every week there are spikes for certain positions. Yes, a large number of applications were, for example, for reconnaissance. There was a separate period when gunners were looking for positions. Always relevant - UAV operators. There is also a demand for staff positions, clerks, and the IT field. —Have there been cases when citizens turn to recruiting centers with the goal of signing a contract, rather than mobilizing? — Yes. Today, that ratio is roughly 40 to 60 or 60 to 40, and the figure fluctuates from month to month. —Do recruiting centers solve the problem of lack of people in the army? — Yes, there is a trend. The situation has improved significantly (in fact, since the end of spring) with the manning of military units. Yes, there are still not enough people, but the situation has improved. The role of recruiting centers in this is essential, because a large percentage of people who join the ranks of the Defense Forces every month are volunteers. These are thousands of people every month who used this new algorithm: took a letter of recommendation, found a part and went to serve there. And there are many such people. —How do young people react to recruiting centers? Your subjective observations. — If we take global statistics, then, unfortunately, we have the following indicators regarding the demographic situation: people who were born in the 90s or at the beginning of the 2000s are simply significantly less than those who who were born in the 70s, for example. But young people also turn to recruiting centers. We explain to them that they have the opportunity to conclude a contract for one year, they are not subject to mobilization, will have the opportunity to enter a higher military educational institution, receive the rank of officer, etc. It can be a ticket to life. Yes, young people are applying, and we perfectly understand that a lot needs to be done in this area, and a lot is already being done in this area. —Do women turn to recruiting centers— what is the trend? What positions are they looking for? Who are they in civilian life? - They apply, and there are a lot of them. In Sumy region, for example, a third of the candidates with whom work is being done on job selection are from women. One in three appeals is from a woman. And the potential is just huge. A woman in the army is not necessarily only a cook, a clerk, a lawyer or a journalist. In fact, there are no legal restrictions. A woman can also get professional training for almost any position in the army and perform her duties. A large number of units are very loyal and recruit women. Moreover, for different positions: snipers, UAV operators, medics. And Chernihiv region is also a regional leader in terms of the number of women applying to recruiting centers. —Portrait of a citizen of Ukraine who applies to a recruiting center,— what is he like? Each person is a separate universe. And to make the -average temperature in the room- would probably be wrong. I don't want to speculate (smiles. — Ed).

Two F-16s collided during a simulated battle, one pilot survived: from NATO history	The fatal incident occurred over the Greek island of Karpathos in the Aegean Sea in the context of the Aegean dispute, a conflict between two NATO member states over sovereignty and related rights in the Aegean Sea and the airspace above it. Reconstruction of a simulated dogfight between Greek and Turkish F-16s On 23 May 2006 around 12:40 local time, the Greek Air Force raised a pair of F-16 fighters to the interception of a pair of Turkish Air Force F-16s escorting an RF-4E Phantom reconnaissance aircraft over the Aegean Sea. The mission of the Turkish spy was most likely to photograph the S-300 air defense systems deployed on the island of Crete. Greek fighter pilots were ordered to intercept planes of the Turkish Air Force and to prevent them from approaching the coast of the island and taking aerial photographs of Greek objects. After the interception, Greek and Turkish fighter pilots resorted to a simulated aerial battle. The pilots of both countries strove to win by recording a conditional defeat of the enemy with the help of instruments. Maneuvering in dangerous proximity to each other, the Greek and Turkish fighter jets collided at an altitude of about 8,000 meters above sea level at a distance of 12 miles from the coast of the island of Karpathos. By <a target=-_blank- rel=-nofollow- href=-https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030232/http:/vasington.be.mfa.gov.tr/ShowAnnouncement.aspx?ID=115955 According to the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a Greek fighter jet attacked a Turkish F-16 from behind and below, which led to a collision between the two planes. The impact caused an explosion that was devastating to both air machines. The collision was witnessed by the crew of Egyptian Airlines flight 797 from Cairo to Vienna, whose pilot informed the control center in Athens that during the flight at an altitude of about 10,000 meters above sea level, he saw a flash about 600 meters below his plane. The rescue missions of both countries immediately went to the scene of the plane crash, hoping that both pilots managed to eject. Greek Super Puma and Turkish Cougar search and rescue helicopters participated in the rescue mission. However, only one of the two pilots was able to eject successfully - Turkish Air Force Lieutenant Halil Ibrahim Ozdemir. He was lucky the second time when he was accidentally spotted by sailors in the merchant navy. At a distance of about 100 miles from the Turkish coast, it was picked up by the Panamanian merchant ship Gas Century of the Japanese company Yamamaru. Greek Air Force pilot Konstantinos Iliakis did not manage to save himself - as a result of the impact, the cockpit of his F-16 was destroyed, so he could not eject normally. The search for the Greek pilot turned out to be fruitless. The sailors of the frigate Λήμνος managed to find only the Greek pilot's helmet and a survival kit with Greek markings. According to Greek media reports, Konstantinos Iliakis was one of the most experienced F-16 pilots who was trained in the US and had many flight hours. The incident caused a major crisis and led to heightened tensions between official Athens and Ankara, with the Greek and Turkish sides traditionally blaming each other for the disaster. In the end, Greece and Turkey toned down accusatory rhetoric and defused the conflict, but failed to settle it. Despite the fact that both countries are part of the North Atlantic Alliance, their disputes in the Mediterranean continue. To date, the Turkish-Greek conflict is the only one in which F-16s have suffered officially confirmed air combat losses. In addition to the May 23, 2006 crash, there were other incidents over the Aegean Sea that resulted in the downing of these fighters.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/12/dva-f-16-zitknulys-pid-chas-imitacziyi-boyu-vyzhyv-odyn-pilot-z-istoriyi-nato/	2024-09-11T20:00:11-07:00

How foreigners fight - told the GUR	He reported this on the air of Channel 24. The GUR noted that volunteers from different countries of the world, who came to Ukraine at the call of President Volodymyr Zelensky, formed the International Legion of the GUR MOU at the beginning of a full-scale invasion. They took part in all key campaigns at the front: Kyiv region, Kharkiv region, Kherson region, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk and Luhansk regions. -If we talk about foreigners, these are people who usually have a lot of military service experience in their countries and combat experience in other wars. We have servicemen for whom this is already the fifth or sixth war,- Volodymyr said. According to him, all foreigners without exception, even American Rangers or Navy SEALs, must go through a stage of training, standardization and other processes that help adapt to our realities. -When our candidates write to us with a desire to join the unit, we always tell them: 'Guys, no matter how experienced you are, no one is ready for such a war as here,'- explained the representative of the International Legion of the GUR. The HUR noted that the working language in the Legion is English, but servicemen from other countries also learn Ukrainian. -Many foreigners attend Ukrainian courses and learn our language quite effectively.

OUV -Tavria-: the Russians changed the directions of assaults in the Orichiv and Dnieper directions	About this on the air Army TV, the spokesman of the OUV said - Tavria- captain Dmytro Lykhovii. -The Russians are putting the most pressure on the Dnieper region, where increased activity has been observed for several days in a row compared to recent weeks,- Dmytro Lykhova said. According to him, during the last five days there were 46 attempts of assaults and four more attempts today. The geographical nature of this pressure has changed somewhat. -If earlier they stormed the left bank of the Dnieper in the area of ​​the village of Krynki, a little further north, where our units retreated after they left this completely destroyed settlement, then in the last few days the assaults have been on various islands along a large stretch of the left bank.- he said. The occupiers operate east of Krynok and closer to Kherson itself, where there is a large and fairly wide gray area. -Probably, they gathered courage and started to try to capture this gray area. But they do not succeed, assault actions are not successful,- the spokesman added. In the Orihiv direction, the enemy has also changed the point of effort and is trying to press not only on the Robotynsky ledge in the area of ​​Robotyny and Malaya Tokmachka, but also further west closer to Zaporizhzhia in the area of ​​the village of Mali Shcherbaki. -This is also a de-occupied territory that was liberated as a result of the 2023 counteroffensive, and now the Russians have renewed pressure there. -Several assaults take place every day, in particular with the support of aviation,- Dmytro Lykhova added. As reported by ArmyInform, in the Kurakhiv direction, the Russian troops are storming in small groups and have almost not used armored vehicles in recent days. pro-demonstraczijni-ataky-rosiyan-na-kurahivskomu-napryamku/->conducting demonstration attacks.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/11/ouv-tavriya-rosiyany-zminyly-napryamky-shturmiv-na-orihivskomu-ta-prydniprovskomu-napryamkah/	2024-09-11T11:41:08-07:00

Rustem Umyerov: Our goal is to return every piece of Ukrainian land, including Crimea	The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine reported this. -For me, this is not just a business meeting or an opportunity to communicate with international partners. This is my personal struggle. Crimea is my home, and every day I, like millions of Ukrainians, feel the pain of the Russian occupation for my state and for our people on the peninsula,- said Rustem Umyerov. He emphasized that Russia uses our land for missile attacks, turning the peninsula into a springboard for aggression against Ukraine. -Therefore, Crimea is a key battlefield for our freedom. And we will not stop until we bring him home,- the Minister of Defense emphasized. He reminded that over the past year, thanks to long-range weapons, Ukraine changed the balance of power in the Black Sea and created a -grain corridor- independent of Russia, through which more than 5,000 ships passed. Defense forces destroyed 24 Russian ships, regained control of Snake Island and deployed the world's first drone swarm technology to counter the Russian fleet. -Our next step is to ensure security in the entire Black Sea region. As part of strengthening our maritime capabilities at the last Ramstein, we signed the Maritime Capabilities Coalition with our partners. This will provide us with additional support in protecting our internal waters and Ukraine's interests in international maritime waters,- said Rustem Umyerov. He added that our goal remains the same — to return every piece of Ukrainian land, including Crimea. -We are getting closer to this goal, in particular, thanks to such meetings as the Crimean Platform. Glory to Ukraine!- said the Minister of Defense. As reported by ArmyInform, President Volodymyr Zelenskyi during a speech at the summit of the Crimean Platform -prezydent-na-samiti-krymskoyi-platformy/-> declared that Ukraine will return all temporarily occupied territories and all citizens of our state.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/11/rustem-umyerov-nasha-meta-povernuty-kozhen-klaptyk-ukrayinskoyi-zemli-vklyuchno-z-krymom/	2024-09-11T11:18:46-07:00
In Volyn, a former official organized the escape of evaders for $5,000	About this informs the Security Service of Ukraine. According to the case materials, the former deputy head of the Volyn Regional Military Administration was involved in the organization of the raid. During her tenure at the OVA, the suspect set up a mechanism for the escape of evaders in the guise of drivers transporting humanitarian goods. The cost of such a -service- was up to 5,000 US dollars per client. To implement the -scheme-, the organizer involved the director of a local charity fund, which arranged international flights for conscript drivers. In this way, the personal data of conscripts was entered into the -Shlyah- information system, which allowed them to go abroad as -volunteers-. In order to find potential customers and transfer money, the person involved involved seven more accomplices. The SBU employees documented the criminal actions of the participants of the event and detained the organizer. During the searches, mobile phones and laptops with evidence of illegal activity were seized from the premises of the accused.

Currently, it is precisely on our part of the front in the Marin community that the enemy has been conducting infantry assaults for the past few days, the equipment is being used in a limited mode,- said Orest Drymalovskyi. He also said that the enemy is in a certain sense carrying out demonstration actions, tanks, BMPs and infantry are leaving. -But as soon as they enter the line of attack, our artillery starts working, they immediately turn around. Obviously, the enemy wants to identify our firing positions,- &#8211; explained the speaker. According to him, the enemy is also carrying out assaults in the direction of the village of Kostyantynivka, mostly infantry. -Our paratroopers repulse them, our drones practice with -maviks- with drops.- Today, six occupiers were killed, 11 were wounded,- he said. As reported by ArmyInform, since the beginning of the day, invaders our units were attacked 14 times. They tried to advance near Kostyantynivka, Ukranian and Georgiivka.

Without training and motivation: in the Kharkiv region, Russia is fighting with poorly trained soldi...	Colonel Vitaly Sarantsev, the spokesman of Kharkiv OTU, announced this on the air of the nationwide telethon -Yedini Novyni- . — This is a newly arrived personnel recruited by Russia — an existing mobilization resource has been raised. It is not yet known for sure who it is. These may be some ex-prisoners or representatives of foreign countries. In particular, there used to be people from Central Asia, Africa or the Middle East, he said. The spokesman noted that the Russian soldiers transferred to the Kharkiv direction have a low level of training and refuse to perform the assigned tasks. -Over the past few days or even weeks, we have already repeatedly noted cases of refusal of personnel - both in the direction of deep Lypka and in the Vovchansky direction - from carrying out combat and special tasks,- Vitaly Sarantsev recalled. The military officer said that cases of refusals have already been recorded and are becoming more and more frequent even in those brigades of the Russian army that arrived relatively recently in the Kharkiv direction. — A few weeks ago, the rotation of the 136th motorized rifle brigade, which took up positions near Vovchansk in the area of ​​the Tykh point itself, ended. They replaced the 82nd Airborne Assault Brigade of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, which suffered heavy losses and was withdrawn to recovery. This 136th brigade came in and stood still for several weeks. They tried to carry out intelligence activities, and equipped sabotage-reconnaissance groups, and tried to storm our positions head-on. Now they have also suffered losses, and as of yesterday - the day before yesterday, we have information that the servicemen of this brigade, which arrived in our direction not so long ago, are also refusing to perform combat and special tasks, he said. The spokesman explained that the special tasks include the establishment and provision of logistics and fortification equipment for positions. — This indicates that the enemy is more and more often in practically all directions using personnel who are not morally ready to perform any tasks. That is, they raise the mobilization resource, prepare it very hastily. Whether by deception, coercion, or in some other way, using promises of monetary rewards to be sent to war. But people understand that they were simply deceived and simply refuse to go into battle any further, said Vitaly Sarantsev. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in the north of Kharkiv region, the occupiers throw soldiers into battle less than a month after signing the contract and without any preparation, as a result enemy stormtroopers are sabotaging the orders of the command and in whole groups refuse to carry out the assigned tasks.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/11/bez-pidgotovky-i-motyvacziyi-na-harkivshhyni-rosiya-voyuye-pogano-navchenymy-soldatamy/	2024-09-11T10:36:36-07:00

It should be valued equally everywhere - Europe, America, Asia, Africa, Australia,- the President noted. Volodymyr Zelenskyy emphasized that the world has many conventions, and more than a hundred countries have ratified the Rome Statute, which should work. -But recently there was an exception in Mongolia for Putin. And this is not just someone's responsibility. It is the responsibility of the whole world to stop the degradation of the legal system, to prevent the destruction of those norms that still remain,- the head of state said. According to him, the legal system should and must work in such a way that the Rome Statute, and in particular the warrant of the International Criminal Court, which was issued in relation to the main Russian criminal, really limited him and already ensured his isolation. In addition, he noted that the G20 summit should be held in Brazil in a few months. -Ukraine heard a signal from the Brazilian authorities about plans to invite the Russian dictator. If this happens, it will mean yet another disregard for the Rome Statute,- the statement said.

Digitization of the provision of the Armed Forces: the DOT presented the innovative DOT-Chain system	-If earlier the term of delivery of products could be up to two months, after the introduction of DOT-Chain, this term should be reduced by approximately four times,- said Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Dmytro Klimenkov. -The digitization of procurement processes in defense is a strategic step in increasing the efficiency of supplies of all necessary military equipment.- -DOT-Shain is another important step towards a military that values ​​people, time and efficient processes instead of filling out hundreds of papers. Thanks to this system, the procurement of products will become clearer and more transparent, and the possibility of expanding it to other products will significantly simplify the logistics processes in the Defense Forces,- said Kateryna Chernogorenko, Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine for Digital Development, Digital Transformations and Digitalization. The creation of DOT-Chain has become the largest digital project in DOT. A team of IT specialists of the State Rear Operator worked on the development. -We were faced with the task of changing the old system so that the non-lethal support of the Armed Forces was more effective. Currently, DOT-Chain functionality extends to food. The DOT IT team has digitized the entire procurement process, from submitting product applications to issuing invoices and documents. In the future, the system can be quickly scaled to cover other categories of goods,- said Alyona Zhuzha, IT adviser of the DOT. 1. Digitized paper documents to optimize the work of the military. This is an important step towards abandoning the -paper army-. Instead of 30 thousand paperwork that the military had to process every week is now just a few clicks into the system. This significantly reduces the amount of work of salespeople. 2. Simplified the process of paying for goods. It will be four times faster, because expense invoices are immediately uploaded to the system, and DOT, having signatures from the military unit and the supplier, can immediately pay for the shipment. 3. Optimized data exchange. Information from the system is used, in particular, by the Ministry of Defense. This allows the military to adjust its needs according to the data aggregated by DOT-Chain: the number of requests, supply information, and the amounts accepted or not accepted by military units. 4. Adjusted the interaction between the parties involved in the process of providing the Armed Forces. In the DOT-Chain system, all procurement and supply documents are visible for each request. In fact, DOT becomes a third party that takes care of both procurement and suppliers and can quickly respond to changing requests from military units. State rear operator (DOT) is a procurement agency under the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, which provides the rear needs of the Armed Forces of Ukraine: food, property, fuel and lubricants. As reported by ArmiyaInform, a new model of food supply for the Armed Forces presented by the Procurement Agency of the Ministry of Defense -State Rear Operator-. As a pilot project, it will be operational in several regions of Ukraine as early as 2025.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/11/czyfrovizacziya-zabezpechennya-zbrojnyh-syl-dot-prezentuvav-innovaczijnu-systemu-dot-chain/	2024-09-11T03:38:08-07:00

From the contract to the front line — 20 days: whom the Russians throw into battle externally	The personnel of the occupiers involved in the hostilities characterized on the air of the telethon -Social News- by the spokesman of the Kharkiv OTU Vitaly Sarantsev. — Among the Russian servicemen there are also former prisoners who were dragged into this war under coercion or deception. There are representatives of foreign countries. There are actually different sections of the population, he said. Russians also use propaganda and coercion to force residents of temporarily occupied territories to join the invading forces. The motivation of such soldiers is extremely low. — These people are not motivated, and in connection with this, we note the numerous refusals of personnel of the armed forces of the Russian Federation to perform tasks. This happens both on the Hlyboke-Lyptsi route and on other routes, in particular in the area of ​​the settlement of Tyche. The 136th separate motorized rifle brigade recently entered there. They started to perform tasks just a few weeks ago, but we are already seeing numerous refusals of personnel to perform both combat missions and special missions, the spokesman said. The occupiers refuse not only to storm the positions of the Defense Forces of Ukraine, but also to perform tasks related to the adjustment and provision of logistics or the arrangement of fortifications. — This indicates that the Russians are gradually losing their offensive potential and they are forced to use anyone and any personnel in order to continue pushing into this war started by Russia, — explained Vitaly Sarantsev. At the same time, he noted that the enemy is actively replenishing not only tactical, but also operational and strategic reserves, paying the necessary attention to comprehensive training of servicemen. — Attention will be paid there to both combat training of personnel and, as they call it, military-political and ideological training. Therefore, we are not relaxing, we understand that, sooner or later, the enemy can supplement its current set of personnel with more trained military personnel, the military officer emphasized. Currently, the enemy does not feel the lack of personnel in the Kharkiv direction. — The forces and means that he currently maintains in our direction are sufficient for the enemy to continue to carry out active actions, to carry out offensive actions, to carry out assaults, to carry out sabotage and reconnaissance activities in non-attacked areas of the Russian-Ukrainian border with the aim of destabilizing the situation, with the purpose of carrying out intelligence tasks, Vitaliy Sarantsev reported. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in Kharkiv Oblast, enemy attack aircraft are sabotaging the orders of the command in whole groups and refusing to carry out their tasks, and also showed a video with captured fighters of the -Charter- brigade of the NGU by the Russian military, who said that signed a contract for military service on August 23 of this year.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/11/vid-kontraktu-do-peredovoyi-20-dniv-kogo-rosiyany-kydayut-u-bij-eksternom/	2024-09-11T02:40:58-07:00

Military vacations are quite difficult to predict, so it is difficult to think everything through in advance and organize an ordinary wedding. And the new service allows you to make friends even while on the front line. Basically, it's a marriage in a few clicks. Only internet is required&#8230; and, of course, the consent of the other half. ArmyInform tells how to marry a military man online. The new service even allows you to make an offer through Diya. The partner will receive a notification to which they must respond within 14 days. In particular, you need to go to -services- in Actions. Select -marriage online- and -Make a proposal- item. The system will offer to send this offer to a messenger convenient for your partner. However, such an offer is not binding. But it is not mandatory. If you made an offer in another way, you can apply for marriage registration right away in Diya. In Services, you need to find the -Marriage online- section and select the -marriage application- section. Someone alone must submit an application and indicate a partner in it. The latter must confirm the submission of such an application. When this happens, you will receive a notification. Read it and click -continue-. Next, you need to choose the date and time of the ceremony. Action will notify when the DRATSS confirms this date. Also, in Diya, you can decide what to do with your surname after the wedding: keep your own, take your partner's surname or make it double. Then you and your partner need to confirm the marriage registration application, sign with an electronic signature and pay the administration fee. On the day of the ceremony, Diya will send a reminder about the start of the video conference. On the wedding day, you just need to go to Diya and follow the link to join the online ceremony. An employee of the digital DRATSS will be waiting there. The ceremony lasts up to 30 minutes. The digital marriage registration certificate will be automatically activated within a day. You can also order a physical document by Ukrposhta delivery or pick it up at the branch. By the way, a wedding can be a reason for an additional 10 days of vacation. How to apply for family leave, read here . There are also certain requirements for registering a marriage in Diya. We will remind, previously Ukrainians had the opportunity to submit an online application for marriage registration. But the ceremony itself was still supposed to take place in DRACE. The only exception was military personnel. A simplified procedure was developed for them, which made it possible to get married remotely. That is, without the presence of the bride or groom. This procedure is valid even now, so a few words about it. What is needed? To submit an application to your immediate commander, in which to indicate information about yourself and your significant other - surname, first name and patronymic, date of birth, citizenship and chosen surname, if you wish to change it. Next, the commander must send an application to the DRATS to which the serviceman submitted the application. The fact of marriage registration is certified by an act, which is drawn up without the physical presence of one or both brides and grooms. However, they must be currently connected to the video procedure. The deed record of marriage is drawn up on the day of receipt of the application for the registration of a marriage or deed by the DRATSS department. This option also remains valid, but the new service in Diya greatly simplifies the whole procedure. As reported by ArmiyaInform, during the beta testing of the service the first , who married in this way, was a military serviceman.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/11/shlyub-u-diyi-yak-vijskovomu-odruzhytysya-onlajn/	2024-09-10T20:12:29-07:00
How the world helps Ukraine with the treatment and rehabilitation of wounded soldiers	Vadym Svyridenko, the adviser to the President of Ukraine on issues of rehabilitation of combatants, told about this during an interview with ArmiyaInform. — After the return of the fighters, we ask for their feedback: how do they like the prostheses, how was the rehabilitation, what did they learn there. And I am very glad that our rehabilitation and prosthetics are not behind in the world. And partner countries are already contacting us, interested in our experience. Because our military, like no one else in the world, faces such combat injuries. And we know what it is and how to deal with it. That is why specialists, for example, surgeons from Canada or America, are already coming to us. They, among other things, helped perform operations for facial injuries, says Vadym Svyridenko. We tell you more about how partner countries help our wounded defenders to recover their health and return to action. This country has an extensive network of cities and institutions where Ukrainian servicemen undergo treatment and rehabilitation. As of January 2024, 1,044 victims, including 735 military personnel, were evacuated to Germany. Also, 125 children with oncological diseases are being treated in the Federal Republic of Germany. In particular, the -Sharite- clinic accepts Ukrainians for treatment - military personnel with severe burns and mine-explosive injuries as a result of Russian military aggression are also treated here. In April 2024, another 13 Ukrainian defenders with amputations left Kyiv for Berlin. In a German military hospital, they are to be fitted with innovative prostheses. In general, German specialists expressed their readiness to provide prosthetics to 60 Ukrainian military personnel in Berlin. Our servicemen are also treated and rehabilitated in the city of Wiesbaden - here they have the opportunity to fully recover and receive the highest level of care. Poland has been helping with military rehabilitation since 2014. Ukrainian soldiers, in particular, are patients of the -Good Brother- rehabilitation and recreation center. In this institution, they can undergo a course of rehabilitation and recovery. Several hundred soldiers have already taken advantage of this opportunity. -Despite the fact that my right leg is completely iron, and the left one is missing about 75% of tendons and 50% of muscles, Polish rehabilitators taught me how to properly control my body. And not only did I return to a more or less normal life, but I even performed tasks in the area where the OOS was held,- Lt. Col. Ihor Chuprun, who underwent rehabilitation in Poland, recalled at one time. Already after the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation, the assistance of the Republic of Poland in matters of rehabilitation and treatment of military personnel only increased. In particular, Poland offered Ukraine to provide treatment and rehabilitation to 2,500 wounded Ukrainian servicemen. In addition, at the Military Medical Institute in Warsaw, Ukrainian specialists are trained in the field of rehabilitation of the wounded, as well as diagnosis and treatment of people who have suffered war injuries. Here, they improve their knowledge of accompanying patients during rehabilitation and modern methods of prosthetics. In Spain, there is a whole program of treatment and rehabilitation of Ukrainian servicemen and veterans who were injured in the war. In addition, this country also helps in the organization of recreation for Ukrainian children affected by the war. The country -stepped in- in aid from the first days of a full-scale invasion. In particular, wounded Ukrainian border guards (about 30 servicemen) who were wounded in 2022 in the first days of the enemy's invasion were treated in Spain. Our defenders also receive rehabilitation and treatment in the military hospital of the city of Zaragoza. This Orad y Gajías General Defense Hospital is one of two controlled by the Spanish Ministry of Defense. And he started receiving our fighters as early as 2022. The Netherlands also operates a rehabilitation program for Ukrainian military personnel. More than one group of servicemen used it. And in the Netherlands, Ukrainian military personnel undergoing rehabilitation and volunteers assemble drones for the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Volunteers look for funding and order parts, while the military assembles the drones. Professional instructors help beginners. The finished device is thoroughly tested before being sent to Ukraine. From June 2022, the French Ministry of Defense will organize assistance to the Ukrainian wounded. One of the facilities that contributes to the treatment and rehabilitation of our soldiers in France is Percy Hospital. In March 2024, it was known that wounded army personnel were being taken to French civilian and military hospitals in the Paris region and Grand Est. As of spring 2024, there were more than two dozen groups of Ukrainian military personnel who arrived in France for treatment. Back in 2018, Bulgaria launched a two-year rehabilitation program for soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine who were wounded, injured and maimed during hostilities in eastern Ukraine. In addition, Bulgaria had the status of a leading country within the NATO Trust Fund project in the field of medical rehabilitation in Ukraine. Our wounded defenders are receiving rehabilitation services at Kaleroya Military Medical Hospital in Hisar. Indications for physiotherapy in Kaleroya are injuries of the musculoskeletal system, injuries of the peripheral nervous system of the upper and lower extremities. And in 2020, the Project of Medical Rehabilitation of Ukrainian Veterans in Bulgaria was launched. Wounded Ukrainian military personnel (both those undergoing military service and those on reserve/retirement) and civilian personnel of the security and defense sector were sent for treatment. Expenses related to the procedures and accommodation of persons in the clinic were provided by the Bulgarian side, and international and local transportation, medical insurance and food for this period were provided by the NATO Trust Fund in Ukraine in the field of medical rehabilitation. The Baltic countries are friendly to Ukraine and our wounded defenders. For example, in April 2024, Lithuania started a special program for the rehabilitation of the Ukrainian military - about 15 million euros were allocated to Ukraine. These funds should be directed directly to the reconstruction of hospitals and the training of specialists. And the Latvian Support Fund for Ukraine, founded in 2014, collects donations for the treatment and rehabilitation of wounded Ukrainian servicemen, is an intermediary between the state, Latvian clinics and Ukrainian wounded who need help. Thus, as of the end of August 2024, more than 540 Ukrainian servicemen who were wounded in the war with the Russian Federation were treated in Latvia. At the beginning of June, the government allocated 184,000 euros for the rehabilitation of the soldiers of the Armed Forces. Estonia is not lagging behind - as of June 2024, it was known that more than 240 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine had already completed a rehabilitation course in Estonia. America supported Ukrainian wounded defenders even before the large-scale Russian invasion. For example, in 2019, the US government allocated about 5 million dollars and accepted 10 seriously wounded Ukrainian servicemen for treatment. For this purpose, the Americans have identified 10 hospitals that will receive Ukrainian servicemen for free treatment. It was then known that the average cost of treating one, as Americans calculated, is half a million dollars. And in December 2022, in New York, just in time for the Day of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the House of Heroes was opened for the rehabilitation and prosthetics of Ukrainian soldiers who lost their limbs during the war. The house is located in the Staten Island area, not far from the ocean. Oleksandr Rubtsov, head of the charity organization Kind Deeds, who owns a real estate company, implements the rehabilitation program for the wounded. According to him, he rented a house for this purpose and is accumulating donor funds for the further rehabilitation of Ukrainian soldiers. In addition, American specialists come to Ukraine and help in the treatment of our military. So, in 2023, American microsurgeons operated on wounded soldiers in Uzhhorod. According to Andrii Novak Transcarpathian Regional Clinical Hospital, this is the second visit of microsurgeons from the USA. During the visit, American doctors performed 7 operations on military personnel: it is about eliminating post-traumatic defects of bones and soft tissues of arms and legs. Canada is also helping our wounded defenders get stronger and healthier. Thus, in 2023, Ukraine and Canada signed an agreement on medical partnership in the field of mental health and military rehabilitation. According to this document, the Ukrainian Center for Mental Health and Rehabilitation -Lisova Polyana- has a sister company, the -Atlas- Institute of Veterans and Their Families. Both medical institutions specialize in the field of mental recovery and military rehabilitation. But this country helped our wounded even before the large-scale invasion. For example, in 2019, a project on the rehabilitation of patients with severe neurotraumas was implemented in the Rivne Region with the participation of Canadian specialists. And the Canadian instructors from the UNIFAIR training mission, who teach the Ukrainian military to provide first aid in case of wounds and injuries, have already become a familiar story for us.

The next conquerors of Tysa did not even have time to get their feet wet	About informs the State Border Service of Ukraine. It is noted that the detainees were residents of Vinnytsia and Ivano-Frankivsk regions. A 60-year-old resident of Nizhnya Apsha in Transcarpathia drove them to the river in his vehicle. According to a previous agreement, the Transcarpathian was supposed to assist the Vinnytsia and the Ivano-Frankivsk in illegally crossing the Ukrainian-Romanian border. Dilock planned to earn 15 thousand dollars from his -clients-. Despite the fact that the Transcarpathian tried to escape, the border guards also detained him. It was possible to expose the illegal device thanks to information provided in advance by operatives of the detachment. Upon detection of signs of the crime provided for in Art. 332 KKU, the border guards informed the police officers. Currently, operatives of the Mukachevo detachment are establishing all the circumstances of the offense and the persons involved in the organization of the scheme of illegal transportation of men of draft age. ArmyInform reminds that it is better not to break the law, but to use the aggregator of vacancies in the Armed Forces or recruiting centers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/10/chergovi-pidkoryuvachi-tysy-ne-vstygly-navit-nig-namochyty/	2024-09-10T11:35:30-07:00

The accomplice of the enemy turned out to be a resident of Kherson. After the capture of the regional center, she got a job at the occupation -electoral office-. Being part of the pseudo-institution, the woman was a member of the so-called mobile voting groups, which went around the homes of local residents and agitated them to support the fake referendum. At the same time, the collaborator required people to sign the -ballots on joining- the region to the Russian Federation. After the liberation of the regional center, the criminal remained in the city, where she tried to -lie down- and avoid justice. The security service documented the criminal actions of the suspect and detained her. The perpetrator faces up to 10 years in prison with confiscation of property.

The IOU and NATO delegations discussed speeding up the promised aid to Ukraine from the allies	About this informs September 10 Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. NATO Assistant Secretary General for Operations Thomas Hoffus and the new head of the NATO Representation in Ukraine Patrick Turner visited the capital. The main topics of discussion were the need for progress on interoperability with NATO and the acceleration of promised aid from allies. The proposal discussed the use of Ukrainian suppliers and manufacturers to speed up the supply of property and support the economy of Ukraine. -We are glad to welcome you to Ukraine, which demonstrates your involvement and interest in our victory. But we have to raise the issue of the fulfillment of promises and the operational logistics of helping our military,- said Oleksandr Balanutsa, Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine for European Integration. He emphasized that what was promised for September should be in Ukraine in September. Sticking to schedules is important on the battlefield. The parties discussed the implementation of a number of joint projects with NATO - NATO's initiative to support Ukraine in security issues and NSATU training, the Joint Center for Analysis, Training and Education (JATEC) and the implementation of projects of the NATO agency for support and supply of NSPA. The Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine, Stanislav Heyder, thanked for all the assistance provided by NATO to Ukraine. He also called for speeding up the implementation of projects within NSPA. -Unfortunately, the speed of implementation of NSPA projects, if we are not talking about fuel and turnstiles, remains at an extremely low level,- said Stanislav Heyder. NATO Assistant Secretary General for Operations, Thomas Hoffus, also introduced the new head of the NATO Representation in Ukraine, Patrick Turner, and once again assured of unwavering support for Ukraine. -We want close cooperation to increase the level of compatibility, progress and Ukraine's entry into NATO. Ready to act more actively from our side in matters of assistance from allies and consultations where necessary,- assured Patrick Turner. The NATO delegation was briefed on the operational situation on the battlefield, needs and intelligence data on the enemy, to which Ukraine should respond asymmetrically. Expanding the geography of airspace violations of NATO countries is a problem that requires a bold solution, which is why the Minister of Defense of Ukraine previously initiated discussions on the creation of a -humanitarian shield- for critical infrastructure facilities. As reported by ArmyInform, as Senior Representative, Patrick Turner lead PNU and take over the focus of NATO interaction with the Ukrainian authorities in Kyiv.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/10/delegacziyi-mou-i-nato-obgovoryly-pryshvydshennya-obiczyanoyi-dopomogy-vid-soyuznykiv/	2024-09-10T09:50:14-07:00
As much as I fight, there is not a single fragment in me - the story of the soldier Fartovoy, who fo...	About the soldier was told on September 10 Armed forces. Such a call sign was given to him by a sergeant, also a marine, at the training center. The military man says that at that time there was no special reason for the call sign -Fartovy-. However, the nickname did become prophetic. The boy signed a contract with the army at the age of 22. It was January 2023. Fartovy shared a video from this -celebration-, when his brothers greeted him just in the positions. The guy was prompted to sign the contract by a video from TikTok. -I watched the video of the Third Assault. The boys are having a good time like this. I wanted too. This is their form, the ARKs&#8230; But, in fact, it turned out to be a completely different story in the army: -kalash- and -pixel- uniform, - smiles Fartovy. The soldier reinforced the status of a forward in battle: -As much as I fight, there is not a single fragment in me. A few contusions only, but that's it. I think I have this fart just because of the call sign. Near Urozhany, when a shell flew into the trenches, there was a boy near me, 200, and I just had a severe contusion. Then there was a direct hit into the trench. Well, there was a drop from a drone in Krynky. Two meters in front of me. Everyone around has 300, but I have nothing,- said Fartovy. For -Fartovy- month, he underwent basic military training at the training center. After that, he joined the ranks of the 505th OBMP. Already in the battalion, he studied for another three months and went through combat training: he practiced shooting at the range, learned the tactics of fighting from his more experienced comrades. After completing the training, as the commander of the grenade launcher unit, -Fartovoy- was sent to the Donetsk direction. Subsequently, he fought in the Zaporozhye direction and again returned to the Donetsk direction. And then there was the most difficult aspect of the front for -Fartovoy- among all the places he visited - Krynka. -The worst thing there is the forest. Because when you go and storm the landing, you have 12 enemies, well, at most, one or two of them can jump out somewhere in the field, and in Krynky, you go into the forest and they can run out from any side. Because of that, it was much harder there. Well, they had a lot of equipment there. Tanks, armored personnel carriers were rolling out on us&#8230; They had a lot of equipment there. But a lot of their equipment was stolen there by our FPV-schneiders,- recalls Fartovyi. Currently, -Fartovoy- performs the duties of chief sergeant of the fire support company. In order to enter the position fully, he still has sergeant courses ahead of him. At the same time, the soldier trains new arrivals to the battalion of fighters in the internal training center. ArmyInform told the story of a fighter who, despite the decision of the VLK, remained in the DSHV. &nbsp; &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/10/skilky-voyuyu-zhodnogo-ulamka-v-meni-nemaye-istoriya-bijczi-fartovogo-yakyj-72-dni-byvsya-u-krynkah/	2024-09-10T09:37:37-07:00
The 12th Banderiv Readings will be held in Kyiv. ArmyInform is a media partner	This was reported by the organizer of the readings, sergeant of the fire support company of the 5th separate assault regiment, director of the USSD National Center Yuriy -Mamai- Syrotyuk. -During the conference, it is planned to revive the destroyed, erased and forbidden history of the long-standing resistance to Moscow imperialism of the peoples enslaved by Russia. Each people, nation, on whose land the Moscow occupier came, did some part of the more than a century of resistance to the Moscow empire. For centuries, Moscow destroyed the disobedient, encouraged traitors, and rewrote history. The time has come for every people in this prison of nations to find out -who they are, by whom, for what they are imprisoned- and to make their own decision - whether to die in Russian captivity, being a blind tool in the hands of the Kremlin, powerless on their land, deprived of language, history, identity, or to remember the glory of their ancestors and to fight for freedom,- noted Yuriy Syrotyuk. The Russian-Ukrainian war opened up a unique opportunity for peoples enslaved by Russia to throw off the yoke of Moscow colonialism and imperialism, and finally become the masters of their own destiny on their own land. The organizers of the 12th Banderiv readings invite researchers of Russian colonialism and the struggle against it, as well as active representatives of national liberation formations of peoples enslaved by Russia, to participate in the conference. The second panel will be dedicated to the actual prospects of the national liberation struggle. Based on the results of the readings, an electronic version of the participants' speeches will be prepared. As part of the XII Banderiv readings, it is traditionally planned to hold a Youth Essay Competition on the specified topic. In addition, on the eve of the event, the book -Involuntary Accession: The History of the Liberation Struggle of Peoples Enslaved by Russia- will be published in Ukrainian, English and an electronic version in the language of the occupiers. The media partner of -Banderivskyi readings- is the -ArmiyaInform- information agency. The Bander Readings project was founded in 2014 at the height of the Revolution of Dignity as an intellectual discussion of Bander's ideas and the creation of a vision of the Ukrainian state. It traditionally takes place in the first days of February at the time of the creation of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists in 1929 as a movement that set the goal of establishing an independent Ukrainian cathedral state, its preservation and development. Past 11th Bander readings -The Liquidation of the Russian Empire- were held on February 10, 2024. It was possible to hold the conference in a new format and to publish the book -Liquidation of the Russian Empire- in English and Ukrainian, which has already been printed in three editions and has become a notable phenomenon among research on this topic. More details about the terms of participation and the possibility to support the project are available on the organizers' page.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/10/u-kyyevi-vidbudutsya-xii-banderivski-chytannya-armiyainform-mediapartner/	2024-09-10T09:17:49-07:00

The soldier's story was made public on September 10 by the Airborne Assault Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. -I commanded a combat position that was semi-surrounded for nine days. Every day we repulsed several assaults of enemy infantry, which climbed on us as if possessed. To say that it was difficult then is an understatement,- recalls Serhiy. During that situation, several of his subordinates were wounded, and he himself received a concussion. However, despite this, and artillery and mortar shelling, which practically did not subside, and drops from enemy drones, the paratroopers did not leave their position, waiting for help. The brave soldier says that one of those days he was very surprised by a Russian who tried to storm the paratroopers in a slightly strange way. -A man in a black Adidas tracksuit, wearing sneakers and armed with a machine gun ran towards us. There was no helmet, no bulletproof vest, no first-aid kit, no other military equipment on him,- Serhiy is surprised. The Ukrainian paratroopers then decided that in this way, the Russian was trying to make it easier for himself to advance to their positions. But the soldiers did not have time to think for a long time, why he decided that it would help him. Therefore, they destroyed this -experimental athlete- with accurate fire. As well as other enemy fighters who climbed into their positions. Serhii notes that participation in active combat operations, when the situation on the battlefield changes very rapidly, has taught him to often make important decisions independently and act without waiting for the commander's order. -Once, during the shelling, I saw that an artillery shell hit the house where our soldiers were staying. There was no time to delay, so my partner and I, without waiting for the shelling to end, ran to help our people,- Serhii recalls. It turned out that the soldiers risked in vain: after freeing the entrance to the basement of the destroyed house, filled with broken brick fragments, the paratroopers rescued four brothers who were blocked in the underground room. -Who knows how the situation would have turned out for the boys if we had waited for the next team,- the fighter ponders. Serhiy went through so much in the war that one gets the impression that he has been serving for a long time, but this is not the case. The man joined the army in February 2024. Until then, he worked as a construction worker. He says that in his 43 years of life, he has never been in the army, but having joined the ranks of the paratroopers, having passed the appropriate training and having been in battles, he feels confident. To those who are still hesitating, he says not to be afraid. -Prepare physically and mentally. Everything else will be taught to you - no one will send you to the front line without training,- concludes Serhiy. His wife and three children are waiting for the paratrooper at home with Peremoha.

15 km per day through enemy territory and the myth of strong intelligence of the Russian Federation:...	Military expert Petro Chernyk told ArmyInform about this: -The Kursk operation is actually very, very successful. I would call it (an operation. — Ed.) global order. And it is necessary to understand why it happened. The first point: this is really an attempt to divert the enemy's forces and means from the main Donetsk direction. Only at first glance, this issue is unrealized. But in reality it is not so. Why? Because the combat army reserves are between 10 and 15 percent. So, if the enemy has 600,000 personnel along the battle line, then the mandatory reserve: 60,000-70,000 is still engaged. This is a very important moment. Next, this is a completely and definitively dispelled myth that one cannot enter the territory of the enemy, because, they say, it is a nuclear country, and the apocalypse will definitely happen. However, the apocalypse did not happen. And the most important goal, and it is, in fact, very promising: sooner or later it will reach the negotiation process. We are well aware that there will be no direct conversation between Ukraine and Russia. But according to the grain agreement, when we, Ukrainians, signed certain agreements with the Turks and the UN, and then Russia signed certain agreements with the Turks and the UN, then such a scenario could happen. And at this point we have to have a very, very strong position-. If for the enemy, Donetsk region and Luhansk region are of principle, then Kherson region and Zaporizhia region are not so principled. And according to the principle of such exchange — i.e., we return Kursk Oblast to them, and they return Zaporizhia and Kherson Oblast to us — such a scenario is quite possible. From the point of view of the organization's tactics and strategy, the operation is brilliant. Why is it shiny? Because it is breakthrough. In the first days of the operation, our forces moved at a speed of up to 10 km per day, and in some locations up to 15. I must remind you that the enemy covered almost the entire dry the weather passes several kilometers in the direction of Pokrovsk. Therefore, our speed is incredible. And most importantly: there is a myth that Russia has very strong intelligence. If the Russians could not calculate and see such an operation, then their intelligence is very, very bad. Any war, and especially the current one, has only three main laws. This is the concentration of the enemy's forces and means, the coordinated work of the military branches, and the third law, it was fully implemented here and very qualitatively, this is the hidden management of the troops. Being able to assemble several shock combat brigades, move them efficiently, provide them with equipment and break through the border — this is really a sign of the great quality of our operational art.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/10/15-km-na-dobu-vorozhoyu-terytoriyeyu-ta-mif-pro-sylnu-rozvidku-rf-ekspert-pro-blyskuchu-operacziyu-syl-oborony-na-kurshhyni/	2024-09-09T20:30:37-07:00
Combat took 14 tankers and two marines out of the encirclement: the story of lieutenant colonel Grud...	&#8230;On February 23, 2022, a battalion of a separate tank brigade named after Kostyantyn Pestushka was raised due to an alarm, and Oleg took it to a designated concentration area. - To be honest, there was nothing to indicate that a large-scale invasion would begin. The relevant order was received, we went out according to the training plans. But on the morning of February 24, around 4 a.m., the connection was dead. Reports began from posts that explosions were heard and bright flashes were seen at the base camp. In addition, we used the Viraj-tablet air defense system. The operator called me to see what was happening, and there were about 30 planes on the radar. We understood that a serious war had begun, the officer recalls. Around 10 o'clock Oleg Grudzevych's tank battalion reached the border in the Volnovakha district. There, the tankers found the first hours of a large-scale invasion. It was very hot near Volnovakha - the Russians broke through the defense of one of the infantry battalions. — Our unit suffered its first losses there — the tank crew was killed. We went away with hard fights - pearls scattered like mad. According to intelligence data, there were convoys of 70 units, and 50, 30, 20. I remember how successfully one crew - an officer's crew - worked. The thing is that Major Serhii Brovkin, the deputy commander, was there for the gunner, and Captain Pavlo Grelya for the tank commander. So they destroyed two BMP-3 with one shot. The armor-piercing projectile pierced both cars of the Rashists, and it was so successful that they exploded one after another, inflating like bubbles. And the column did not even stop, the Rashists simply did not understand what had happened, says Oleg Grudzevych. He remembered the first days of the large-scale invasion as continuous battles, maneuvers, retreats, counterattacks, and at the same time the realization that the Rashists could be beaten. And he still cannot forget how the local population helped the Ukrainian soldiers. When our tanks simply ran out of fuel on February 27, volunteers from one of the settlements, which is currently temporarily captured, came to help. Farmers shared the fuel, pouring 200 liters into each tank. As Oleg recalls, he managed to gather his units, and on February 28, the tankers entered Mariupol on the territory of the Azovmash plant, where, together with the marines, they began fighting for the city. Oleg tells about those battles calmly, as if it were about ordinary work: - The schedule of the orcs was like a working day. It's dawn - they're on the move, small arms are working. It begins to pout - shooting battles stop, artillery and aviation begin to work. On the 13th, a mechvod (mechanic-driver. — Ed.) died. We tried to protect the team link, but still they had to take risks, there was simply no other strength. Already on the 2nd or 3rd day of the fighting, we moved to the basement. Battalions were still stationed around the city perimeter, tanks were moving out, there were constant skirmishes, Russian artillery and aviation were already in full swing. They calculated the location of headquarters on -Azovstal- and -Azovmash-, and aviation worked on them. Mines and -Hradi- were already flying to the plant. The Azov people came to us and said: -We don't understand their mathematics: 50 people attack every day from one direction. 20-30 turn around, they will lose a lot of equipment and tanks. The next morning it's 50 again.- The fighting continued at this pace until the end of March. On March 15, the tankers ran out of drinking water and food. Oleg thinks, then continues: - We started drinking water from the fire-fighting ponds that were at the factory. Water and green, but there was no way out. There was also no supply of ammunition and food, later we began to count literally every projectile for tanks, sukhpai. The ring was getting tighter every day, we were moving away little by little. Orcs were literally pelting us with cannon fodder. We had no news or communication, but we stood on the perimeter of the plant, holding Azovmash - 800 meters, in the roundabout. I had 2 combat-ready tanks left, mine and one more, and 2 or 3 vehicles were from the 36th brigade. They went to work in pairs. Scatter on all sides of the pearl. All the anti-aircraft gunners and tankers I had were already working as infantrymen, going on 8-hour shifts. I remember how on April 5, an enemy tank broke into the territory of -Azovmash-, but it was knocked out. Every evening, as soon as it got dark, the Russians came out and began to -pour- everywhere with a double frenzy. We understood that we would not last another week. Oleg recalls that the first attempt to break through the encirclement was on April 10. They tried to break through the territory of the Ilyich plant, but, unfortunately, the attempt was unsuccessful. The next day, another breakout attempt, this time successful. Two tanks that remained from Oleg's battalion with the remains of shells: one had about 20 shells in the conveyor, the other tank had 15. The unit left the factory. — Our plan was as follows: to the road, if there is an opportunity, we break through on equipment. When the tanks stop, then we blow up the equipment, and then we move on foot, in groups of 10-15 people. The connection was reset and checked. On April 11, around midnight, they started moving. Next to my tank was a -motolyga- (light armored multi-purpose transporter. - Ed.), people were sitting on it, including the wounded. I tell the officer that I will divert fire on myself. And I will not leave them alone. I give tasks to the commander, the mechanic. We were lucky that it was raining that night and there were no drones. I say to the commander of another unit that was with us: -While we are shooting for 30-40 minutes, stay a kilometer away from me. You see the transfer of fire - move behind us to the distance that we have advanced. And this is how we move - from border to border.- &#8230;The breakthrough was frantic - tankers opened fire, burned Russian equipment, the infantry also did their job. Then the tanks ran out of fuel and stopped. There were no shells either. Tankers took out night lights, radios, sights and destroyed everything they could. They took with them small arms, ammunition, grenades, remnants of sukhpay, water. They moved behind the rear of the Rashists. Today, few people can imagine what it is like to move in the enemy's environment. Expect a shot, a rupture, a mine detonation, a random meeting with the occupiers or local traitors at any moment. Oleg speaks sparingly about the exit. — Before the breakthrough, thanks to Starlink, I downloaded an offline map and took a normal one. We knew roughly where our units would be and how far we had to go. It was 138 kilometers straight, and all 175 to bypass the Rashisti. They planned the movement as follows: we walk at night, warm up at the same time, and hide somewhere during the day. The only thing that bothered me a lot was the cold. Although, perhaps, it saved us in the end, because the enemy also did not want to peek somewhere in such abominable weather. On the first day, the main thing was to get as far away from the abandoned equipment as possible. Population centers were bypassed. But we went to one, Znamenivka, not far from Anatolia - there was a bridge over the river near the reservoir. We came across a Russian DRG near the bridge. We -put down- one occupant, ran across that concrete bridge and lay down in a rather large landing. From 8 in the morning to 9 in the evening, they stayed in that landing. The opponent was afraid to comb her. For 4 hours, they drove next to each other, released only a few queues in our direction. Then we got somewhere - they probably thought that we had gone along the creek. We were very tired, because we had been out for the 3rd day. So, after resting a little in that landing, they filled up with water and moved along the river. There they ran into another group of Rashists. There was a short fight, one of them was definitely -killed-, but a bullet or two hit our fighter in the backpack. The soldier is running, the backpack is on fire, I shout to him: -Drop that backpack!-, and he: -Go away, there are grenades!- — -All the more, throw him to hell!-. He tore off that backpack and threw it away. We then broke away and went for several days without fire contact. Somewhere on the 6th or 7th day, they finished off the remaining sukhpai, began to look for sorrel, rummaged through garbage cans - they thought they would find something. On one of the days we almost got caught. We leave the next landing - and here our soldier noticed a tent 20 meters away, and some antennas there. They passed 300-400 meters. In the morning I already say: -Let's not go anywhere, because our legs hurt, our stomachs hurt, it's raining.- There are still about 40 kilometers to the front. Next is a quarry with sand, they thought to wait in it, and there were 20 Urals with Zetkas. We hear - somewhere behind, the generator started up, 400 meters away. I think they have come. It saved that the weather was bad, it was raining. So they lay near the quarry. Orcs were loaded with sand, no one else was seen until evening. Then they went very carefully - I sent a patrol of 2-3 people ahead. At 500 meters, if clear, they turned back, and we continued. Walked all the time with their phones turned off - I warned them to charge the power banks before leaving, and everyone turned off their phones except for me. I say - if I see someone's phone, I will shoot my knees! Of course, I wouldn't have done that, but no one was using the phones, because the Russians track cellular communications clearly. About 15 kilometers before the collision line, I see one -Life- strip appeared on my phone, but I couldn't make a call. On the 9th day, 2 -sticks- appeared on the phone. He called the brigadier general, he didn't recognize us at first, then he was happy. I got together with the unit commander who was ahead of us, and for the last 12 hours he helped us go. I remember how he tells us that there is a small area that will have to be run. And our legs are no longer carrying us, and our stomachs hurt, I was vomiting blood. The guys took my machine gun and backpack from me, they say: -We will deliver them, your task is to prove us.- And so they came&#8230; They cried because they almost didn't believe that we would make it. They have experienced so much&#8230; They came, fell down, we were given a cigarette and water to drink. He called his commander back, the next day our brigade came to pick us up. There were 16 people with me. Two of them are from the 36th Brigade. For this breakthrough from Mariupol and exit, in fact, he received the -Golden Star-. I do what I can, no more and no less. At the moment, we are temporarily on recovery, soon they will give a new command, because the Rashists must be beaten in order to return home as soon as possible. In addition to the -Golden Star- of the Hero of Ukraine, which was personally awarded to Oleh Grudzevych by the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyi during a visit to the unit, for the battles near Volnovakha and Mariupol, the officer was also awarded two orders of Bohdan Khmelnytsky III and II degrees.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/10/kombat-vyviv-z-otochennya-14-tankistiv-i-dvoh-morpihiv-istoriya-pidpolkovnyka-grudzevycha/	2024-09-09T20:19:14-07:00
-Dirty bomb-, biolaboratories and what are the Chechens doing here: what is the Kremlin mouthpiece c...	During the meeting of the Ninth Eastern Economic Forum on September 5, he again changed the goal of the war against Ukraine and stated that the main task of -his- remains the capture of the Donetsk region. He also called it a -sacred duty- of Russian soldiers to retake part of Russia's Kursk region, which is currently controlled by the Ukrainian military. Putin declared: -The invasion of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation into the border regions of the Russian Federation failed.- And this is despite the fact that the Armed Forces continue to perform all the assigned tasks in Kurshchyna. The Russian dictator also hinted that Russia did not refuse negotiations with Ukraine, but on the basis of -documents- agreed in Istanbul in 2022. It will be recalled that at that time the Russians demanded the actual capitulation of Ukraine. In the annexes to the Istanbul Agreements, Russia prescribed a number of restrictions for Ukraine, while no restrictions were foreseen for the Russians. This was said by the former US Deputy Secretary of State Victoria Nuland. -The Istanbul agreements prohibited Ukraine from having some weapons systems, so, in essence, Ukraine would be weakened from a military point of view, while there were no similar restrictions on the part of Russia: Russia was not required to withdraw, it was not necessary to have a buffer zone on the border, Russia was not it was forbidden to keep any weapons on the border. -Ukraine felt that this could be a trap, so after consulting with its allies, it withdrew from the negotiations,- said Victoria Nuland. Putin could get a castrated demilitarized country for nothing. He obviously liked this, so now Putin only creates the appearance of readiness for negotiations, and all he wanted and wants is the surrender of Ukraine. For this purpose, the Russian dictator is manipulating the ephemeral -Istanbul Agreements- in the Russian interpretation. Ukraine needs a just peace, according to the norms of international law, according to the Ukrainian Peace Formula, which the head of the Kremlin constantly avoids. In addition, during his speech at the forum, Putin continued to say that the current authorities of Ukraine are not interested in ending hostilities because they do not want to hold presidential elections. He was supported by the dictator's spokesman, Dmytro Peskov, who declared: -Zelenskyi's regime is de jure illegitimate, although in fact it continues its activities.- We will remind that, according to the Constitution of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyi remains the legitimate head of state and will exercise his powers until the moment of taking office as the new President, whom Ukrainians will elect in the elections. Zakharova, the representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, was also noted for another batch of disinformation published on the air. She stated: -Ukrainian criminals guilty of serious international crimes against their own and Russian citizens, as well as their accomplices, will be brought to court and they will suffer the deserved punishment.- As is known, during the war, Ukraine strictly adheres to all international conventions and rules of warfare, unlike Russia, which constantly violates them. Zakharova also emphasized once again that the alleged main customer and instigator of the aggression of the -Kyiv regime- is the -collective West-. The statements of the Russian propagandist are populist in nature and do not have any legal basis. In addition, they cannot withstand any criticism and have no limits to cynicism. It was Russia that attacked a sovereign state, kills Ukrainians every day and destroys entire cities. There is only one aggressor, whose name is Russia. But this does not prevent the terrorist country from constantly accusing Ukraine of preparing terrorist attacks. So, last week, the RIA Novosti channel published an interview with an alleged Ukrainian prisoner of war, who said that the Armed Forces of Ukraine were preparing ammunition with the banned chlorpicrin in a laboratory near Kramatorsk. Also, Russian propagandist Veselovskyi said: -Ukraine has already made a dirty nuclear bomb long ago and would be ready to use it, but it does not use it,- and a collaborator from the Russian Federation, Ganchev, said that the threat of attacks by the Armed Forces of Ukraine on the Kursk and Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plants will remain. Let us remind you that it is Ukraine that strictly adheres to the requirements of the international nuclear security regime, unlike the aggressor country, which constantly uses nuclear blackmail for manipulation and intimidation. In addition, Ukraine, as a signatory to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons, strictly adheres to its obligations. Therefore, all the statements of propagandists are fakes, in which only Russians believe. And with plots on its own television, the propaganda of the aggressor country tries to justify the aggression of the Russian Federation and to cultivate hatred of Ukrainians among its citizens. For example, on the anniversary of the terrorist attacks in Buinaksk, Volgodonsk, and Moscow (September 4-16, 1999), the story of propagandist Dmytro Kiselyov is being circulated in the Russian Federation, in which Ukrainians are equated with -Chechen terrorists.- According to Kiselyov, now Ukrainians resisting the Russian invasion are -doing the same thing- as the terrorists who blew up residential buildings in Russian cities. Propaganda directly threatens - the defenders of Ukraine will either be destroyed or a Russian prison, -where life is worse than death.- In fact, using the pretext of -fighting terrorism- to justify wars is a classic Kremlin tactic. According to many independent investigators, the FSB was involved in the terrorist attacks in 1999, in which more than 300 people died and which became the reason for the Second Chechen War. It is the terrorist country Russia that constantly uses terrorist methods and commits crimes against the civilian population in both Chechnya and Ukraine. To write the review, materials from the Center for Combating Disinformation at the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine were used.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/10/brudna-bomba-biolaboratoriyi-j-do-chogo-tut-chechenczi-pro-shho-znov-volaye-rupor-kremlya/	2024-09-09T20:10:59-07:00
Because it is the most long-range: the US Navy puts into service the AIM-174B air-to-air missile	The fact that the Indo-Pacific region has been chosen as the prime territory for the deployment of these weapons, in the opinion of Reuters agency analyst, can significantly change the balance of forces in the air, in particular in armed confrontation with China, ArmiyaInform reports. The missile was developed by a well-known American manufacturer in the field of aerospace engineering - Raytheon - based on the SM-6 system , making it currently the longest-range missile ever used by the US, and was officially commissioned in July. It should be noted that the Pentagon did not officially present the new charge. Therefore, defense sector researchers are only making assumptions about the capabilities of the new missile based solely on its external image. Photos of F/A-18E/F Super Hornet aircraft with a new type of armament have appeared online. The new missile program and its implementation may mark a scientific and technical revolution in the fight against air targets&#8230; and even more. Yes, by data by The War Zone, the AIM-174B is a new air-to-air missile. Its appearance marks a significant increase in the capabilities of the US Navy in the fight against air targets, although the use of new weapons may extend beyond the air sphere. As confirmed by Naval News, the missile, also known as SM-6 ALC (Air-Launched Configuration), has been officially adopted by the US Navy. Weapons photographed by air adjusters during RIMPAC 2024 maneuvers while which has not been officially announced. The sudden appearance of a new missile without a pre-presented development program in the press remains largely a mystery. This reflects well the ability of the United States to conduct secret programs and the ability of Americans to avoid leaking information to the press when necessary. There are many indications that the F/A-18s will receive weapons that could radically change the balance of power in the Pacific. As can be seen from the photos published on social networks, the missile is suspended on the underwing pylon of the BRU-32B/A type of the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet. A few years ago, visually similar weapons were spotted under another aircraft of this type. However, that rocket was painted orange, which could mean that it was just an experimental product, a mass-sized mock-up, or maybe just a flying target. All three F/A-18E/F VFA CVW-2s are attached to the aeroplane of the Carl Vinson aircraft carrier and apparently received the AIM-174B air defense system. In recent weeks, the new missiles have been spotted in a gray color with a white fairing, which is typical of production air-to-air missiles adopted by the US Air Force and Navy. The airframe of the rocket can also be seen in great detail in the pictures. On its case there is a spoken marking DATM-174B. The abbreviation means that the missile is special, test, the common designation of the combat missile is AIM-174B. The RIMPAC exercise also saw F/A-18E/F fighters with underwing pylon-mounted missiles bearing the NAIM-174B index, with the N prefix indicating modifications for special tests where no return to the original configuration is planned. The model number in the missile designation -174- and the geometric and aerodynamic exterior of the missile airframe reveal the mystery of the weapon's origin. RIM-174B is the ship-to-air missile designation, also known in the US Navy as the SM-6 (Standard Missile-6) Block IA. In the US Navy, it is used to combat aerodynamic and ballistic targets, and also has limited capabilities to attack surface targets. The AIM-174 is a variant of the SM-6 adapted for use on combat aircraft. A missile modified for air carriers can use the altitude and speed of its carrier as launch conditions. For this reason, it lacks the Mk 72 solid propellant booster used in the original RIM-174B, which is launched from the Mk 41 shipboard Vertical Launch System (VLS). The AIM-174B missile without the Mk 72 booster weighs 1,890 pounds ± 14 lbs (857 kg ± 6 kg). The missile's terminal velocity can reach Mach 3.5 (1,050 m/s) when intercepting aerial, aerodynamic, and ballistic targets at altitudes up to 110,000 feet (34,000 meters) or Mach 2.5 (825 m/s ) when hitting land and surface targets at a range of 200 nautical miles (370 km). The missile has an active AIM-120 AMRAAM air-to-air homing system for end-of-flight targeting, but, unlike the AMRAAM, is not equipped with an inertial system as the primary missile control system in the initial and mid-range of the flight path, but programmable GPS navigation system, which is more accurate and allows you to do without a radio altimeter when attacking surface and ground targets in flight at low and ultra-low altitudes. It seems that as a result of this modification, the weapon does not lose its aerodynamic parameters, in particular, regarding the launch range. In this aspect, an air-launched missile may even win against a prototype ship-based missile. Given that estimates of the launch range of the -traditional- ship-based RIM-174B range from 240 to 460 km, this means that the AIM-174B could prove to be the longest-range air-to-air missile in its class, surpassing the Russian P-37 (AA 13 Axehead in the NATO nomenclature), the Chinese PL-15 (CH-AA-10 Abaddon) or the European Meteor. AIM-174B — new missile -air — air- of the US Navy for long-range F-18 Super Hornets.

Heavy fighting in tracts and islands: the intensity of enemy assaults on the Left Bank of the Dniepe...	Captain Dmytro, the spokesman of the operational group of troops -Tavria- told about this on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyni- Lykhova - In three days - Friday, Saturday and Sunday - 30 combat clashes took place there. The opponent had no success. Today, since the beginning of the day, there have already been 7 combat clashes there, while they are not taking place in one place, but are scattered on different islands, tracts, on different areas, which are stretched over a considerable length of the Dnipro coast, he said. This is an atypical situation, because previously most of the enemy's ground offensive operations were carried out in Zaporizhzhia, namely on the Robotynsky ledge in the Orihiv direction. Now the situation has changed. — Over the course of yesterday, 13 enemy assaults were repelled in our entire operational zone, of which three took place in the Orichiv direction, none in the Gulyajpil region, and 10 attacks were repelled at once in the Dnieper direction. This is such an atypical activity, the spokesman noted. The military believes that the Russians want to oust units of the Defense Forces from their positions on the bridgeheads on the Left Bank of the Dnieper. — They want, so to speak, to do it in such a leap. There are no other explanations. But in principle, their activation is the greatest in the last couple of months after the end of the active defense of Krynok, when our units — marines and other units of the Armed Forces — moved to other designated positions on the Left Bank of the Dnieper, he said. Dmytro Lykhovii suggested that the intensification of offensive actions by the Russians on the left bank of the Dnieper is related to their concern about a possible Ukrainian offensive in this direction. — There was information that the Russians were waiting for our offensive there. There were active actions, in particular, by the special forces of the Main Directorate of Intelligence with amphibious landings on the Kinburn spit, on the Tendriv spit. So the Russians keep their contingent there also for defense reasons. But now we are dealing with an increase in the number of assaults on their part, the spokesman said. In general, the Russians did not relax their attention to the SSU-held bridgeheads on the Left Bank of the Dnieper, even when they transferred their units from other directions in the South in view of the Kursk offensive operation of the Defense Forces. — It can be said that after the start of the Kursk offensive operation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, when the enemy in a certain way transferred his units to threatened areas, in particular to Kurshchyna, he took most of these units from the Zaporizhzhia region. Whereas in Kherson Oblast, the number that was there actually remained. There, the Russians did not weaken the group. On the contrary, they conduct rotations at the front edge of their units, transfer -storm- detachments there in particular to maintain the intensity of assault actions, in order to be able to attack in the future, said Dmytro Lykhova. On the other hand, in other directions in the South, the number of assaults by the occupiers decreased. — If earlier most of the combat clashes took place in Zaporozhye, in the Orichiv direction, specifically on the Robotynsky ledge, now there are very few of them there. For example, yesterday there were three of them, none before that, today two have already happened since the beginning of the day. At the same time, the enemy is actively using unguided air missiles. In the Gulyajpil direction, there have been three weeks without significant changes, that is, there are no ground assaults, the spokesman said. Earlier, ArmyInform showed that our soldiers destroyed a warehouse of enemy watercraft in the South.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/09/v-urochyshhah-i-na-ostrovah-vazhki-boyi-zrosla-intensyvnist-shturmiv-voroga-na-livoberezhzhi-dnipra/	2024-09-09T10:28:16-07:00

This is discussed in the message of President Volodymyr Zelensky on September 9. -First of all, about the Donetsk directions. Thanks to all our units at the front, who ensure full implementation of the tasks and really steadfastly repulse the Russian assaults and restore our positions. This is important,- the head of state noted. According to him, it is also important to destroy as many enemy forces as possible. -The Pokrovsky direction, Kurakhivskyi - that is where the Russian army should lose as much combat capability as possible. I am proud of all our soldiers, who by their actions are teaching Russia to clearly know where its land is and where its neighbors are,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy emphasized. As reported by ArmyInform, the enemy continues to use special munitions equipped with dangerous chemicals against the Defense Forces.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/09/prezydent-rosiya-povynna-vtratyty-najbilshe-boyezdatnosti-na-pokrovskomu-kurahivskomu-napryamkah/	2024-09-09T10:00:51-07:00

They talked with a captured Kazakh who went to kill people for money. We often meet people who think they can sit in the back, make money, and everything will be fine. But when they get into the Russian military system and face reality, everything falls into place,- the Ukrainian military said. -Это что вообще такое? You go according to the contract, you sign the contract, and you go and spend your money. Those are contracts that you get, you earn,- complains a serviceman of the aggressor state of the Russian Federation. Instead, in captivity, he was fed and given the necessary clothes. However, only he was so lucky - all the other henchmen of the Russian died. -Russians, you live in a country that kills you more than any other. Your Russian -tsar- killed more Russians than any Ukrainian. We will continue to destroy anyone who chooses to play the -great conqueror-. We have something to fight for - for our home, our families, our future,- Ukrainian soldiers emphasized.

Thousands of residents remain under shelling in the Kupyan region: where in the community is the mos...	Where is the most dangerous place in Kupyan Oblast and how evacuation takes place on the air -Suspilne Novosti- the head of Kup told Andriy Besedin of the Yansk City Military Administration. — The situation is very difficult in the settlements of Kivsharivka, Kupyansk-Vuzlovy, the left bank of the city of Kupyansk itself — Zaoskilya district, the central part of the city. Now there is no such place on the territory of the Kupyan community that we can say is safer, he said. Enemy artillery is practically non-stop, the Russians are striking with UAVs. However, even under such conditions, a significant number of local residents refuse to evacuate. — Unfortunately, evacuation is neglected, refused. Now more than 7,000 residents are on the territory of the community, 155 children remain on the right bank of the city of Kupyansk, said the head of the Kupyansk MBA. Employees of the Kupyan city military administration work with them every day, persuading them to leave the territory of the community, which has become deadly dangerous. — Now it is critical to leave the territory of the community to safer places. The whole algorithm is worked out, everything is created - from the hotline phone to the cities that can receive our people. If people want to come to the city of Kharkiv, they will be provided with compact accommodation and all the necessary services and conditions. If people want to go to safer regions, that is also an option. A large number of sister cities of Kupyansk are ready to receive our people, Andriy Besedin said. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that Kupyansky district suffered the most from shelling in Kharkiv region.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/09/pid-obstrilamy-na-kupyanshhyni-lyshayutsya-tysyachi-meshkancziv-de-v-gromadi-najnebezpechnishe/	2024-09-09T08:48:13-07:00

Married to the mother-in-law: a story about unexpected love on the border with Poland	She informed about them State Border Service of Ukraine. In one case, a 28-year-old resident of the Rivne Region married his 40-year-old mother-in-law, a person with a disability of the 1st group. According to the version of the -newlyweds-, they were going to Warsaw to treat the sight of their -wife-. -The couple showed their acting skills until the end and assured that the marriage was concluded in July - out of great love. Later, the man admitted that his new wife was his mother-in-law. And the marriage was concluded with the purpose of leaving Ukraine,- the border guards said. As the border guards found out, on September 7, the husband's real wife left the country by train. -On the same day, the man and his mother-in-law tried to leave through the car checkpoint in Volyn. When the plans of the -couple- were exposed there, on September 8, the -couple- went to the Rava-Ruska checkpoint,- the report says. The other two cases were recorded at the -Krakowec- checkpoint. Both -spouses- were allegedly going to treat their wives. At the end of August, a 41-year-old native of Ivano-Frankivsk region married a 46-year-old woman with a disability of the II group.

The Ministry of Defense is updating the food supply of the Armed Forces: the pilot project will be l...	About this reported in the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. The main task of the new approach is to ensure better quality of products supplied to the Armed Forces and to increase the efficiency of the supply process itself. It was introduced to potential suppliers, manufacturers and distributors. -From February 2025, two models will operate in parallel: the one under which DOT works now, and the new pilot model. This approach is used to ensure the stability of the system and the continuity of the supply process. Transformations in the food model for the military should increase the efficiency of supply and, at the same time, ensure compliance with high standards of product quality,- said Deputy Defense Minister of Ukraine Dmytro Klimenkov. The pilot will operate throughout the year and will cover such regions as the city of Kyiv and the Kyiv, Vinnytsia, Zhytomyr, Cherkasy, and Kirovohrad regions. The main changes concern the financial model of interaction with the supplier, the product model and the quality control process. The supplier will receive compensation for the cost of goods and a fee for services (warehousing and transportation) subject to the SLA. The marginal cost of the catalog will be determined and fixed. For most types of products (75%) through open procurement platforms, the DOT will choose manufacturers who will be contracted by suppliers. For the remaining categories, suppliers will independently identify subcontractors. DOT, in turn, can block them for quality inconsistency and for violating integrity norms. All products will pass through the distribution center and only then be sent to military units. This is an additional stage of quality control, to which DOT specialists will be involved. DOT will apply a -black list- to suppliers and manufacturers - a new tool to prevent participation in the process of providing food for the Armed Forces in future periods of those entities that have already violated contractual obligations . -The idea of ​​the pilot model is to change the philosophy of interaction with suppliers and manufacturers due to the change in their incentives and the openness of the terms of cooperation. We see this approach as the basis of partnership. At the same time, our main goal is to ensure an increase in both the quality of products received by the Armed Forces and the efficiency of the supply process itself. So that, while observing the transparent rules of the game, all participants in the process are interested in ensuring a continuous and high-quality supply of the Armed Forces,- said Halyna Litosh, program director for the food sector of the DOT. Earlier, ArmyInform informed that The Kingdom of Sweden announced the 17th package of military aid to Ukraine in the amount of SEK 4.6 billion.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/09/minoborony-onovlyuye-harchove-zabezpechennya-zsu-pilotnyj-proyekt-zapustyat-nastupnogo-roku/	2024-09-09T07:52:03-07:00

The Russians almost wiped the borders of Kharkiv Oblast from the face of the earth: what is the goal...	The goal of the occupiers was explained on the nationwide telethon by the spokesman of Kharkiv Technical University, Colonel Vitaly Sarantsev. — Unfortunately, the picture of the entire border area is not much different from Vovchansk.

Other settlements in the north of Kharkiv Oblast also suffer from the terrorist actions of the Russian occupiers. — In particular, this is the settlement of Liptsi, which is almost destroyed, almost erased from the face of the earth.

He explained that the actions of the Russian invaders have practically no military objectives and testify to the enemy's intentions to terrorize the civilian population with the aim of sowing panic and despair. — The tactics of his actions show that the enemy does not need these settlements and the population that is located there. He acts indiscriminately, he does not have any military strategy in carrying out these attacks. His main intention is to destabilize the situation, sow panic among civilians and discouragement towards the military and political leadership of the country, towards the Armed Forces of Ukraine, he explained.
