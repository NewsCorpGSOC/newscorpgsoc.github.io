Your house will not be demolished now: the occupiers are nationalizing the abandoned dwelling	This was reported by the head of Luhansk OVA, Artem Lysogor. According to him, the occupiers are acting according to the legislative norms of the Russian Federation, which allow property to be recognized as ownerless if the owner has not declared his rights within a certain period. In many cases, people did not even know that they needed to make such a statement. Many appeals against similar decisions have already accumulated.

Father and Son at War: The Story of Two Generations of Defense Forces Soldiers	The story of the fighters was made public on page 128 of the separate Transcarpathian mountain assault brigade. Dmytro's first unit was radio engineering troops, but a year later he was transferred to the 128th separate mountain assault brigade. After the first contract, he returned to civilian life, but lasted only a year and eight months - and was again in the army. In May 2022, his regular contract ended, but due to the full-scale war, he continued his service. Dmytro serves as a driver and over the years of the war managed to master various types of transport, from volunteer pickups to American Humvees and trophy Russian Urals. He well remembers the first combat contact in Zaporozhye: the enemy surrounded the village, and his tanks approached almost silently through rubberized -goosebumps-. Then two of Dmytro's comrades were killed under enemy fire, and the unit had to fight its way back more than 40 kilometers. Dmitry's father is 52 years old. He once served as a conscript in the Soviet army, and before the war he worked as a combine harvester. For many years he insisted that he wanted to mobilize, but Dmytro dissuaded him. In the end, the father could not stand it and joined his son's unit. Currently, he serves in the same battalion, repairs equipment. Due to constant combat missions, they and their son cannot see each other every day, but they are always in touch. According to Dmitry, the most difficult thing is to know that a loved one is also on the front line. Dmytro's mother had a hard time surviving his father's decision to join the Armed Forces. She stayed at home with her youngest son, who is only 12 years old. Dmitri and her father try to calm her down, although they know that each of their calls to her is a moment of relief, but also of anxiety. A girl is waiting for Dmytro at home.

Maritime coalition: how the West is arming Ukraine for war at sea.	At the same time, it is important to understand to what extent Ukraine is equipped with the necessary forces and means to defeat the enemy at sea and liberate Crimea? What is the role of the Maritime Capability Coalition in this? How and in what volumes is foreign aid provided to develop the capabilities of the Defense Forces of Ukraine to carry out tasks at sea? Military expert, retired captain 1st rank, candidate of military sciences, associate professor Stepan Yakymyak told ArmiyaInform about this and other important issues in the activities of the Coalition of Maritime Capabilities. — Ukraine, according to leading foreign and domestic experts, is defeating the enemy at sea, has pushed its main forces to the eastern part of the Black Sea. However, for the development of success, it is necessary to build up forces and means, including taking into account the help of foreign states and the created coalitions. What are the main results of the Coalition of Maritime Capabilities and how do they affect actions at sea? - Everyone knows that foreign aid plays a very important role in the defense of Ukraine in the war with the Russian Federation, in particular at sea. The acquisition of Harpoon missile systems, other means, and intelligence at the beginning of the Russian Federation's large-scale military invasion of Ukraine ensured the stability of the Ukrainian Defense Forces, increased strike capabilities, and the ability to effectively counter the enemy. However, since December 2023, since the formation of the Coalition of Maritime Capabilities on the initiative of Great Britain and Norway, the development of the maritime capabilities of the Defense Forces of Ukraine has become systematic and planned. According to the results of the first year of the coalition, the commander of the Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine during a meeting with partners on December 11, 2024 stated that it significantly contributed to the achievement of the main goals in the war at sea. Thus, during 2024, the safety of navigation in the northwestern part of the Black Sea was ensured, the export of Ukrainian products by sea was restored, and the enemy was forced to withdraw forces from Crimea to the eastern part of the sea. In 2025, it is expected that the efficiency of the foreign road will increase, because the activity of planning the needs of the Defense Forces of Ukraine and their provision, taking into account foreign resources, is improving. The achieved level of purposefulness in the functioning of the coalitions, in particular the Coalition of Maritime Capabilities, is confirmed by the adoption of the road maps of the coalitions during the meeting of the contact group on defense issues of Ukraine on January 9, 2025. — How powerful is the Coalition of Maritime Capabilities and what areas of its activity are identified as priorities for 2025? — The Maritime Coalition is one of the most powerful among the eight currently existing coalitions to support the defense of Ukraine. It unites 19 states, twelve of which have already officially signed the instrument of accession. The following countries are known to be operating within the coalition of maritime capabilities: Great Britain, Norway, Belgium, Bulgaria, Greece, Denmark, Estonia, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, Germany, the USA, France, Sweden, Portugal, Poland, Romania and Turkey. In addition, several states (Canada, Iceland, Finland) provide their means to build up Ukraine's naval capabilities, but do not join the coalition. Also, several countries, including Australia and Japan, are studying possible areas of cooperation with the coalition. Note that, in addition to the Coalition of Naval Capabilities, the following coalitions are currently functioning: aviation, integrated air and missile defense, artillery, armored vehicles and maneuverability, drones, information technologies, demining. In addition, it is possible that the number of coalitions will increase, because on December 6, 2024, Ukrainian-French associations appealed to the President of France regarding the creation of a coalition of military instructors in Ukraine. The largest today remains the demining coalition, which includes twenty-one countries. The priorities of the Coalition of Maritime Capabilities are determined by the nature of operations at sea and the needs of the Defense Forces of Ukraine. At the moment, the primary task is, of course, to build up the strike capabilities necessary for the task of defeating those enemy forces that operate most effectively on and from the sea. The importance of the development of strike capabilities was emphasized by the commander of the Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine during a meeting with foreign coalition partners in December 2024. In addition, the capabilities necessary to protect ports and the created -sea corridor- have been prioritized. It is quite obvious that the specified priorities are determined on the basis of their importance for Ukraine in the war with the Russian Federation. After all, successful defense of the state at sea and from the sea is impossible without destroying the enemy's capabilities. At the same time, the protection of maritime exports is critical to building up Ukraine's economic capabilities in the war. When considering the priorities of the maritime coalition for 2025, it is advisable to take into account another important and particularly relevant factor today - the formation of a security package of forces and means of conditions for the start of peace negotiations. In the event of a cessation of hostilities everywhere, including at sea, there will be a need for the formation of capabilities to contain the Russian Federation and countermeasures in the event of a repeated Russian attack on Ukraine. Are and what kind of naval capabilities are necessary for this? The answer to this question is relevant in the activities of the leadership of the Defense Forces of Ukraine, the leadership of the national navy and the leadership of the Coalition of Maritime Capabilities already now. - How effectively and systematically, in your opinion, does the international Coalition of Maritime Capabilities operate in today's conditions? - You touched on a very important aspect in your question! The fact is that in the conditions when the war becomes long-term, it is precisely the comprehensively formed and implemented measures that ensure stability and the necessary result. In view of this, it is important to what extent the coalition's capability development strategy takes into account medium- and long-term projections of changes in the environment. The answer to the question can be found in the report on the results of the meeting of the leadership of the maritime coalition, which took place at the end of 2024. As it was emphasized, the road map of the Coalition of Maritime Capabilities is formed for the period until 2035. This proves that the naval coalition is working with the long-term goals of the development of the national military fleet in mind. Therefore, the activity of the maritime coalition has a high level of validity, systematicity and consistency. This is a considerable advantage, and perhaps the Coalition of Maritime Capabilities is the leader among all coalitions in this indicator. This positive experience can be used by other coalitions. - How can you assess the pace and scope of activities of the Coalition of Maritime Capabilities at the present time? - Since the creation of the maritime coalition in December 2023, the planned activities have been implemented at a fairly high pace. And could it be otherwise in the conditions when hostilities are intensifying, gaining scale and ferocity? To the credit of our partners, they not only work proactively, but also sometimes anticipate the emerging situation. They use a strategic and far-sighted approach to cooperation and assistance to Ukraine. On the other hand, it is clear that each state has its own characteristics and a certain bureaucracy. However, it should be emphasized that the current pace of cooperation within all coalitions is impressive in terms of dynamics and coverage of Ukraine's defense issues! Regarding the amount of aid provided by coalitions, of course, each state is guided by its capabilities. Within the borders of the Coalition of Naval Capabilities, the creation (procurement), supply and maintenance of a significant number of samples of naval weapons and military equipment is carried out. Examples of the provision of coastal anti-ship missile systems and Harpoon missiles to the members of the Defense Forces of Ukraine, at least more than 70 combat boats, of which the SV90 type boats are the most powerful in terms of combat potential, and dozens of marine robotic complexes of various purposes can testify to the volume of the provided weapons. In general, according to the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, within the borders of the maritime coalition, Ukraine receives: ships, boats, naval strike weapons, surveillance and intelligence equipment, anti-mine systems, and others. Technical support for the operation and deployment of assets, strengthening of amphibious capabilities, training of crews and system operators, training of marines and flotilla personnel is also carried out. In order to increase mine countermeasures, the Netherlands and Belgium will provide three Alkmaar-type mine countermeasures ships, which, together with the two minesweepers already received from Great Britain, will form the basis of a mine countermeasures joint to combat the mine danger in the Black Sea after the end of hostilities. A naval training center has been established in Romania to train marines. —What else can be expected from the naval coalition? In your opinion, which projects in the activities of the Coalition of Maritime Capabilities are the most significant and promising? — In the near future, within the Coalition of Maritime Capabilities, a significant increase in dynamics is expected to provide Ukraine with the latest means of combat at sea. It is enough to recall the statement of the leader of the coalition - Great Britain on October 22, 2024, in which the provision of 120 million pounds sterling (150 million US dollars) was announced. In addition, it was stated that Great Britain together with Norway plan to find an additional 100 million pounds to finance the coalition. The United Kingdom is also working to find resources to co-finance the delivery of hundreds of unmanned maritime vehicles and other equipment to the forces protecting the Ukrainian maritime grain corridor. It is possible that it is about unmanned surface complexes of the Snapper (-Perch-) and Wasp (-Wasp-) type, which were mentioned in his speech on January 29, 2025 by the British Defense Minister John Healy. In the context of promising projects, it will be appropriate to mention that, according to the information of the Ministry of Defense of Great Britain, on January 22, 2025, a meeting of potential manufacturers was to be held in London regarding the creation of a small unmanned combat ship (boat) under the COOKSON project. It is assumed that it will be a multi-purpose stealthy high-speed marine platform that can be a carrier of anti-ship missiles and be transported by land transport. Here it should be recalled that as early as 2021, an agreement was signed on the construction of eight missile boats by Great Britain for Ukraine. If we are talking about this variant of the implementation of this agreement, then we can expect another revolution in military affairs at sea! After all, robotic flotillas with powerful missile weapons and drones on board can radically change the course of not only any future war at sea. They can provide a decisive advantage to one of the parties in the resolution of the most crises and conflicts between the world's leading powers in any part of the world ocean or on any of the continents. - Tell me, in your opinion, what other directions and measures of joint activity within the borders of the Coalition of Maritime Capabilities could ensure increased efficiency in achieving its goals? Sharing with partners such experiences definitely happens. Exchange rates are increasing. For example, on February 17, 2025, the first joint structure of Ukraine and NATO - the Joint Analysis, Training and Education Center (JATEC) - officially began functioning in the Polish city of Bydgoszcz. One of the important functions of the center is to organize the exchange of war experiences. In view of the above, it would be very appropriate to have a separate package of activities for the joint study of the experience of warfare at sea among the priorities of the Maritime Capability Coalition. Within the limits of this package, it would also be useful to provide for the conduct of exploratory naval games and the development of scenarios for future actions at sea. Such work with the use of brainstorming methods is a productive means of developing effective strategies to fight the enemy and ensure victory at sea. In addition, thanks to these measures, our foreign partners would get more motivation to work together and increase interoperability with the armed forces of NATO member states. - What areas of activity of the Coalition of Maritime Capabilities, in your opinion, could be expanded in view of the growing interdependence of the security of Ukraine, the countries of Eastern Europe and other states in the context of the hybrid war unleashed by Russia in different parts of the world? Common threats require a common response. So it is obvious that already today and in the future, the leading manufacturers of naval weapons could, in cooperation with the Coalition of Naval Capabilities, expand the arsenal of combat capabilities not only of the Defense Forces of Ukraine, but also of the defense structures of their countries. In view of the priority directions for the development of capabilities in the ongoing war on the Black Sea, it would be rational to involve the world's leading developers of naval weapons in these directions. Thus, the Norwegian company KDA (Kongsberg Defense & Aerospace), which is a developer of NSM (Naval Strike Missile) and one of the flagships of this industry, could make a significant contribution to the development of strike capabilities. In the context of the development of underwater technologies and systems, it would be appropriate to involve the French company Naval Group, as well as the American Raytheon and the British Kraken Technology Group. The development of naval mine weapons could be facilitated by RWM Italia S.p.A., and the development of automated control systems for combat platforms by Germany's Atlas Elektronik. All the above companies and other leading manufacturers of forward-looking weapons would be very interested in testing their latest developments in the Black Sea and together with the Ukrainians create innovative technologies necessary for victories at sea. — How do you assess the effectiveness of work on the organization of the activities of the Coalition of Maritime Capabilities? — As is known, in April 2024, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine established the Coalition Support Office in order to improve the coordination of actions in working with partners. One of the important functions of this structure is also the planning of work within each of the coalitions. Therefore, we should expect a balancing of the needs of the Defense Forces of Ukraine and the resources that can be provided by foreign partners. At the same time, during the improvement of the activities of the Coalition of Maritime Capabilities, one of the promising directions, as can be seen, is the clarification of the goals and tasks of international cooperation, taking into account the ones already concluded by Ukraine in 2023-2024. security agreements with a number of foreign countries. Based on the goals and measures laid down in the agreements, it is possible to focus the attention of partners on the resources most expected by Ukraine. It is also important to emphasize the order of distribution of resources accumulated by the coalition. It is advisable to prioritize spending on short-term projects. After all, the absolute priority is the protection of the independence of Ukraine already now, in the conditions of the ongoing war. According to experts, in this context, the ratio in the allocation of measures and costs in the provision of assistance by other states can be: measures to ensure actions now and victory in the war - 70-95%, for medium-term and long-term projects - 5-30%. Under such conditions, we can count on focusing our efforts on the main task of repelling aggression and protecting Ukraine's national interests at sea.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/23/morska-koalicziya-yak-zahid-ozbroyuye-ukrayinu-dlya-vijny-na-mori/	2025-02-22T20:56:09-08:00
Hot air balloonists return to the military: a payload delivery system launched from a balloon was in...	As stated on the official portal of this Canadian company located in the province of Alberta, this innovative system called Eagle (translated from English as -eagle-) is the world's first high-altitude military glider launched with the help of a balloon, ArmyInform reports. -The Eagle system combines stealth, versatility and high performance for modern military operations,- its creators emphasize. According to technical specifications, the advanced payload delivery system is capable of reaching stratospheric heights. The Eagle is designed to deliver -precise payloads hundreds of miles- regardless of operational complexity. Recent tests have confirmed its performance in extreme environmental conditions, -underscoring its reliability and ability to adapt to harsh real-world scenarios,- according to analysts of the Dutch defense research portal Army Recognition. It is worth recalling that the stratosphere is the second layer of the Earth's atmosphere located above the troposphere. It begins at an altitude of about 8-20 kilometers from the surface and extends to an altitude of about 50 kilometers. According to Defense Industry Europe's publication, the Eagle APDS was designed to -reimagine high-altitude, long-range military aerospace capabilities.- Its innovative variable airfoil provides a smooth transition between supersonic speeds and low barrage speeds, guaranteeing adaptability to different tasks. The system allows you to combine the possibility of both controlled operators and fully autonomous flights. -The key point in the Eagle's design is its stealth and survivability. With a minimal radar signature and resistance to EW equipment interference, the complex can operate deep in the enemy's rear,- the portal clarifies. If we delve into the history of aeronautics, in 1783 the brothers Joseph and Etienne Montgolfier raised a balloon to a height of more than 1,000 meters. This was the first public demonstration of a balloon. The French scientist-physicist Jacques Alexandre César Charles also worked on the creation of an airship. In 1783, he made a ball, which he filled with hydrogen gas. Depending on the different ways of filling the balloons, they received different names. The spheres filled with warm air were called -montgolfiers- and those filled with hydrogen were called -charliers-. The first -Charlier- was launched from the Field of Mars in Paris in 1783. The idea of ​​launching military reconnaissance probes is not new either. As our agency informed, in February 2023 the Russian invaders decided to use weapons that had not yet been used against the Defense Forces of Ukraine formerly balloons. Over our territory, in some places, the Ukrainian military noticed numerous balloons with corner reflectors launched by the aggressors. At the same time, everyone probably remembers the sudden vulnerability of the USA to the appearance of such objects over its territory. Shooting down such an object in the stratosphere is an extremely difficult task, and barrage from such a height will allow you to bypass the enemy's air defense positions. In general, balloons have been used for military purposes since the middle of the 19th century. In 1849, the Austrian general Franz von Uchatius proposed during the siege of Venice to release several dozen bullets with incendiary bombs towards the city. The attempt was not too successful - the city was practically not damaged, and some of the bullets were carried by the wind to the positions of the Austrians. Later, balloons began to be used in military affairs quite widely, but rarely as bombers. The main advantage of the modern Canadian Eagle is its ability to carry a wide range of payloads, including equipment for gathering intelligence, surveillance or high-precision munitions. This capability enhances its role in military operations, providing commanders with a versatile tool that can be quickly adapted to meet changing mission needs. The system's ability to operate in environments where traditional GPS guidance systems may be compromised or unavailable further emphasizes its tactical importance. The design and technology of the Eagle is designed to support a range of mission types, including intelligence gathering, electronic warfare and precision strikes, while operating in a variety of TVD environments from arctic to desert environments.

The new -masterpiece- of the Kremlin fantasists about -medical experiments- in Ukraine: what did the...	Any information campaign of the Russian Federation works according to a proven scheme: loud accusations, no real evidence and maximum fear-mongering. This was the case with -crucified boys-, -NATO war geese-, -secret biolabs- and -war mosquitoes-. Now it is the turn of the medical field. It is interesting that none of these -experiments- have been documented by independent sources, no witnesses have been able to confirm such cases, and, the funniest thing, there are no secret laboratories in Ukrainian hospitals where doctors -atrocize-. On the contrary, Ukrainian military hospitals work according to the best world standards, rescuing wounded soldiers, and civilian hospitals heroically extract victims from Russian shelling. the Russian army is deliberately destroying the Ukrainian medical infrastructure. Hospitals and emergency rooms are targeted for their attacks. They attack maternity hospitals, children's wards, civilian medical facilities - and all this is documented by international organizations. Therefore, when Moscow tries to accuse Ukraine of unethical treatment of the wounded, it is not just cynicism, it is a desire to hide its own war crimes. The goal is obvious: to demonize Ukraine, to create an image for the domestic Russian consumer to justify the war and its own crimes. The more absurd and the more terrifying the lie, the easier it is to manipulate. A person who believed in -Ukrainian Nazis- will easily believe in -medical experiments.- Ukrainian doctors are people who save lives in conditions of constant threat. And Russian propagandists are people who invent fairy tales for those who are not capable of critical thinking. So, once again, we are dealing not with an investigation or the truth, but with a primitive information dump, which is calculated on irrational fear and hatred. Now tell me honestly: maybe next time they will invent something about -Ukrainian sorcerers- resurrecting the military? Because, it seems, the fantasy of propaganda has long gone beyond common sense.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/23/novyj-shedevr-kremlivskyh-fantazeriv-pro-medychni-eksperymenty-v-ukrayini-shho-vygadaly-czogo-razu/	2025-02-22T20:05:57-08:00
The President of Ukraine listened to the reports of the defenders and noted the four divisions	The Office of the President informs about this on February 22. In particular, according to the results of this week, the head of state honored the soldiers of the 425th separate assault regiment for the destruction of the occupiers, as well as the soldiers of the 59th separate assault brigade of unmanned systems named after Yakov Handziuk, who defend Ukraine in the Pokrovsky direction. He also noted the resilience and bravery of Ukrainian soldiers in Kurshchyna, in particular the fighters of the 47th separate mechanized brigade and the 95th separate amphibious assault brigade. -Today we continue our international work, new talks with partners are very useful talks: there will be more support in Europe, more interaction. Now we are doing very concrete things so that conversations about Ukraine and all of Europe take place with the participation of Ukraine and Europe,- he said. According to him, security guarantees are what unites the absolute majority. -And Europe, America, all our partners in the world need a common understanding of how to guarantee that Putin will no longer be able to deceive anyone and that Russia will not be able to bring death to other nations - from Ukraine and Europe to Syria and the countries of the Middle East and Africa,- he emphasized. According to him, over the past 30 years, Ukrainians have seen too many ruins and deaths, the blame for which lies precisely with Russia - with the Russian army, with their special services, with their mercenaries. -The world needs guarantees, and I thank everyone for their support,- the President noted. As reported by ArmyInform, the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky had a conversation with the Prime Minister of the Netherlands Dick Schoof after meeting in Munich and discussed with him the just end of the war and the strengthening of unity in Europe. Ukraine is counting on strengthening the F-16 fleet.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/22/prezydent-ukrayiny-zasluhav-dopovidi-oboroncziv-i-vidznachyv-chotyry-pidrozdily/	2025-02-22T10:56:11-08:00

Operators of attack UAVs work on any enemy target that appears in the field of vision. -War is evil, but allowing evil to win is even worse. We will stop him. We will endure. We will win,- &#8211; stressed the paratroopers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/22/vluchnist-i-shvydkist-na-pokrovskomu-napryamku-desantnyky-fpv-dronamy-znyshhyly-vorozhu-tehniku/	2025-02-21T23:07:05-08:00

-Paradox- from M113: about the rescue of -wounded- -Emka- 2 of the International Legion	-Paradox- told ArmyInform about the tasks and advantages of the legendary -emka- during the evacuation of the wounded, as well as the story of the rescue of an armored personnel carrier damaged during one of the evacuation trips. — The call sign -Paradox- came to me somehow spontaneously. At first, I thought about the nickname -Veles-, I wanted to be called as an ancient pagan god. And then I wanted -Paradox- - that's how it caught on, - the military man jokes about his call sign. By education, Paradox is a chef, he also studied in Lviv at the college of restaurant, hotel and tourism business. In civilian life, he worked in the field of Internet access services. He spent a lot of time in Europe, but, he admits, he always wanted to go home to his native Lviv. The man joined the Armed Forces for the first time in 2017, when he served his military service. He then signed a contract that expired in 2021, about a year before the full-scale invasion began. — Literally 11 months after the end of the contract, a full-scale war began and on February 28, 2022, I returned to service. And in 2023, I was lucky enough to be transferred to the 2nd International Legion, where I serve to this day, the man says. Paradox serves as a sanitary instructor and commander of M113, an armored personnel carrier used to evacuate wounded soldiers to the nearest rear for providing them with medical assistance at a stabilization point. - I am responsible for this car and everything related to it. I am her driver and the one who carries out the evacuation of the wounded, he explains. -Emka-, emphasizes -Paradox-, can do a lot. In addition to the primary task of evacuating the wounded, M113s help to conduct rotations, provide logistics, and pull out equipment stuck on the road. -In principle, these are exactly the tasks for which this armored personnel carrier was created as a combat tracked armored vehicle of increased cross-country ability,- Paradox emphasizes. You can learn to drive the M113 in 3‒4 hours — Driving the M113 is not difficult at all. We were given two weeks to study and even finished everything a little earlier, because the -beerka- - combat order - came and we had to leave. And in general, you can learn to drive it literally in 3-4 hours, there is absolutely nothing difficult there, - assures the soldier. -Paradox- is satisfied with American equipment because of its reliability, functionality, unpretentiousness and ease of use. — This is an American technique that does almost everything for you. There is an automatic transmission and a steering wheel - everything is simple, as in cars with an -automatic-. By and large, it is not significantly different. If you do everything with a cold mind, this car is just perfect, notes -Paradox-. According to him, neither the weight, nor the dimensions, nor the crawler base pose any problems for beginners. It is enough to be attentive - and in a few hours you can get used to everything. The intensity of work of -emka- on the front line depends on many factors. Occasionally there may be a day without a single departure, on average there are 5-6 such departures per day, but there may be more. When it comes to rotation or cargo delivery, they are planned in advance and carried out mainly in the dark. When it is necessary to evacuate a wounded person, everything depends on his condition. — If the -three hundredth- is light and can wait until dark, then we evacuate it -by gray.- If the -three hundredth- is difficult, then we have no way out - we have to go after it, because we understand that every minute, as they say, is worth its weight in gold. Then we go if it's light and even when enemy drones are flying. Then we have no way out, because these are our brothers and we must get them out, the health instructor emphasizes. In such situations, when you have to take risks, -Paradox- relies entirely on its own skills and experience, as well as on the unique qualities of the M113 - speed, maneuverability, maneuverability and, above all, security. — There is no way to -flash- it with a machine gun or a machine gun. A direct hit by a mine, if it's an -eighty-, for example, I think it will take it easy. -Emka- withstands hitting an anti-tank mine as well. It breaks down, but the crew remains alive and without serious injuries, the military assures. Of course, the M113 armor cannot withstand a direct hit from a tank gun, but there are few chances of -running into- an enemy tank. On the other hand, FPV drone strikes with cumulative charges are much more dangerous. However, the protective grilles additionally installed on the armored personnel carrier help a lot. — We worked with the previous brigade in Chasovoy Yar, then their -emka- left the battlefield on its own after 13 FPVs flew into it. At the same time, she had literally the same as ours - welded-on grids, nothing more. They really help, Paradox explains. The M113, which we are reviewing, arrived at the 2nd International Legion without any protective structures, so they had to be installed on site. Thanks to this, the armored car, protected on all sides by grills, has a formidable, bristling appearance. There should always be two fighters in the crew of an evacuation -emka- - a driver and a paramedic who provides assistance, helps to load the wounded and monitors his condition while driving. - The lightly wounded can get into the armored personnel carrier independently through the door, for the -severe- we lower the apparatus. But the fighters must be warned not to approach the machine until the apron is completely lowered, says the medical instructor. A half-ton harness can indeed be dangerous if handled carelessly, but it's extremely handy when you need to get a casualty in quickly. It is necessary to do this as soon as possible, because during the slightest delay, the enemy can detect the armored vehicle and strike at it. - We try to fit in 30 seconds - this is the optimal download time. After 30 seconds, the enemy is able to calculate the target and deal fire damage. That is, it is highly undesirable to stand for longer, the military officer emphasizes. ILLUSTRATION 09 CAPTION: Photo by Ruslan Tarasov / ArmiyaInform No special medical equipment is provided in the evacuation -emka-, because it is impossible to provide assistance to the wounded while moving - the armored vehicle jerks in all directions at speed. The main thing is to deliver the -three hundredth- to the stabilization point as soon as possible. - During movement, absolutely nothing can be done, because you are constantly thrown left and right and back and forth, it is impossible to take any stable position. The best thing we can do is to drive quickly without stopping, explains the health instructor. First aid was already provided to the wounded before the arrival of the evacuation team, so the task of the M113 crew was to maintain the existing stable condition of the soldier and ensure his speedy delivery to the stabilization point. — This is an evacuation from the front point to the -stabik-, because, in fact, you will do absolutely nothing on the move. You just have time, and you try to drive as fast as possible during that time and deliver it to the stabilization point, -Paradox- describes the task of the emka crew. Emka left even with a damaged track Although the M113 is a reliable helper in rescuing the wounded, sometimes the -Emka- itself needs help due to the damage it received. Then the armored personnel carrier itself has to be evacuated from the battlefield. -Paradox- tells about the case when the M113 caterpillar ran over an anti-personnel mine. For some time, the armored personnel carrier was still able to continue moving, but in the end it -dislodged- and had to be towed out. — We continued moving, managed to bog down the heavy -three hundredth-, turned around and even drove a kilometer away from the position - and even then the track broke. I had to leave the car and find shelter in the landing next to it, because the -Emka- began to be fired upon, - says -Paradox-. In the evening of the same day, they tried to evacuate the emka with the help of an Oshkosh tractor, but could only move it 800 meters, because the -Oshkosh- ran out of power on the steep climb. However, this movement saved M113 - the enemy lost sight of the evacuation armored personnel carrier. The rescue of the armored personnel carrier was continued with the help of a -motoliga-, and when it did not cope, even a tank was involved in the evacuation. Special cables had to be found for it, and on the second attempt, the heavy battleship eventually managed. — We found the tank with our neighbors. Drove in at dusk, got caught in the cables. The first ones broke because the -bucket- sunk into the ground, and we had to drag it down the hill. Then they found special tank cables and were able to bring our car to the nearest village, Paradox recalls. From there, the further evacuation of the armored personnel carrier went more smoothly and soon the repaired M113 was able to return to service to continue to help save the lives of the wounded. The now-repaired -emka- is a reliable assistant and fast armored warhorse of the Medical Service of the International Legion 2.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/22/paradoks-iz-m113-pro-poryatunok-poranenoyi-emky-2-internaczionalnogo-legionu/	2025-02-21T20:53:59-08:00

In the evening of the same day, they tried to evacuate the emka with the help of an Oshkosh tractor, but could only move it 800 meters, because the -Oshkosh- ran out of power on the steep climb. However, this movement saved M113 - the enemy lost sight of the evacuation armored personnel carrier. The rescue of the armored personnel carrier was continued with the help of a -motoliga-, and when it did not cope, even a tank was involved in the evacuation. Special cables had to be found for it, and on the second attempt, the heavy battleship eventually managed. — We found the tank with our neighbors. Drove in at dusk, got caught in the cables. The first ones broke because the -bucket- sunk into the ground, and we had to drag it down the hill. Then they found special tank cables and were able to bring our car to the nearest village, Paradox recalls. From there, the further evacuation of the armored personnel carrier went more smoothly and soon the repaired M113 was able to return to service to continue to help save the lives of the wounded. The now-repaired -emka- is a reliable assistant and fast armored warhorse of the Medical Service of the International Legion 2.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/22/paradoks-iz-m113-pro-poryatunok-poranenoyi-emku-2-internaczionalnogo-legionu/	2025-02-21T20:53:59-08:00
Combat digitized -earth-moving machine-: an Asian company supplied the Singaporean army with the lat...	As the defense portal Asian Military Review informs, the new machine called Hunter Armored Engineer Vehicle (HT-AEV) is equipped with a backhoe boom and a front loading system and a gripping lever, which makes it ideal for clearing obstacles in various combat and natural environments. ArmyInform notes. The HT-AEV, developed jointly with Singapore's Defense Science and Technology Agency (DSTA) and local company ST Engineering, is to replace the British combat engineer tractor FV180 (CET) which has been in use since the 1990s. According to the weapons market researchers from the Netherlands portal Army Recognition (AR), the Hunter Engineer Armored Vehicle (HT-AEV) is based on the Hunter Armored Fighting Vehicle (HT-AFV) platform, designed to provide mobility, protection and digitized operations. One of the key features of the HT-AEV is the presence of an all-round camera system, which allows the crew to operate with closed hatches, which minimizes the need for a large number of personnel and increases effectiveness in combat conditions. The machine is operated by a crew of two people: a mechanic-driver and an operator. The HT-AEV is part of the broader Hunter platform family, which also includes vehicles such as the Hunter Recovery Vehicle (HT-HRV) and the Hunter Armored Vehicle-Launched Bridge (HT-AVLB). Each of them is designed to perform specific tasks within engineering and combat operations. The technical characteristics of the HT-AEV and HT-AVLB have not been disclosed, although it is known that the base model Hunter AFV measures 6.9 m in length and 3.4 m in width and has a combat weight of approximately 29 tons. Launched in February 2022, the HT-HRV is equipped with a 360-degree telescopic jib crane and a 25,500 kg pull winch. This makes it an effective tool for restoring armored vehicles and other vehicles. Entered into service in November 2022, the HT-AVLB deploys modular bridges and replaces older designs based on the SM-1, which greatly increases troop mobility and maneuverability. Development of the Hunter platform began in 2006 as a collaboration between DSTA, ST Engineering and the Singapore Army to replace the Ultra M113 armored personnel carriers of the 1970s. Entered into service in 2019, the Hunter AFV was the Singapore Army's first fully digitized armored platform. Variants such as HT-HRV, HT-AVLB and HT-AEV were later added. The platform integrates the Army's tactical information system (ARTEMIS) for real-time mission planning and coordination, and its modular design supports roles such as combat, recovery, guidance bridges and engineering tasks. An integrated combat cockpit provides joint control between crew members, and a system for monitoring the functioning of mechanisms and aggregates helps in maintenance. As AR analysts point out, the transition of the Singapore Army to advanced systems such as the HT-AEV reflects the changing requirements for engineering vehicles in modern military operations.

Ground unmanned complexes: - Predators of heights - already use robots on the front	How robotic ground complexes are used against the occupiers, about the specifics of their combat work and tasks, the commander of the -Predators of Heights- battalion, Major Maxim with the call sign -Condor-, told ArmiyaInform. -In addition to the unmanned aircraft component, we use ground unmanned complexes in everyday combat activities. We are moving towards improving our capabilities and combat operations. In this context, our main task is not to win the war at any cost, but to defeat the enemy while preserving our personnel. For us, every Ukrainian life is a great value, unlike Russians. The concept of the Unmanned Systems Forces is that unmanned systems should be the main component of an assault of any type. It used to be a human, a stormtrooper. Now we are trying to make the attack aircraft an additional component for unmanned components in the conduct of assault operations. Plus, we have to make sure that, thanks to the use of unmanned technologies, the danger is diverted from the soldier who is on the line of battle. At the forefront, we use FPV drones, Mavic, and Autel, and heavy bombers, and reconnaissance UAVs, and plus ground robotic complexes. In such a symbiosis of various unmanned systems on the battlefield, it is much easier and more efficient for a simple attack aircraft to do its job. In general, robotic ground complexes can be assigned the tasks of fire damage, demining, demining and performing kamikaze missions, logistical operations, in particular evacuation. That is, the set of tasks is actually very large. Here, in Donetsk region, in conditions of intense hostilities, we actively use these ground complexes for various combat tasks. For example, kamikaze machines with 30 kg of explosives on board overcome the path to the enemy's shelter, enter the dugout from above and successfully detonate the ramparts. No wooden shelter can withstand such an explosion. How it happens: the crews of the machine itself and the Mavik UAV work in pairs. The operator of the machine looks at the monitor of the broadcast conducted by the drone, because the complex does not have its own camera. From above in the air, the machine is accompanied to the target by the -Mavik- pilot. Before that, we do reconnaissance of the route, see if there are any obstacles and impassable sections. When the ground complex reaches the target, the machine operator remotely detonates the explosives. That's it, the enemy is destroyed! In addition to the kamikaze machine, we can also make a reset from the UAV in order to fix the result for sure. That is, we perform tasks in a complex. There are machines that are engaged in purely mining the paths of probable advance of assault groups or enemy armored vehicles. That is, it is no longer necessary for military personnel to do it themselves and be exposed to danger. Robots go there, with the help of special mining systems, lay various types of mines on the terrain and return back. They make various mine obstacles. We mainly use changers at a distance of 5-8 km. Depending on the training of the crew, they can also be used at night. Again, work in tandem with the Mavika operator. For example, we can see where the tank-dangerous areas are. The machine reached that road, at a specific point the operator pressed a button on the control panel and unloaded the mine. If it is necessary to lay a mine somewhere else, the machine leaves 20-30 meters away and does it again. In general, one machine-changer can transport 4 anti-tank mines and deploy them. After that, the ground complex turns back. There are ground complexes that provide logistics for our front-line units. Provisions, water, BC, medicines are delivered. In short, we can provide everything that the guys on the front line need. When I was still the commander of the first infantry battalion of the 59th brigade, we in the unit began to actively use ground complexes during combat missions two years ago. I remember that it was quite difficult with logistics in the Pisky settlement area. These machines really helped us out then. There was one position that was difficult to get into. In two walks, cars brought food, BC, batteries for the radio station and medical preparations for the boys who were there for a very long time. During the second walk, the enemy saw the machine and began to inflict fire damage on it. Yes, it was destroyed, but it fulfilled its mission. Our infantry continued to defend the area and destroy the invaders. The use of these machines actually saved the infantry. Ground complexes should become an important element of any military operations. The enemy does not stand still. It is also evolving. In some units in our direction, the enemy began to use robotic ground systems, but in small numbers. First of all, to ensure logistics. Somehow, we discovered the operation of the Katsap complex. The reaction was immediate. The enemy machine was destroyed by various means of defeat, which are in the arsenal of the -Predators of Heights- battalion. It did not even reach the Russian attack aircraft, which were in the forest plantation and were waiting for the replenishment of the BC.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/22/nazemni-bezpilotni-kompleksy-hyzhaky-vysot-vzhe-vykorystovuyut-robotiv-na-fronti/	2025-02-21T20:25:11-08:00
A parade of lies until February 23: Russia is again -defending itself- against fictitious terrorist ...	The Russian media are already actively spreading statements that the -Kyiv regime- (that's right, because the Kremlin has long refused to call Ukraine a state) is allegedly planning explosions in Moscow, Belgorod and even in Crimea. As always, -from reliable sources- that no one has ever seen or verified. And to reinforce horror stories, they add photos from the archive or unknown videos, which usually turn out to be staged. It is interesting that such -throwaways- always appear just before domestic political dates. The goal is to rally Russians around the mythical image of the -enemy-, raise the rating of the army and justify new repressions against their own citizens. After all, every -terrorist attack- that did not happen is a great opportunity for the FSB to show off its -brilliant- work. The most interesting thing is that some of these fakes have a peculiarity - they often become self-fulfilling prophecies. Explosions, arsons and attacks attributed to Ukraine suddenly happen, but their perpetrators turn out to be not Ukrainians at all, but -indifferent- citizens of the Russian Federation. In the best traditions of the genre, Russian security forces sometimes -neutralize- conditional -saboteurs- or catch -Ukrainian spies- with incredibly theatrical sets of physical evidence - from tridents to SBU agents' certificates marked -secret-. During the analysis of such information leaks, it becomes obvious: the goal is to divert the attention of the population from real problems. And if last year they shouted about -Ukrainian terrorist attacks- in February, then in April - about a -nuclear threat-, and in August - about -attacks on the energy system-. The content does not change, only the date changes. Each such fake is part of a large information war, where Russia is not only trying to create a -terrorist state- out of Ukraine in the eyes of its own population, but also to divert the attention of the international community from its war crimes. Therefore, it is important to expose such manipulations, sort them out and show the reality: it is Russia that engages in terrorist attacks, provocations, and war, not its victims. So don't be surprised if, a year before February 23, you hear again about the -terrible Ukrainian plan to destroy Russia.- After all, the main thing for the Kremlin is not reality, but the creation of another pretext for repression and mobilization. And while the Russian Federation itself is afraid of -fictional terrorists-, Ukraine continues to fight against a real aggressor.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/22/parad-brehni-do-23-lyutogo-rosiya-znovu-zahyshhayetsya-vid-vygadanyh-teraktiv/	2025-02-21T20:04:19-08:00
Botfarms and fakes: the special services of the Russian Federation conduct information sabotage	The SBU informs about this on February 21. -For provocations, the Russian special services have used the full potential of their bot farms and massively use controlled groups and fake accounts in popular messengers and social networks, most actively in TikTok and Telegram,- the report says. In destructive content, the enemy spreads fake information about the alleged spread of protest sentiments among Ukrainians and street riots in various regions of our country. -At the same time, the Rashists call on citizens to hold mass actions in order to violate public order and the constitutional order, and offer funds for participation in rallies,- the SBU said. The Security Service carries out all the necessary response measures and works out existing and potential threats to the national security of Ukraine. -The SBU appeals to citizens to be vigilant and not to react to hostile provocations that the Russian Federation uses to try to undermine the internal situation in our country,- the SBU noted. It is noted that actions aimed at violently changing or overthrowing the constitutional order or seizing state power contain signs of a crime under Article 109 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine, which is punishable by up to 10 years of imprisonment. -The experience of Ukrainians' heroic resistance to Russian aggression has repeatedly proven that it is in unity that our people are able to resist the enemy most effectively. And no Russian IPSO can undermine our national spirit!- — emphasized the SBU. We would like to remind you that if you are being recruited to set fire to a car of the Armed Forces, an administrative building, a terrorist attack or a mine attack, immediately report it to the SBU chatbot.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/21/botofermy-ta-fejky-speczsluzhby-rf-provodyat-informaczijni-dyversiyi/	2025-02-21T11:58:44-08:00
Food and use of humanitarian vehicles: the government made important decisions for the military	reported this by the acting state secretary MOU of Nikita Nikitenko. The first resolution &#8211; -On making changes to the food standards of servicemen of the Armed Forces and other military formations.- According to these changes, it is planned to provide additional food to the servicemen of the State Security Department who are on combat duty, day duty, and in the case of their appointment to the day duty, related to ensuring the safety of officials and objects that require state protection. The second resolution is called -On Amendments to Clause 16 of the Regulation on the Procedure for Accounting, Storage, Decommissioning and Use of Military Property in the Armed Forces.- The changes provide for the possibility of writing off used fuel and lubricants, spare and component parts for the repair, maintenance, and operation of vehicles that were received by servicemen as humanitarian aid help As reported by ArmyInform, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine is introducing a new control system for the supply of canned goods to the Armed Forces of Ukraine. According to the new rules, the supplier creates an invoice in the system before shipping the products, indicating the corresponding number of the test report.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/21/harchuvannya-ta-vykorystannya-gumanitarnyh-avto-uryad-uhvalyv-vazhlyvi-rishennya-dlya-vijskovyh/	2025-02-21T11:37:54-08:00
Traded medical certificates and escape routes abroad: 4 schemes for evaders were liquidated	The SBU informs about this on February 21. As a result of comprehensive measures in different regions of Ukraine, 7 organizers of riots were detained. -Criminals traded fake medical certificates or escape -routes- across the border to bypass checkpoints. The cost of such -services- ranged from 2 to 15 thousand US dollars per petitioner,- the report said. So, in Kyiv, a neurologist, a member of the military medical commission, was arrested for bribery. The official took money for issuing fake diagnoses that would limit participation in combat operations at the front. Also, the military counter-intelligence of the SBU, together with the police, detained two residents of the capital, who were selling the geo-locators of -bypass- paths on the border of Ukraine and the European Union. In addition, three members of a criminal group were detained in Kropyvnytskyi, who were trading in forged medical certificates of the VLK to remove them from the military register due to their health status. In Vinnytsia, a 34-year-old director of a confectionery company was detained, who tried to unjustifiably include the enterprise in the list of critical importance, in order to then issue -bookings- for evaders. -To implement the criminal scheme, the person involved artificially inflated the number of concluded contracts for the supply of their own products and the company's overall profits,- the SBU reported. During the searches of the workplaces and residences of the perpetrators, documents, mobile phones and computers with evidence of weapons were found. Based on all the revealed facts, the detainees were informed of the suspicion of crimes committed under three articles of the Criminal Code of Ukraine: The accused face up to 10 years in prison with confiscation of property. ArmyInform reminds that it is better not to break the law or risk your life, but to use the aggregator of vacancies in the Armed Forces and recruiting centers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/21/torguvaly-meddovidkamy-j-marshrutamy-vtechi-za-kordon-likvidovano-4-shemy-dlya-uhylyantiv/	2025-02-21T11:32:57-08:00

Payment only for verified food: MOU implements digital control of products for the Armed Forces	This is reported by the Ministry of Defense on February 21. According to the new rules, the supplier creates an invoice in the system before shipping the products, indicating the corresponding number of the test report. If this number is not entered, the special database in the DOT-Chain IT system will not allow the invoice to be generated, which will make it impossible to supply products without laboratory control. The introduction of new control mechanisms was a response to discovered abuses by unscrupulous suppliers. The head of the Central Department of Quality Control of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, Ihor Leshchenko, said that during the inspections, it was found that the amount of canned products sent to the Armed Forces significantly exceeds the amount checked by veterinary laboratories. -Because of this, there have been questions about the quality of the products. Therefore, we have decided to change the very monitoring system for the supply of such products to ensure transparency and strengthen control,- he noted. Therefore, all laboratory test reports are now sent to the State Frontline Operator (DOT), which enters them into the DOT-Chain. It contains detailed information about the products: test report number, date of manufacture, manufacturer, lot size, etc. -DoT continues to digitize more and more processes in the field of food supply to the Armed Forces. The implementation of a joint initiative with the Central Department of Quality Control of the Ministry of Education and Culture is another example of how modern solutions allow us to quickly and promptly respond to violations,- noted Volodymyr Chugai, head of the Department of Product Management of the DOT. According to him, from now on, not only military units will be able to form online complaints about the quality of products in DOT-Chain, but the system itself will be able to proactively detect potential threats. The system analyzes the invoices daily, comparing them with the database of test reports. If the supply limit is exceeded, the violation is automatically recorded, and the supplier must provide an explanation. If the violation is confirmed, the company will pay a significant fine, and excess products will be prohibited from being issued and will be sent for laboratory testing. Thus, thanks to the DOT-Chain system, the supplier receives payment only for verified products, which should exclude financial interest for fraud. The control system is already in operation and is constantly being improved for even more effective monitoring and prevention of the risk of supplying dangerous or low-quality products to the Armed Forces. As reported by ArmyInform, feeding of the military is carried out in accordance with state norms that ensure a complete daily ration. In the field, military personnel are provided with individual rations, and during a stationary stay, three or four meals a day, depending on the standard of provision.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/21/plata-lyshe-za-perevireni-harchi-mou-vprovadzhuye-czyfrovyj-kontrol-produkcziyi-dlya-zsu/	2025-02-21T06:09:05-08:00

In the Kyiv region, Russian agents were detained with a fire extinguisher-bomb	This was reported on February 21 by the Security Service of Ukraine. The main targets of the enemy were the bases of local police units, the TCC and the prosecutor's office. As the investigation established, the agents had the right to choose the first -object- to blow up among them. However, thanks to the anticipatory actions of the SBU, the terrorist attack was prevented. According to the case file, the occupiers remotely recruited two unemployed people from the Kyiv region - a 27-year-old drug addict and his roommate, who were looking for -easy- money on Telegram channels - to carry out the enemy's mission. According to the instructions of the FSB, the agents settled in a hostel near Kyiv, where they began to secretly manufacture an improvised explosive device (IED). To make it, those involved purchased chemical components for the synthesis of an explosive substance, as well as striking elements in the form of metal bolts, nails and aluminum shavings. Next, the attackers prepared a fire extinguisher, which was supposed to be a container for disguising the SVP. After making the explosives, they planned to -report- to the FSB about their readiness to commit a crime and obtain geolocation for its establishment. SBU employees exposed the agents in advance, documented their contacts with the Russian special services and preparations for terrorist attacks. At the final stage of the special operation, both involved were caught red-handed when they were making explosive components for the SVP. During the search, the following were seized from them: — 2 kg of explosives; — a fire extinguisher that was converted into a -container- for explosives; — striking elements for SVP. In addition, the detainees were found to have mobile phones with evidence of communication with the FSB, as well as a video recorder on which they were supposed to record the planned terrorist attack. So far, the persons involved have been notified of their suspicion under several articles of the Criminal Code of Ukraine: — ch. 1 Art. 14, ch. 2 Art. 258 (preparation to commit a terrorist act by prior conspiracy by a group of persons); — ch. 2 Art. 263-1 (illegal manufacture of explosive substances and explosive devices). The perpetrators are in custody. They face up to 12 years in prison with confiscation of property. As reported by ArmyInform, 7 more arsonists were arrested, who face a minimum of 8 years in prison.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/21/na-kyyivshhyni-zatrymaly-rosijskyh-agentiv-z-vognegasnykom-bomboyu/	2025-02-21T00:47:23-08:00

The fantasy world of the Russian Federation: a fake about the mass return of Ukrainian women for mob...	This time, the Russian disinformation machine released another masterpiece: Ukrainian women are allegedly being deported en masse from Europe in order to&#8230; forcibly sent to the front. According to the Kremlin's methods, the scenario looks something like this: Of course, there is zero evidence for this. But who has that ever stopped? The fake about the -mass return of Ukrainian women for mobilization- is as real as -NATO combat mosquitoes-. The reasons are traditional: When the Kremlin runs out of arguments, the fake machine is turned on. She spits out into the world incredible stories about Ukrainian women who for some reason do not want -liberation- from Russia and instead voluntarily fight for their country. But the problem is that the truth is always stronger than a lie, and Ukrainians have long learned to recognize the Kremlin's delusions. And if Russia is really afraid of Ukrainian women, then it has reason to be afraid. Because our women not only fight back at the front, but also shatter all their false myths.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/21/svit-fantazij-rf-fejk-pro-masove-povernennya-ukrayinok-dlya-mobilizacziyi/	2025-02-20T21:04:58-08:00
The ghostly story of the Mirages: how the famous French fighters were created	About the Mirage, the ArmyInform reporter asked Andrii Haruk, a military historian, doctor of historical sciences, professor of the Department of Humanities at the National Academy of Land Forces named after Hetman Petr Sahaydachny. — I immediately warn those who tuned in to a story in the style of the birth of the F-16 -Combat Falcon- - with a competition of hunting and bombing mafias, secret intrigues and open competitions. No, this will not be in our conversation, but it will be about the leisurely evening conversations of the two presidents in the Elysee Palace, it will be about marketing calculations and banal accounting calculations&#8230; - Andriy Ivanovych, after all, what was the basis for the creation of -Mirages-? - In the 60s of the last century, the company -Avion Marcel Dassault- experienced a real boom. Its -deltas- - tailless fighter planes with a triangular wing - collected contract after contract. The Mirage III fighter was a worthy competition for American and Soviet machines. A simplified version of it, Mirage 5, was created especially for export, and it was successfully sold on four continents. The Mirage IV strategic bomber, although it had no chance of becoming mass production, was an extremely prestigious product, because it became one of the components of the French strategic nuclear triad. But the managers and designers of AMD - as the company was called for short - did not relax. The arms market demanded new products - without this, the threat of losing the conquered positions became real. There was no need to worry about the domestic consumer - already in the 60s, AMD actually became a monopoly in France in the field of creation and production of combat aircraft. But foreign buyers wanted something new&#8230; Therefore, after the French Air Force abandoned the development of the Mirage F2 and Mirage F3 projects - two-seater fighters, in which AMD designers abandoned the -delta- and applied a high-flying scheme with a swept wing and a normal tail (this term is called classic plumage with a keel and a stabilizer), - the company invested its own funds in the cheaper and simpler Mirage F1 single-seat fighter. — And how did their competitors react to such a policy of French aircraft designers? The same creators of the F-16 from General Dynamics? After all, this kind of -intraspecies- struggle for the sales markets of combat aircraft has never stopped? - Indeed, the competition there was serious. And -Mirage F1- was considered as a competitor of F-16 in the fight for the markets of four European NATO countries. And although the -contest of the century- -Mirage F1- lost, the investment fully paid for itself. Such aircraft were not only exported to one and a half dozen countries, but were also purchased by the French Air Force as a -transitional option-. - And what, at least for a certain time, did the officials in the department, which is now called the Ministry of the Armed Forces of the French Republic, stop their choice? - Another aircraft was to be the -final option- for France - the Mirage G8, in which the popular on the frontier was implemented 60-70s scheme with a wing of variable geometry. The American F-111 and F-14, the Soviet MiG-23, Su-24, and the Western European Tornado were built according to this scheme. And this is not to mention the strategic missile carriers B-1, Tu-22M and Tu-160. The French, although they brought the Mirage G8 program to the stage of prototype testing, in 1975 they finally closed it due to the increase in development costs. - Such! And in what direction did the French develop their combat aviation further? — In parallel with the Mirage G8 program, the ACF (Avion Combat de Futur) program, initiated by the General Staff of the French Air Force, has been developing since mid-1972. It envisaged the creation of a twin-engine single-seat fighter of the same class as the American F-15. At this stage, the aircraft was designed under the designation -Super Mirage-. However, this program was also stopped. The reasons are purely commercial: the excessive cost of the project and the lack of interest among potential foreign buyers. At that time, aircraft of a similar class - the F-15 and the Tornado - were already presented on the market, so the chances of the Super Mirage to win customers abroad were considered slim. It even got to the point that the French Air Force seriously considered the possibility of buying American fighters. — And what about the famous French patriotism? — In April 1976 a delegation of French military aviators visited the American Edwards Air Force Base, where they got acquainted with the F-15. Interestingly, French rondels were even painted on the plane! However, the matter did not come to the purchase of -Igliv-. The French preferred their own project, but in a different, lighter class. - And in which one exactly? Immerse our readers in the details, Mr. Professor! — In the 70s of the last century, air combat fighters could be conventionally divided into two classes - ten-ton and twenty-ton. The Mirage III and Mirage F1 aircraft belonged to the first of them. The USA, before the appearance of the F-16, did not have a worthy competitor to the French machines - the Northrop F-5A/E aircraft were typical -hunters for the poor-, with lower flight characteristics and more modest combat capabilities. But the creation of the -Fighting Falcon- threatened the position of French aircraft in the world arms market. Therefore, AMD-BA (the company had this abbreviation since December 1971, after the takeover of Breguet Aviation) back in 1973. initiated the program to create two new fighters with the triangular wing traditional for Mirages and the new two-circuit SNECMA M53 engines — the single-engine Mini Mirage (MIMI; the future Mirage 2000) and the twin-engine Maxi Mirage (MAMI; the future Mirage 4000). The following year, Marcel Dasso decided to use it on new aircraft electric remote control system — for the first time in the practice of French aircraft construction. These proposals were presented at the highest level, and on November 4, 1974, French President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing sent a letter to AMD-BA President Marcel Dassault in which he approved the continuation of the ACF program and emphasized that the defense of France could not be guaranteed without a twin-engine fighter. And how much did it affect the project? - Surprisingly, the position of the president of the republic was questioned by one of the government officials - the ministerial delegate for arms affairs. In a lengthy briefing note, he noted: yes, a twin-engine fighter is needed for France, but having invested in its development, we will not have the funds to design a single-engine machine, and this will lead to a loss of position in the world market&#8230; After several rounds of consultations between the two presidents, on December 18, 1975, the Defense Council, chaired by the French president, finally decided to abandon twin-engine ACF fighter in favor of purchasing a single-engine machine. Valery Giscard d'Estaing, receiving Marcel Dassault at the Elysée Palace, emphasized that the government would support the potential export of the Mirage 4000, but would only purchase the single-engine Mirage 2000 for the French Air Force. Thus began the history of the aircraft that entered service half a century later of the Air Force of Ukraine&#8230; Next will be...	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/21/neprymarna-istoriya-mirazhiv-yak-stvoryuvalysya-znamenyti-franczuzki-vynyshhuvachi/	2025-02-20T20:53:08-08:00
Contract 18-24: how much volunteers will be paid	So this is exactly what ArmyInform tells in more detail. One of the main bonuses of such a contract is the payment of 1 million hryvnias in cash assistance. It must be paid in three stages: 200 thousand hryvnias - at the very beginning of the service. Within 5 days after signing the contract and starting to perform duties. 300,000 hryvnias already after completing training (45 days of general training, 14 days of specialized training and up to 14 days directly in the unit) and involvement in combat missions. That is, half a million hryvnias can be received within the first 2.5 months of service. 500,000 hryvnias are paid on the day of exclusion from the lists of the military unit at the end of this contract. One of the key conditions for the payment of the third part of the financial aid is direct participation in hostilities within 6 months. If for some reason it turned out to be less, the payment will also be smaller - it will be calculated proportionally from the calculation of 1/6 of 500,000 hryvnias for every 30 days of direct participation in hostilities calculated in total. The payment will be calculated according to the same formula if martial law is canceled during the service and it is simply not physically possible to fulfill the condition of participation in hostilities. If the contract is terminated prematurely due to health (due to injuries or illnesses related to the defense of the Motherland), or the term of the contract expires, but due to illness or injury the volunteer cannot fulfill the condition of direct participation in hostilities for 6 months, he will still receive the third part of the payment in full. If the serviceman systematically does not fulfill the terms of the contract, he will not only not be paid the third part of the allowance, but will also have to return the previously received 200,000 and 300,000 hryvnias. The payment of one million hryvnias for signing a contract is only part of the payments that a volunteer aged 18 to 24 will receive after joining the Defense Forces. Also, no one cancels the main and additional types of financial support that every Ukrainian military receives: You can read more details about how all these payments are calculated in 2025 here. There is also a list of benefits and compensations. Those who will sign a contract 18-24 can also count on them: All these payments are fixed by Ukrainian legislation, and are also additionally prescribed in contract, which will be signed by citizens aged 18 to 24.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/21/kontrakt-18-24-skilky-platytymut-dobrovolczyam/	2025-02-20T20:43:57-08:00
The realities of war through a photographic lens: portraitist Valentyn Kuzan talked about the image ...	- Tell me about your combat path, about the brigade, about the people with whom you had to serve. - I joined the 72nd OMBr in the fall of 2023. Before that, he traveled with many Ukrainian mass media to the de-occupied parts of Ukraine - cities, villages, photographed destroyed cultural and scientific objects. This is how I spent the first year and a half of full-scale. When a vacancy appeared in the press service of the 72nd, I joined this unit. At first I just took pictures, and then I also recorded short interviews so that there was a comment under the photo: who is depicted, what is the combat path of this person, and in general some interesting biographical facts. - And in general, how much did you manage to record while in the brigade, people, events? - I had an ambitious goal to make a portrait of every soldier in the brigade. I served in the brigade for a year and a half, but I realized that I did not come close to this goal. For various reasons. One of them is that not everyone likes and wants to be photographed. Some said they did not want to remember anything about this war. So I did not photograph everyone in the crew, after all, there are thousands of people, but still quite a lot, because the shooting was both portrait and reportage, when more people got into the picture at once during some events. It's hard to estimate, but surely hundreds. Perhaps a quarter or a third of the brigade was photographed, but it is very difficult to estimate. I will continue to do it, but as a civilian photographer. Those who are veterans of the 72nd will be filmed here on the spot, and I intend to come to those who are still serving as a civilian. If there is an opportunity, I want to continue this work. —I remember when you went to the army, when you were drafted, you said: -You will be able to do what you have been doing. Well, I will learn to dig, of course. And they promised to show which side to hold the weapon.- Were these expectations met? Was it difficult? - I was very lucky with the command and with my direct from the communications department and with the brigade command. Because it actually happened. Photography has remained my main activity, although many things have changed. It is clear that an army is an army. It is impossible to limit myself to one thing, but I really spent most of my time taking pictures. - What did you see in the war that you will never forget? - Death. — Many acquaintances have died? — From time to time news emerges. Some of those whom I photographed died, others died, some were injured. Once I photographed a person in the place where he lives, then they took portraits of people, talked with them, and recorded some stories about their lives. Then I come to take his picture on the -stabika-, we sit there - silence. The evening comes and a bunch of soldiers arrive with various injuries. And including the military man whose portrait I did recently. I took a portrait of him when he was completely intact and here I am taking a portrait of him - I still have this image in front of my eyes: a face cut with small stones or shrapnel, a swollen neck. And the vision is so blurred after an acubarotrauma (injury due to the effect of an acoustic blast wave - ed.), or a contusion&#8230; However, the most impressive, of course, is death. I saw her, fortunately, not so much. There were more mentions that some people we worked with had died. But, for example, worked with the team dealing with the fallen. I was filming the evacuation from the battlefield and there was a soldier who was burned. I don't think it's even worth describing this picture. It's a steep sight. These are really terrible shots, but it was important to make them because, on the one hand, they show the realities of war, and on the other hand, the work of the team that deals with it. And this is very important. —You have your own business, you are engaged in photography. And at some point he decided to go to war. How did your family, friends, and surroundings perceive this step of yours? - Colleagues received it with respect. I didn't think about it at the time, but I was one of the first photographers in my circle of friends to join the army. There were already precedents before me, of course, during all this time, but there were still no corresponding positions in the press services. Most of them were somewhere in the media teams, but most of them were not. And as soon as they started to appear, I was one of the first to leave. I still have some colleagues say respect, it's very, very nice. Then there was, of course, a complex of certain reasons. One of them was my conclusion that the only chance to stand against such a great enemy is if everyone who can is involved in one way or another in the Defense Forces. How did I come to this conclusion? Photographing soldiers on the battlefield, when asked by reporters what you want to say on this occasion - said a lot - change us. I also took it at my expense. Of course, I did not serve in the infantry, because then the infantrymen, of course, said that in the first place. But here, too, I felt a duty. Firstly, it was such a logical sequence that since I think so, then it is necessary to start with myself. And secondly, as a photographer, what could be more important for me to photograph right now than these events and all that is connected with them? I once had the motivation to start a project about Ukrainian artists. It was already after 2014. I felt that Ukrainian artists should be highlighted. Especially at a time of such a threat from katsaps, who destroyed the flower of the Ukrainian intelligentsia during the time of the sovka and even before that. And then they went to war against us again. And these people form nation-building narratives. And when I mobilized, I decided that now it is necessary to highlight the people who are fighting, to tell their stories, to show their faces. I myself was very interested in forming this composite portrait in my head: who is this person who is fighting for his country? - Is the work of a photographer in a brigade and the work of a civilian photographer different conceptually? - They are different, because over the years of photographic practice I am used to people writing to me, calling me, signing up for shootings and coming already prepared for this process. And when I joined the army, I met such a beautiful phenomenon as -healthy fig-: you come, the same as everyone else, do something or rest, have a drink, talk to someone. On the one hand, it seems to be indifferent to each other. And at the same time, the atmosphere of a very close community. I haven't been in the army long and haven't been to many places to compare different units. Is this a feature in our brigade, or in the armed forces in general, or is it my optics as a photographer who has chosen the environment where he will go in the army. Because there are different cases. But I had and still have a sense of the army as a community. If you see someone in the same shape as you, then your communication is immediately fraternal. And it's a very high feeling. Apart from what I said about death, I will not forget this feeling of brotherhood. For example, it happened that the wheel was punctured. A moment - and there is already a queue of those who want to help you. More precisely, some started asking if everything was fine, others, others. Such moments are very pleasant. I saw a military man on crutches, somewhere in Donetsk region, stopped, talked on the road while he gave me a ride. Something like family. And there is also dignity - also an unforgettable feeling that you are in these historical events, also a person in shape, participating in the defense of the country. It is clear that my work is not combat, but there was a sense of importance of what I was doing. Of course, this contribution is minimal, it does not affect whether this position in defense will be stronger. But someone died and you think: it's good that I managed to take a series of photos for him. The photos reflect the level of that person, the level of courage of that person, their personality. In this regard, the photograph, the quality of the photograph, is not in the technical parameters, but in the extent to which it captures the person as he is. So that this memory remains for posterity&#8230; Our work is generally about writing a visual story. But it becomes relevant after dozens of years: a person used to be like that, but now he looks completely different, life has changed, or, God forbid, someone has already left. A month ago I was photographing people. And yesterday, our brother from the communications department told me that there was a tragedy, an explosion, at the shooting location. And we do not know for sure which of those in the photo was injured, what happened to whom. There are dead, there are wounded. And it's a slipper&#8230; - Actually capturing events is extremely important. When you look at the photos from the perspective of time, only thanks to the skill of the photographer can you feel the pulse of the era. — I was at the exhibition of Oleksandr Glyadyelov back in 2022. There were pictures of destroyed Kyiv, shopping centers in ruins, broken roads, a tank on fire on the road. And then it was perceived one at a time. It was still very much alive then, but now it is history. Only two years have passed. And what will happen in 50? - You are now returning to civilian life. Do you already have any projects that you plan to work on? What prompted you to change the format of your work? - I have four children. Therefore, the main motive is to be more with the children, to take care of them more than I could at a distance. In a year and a half, I saw very few of them. Physical presence is important to them and it's important to me to be with them for my mental health after what I've seen there. Psychologically tired. This is, of course, incomparable to many other cases. But if we talk specifically about ourselves, then it is clear that the time spent in Donetsk, when we lived close to the battle line and worked in very different places, in Vugledar, in particular, we came under fire, we fell nearby, we saw death&#8230; There was not a single night in Donetsk while they were there that explosions were not heard. Moreover, you get used to a certain level of noise, then - once, somewhere closer, it even throws up on a folding table. Over time, sleep worsens and so on. Psychologically, it is by no means easy. You understand that you are doing some valuable work, and it lasts. There are people waiting at home, this is also an extremely big support. But still, time passes, and you feel that you are drowning little by little in all this.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/21/realiyi-vijny-kriz-fotoobyektyv-portretyst-valentyn-kuzan-rozpoviv-pro-obraz-yakyj-dosi-stoyit-pered-ochyma/	2025-02-20T20:25:24-08:00
-Hot tours- to Kursk: how steppe warriors -roast- invaders on their own land	The video, published on the brigade's page, demonstrates a master class on -frying- enemy equipment and manpower. -Hunting- for the occupiers was successful. Steppe warriors, using kamikaze drones and other -goodies-, turned enemy cars into flaming torches, destroyed EW and caused losses to enemy infantry hiding in shelters. But the -highlight- of the program was a burning Russian tank. According to the fighters, it was -dessert- for the occupiers. The spectacle, it must be admitted, is impressive. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the 61st Mechanized Steppe Brigade repelled an enemy attack on 3 BMP with landing forces.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/20/garyachi-tury-do-kurska-yak-stepovi-voyiny-smazhat-okupantiv-na-yihnij-zhe-zemli/	2025-02-20T11:54:56-08:00
The column of -Urals- will turn into scrap metal in a few minutes: -Send- knows how to do it	The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. -I love good anecdotes, but most of all - ministurms of the enemy,- says -Poshly-. According to him, the occupiers often go to positions without proper weapons and protection, which makes them an easy target for Ukrainian fighters. -They go as if for a walk - two or three at a time, with anti-tank mines in their hands, without armor and automatic weapons. And it is at this moment that the boys and I get down to work,- he adds. -Poshly- and its counterparts use -Stugna-P- - a universal anti-tank missile complex that effectively destroys enemy manpower, armored vehicles and fortifications. -Stugna- is not afraid of EW and drones, and the ability to choose between cumulative and high-explosive charges allows it to adapt to any target. -Once we hit a motorcyclist, and a rocket flew into a farm with enemy ammunition. The explosion was loud. The motorcyclist was left without a partner, and we were left without one more enemy,- recalls -Send- one of the cases. Fighters of the 59th OShBr work especially effectively against enemy equipment. -If we see a column moving along a familiar route, we immediately calculate the landmarks. The enemy often goes on the attack on -Soviet rags- - -Urals-, -UAZs- and even awning trucks. We destroy the equipment, and our FPV pilots finish off the infantry,- says -Send-. According to him, their work is non-stop, without a standardized schedule. -It is important to be fast and coordinated: load the rocket correctly, drop the tube quickly,- he explains. The biggest danger for them is enemy -mavics-, because they operate close to infantry and are often hit by drones. -There are cases of injuries after dropping VOGs and grenades. The best insurance is camouflage. -Fall less,- says our commander,- adds Send. -Mechanic- and -Rex- serve along with -Send-. -Mechanic- is reliable and calm, and -Rex- is a brat, but the main thing is that they know what they are fighting for. -We are fighting for Ukraine, which our children will be proud of. They will build it, and we have to defend it,- concludes -Send-.

-Staff shortage- in -LNR-: Russia is looking for -guest workers- for the occupied Luhansk region	As reported the head of the Luhansk OVA Artem Lysohor, this is a consequence of the forced mobilization carried out by the occupiers. Because of this, the so-called -LNR- was forced to turn to Russia for help. Agreements were signed with several regions of the Russian Federation regarding the invitation of specialists to the occupied Luhansk region. Now, -specialists- will be sought for work in the -LNR- as far as Altai, Dagestan, Ingushetia, Kalmykia, North Ossetia-Alania and the Chechen Republic. This fact shows that the Russian occupiers have serious problems with the equipment of their -state- structures on the TOT.

The star of Banditsky Petersburg got a role in the new TV series: 10 years in absentia	informs the SBU about this. A deputy of the State Duma of the Russian Federation, who is part of the circle of Kremlin propagandists, actively used his recognition to spread anti-Ukrainian narratives. Pevtsov repeatedly spoke at mass events together with Putin, where he supported a full-scale invasion. In addition, on the airs of Russian TV channels, he called for the annexation of Ukrainian territories and denied war crimes committed by the Russian Federation, in particular in Mariupol. The Ukrainian court found him guilty under three articles of the Criminal Code of Ukraine: For these crimes, Pevtsov was sentenced to 10 years in prison with confiscation of property. However, for now he remains on the territory of the Russian Federation, so the actual execution of the sentence will depend on further events. The case was investigated by SBU employees in Vinnytsia region under the procedural guidance of the regional prosecutor's office. The court verdict became another signal for all those who promote aggression against Ukraine: even if it seems that the law can be circumvented, justice does not forget. As reported by ArmyInform, The Security Service of Ukraine prevented a terrorist attack in Dnipro - they detained an enemy intelligence group that, on the order the Russian Federation tried to blow up a former law enforcement officer from the regional center.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/20/zirka-bandytskogo-peterburga-otrymav-rol-u-novomu-seriali-10-rokiv-zaochno/	2025-02-20T09:48:46-08:00
The dog apprehended a smuggler of drug evaders who was trying to escape from the court abroad	informs about this on February 20. The man was moving towards the border on the outskirts of the city of Chop when he was stopped by the soldiers of the -Solomonovo- department. The detainee turned out to be a local resident who was engaged in illegal smuggling of people across the Ukrainian-Hungarian border. -In the past, he was repeatedly detained for attempts to illegally cross the border and for transporting people of draft age on the territory of the same unit.

Two against five: how Ukrainian soldiers captured a group of Russian invaders	The story of the fighters was made public on the brigade channel with a link to material of journalist Nadiya Sukhoi. -They walked on the roof and next to it,- recalls one of the defenders. Ukrainian soldiers acted clearly: -I was inside, I could only take cover and shoot in the direction of the window.- Command of the operation took place with the help of drones: -The commander coordinated our every move through the drones.- At a critical moment, -Frank- and -Rupor- stepped forward. One went forward, the other covered from the side. To the sound of explosions and gunfire, the fighters captured the first two Russians. But a message came over the radio: three more are hiding in the same position. -Like a ball — a total of five came out. One asked: -Guys, don't kill!-, says the Ukrainian fighter. The captives were led out with their hands and feet tied so that they would not become targets for drones. The captives were shocked - they did not expect such resistance. -They thought there was no one here, that they should just go in and wait for reinforcements.- But the approach of the occupiers turned out to be a failure: instead of rapidly capturing the territory, they ended up in Ukrainian captivity. The prisoners asked for water and cigarettes. -Behaved humanely,- says one of the soldiers. Soon, experienced fighters arrived at the position and once again checked the prisoners before transporting them. Two wounded Ukrainian soldiers are in hospital. One of them, -Rumin-, left the position on his own, leaning on a machine gun. The other, -Pam,- has already undergone multiple surgeries. As reported by ArmyInform, a story appeared on the page of the State Border Service of Ukraine about the first assault of a young border guard with the call sign -Wise.- The boy, who was a cadet last year, now commands a platoon of border guards of the -Steel Border- brigade.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/20/dvoye-proty-pyatoh-yak-ukrayinski-voyiny-vzyaly-v-polon-grupu-rosijskyh-okupantiv/	2025-02-20T09:14:25-08:00

-Licking frost from a stick-: 19-year-old Russian, abandoned by the command under the rubble, told h...	The video of the interrogation of a Russian prisoner was made public on the page of the social project, with a link to the telethon -Edyni Novyni-. The boy, wounded and abandoned by his command under the rubble of a destroyed building, fought for survival for eight days before he was found by the Ukrainian military. Sergey, like many other Russian soldiers, became a victim of deception and blackmail by the command. To make up for the losses at the front, the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation managed to force the boys to sign a contract, promising them more money and not being sent to the front. -Two people are needed for a day to sign a contract for a -youth-. It turns out that if they don't do this, they will be sent away, and they don't want to. And they want to seem the best - many people sign contracts with us,- says Serhiy. Soon, five young soldiers, including Serhiy, found themselves thousands of kilometers from their native Amur region, in Ukraine. Four of them died, and Serhiy miraculously survived. He spent more than a week without food or water, licking frost from a stick in the morning to at least quench his thirst. Due to the frostbite of both feet, Serhiy is at risk of amputation. He could have returned home a long time ago under the procedure for the repatriation of seriously wounded prisoners of war, but Russia continues to sabotage the launch of the joint medical commissions. It is not known how much longer the boy will remain in captivity, waiting for an exchange. This story is yet another evidence of how the Russian command callously throws its soldiers to certain death, not caring about their lives and health. The -I want to live- project calls on parents of Russian conscripts not to believe the promises of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation and to ask for help to save their children from war. -All autumn, we warned the parents of Russian conscripts that their children in the army would be sent to war. How many more of these guys have to disappear before the Russians realize that they are dying not for something -big-, but simply because someone needs to -fulfill a plan-? - says the message of the -I want to live- project. We would like to remind you that the -I want to live- chatbot has dialogue branches for relatives of Russian military personnel who can ask for help and save their loved ones from death. As reported by ArmyInform, Russian conscripts who were captured talk about the conditions of service and the -reward- they received for their participation in combat operations.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/20/zlyzuyuchy-inij-z-palyczi-19-richnyj-rosiyanyn-kynutyj-komanduvannyam-pid-zavalamy-rozpoviv-svoyu-istoriyu-polonu/	2025-02-20T08:41:46-08:00

Rustem Umyerov presented a new model of providing drones for the Ukrainian army	He wrote about this on his Facebook page on February 20. Rustem Umyerov held a meeting with representatives of more than 200 Ukrainian companies engaged in the production of drones. He emphasized the importance of these technologies for modern warfare, as they help destroy enemy equipment, personnel, shoot down helicopters, conduct reconnaissance and provide logistics. The key innovation is the introduction of the DOT-Chain system, which has already proven its effectiveness in non-lethal procurement. This system will allow: The DOT-Chain Defense System gives teams the ability to independently determine which drones they need based on the situation on the battlefield. At the same time, producers get a clear picture of demand and can plan their work more efficiently. The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine is interested in ensuring that no military personnel wait weeks or months for the necessary equipment. The agency is open to dialogue and cooperation with manufacturers to achieve this goal. As reported by ArmyInform, the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Rustem Umyerov, together with the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyi, visited Turkey, where he held important negotiations with Defense Minister Yasar Güler and Commander of the Turkish Ground Forces General Selcuk Bayraktaroglu.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/20/rustem-umyerov-predstavyv-novu-model-zabezpechennya-bezpilotnykiv-dlya-ukrayinskoyi-armiyi/	2025-02-20T08:10:21-08:00

-First among equals-: The Presidential Brigade received an updated arm badge	This is discussed in posts on the brigade page. The new armband contains deep symbolism, each element of which has its own meaning. A golden image of -Serdyutskaya Zora- with a trident in the center is placed in a crimson shield decorated with gold edging. On the diagonals of the shield are two golden crossed divers. Above the shield is a crimson motto ribbon with the gold inscription -First Among Equals-. The crimson color used in the sign is the traditional color of the Ukrainian Cossacks, symbolizing nobility, chivalry, victory and courage. It was the crimson flags that were flown by the Zaporizhia-Sichovites, and there was also the cloth of the 1st -Bohdaniv- regiment, in honor of which the brigade has an honorary name. This color is also the color of the flags and standards of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The -Serdyutska Zorya- depicted on the sign is the cockade of the Serdyutka Division, which included the Bohdaniv Regiment. The divisions were named -Serdyutky- in memory of the Serdyutsky regiments of the Zaporizhzhya Army, who bravely fought against the Muscovites and almost all of them died during the siege of Baturin in 1708. The pirnach depicted on the sign is a type of mace that was used to deliver heavy blows and break through enemy armor. Over time, the pyrnach became a symbol of power and management, one of the symbols of the Ukrainian Cossack chieftainship. For the Separate Presidential Brigade, this symbol reflects its dual task: fighting the enemy on the front line and providing ceremonial and accompanying events with the participation of the state's top military and political leadership. The separate presidential brigade named after Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytskyi is one of the largest in the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the only one without a number in the name. From the first days of the full-scale invasion, the brigade has been engaged in combat, defending the capital and striking the enemy in the east of the country. The brigade also performs important ceremonial functions, accompanying the first persons of the state at solemn events and being the first to meet foreign delegations. -We stand in the front lines on the Ukrainian front and beat the enemy on its territory. We continue the tradition of the First Cossack Regiment named after Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytskyi - the first Hetman of free Ukraine!- - says the message of the brigade. As reported by ArmyInform, the pilots of the 3rd mechanized battalion of the Presidential Brigade named after Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytskyi prevented the Russians from advancing in the Vremivsk direction.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/20/pershi-sered-rivnyh-prezydentska-brygada-otrymala-onovlenyj-narukavnyj-znak/	2025-02-20T07:54:27-08:00

British parliamentarians arrived in Kyiv to assess the needs of Ukraine and prospects for increasing cooperation. -Thank you for your visit, it once again demonstrates the reliability of our relationship with Great Britain. Thanks to constant help, and now leadership within the Contact Group on Defense of Ukraine, we can continue the fight,- Serhii Boev thanked. The Ukrainian side familiarized the British parliamentarians with the operational security situation at the front, Russia's plans and Ukrainian intelligence data on the development of the Russian defense industry. Particular attention was paid to the Russian Federation's cooperation with China, Iran and North Korea. Serhiy Boyev emphasized Ukraine's constant needs for air defense and anti-missile systems and interceptor missiles for them, heavy armored vehicles, ammunition and investments in the Ukrainian defense industry. The deputy minister noted that Ukrainian defense companies have a production potential of $35 billion by 2025, which may not be fully utilized due to a lack of funding. He emphasized the importance of increasing defense spending in the next UK budget. Also among the proposals was the prospect of joint production of drones, because Ukraine has the expertise and experience for this. Serhii Boev informed the British parliamentarians that Russia continues to increase the volume of production of its own defense industry, develop recruiting and personnel training. There are no signs of the aggressor's readiness to cease hostilities, the deputy minister emphasized. Phil Breakell and David Taylor assured that Great Britain understands all the threats and risks, so it continues to stand by Ukraine in this battle: -Our relationship is unique and we will continue to support you. We can't waste time, we need to build up our own capabilities, including in Europe.- Representatives of the Labor Party assured of defending Ukrainian interests within the Parliament of Great Britain and in relations with other European partners.

Two occupiers came close to our positions, where they were discovered in time by aerial reconnaissance and an attack drone was called in, which injured the Russian. Our fighters, who finished off the enemy at close range, finished the job. -Bradley- broke into the village with a landing party, where it began to pour on the Russians. However, after hurrying, our infantry was ambushed and received a command to withdraw. Later, the fighters of the 225th Assault Regiment nevertheless returned and occupied the lines. In Kurshchyna, the fighters of the 156th battalion of the TRO organized a pursuit of the Russian -snag-. The occupants were so confident in the capabilities of their UAZ that they began maneuvering and drifting on the slippery road. Our drone was not going to lag behind, so it drove the Russian directly into the ravine, where it explosively ended the Russian race. These and other topics are discussed by our presenters - junior lieutenant Volodymyr Kravchuk and lieutenant Serhii Lipko.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/20/znyshhyly-okupantiv-vprytul-tro-ganyaye-rosiyan-lymanskyj-betmen-strim-iz-pryfrontovogo-mista/	2025-02-20T07:30:21-08:00

The first assault for -Wise- miraculously did not end with a wound from a fragment of an enemy projectile. After a hard fight that lasted all day, his unit returned with victory and trophies. And the border guard himself gained invaluable experience of real combat operations and the skills of interaction with fellow soldiers. -When this unit first came, there was not so much respect there,- Mudryi says. — Well, yes, they did what I told them. And even after I visited with him on combat operations, because I showed them that I would go with them to the positions, already after that everyone listens, everyone understands, everyone respects.- According to the -Wise-, after the first assault they repelled two more. -A shrapnel flew under my armored car, but thank God, it just flew, it just pierced my armor and that's all,- the fighter recalls. During the clearing of positions, the Ukrainian defenders found a trophy radio station, which helped repel the second assault wave. -For us, everything started at about eight in the morning and lasted until seven in the evening,- Mudryi says. — And before the shift there was another storm. Well, it is already so small there, because our artillery destroyed them very well.- With the help of a trophy radio station, the border guards were able to intercept enemy reports of losses. -On the walkie-talkie, we then heard that there were three 200s, three light 300s and six heavy 300s, because they were evacuating,- Mudryi says. Among the trophies captured by the border guards were magazines, AK-12s, AK-100s, many thermal imaging cameras and night vision devices. -On account of training in Britain, we went to the position of platoon commander,- says -Mudriy-. — I stayed there for two and a half months. I liked it. There are leadership courses. How they taught how to storm buildings and storm trenches. I took a lot for myself there.- As reported by ArmyInform, fierce battles continue in the Vovchansk direction.

Together with the mothers of the Heroes, the teachers of the CPSU organized the personal belongings of Andrii and Badri so that the visitors could feel the pain of losing such bright, devoted defenders, and at the same time pride for the soldiers who gave their lives for the independence of Ukraine. A mobile exhibition created by specialists of the National Military Historical Museum of Ukraine and a photo exhibition dedicated to episodes of the Russian-Ukrainian war, which has been ongoing since 2014, are also presented. The exposition is timed to the third anniversary of the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation and the eleventh anniversary of the beginning of Russia's war against Ukraine. This is an event for all those affected by the tragedy that has come to our land. This is gratitude to everyone who protects our state every day, every hour, every minute, who protects our present. Addressing the audience, the director of the Kyiv Palace of Children and Youth, Oksana Dobrovolska, said: - We are opening a very touching, patriotic exhibition in support of those boys who are protecting our country today. Such projects form the historical memory of our people. Today is a very difficult time for our country. The incurable pain of lost lives, the broken destinies of Ukrainians, the difficult traumatic experience of whole generations of Ukrainians are our realities today. But our entire team supports our state every minute, every day, in every circle, at events, because you and I are strong. We believe that victory will be ours. The mother of the Hero of Ukraine Andrii Pilshchikov, associate professor of the Kharkiv National University of Radio Electronics, Liliya Averyanova, spoke about who we should look up to in a world that changes wildly every day, where every day we must gather our strength to continue fighting for the future. By the way, Andriy Pilshchikov has been to the aerospace center of the CPSU several times. And thanks to his mother, a museum has been created there today. Therefore, future pilots have someone to take an example from. - You see how fast our life is going, and we understand that the life of our state depends on how smart we are, how we are determined to fight, how we are ready to respond to these changes. No matter how dark the present is, we must first of all push back from the mission that our Heroes carried out. Because they went ahead, they went beyond what we imagined for an individual. And it is they who teach us by their example, and that is why we tried to collect as many interesting things as possible, so that through these exhibits, through this exposition, you will understand as much as possible what you should be like now. Because this is a question of our life, our survival, - noted Liliya Averyanova. And the mother of educator Badri Lalashvili, Larisa Lalashvili, who today works in the Palace and continues her son's work, said: - I am very grateful to everyone that you remember, that you honor the memory of our hero. I thank educators, friends, colleagues who continue his work, his work. His dreams, as he wanted, they come true. And Heroes are alive. As long as we remember them. We will always remember them. The exhibition, created by specialists of the National Military Historical Museum of Ukraine, is a unique format and project that allows you to see up close the irrefutable evidence of Russia's war crimes: fragments of deadly weapons used by the aggressor to destroy Ukrainian cities and villages, draw attention to the crimes of the Russian Federation and the heroic resistance of the Ukrainian people, see with your own eyes real evidence of the war and realize the scale of the destruction caused by the occupier. The Deputy Director of the National Military Historical Museum of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine Yury Koshel talked about the work of the museum and its ongoing projects. - Today we are presenting an exhibition that reminds us of how the historical events that we are witnessing today began. The National Military Historical Museum collects artifacts so that people know about the causes of these events, their consequences, emphasizes the role of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the role of all Defense Forces in heroic resistance. Of course, our largest exhibition is in our museum. This is only a part of the work that we constantly carry out, - emphasized Yuriy Koshel. Also present at the opening of the exhibition were brothers of -Jusa- and priest Kostyantyn Panteley, a junior lieutenant of the chaplaincy service of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, who, before mobilization, served at the Askold grave, where the body of the hero-aviator rests, whose photos and personal belongings are displayed in the exhibition. - I had the privilege of being at the service when we said goodbye to Hero Andrii Pilshchikov. When we say the word Hero, it means that this person has absorbed in his life, sometimes very short, all the traits that every civilization on earth, every generation, every person considers to be the highest valor or the highest virtue that defines the human race. Sometimes we work our whole lives to cultivate at least one such virtue. The heroes have these virtues, the best traits that we want to imitate, as if crystallized over many generations, the military chaplain emphasized. These words are especially symbolic today, on the Day of Heroes of the Heavenly Hundred, who were the first to fall in our war for Independence.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/20/u-stolyczi-vidkryly-vystavku-do-rokovyn-shyrokomasshtabnogo-vtorgnennya-rf-v-ukrayinu/	2025-02-20T06:33:49-08:00

About this informs the GUR of the IOU with a link to commentary of its representative Andrii Yusov for -RBC-Ukraine-. -Of course, these are fakes,- Andriy Yusov emphasized. He emphasized that such statements are a direct threat to destabilize the situation in other countries, because -Putin's special services are good at organizing various provocations and terrorist attacks, including against their own citizens.- The representative of the GUR noted that the world is aware of the absurdity of these accusations, but the propaganda machine of the Russian Federation needs constant feeding of such fakes. -The whole world understands the absurdity of these statements, but propaganda tasks require certain actions, even if they absolutely do not stand up to any criticism,- he explained. This is not the first such fake from the Russian special services. Previously, they spread lies about Ukraine allegedly preparing attacks on representatives of the so-called Russian opposition abroad.

According to him, a few days ago in the Kursk region, the fighters of the brigade defeated a group of attack aircraft from the DPRK. 14 North Koreans were killed or seriously wounded. They walked across the field in a large group without any connection. -It is very strange that they walked alone, without a radio station. We understand that they had some kind of map before leaving. It was explained to them where they should gather, where they should wait. And when our pilots saw that up to 12 Koreans were gathering in one place in a dugout or a trench, it was a great goal for us,- Azimut said. Now, according to the chief sergeant of the 47th brigade, 2-3 servicemen from the Russian Federation are being added to the group of Koreans. They work as transmitters of orders. -They do not understand each other very well, although there is a connection with other units that command these North Koreans. But if military personnel do not understand each other, then there will be chaos. They can show them with their hands where to go, what to do, but in general there is no understanding as such,- said the chief sergeant of the company of the 47th separate mechanized brigade.

- I see a blanket hanging that was not here. I went there - a grenade-: the story of a fighter who d...	The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. Dmytro was a truck driver in civilian life, and at the front he became a guide who leads his comrades to positions and returns them back. And, as he himself says, a little -crazy-. One night, for the third time in a shift, Dmytro led a group of fighters to an observation post. The path lay through abandoned trenches. When they jumped into the trench, the shooting began. At first it seemed that it was fire from his own people, but moving forward a little, Dmytro noticed a blanket at the crossing, which was not there a few hours ago. Hiding, they overheard the Russians' talks on the walkie-talkie. The reaction was instantaneous - a grenade, automatic fire, comrades pulled up, and the enemy was destroyed. Three occupiers escaped, but were eliminated by drones. War does not divide into -own- and -foreign-. When the neighboring brigade could not pick up the injured 26-year-old girl for four days, Dmytro went to help. He knows that he is responsible for each fighter, because -someone is waiting for each of them at home.- Before each mission, Dmitry studies the terrain, memorizing every tree and ditch. When leading groups, never take more than three people - a large crowd becomes an easy target for enemy drones and artillery. The longest way to the positions, which had to be covered on foot, is 8 km. Dmytro has two wounds, not including contusions. He was last hit by a mortar fragment while on a mission, but he managed to mine the area with the engineers. The best way to avoid being hit by an FPV, in his opinion, is to hide. -In the bush, in the pit - the main thing is that the drone loses sight of you.- Once they sat in a hole for four hours while enemy drones exploded around them. One of the most difficult moments is the evacuation of a fighter who could not move on his own. For nine hours, Dmytro helped pull him out of the shelling, overcoming fatigue and danger. Brothers from a neighboring brigade helped to complete the mission. In addition to weapons, a bulletproof vest and EW devices, Dmitry has one more personal amulet - three icons and a photo of his wife. -Effective since 2014,- smiles the warrior. As reported by ArmyInform, who would have thought that a former waiter and carpenter would become one of the best UAV operators in the Armed Forces?

- Two hundred and ten orcs were killed in the enemy dugout - how our fighters accidentally stumbled ...	His story was published on the Air Force page. He jokes that -the geography has now been significantly expanded.- But he seriously adds that he was lucky to work, and most importantly, to survive in the Kherson, Zaporizhzhya, Sumy, Kharkiv, Dnipropetrovsk directions. Although he serves in the combined rifle brigade -Coyote- by profession - he holds the position of deputy chief of communications, during this time he also mastered several additional specialties - rifleman, machine gunner, grenade launcher, driver, paramedic. His task as a communicator includes not only providing coverage, setting up the communication system, flashing stations, programming, working with telecommunications, intercom devices. It is often necessary to directly transport the means of communication to the positions and configure them on the spot. -And it just sounds simple. Because the most difficult thing is to get into a position and get out of it intact. It is at such moments that the greatest losses occur. We were met with everything: artillery, mortars, drones, KABs, helicopters&#8230; My boys and I repeatedly came under fire,- he said. However, according to him, there are not enough people at the front, so it is necessary to help in every possible way. -It doesn't matter in which type or branch of the army you serve - we all fulfill the same duty, because it is clear what is at stake. I won't hide it: here, on the front line, it's difficult. Maybe even harder than we all expected. We are holding on, we are not losing heart, we are fighting back - every day minus the Russian cannon fodder,- -Coyote- assured. -Coyote- fought on many fronts. I had to experience moments of success on the battlefield, as well as failures and losses of comrades. -Somehow, our boys missed a bit and got into a position towards the Rashists. It is a dark night in the yard, they are with flashlights, and also with water and food. They reached the enemy dugout and heard: -Stop! Who's an idiot?- You can't confuse racism with anything here, they realized that they were in serious trouble,- he recalled. After assessing the situation, the fighters realized that there was no other option but to run from there. -They ran so fast that even professional sprinters would be envious. Even water was not left for the occupiers! In the morning, thanks to our spontaneous -improvised reconnaissance- (with a happy ending), as well as an accurate drop from a drone, -two hundred- orcs were -two hundred- in this Russian dugout,- the man reported. It is noted that Oleksandr Zavhorodnyi was in the Vovchanskyi direction, where the Russians already traditionally use scorched earth tactics. -A few days after our conversation, an order came to transfer the Coyote to one of the brigades of the airborne assault troops,- the Air Force of the Ukrainian Armed Forces noted. -Coyote- noted that the distance to the enemy is currently calculated in meters. -Despite all the trials right now, I and my brothers are absolutely sure that we are where they are needed the most! And we are not at all concerned with titles, career growth, finances. - emphasized the fighter under the pseudonym -Coyote-. As reported by ArmyInform, two Ukrainian soldiers - -Vyshnya- and -Kolomiya- - spent 45 days surrounded, resisting the Russians invaders and eventually making a bold breakthrough to their fellows. Their story is proof of the courage, resilience and indomitable spirit of Ukrainian soldiers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/20/u-vorozhomu-blindazhi-zadvohsotyly-z-desyatok-orkiv-yak-nashi-bijczi-vypadkovo-natrapyly-na-pozycziyu-rf/	2025-02-20T03:09:19-08:00

Kursk children of corn: the Russians attack, hiding in fields with cobs	told this on the air -Suspilne.Novyny- by the chief sergeant of the 47th separate mechanized brigade company with the call sign -Azimuth-. According to him, anti-aircraft guns and artillery always work before an enemy assault on the positions of the Defense Forces. Then small infantry groups go. -If our boys build themselves some dugouts, our boys build themselves some shelters, some loopholes - everything is destroyed by anti-tank missiles and self-propelled guns. That is, they are simply trying to destroy a place where they can gain a foothold - and then drive their troops there,- said the chief sergeant of the 47th OMBr company. The enemy works according to the standard, repeats the master sergeant. Brings up infantry. Two kilometers before the skirmish line, the attack planes are landed and they scatter, trying to go forward. From time to time they are -rolled- by armored vehicles. -They tried to come to us in a large convoy. It should have been two columns. But we destroyed their first column, there were three tanks and three armored personnel carriers. When their infantry dispersed, they did not make a second assault. They began to look for some workarounds. Probably one of the problems in this area is that there are large cornfields that are very difficult to burn. And their fighters can pass through these cornfields one at a time,- Azimut noted. As ArmyInform reported, in the Serebryan forest, on the border of Luhansk region and Donetsk region, hostilities continue with high intensity Artillery, mortars, drones work non-stop.

After all, these plans were -released- from the Kremlin, which absolutely does not care what losses the Russian troops will have during this. -Another thing that generals understand is that they have certain limited resources and try to use them effectively. Therefore, they are thinking how to do it so as not to disrupt the entire operation. Therefore, yes, the intensity of fighting there is slightly decreasing, but this does not mean that they will not try to regroup their forces, that they will not try to transfer their resources in order to continue attacks there,- said Viktor Tregubov. As ArmyInform reported, in the Serebryan forest, on the border of Luhansk region and Donetsk region, fighting continues with high intensity. Artillery, mortars, drones work non-stop.

Colombians in position and - massacre - face to face with the enemy FPV: the story of the mortar - R...	He is 27 years old, he has been in the war since he was 19. Today we tell his story. Junior sergeant Roman with the call sign -Romario- is a mortar commander of a mortar calculation in the ranks of the 23rd separate mechanized brigade. When he turned 19 in 2017, he joined the ATO, on a contract with the 92nd brigade. There he was a senior gunner of -Gvozdyky-, they worked in the Maryinka and Avdiyivka area. After demobilization, he served in the Military Commissariat. Then - civilian life, he was an auto mechanic-welder at one of the country's large metallurgical enterprises. With the beginning of the large-scale invasion, he was initially in the infantry. He was 25 years old in 2022. The soldier recounts the details of his work: -First we go, we choose a position so that there is a normal place, more trees for camouflage. Then the next day we drive in, set up our mortar. The main plus is that we have Starlink. We are working on the -Zelenka-: we got a call, -to the battle-, we quickly ran out, started up, threw a mine and shot,- the military man recounts deliciously. He talks warmly about his brothers. For example, about a 60-year-old fighter with the call sign -Dobro-. -Could have quit - but stayed, signed a contract for a year, continues to serve with us. And you can't say that he is 60 years old: he runs better than a young man.- -Romario- and his team work accurately and effectively, even the battalion commander praised. During the execution of combat missions, he destroyed 15 units of the enemy's manpower with small arms. One of the difficult combat points on the battle map of our interlocutor is Chasiv Yar. They lived in cellars, not in dugouts. -There was a lot of FPV&#8230; And the dances worked. And in general, everything was fine,- says the army man. And tells about one of the cases involving enemy FPV. -Once we were in position in the dugout. They hung a camouflage net and an efpivishka flew in: it got tangled up, but did not explode. The battery began to -spit-. I got so sick of this sound that I just got out, disconnected it and then handed it over to our pilot guys. The projectile remained there, did not explode, we then disconnected it and threw it as far as possible. The drone was simply entangled in the camouflage net.- And once there was a case, he recalls, when a Colombian infantryman went to Ukrainian positions, it was a little over a month ago. -We are standing in a position - and we hear a foreign language nearby. We came out with automatics. We were told something like: -Yours, don't shoot.- And then they started speaking in Spanish. It was not clear to us, we started communicating through an online translator. He said that their car was broken into, he didn't know where to go - he came out on us. We called his superiors, they advised us what to do. Then we took him to their commander and everything ended well.- At the moment when it was possible to communicate with -Romario-, his unit went out of combat. A week off - and back in action.

Less than a second per target: an Indian company tested its own air defense system to combat swarms ...	The Indian press praised the development of local gunsmiths in a typical Asian manner with the use of superlatives. In particular, reporters from Times of India magazine said that -Nagpur-based Solar Group has developed the world's first manned drone system to combat drones. micro-missiles,- ArmiyaInform notes. In turn, the authors of the portal Bharat Shakti informed that the two-day practical field tests were held at the Gopalpur Seaward training grounds. The system is claimed to have successfully engaged designated virtual targets at a distance of over 2.5 km. -The Bhargavastra complex is equipped with advanced capabilities, including detection of even small UAVs at a distance of more than 6 kilometers. It neutralizes threats with guided micromunitions, ensuring precision and effectiveness,- the publication says. It is noted that the anti-aircraft missile installation can be placed on a mobile platform for rapid deployment. In its statement, the development company Economic Explosives Ltd claims that its air defense system can destroy enemy UAVs with destructive means -at an affordable price.- -The system can also be integrated into the existing network of the armed forces for network-centric warfare,- the Indian arms makers said in a statement. In turn, researchers from the defense site The Defense post reported some technical characteristics of the Indian air defense system. Bhargavastra can monitor the airspace with the help of an on-board radar system equipped with 4 radars at an angle of 90 degrees, providing coverage of 360 degrees. The Bhargavastra radar has a range of 10 kilometers (6.21 mi) and can detect micro-drones up to 6 kilometers (3.7 mi). In addition, the system uses electro-optical infrared sensors for effective target identification in different lighting conditions and artificial intelligence for improved threat detection and analysis. The optical system integrated into the complex also provides accurate detection of targets with low radar visibility. The Bhargavastra complex can reportedly engage 64 targets simultaneously and be integrated with existing military networks. At the same time, each of the minimissiles can be launched with an interval of less than one second. According to the developers, the system is particularly effective against swarms of autonomous drones resistant to traditional methods of jamming by EW stations. Experts of the Ukrainian military-analytical portal IKK Defense Express (DE) assume that the most likely presented Indian complex uses a system of remote control of anti-aircraft missiles (so-called -target illumination-) in order to reduce their price. After all, missiles with a homing head are too expensive, and therefore are a bad option for fighting much cheaper drones. -And although according to the announced characteristics, the Bhargavastra is a very interesting and, as it seems, conceptually correct anti-drone complex, its true effectiveness against a swarm of drones still depends on the real number of targets it can simultaneously destroy,- DE analysts add. The complex can be installed on a number of mobile platforms for rapid deployment and work in a variety of climatic conditions. Together with the sensor mast and the future soft-kill option, the multi-level system can be integrated into a 7.5-tonne all-terrain vehicle on a 4x4 chassis. At the same time, according to the conclusions of researchers from Defense Express, such a system has a limited channel, and nothing is known about the existence of systems that can fire at dozens of targets at once. A possible explanation is that multi-channel is achieved due to the placement of 4 radars at once, which are directed in four directions. And the clarification about the one-second pause between launches is also about the reserve of time that the missile needs to hit the target at a distance of 2.5 km. This complex was specially designed to meet the operational needs of the Indian Armed Forces. However, as its manufacturers note, this air defense system will be presented to potential foreign buyers. Bhargavastra anti-aircraft missile system presentation.

Ukraine commemorates the Heroes of the Heavenly Hundred	It was then that the Ukrainian Revolution turned into a war of national liberation, which continues to this day and will be able to end only after the destruction of the -colossus on clay feet-, which is now called the Russian Federation. — Already at that time, in Mariinsky Park, the Russian terrorist Khyrkin faced the guys who chased him like a dog from Slovyansk in a few months. And the GRUshniks -Petrov- and -Boshirov- under the guise of Russian nationalists registered in Maidanovka. Even then, not just the Heroes of the Heavenly Hundred went to heaven, but the soldiers of the Russian-Ukrainian war, - recalls the author of the term Revolution of Dignity, then a People's Deputy of Ukraine, and now the chief sergeant of the fire support company of the 5th Armored Brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Yuriy Syrotyuk. The Revolutionary Maidan in February 2014 is the latest sign of Ukrainian statehood. The Heavenly Hundred are the knights of light, as well as the Krutyans, who showed with their blood what the Ukrainian people are worth. We well remember the coffins that floated through the sea of ​​weeping people on the Independence Square to the sound of -The Duck Floats along the Tysyn-. This memorial service on February 21, 2014, for the fallen heroes of the Revolution of Dignity in the symbolism of the formation of our state, became one with the mass funerals of the heroes who fell in the Battle of Kruty, which took place on March 19, 1918. During the funeral of the Heroes of the Heavenly Hundred over the Maidan, despite the rain, a swan flew low, directly over the burned-out Trade Union Building, where the headquarters and hospital were located. It was a symbol of eternity and immortality. So their glory and grateful memory of them will live forever among the people, with our freedom together. Obsessed with the idea of ​​reconstruction of the -USSR-2-, the Kremlin maniac, from whom the revolution took away fully controlled Ukraine, finally went crazy and began a military invasion of our country. Already a year later, the Russian offspring felt for themselves what happens to those who come to our land with weapons and slogans of -Russian peace- during the heroic resistance of the Debaltsivka ledge. But everything was just beginning&#8230; Many brothers have joined the heavenly host over the years. There is no longer one Heavenly Hundred, but several Heavenly Brigades. And we, those on earth, keep our lines stronger. The second Koliivshchyna has been going on in Ukraine for three years now. The fury of our people is so terrible that a dozen orcs are destroyed for every brother. And no Trump and no -Saudi conspiracy- will be able to stop this just revenge. It should end only with the just punishment of criminals - whether on the battlefield or in the courtroom, at the second Nuremberg Tribunal. No, these are not empty pathetic words. For many, revenge against racist criminals has already become a matter of life. And it will not end when, ignoring the victim, the policeman and the criminal put their autographs on some piece of paper. It is well known that agreements with Russia are not even worth the paper they are written on. We have to do our own thing&#8230; We survived then, during the Revolution of Dignity. We live and will live to bring the work of the Heroes of the Heavenly Hundred to completion. There will definitely be victory! You need to believe in it and act.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/20/ukrayina-vshanovuye-pamyat-geroyiv-nebesnoyi-sotni/	2025-02-19T20:28:26-08:00
Fantasies of Kremlin propagandists about the Chernobyl nuclear power plant: another absurdity from t...	It would seem that this is too much even for Russian fantasists, but no. They are seriously trying to convince the world that Kyiv is interested in re-transforming the exclusion zone into an apocalypse zone. 1. Why should Ukraine arrange a nuclear disaster at home? It is obvious that any damage to the Chernobyl nuclear power plant will cause radiation emissions, which will primarily affect Ukraine and neighboring countries. If we follow the -logic- of Kremlin propagandists, then Kyiv voluntarily wants to get a second Pripyat. Well, of course. 2. The Chernobyl zone is already under Ukrainian control. Since the spring of 2022, there have been no Russian occupiers there, so even a hypothetical -attack- looks somewhat ridiculous. We are not Russians to shell our own positions, passing it off as -successes-. 3. The world community is already tired of Russian fabrications, the Kremlin regularly stamps such -sensations-, and then cannot confirm them in any way. From the series: -NATO combat geese are working in Ukraine-, -Kyiv is developing a dirty bomb-, -Ukrainian special forces blew up the Kremlin-&#8230; Now the -attack on Chernobyl- has been added to this list. 4. Russia itself creates nuclear threats While Moscow talks about the -Ukrainian threat-, it itself occupied the Zaporizhia NPP, shelled its territory and threatens the world with nuclear blackmail. So, as they say, who would say&#8230; It's simple: another attempt to divert attention from one's own crimes. While the Kremlin is spreading delusions about Chernobyl, the situation on the front is not the best. So it is necessary to come up with some kind of -sensation- to intimidate the West and somehow justify its aggression. But there is one problem: no one will believe it anymore. Even the most ardent fans of Russian propaganda channels understand that they are fed not just lies, but some psychedelic visions. The Kremlin proves once again that its propaganda machine works on the principle -the stupider the fake, the better.- But Ukraine, like the entire civilized world, knows one thing: the only real threat comes from Russia. And if there is a danger of a new nuclear catastrophe, it is due to the actions of the Russian military, which, it seems, does not know what to do next.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/20/fantaziyi-kremlivskyh-propagandystiv-pro-chornobylsku-aes-chergovyj-absurd-vid-rf/	2025-02-19T20:14:04-08:00
There are more than 1.3 million veterans in Ukraine: civil society helps the state in their adaptati...	Oksana Kolyada, head of one of the successful veteran projects of the NGO &#8220;Space of Opportunities&#8221;, told about this. Vacancies, business, rehabilitation, health restoration needs - all this is part of the system of supporting veterans, which should work from the moment of their return to their full integration into society. Veterans receive social, professional and psychological support that helps them adapt to peaceful life. The state, local communities and civil society are working on solving these issues. The latter, in order to better coordinate their work, united in an association. -The first requests for assistance to veterans began to arrive during the active phase of hostilities. It was about the issues of rehabilitation, social benefits, processing of documents. In particular, it was possible to create an entire support system that is expanding and becoming more effective,- said Oksana Kolyada, head of the -Space of Possibilities- organization. According to her, the experience is being scaled up, and now the initiative covers not only the issue of rehabilitation, but also the career development of veterans. -We strive for every veteran to be able to realize his potential. It can be employment, entrepreneurship or social activity. Foreigners study because they see our model as effective,- said Oksana Kolyada. In recent years, public perception of soldiers who returned from the front has changed significantly. If earlier there were certain stereotypes, now veterans receive more support and recognition. At the same time, after the end of active hostilities, the level of attention to this category of citizens may change, so it is important to work on long-term programs for their integration. -At the level of communities and local self-government, work with veterans is often organized more effectively than at the national level. In particular, it was possible to involve local leaders in the support process, because they know the needs of their residents better,- said Oksana Kolyada. Adaptation of veterans to peaceful life includes physical and psychological rehabilitation, finding work or opportunities for professional development. Also, an important aspect is the support of families, because it is the immediate environment that first helps military personnel in their transition to a peaceful life. -We work not only with veterans, but also with their families. It is important that the family is ready to accept a person with a new experience, understand and support him. In particular, it was possible to implement a number of educational programs for military families,- says Kolyada. According to the head of the -Space of Possibilities- project, one of the effective tools of assistance are veteran spaces - places where informational, psychological and professional support is provided. They operate across the country and offer a wide range of services, from advice to training programs and career opportunities. -Veteran spaces are not just meeting places. These are hubs where people can get help, find like-minded people and plan their future. The experience is being scaled up, and we see how similar initiatives are beginning to develop in other countries,- she said. Veterans and their families can contact specialized organizations and public initiatives working in this field. Contacts, addresses of centers and current news can be found on relevant resources in social networks or official websites. -It is important that every veteran knows that there is support and that the state and public initiatives are working for them. Foreigners study, because our model of an integrated approach can be applied in other countries,- Oksana Kolyada noted. Supporting veterans remains an important aspect of public life. The quality of their adaptation and the opportunity to realize themselves in a peaceful life depends on the availability of effective programs and long-term initiatives.

-Master of Marines: The Story of a Support Regiment Sergeant Major	The story of the fighter was made public on the page of the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. His military career began in the National Guard of Ukraine, then he served for a long time in the Ground Forces. In 2021, he signed another contract and decided to continue his service in the Marine Corps of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. -There was a desire to try my hand at the Marine Corps. I had friends there, and on their recommendation, I got into the family of marines,- -Master- recalls. The Marine Corps has its own personnel requirements. Among the most important are competence and continuous personal development. Each Marine, depending on the role and place in the unit, must have a thorough knowledge and command of the tools and techniques that ensure the accomplishment of the assigned tasks. -The competence and training of a Marine comes first. Constant training is mandatory for fighters. This personnel is helped by commanders who, by their own example, thus build the trust of their subordinates in themselves. Mentoring is the cornerstone of success in training personnel,- said Master Sgt. The position of regimental chief sergeant is responsible and requires attention and professionalism. Training personnel, providing servicemen with material means and tools, creating and maintaining discipline and a healthy microclimate in the unit - this is far from an exhaustive list of the -Master's- duties. -First of all, you must always be a person, look for an individual approach to each fighter. My subordinates should feel cared for and cared for. They know they're not alone with their problems,- the Marine smiles softly. It is thanks to the daily and persistent work of people like -The Master- that Marine Corps units are able to develop, improve and be ready for combat missions in any environment. As reported by ArmyInform, two Ukrainian soldiers - -Vyshnya- and -Kolomiya- - spent 45 days surrounded, resisting the Russians invaders and eventually making a bold breakthrough to their fellows. Their story is proof of the courage, resilience and indomitable spirit of Ukrainian soldiers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/19/majster-morskoyi-pihoty-istoriya-golovnogo-serzhanta-polku-pidtrymky/	2025-02-19T11:53:22-08:00

-Secret- assistant of naval special forces: which is in the backpack of the SSO operator	The use of the minesweeper by SSO operators was reported on page 73 of the SSO Maritime Center. The photos published by the SSO center show a mine detector, a common item for combat groups. However, this model has an interesting feature - it can be used both on land and in water. After all, danger in the form of mines can lie in wait for soldiers anywhere. This minesweeper meets several important criteria that are defining for a special agent. -We use it to detect mines, engineering barriers, while traversing minefields. First comes an engineer with a minesweeper, he -breaks through- the path and the main group comes behind him, which at the same time covers him,- the soldiers of the 73rd SSO center say. In use, this device is quite simple, so, if necessary, it can be used by any of the operators of the group. -We use it all the time. And during training, we also practice working with a minesweeper,- the commandos note. As reported by ArmyInform, in modern combat, where it is often necessary to operate in conditions of limited visibility, a flashlight on a weapon is a critically important item of equipment.

-Concentration - above all else-: a fighter of the GUR special unit revealed the secrets of the succ...	About the little secrets of this profession told a soldier of the GUR special unit of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine -Artan- with the call sign -Korean-. The main -ritual- for a sniper, according to the -Korean-, is full concentration on the task. The success of the task depends on how thoroughly the fighter has prepared for it. -Before doing anything, snipers always analyze all available information. If further investigation is required, we conduct it. We study the area. Ways of entry, exit, various backup options. If you study everything, you get the confidence that you can do it,- shares the -Korean-. An important stage of preparation is also arranging the position. -If there is an opportunity, we go out and prepare a position. Because if something starts, and you don't have a prepared position, you're not ready to execute it,- says the fighter of the Artan special forces. He also adds that snipers always plan in advance where they will take positions and, if possible, prepare them in advance. This allows you to be ready for any development and to successfully complete the task. As ArmyInform reported, -If you want to win, fight!- — this is exactly the principle that warriors of -Artan- operate, turning these words into the daily reality of the Ukrainian resistance. New exclusive footage captures how the coordinated work of scouts, stormtroopers, gunners and FPV drone operators translates into precision strikes that inflict heavy losses on the enemy.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/19/konczentracziya-ponad-use-boyecz-speczpidrozdilu-gur-rozkryv-sekrety-uspihu-snajperiv/	2025-02-19T10:56:18-08:00

The story of the soldier was published on the website of the Land Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022 was not just a tragic date for Dmytro, but also the day when he decided to defend his country. -Neo- joined the army on the second anniversary of the start of the war, leaving behind a peaceful life and plans for the future. He received his call sign -Neo- while studying in Great Britain. Instructors noted his ability to deftly dodge fire, comparing him to the hero of the famous movie -The Matrix-. This call sign became for him not just a name in the war, but also a symbol of his indomitability and ingenuity. Dmytro celebrated his 24th birthday in Turkey, where he was studying. -At that time, I was not interested in cakes or candles,- he recalls. However, the command congratulated him on the radio, which was a pleasant surprise for the soldier and gave him strength in a difficult time. The most memorable battle for -Neo- was the assault that took place in the summer of 2024 in the village of Zalizne. Early in the morning, the enemy attacked the positions of the Ukrainian defenders. -We were a bit out of position and we successfully fought him off,- says -Neo-. In this battle, he and his two comrades were helped not only by their own courage and training, but also by the support of comrades from FPV drones. -The job was to kill them so they wouldn't kill us,- Neo says of that fight. He does not hide that it was scary, because fear is a natural human reaction to danger. However, the main thing, according to him, is not to panic and to control your fear. -When it's just fear and it's under control, it's possible to fend off an assault with it and continue to fight,- the fighter is convinced. -Neo- considers it his duty to protect his people and his country. He is one of thousands of Ukrainian soldiers who risk their lives every day for the sake of victory. His story is a story of courage, devotion and indomitable spirit of the Ukrainian people.

Almost drowned in the Tisza, froze, got tangled in barbed wire: border guards rescued the violator	was informed about this on February 19 in DPSU. A 27-year-old resident of the Ivano-Frankivsk region was discovered at midnight today by a border squad from the -Business- department of the Mukachiv detachment. The man was calling for help. He, frozen and with cut hands, was found 10 meters from the state border. -The Carpathian became entangled in inconspicuous barriers when he got out of the water and decided to return back to Ukraine. The man could barely speak due to hypothermia. He was quickly brought to the unit, given the opportunity to change clothes and given hot tea,- the report said. The violator told the border guards that he intended to enter Romania illegally. For this, he found shippers who promised to help him for $9,000. Dilki assured that crossing the border would be as safe as possible, although they did not hide that the new boy would have to cross the infamous Tisza. While overcoming the barrier fence, the man cut his hands, but continued to move towards the river. -Despite not being able to swim, he still climbed into the water, because in the dark he could not assess the real danger of such a decision. The rapid current instantly knocked him off his feet, picked him up and carried him in an unknown direction. In this way, the man swam 50 meters and, fortunately, was able to get to the shore,- the DPSU noted. In the dark, he got into a barricade, from which he could not get out on his own. So far, the border guards have already identified the persons involved in transporting the Carpathians across the border. Criminal liability awaits them. ArmyInform reminds that it is better not to break the law or risk your life, but to use the aggregator of vacancies in the Armed Forces and recruiting centers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/19/led-ne-vtopyvsya-v-tysi-zamerz-zaplutavsya-u-kolyuchomu-droti-prykordonnyky-vryatuvaly-porushnyka/	2025-02-19T09:44:08-08:00

The story of the fighter was published on the page of the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. -Cap- joined the battalion three months ago of his own free will. Together with his subordinates, he holds positions and inflicts significant losses on the occupants. -We have everyone motivated. The main thing for a warrior is motivation. We will teach him, show him, tell him the rest,- says the commander. Fighters of the battalion recently repelled another enemy assault, destroying up to 30 occupants and two armored vehicles. The enemy tried to attack on the equipment, but fell into a carefully prepared trap - the enemy transport was blown up on a mine barrier, and the -Mainland- fighters completed the operation by means of fire, using drones, machine guns and grenade launchers. -The enemy did not expect that we have everything prepared here. Only six or seven of our guys took part in the battle, but we defeated much larger enemy forces,- says -Kep-. Modern warfare is impossible without drones, which conduct 24-hour reconnaissance and monitor enemy movements. -Drones hover constantly, preventing the occupants from leaving or moving. In such conditions, it is important to act quickly and inconspicuously,- the commander notes. However, even with high activity of enemy drones, Ukrainian soldiers find ways to defend themselves effectively. Once the weather conditions (fog and rain) allowed the fighters to act more freely, which helped to successfully repulse the attack. Despite all the difficulties, the Ukrainian military steadfastly stands in defense of the state. -It's hard work, sometimes mentally, sometimes physically. But if we don't stop the enemy here, tomorrow he will be in our houses,- Cap emphasizes. The commander also shared his personal motives for fighting: -My father is fighting, I am fighting. But I don't want my child to see war.- As reported by ArmyInform, the chief sergeant of the unit with the call sign -Puzzle- is one of those who does not hesitate for a minute when it is necessary to go into battle or save fellow citizens.

Recruits prisoners to fight against Ukraine: a colonel of the internal service of the DNR is suspect...	The Donetsk regional prosecutor's office informed about this on February 19. -In 2014, the man stayed in occupied Makiivka and got a job in the -penitentiary service- of the quasi-republic. After the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation into the territory of Ukraine, he continued to build a -career,- the report says. For conscientious service to the enemy, he was awarded the fake rank of colonel of the internal service. In addition, they were appointed to the position of -deputy head of the main department of the Federal Penitentiary Service of the DNR-. He mobilizes convicted citizens in places of imprisonment and recruits them to sign contracts for military service. In addition, he holds meetings with children of specialized children's institutions, where he idealizes the Kremlin regime. -Under the procedural leadership of the Donetsk regional prosecutor's office, the citizen was informed of the suspicion of treason (Part 2 of Article 111 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine),- the DBR employees said, ArmyInform reported. href=-https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/19/perebizhchyk-praczyuvav-na-okupantiv-ta-led-ne-potrapyv-na-sluzhbu-v-zsu-sudytymut-cholovika/->completed a pre-trial investigation regarding a resident of Kherson, who during the occupation of the city worked for the invaders in the captured colony, and then barely did not get into the service of the Armed Forces.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/19/verbuye-vyazniv-voyuvaty-proty-ukrayiny-pidozryuyut-polkovnyka-vnutrishnoyi-sluzhby-dnr/	2025-02-19T09:03:14-08:00
Manipulations and fakes about TCC: how Russian propaganda incites enmity in Ukrainian society	This is reported by Land Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine with reference to material of the Institute of Mass Information. As noted in IMI, individual posts do not simply question the need for mobilization measures. They openly provoke aggression, sow enmity and incite confrontation between civilian and military Ukrainians. The fact that some resources resort to outright distortion of the context is particularly worrying. By replacing the word -military serviceman- with -employee- or -employee-, they are trying to artificially separate the TCC from the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the entire defense system of the country. Thus, the attack on an employee of the TCC is presented not as an attack on a military person in a warring country, but as a separate incident unrelated to the general struggle against Russian aggression. This information campaign aimed at discrediting the TCC and the military is part of a broader Russian propaganda strategy. Its goal is to sow discord within Ukrainian society, undermine confidence in the authorities and the Armed Forces, as well as disrupt mobilization measures, which are critical for success in the war against the Russian invaders. It is important to note that such information attacks are not new. Russian propaganda has long been using similar methods to achieve its goals. However, against the background of war and growing tension in society, such manipulations can have particularly devastating consequences. As reported by ArmyInform, from the moment of entry into force of the changes related to the mobilization policy as a whole, in accordance with the Law of Ukraine -On Amendments to Certain Legislative Acts of Ukraine Regarding Certain Issues of Military Service, Mobilization, and Military Registration-, a number of significant changes were made that relate to the procedure for conscripting citizens for military service during mobilization, for a special period that was specified by Resolution No. 560 of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine dated May 16, 2024.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/19/manipulyacziyi-ta-fejky-pro-tczk-yak-rosijska-propaganda-rozpalyuye-vorozhnechu-v-ukrayinskomu-suspilstvi/	2025-02-19T08:56:58-08:00

The fairy tale - Three Little Pigs - in a modern way: a Ukrainian wolf destroyed enemy pigs with an ...	This is discussed in publications on page 110 of the separate mechanized brigade named after Corporal General Mark Bezruchka. In a modern interpretation of the well-known fairy tale, three little pigs, Nifnifov, Nafnafov and Nufnufov, turned out to be invaders who took over someone else's brick house. They sat there talking about the -Ukrainian wolf- who, for some reason, did not like the foreign piglets. However, their plans were destroyed by the -Ukrainian wolf- - a fighter of the 110th separate mechanized brigade, who launched an FPV drone and discovered the location of the enemy. In a few minutes, the drone was already flying around the hut, looking for the best place to hit. Finding the perfect moment, the drone flew into the building and the ammunition detonated. The pigs died on the spot, victims of their own aggression and greed. -These three pigs will no longer spoil other people's homes on Ukrainian soil with their presence,- the brigade's message reads. Unfortunately, there are still a lot of such -pigs-, so the -wolf- is forced to continue its struggle, day by day reducing their herd. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the 110th mechanized brigade named after Colonel-General Mark Bezruchka recorded a mass escape of the invaders from the positions they captured a few days ago.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/19/kazka-troye-porosyat-na-suchasnyj-lad-ukrayinskyj-vovk-znyshhyv-vorozhyh-svynej-fpv-dronom/	2025-02-19T08:24:55-08:00

-Contract 18-24-: Pavlo Palisa on the principle of selecting teams for the project and the first res...	Colonel Pavlo Palisa, deputy head of the President's Office, told TSN about this in an interview. According to him, the -18-24 contract- is a new project, which involves six brigades of the Armed Forces of Ukraine: one Marine Corps, one Air Force and four Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. This is done in order to test all elements of the system in different directions and under different conditions. -Why six? In order to test all elements in each direction, in each brigade, from the moment a citizen applies to the moment when he enters the military unit, receives the first payments, becomes eligible for all types of security, and begins his own training. We plan to monitor all moments throughout the entire contract so that, if we make mistakes somewhere in preparation, organization, provision, payments, so that we have the opportunity to complete and correct all these things, relatively speaking, because it is certainly easier to do it with six brigades than with hundreds,- Pavlo Palisa explained. The brigades to participate in the pilot project were chosen based on the principle of their ability to conduct high-quality combat training on their material and technical base. Three brigades organize combat training independently, the other three with the help of a training center. This is done to compare the quality of training and to choose the best option for the future. -I believe that the best training for a fighter can be provided by those commanders and instructors with whom he will later perform combat missions. This makes it possible to immediately prepare recruits for real conditions, taking into account the specifics of the terrain and the intensity of hostilities,- noted Pavlo Palisa. As reported by ArmyInform, the mobile application -Rezerv+- continues to receive applications from young people aged 18-24 who expressed a desire to sign a voluntary contract with the Armed Forces of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/19/kontrakt-18-24-pavlo-palisa-pro-prynczyp-vidboru-brygad-dlya-proyektu-ta-pershi-rezultaty/	2025-02-19T07:06:33-08:00

The document plans to provide clear terms of service depending on when the soldier was mobilized. -Citizens of Ukraine who were mobilized in 2023, having signed the contract, will be able to be released after 9-10 months, relatively speaking. Those who were mobilized in 2024, having signed a contract, will also be able to leave after a slightly longer period,- he said. At the same time, Pavlo Palisa emphasized that this will become possible only after certain conditions are created. -We cannot expose the front and deprive the combat element of the ability to perform the task,- he explained. As reported by ArmyInform, an updated version of the application -Rezerv+- was released with the possibility to apply for concluding a voluntary one-year contract for citizens up to 25 years.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/19/v-ofisi-prezydenta-rozpovily-pro-rozrobku-kontraktiv-dlya-mobilizovanyh-z-terminamy-sluzhby/	2025-02-19T06:53:48-08:00
Warriors with a brush under the slogan of an 8-year-old boy: the exhibition -Painters on the Front- ...	The opening of the exhibition was attended by correspondents of ArmiyaInform. — This is the first exhibition of the -Art-resistance- project. It conceptually represents the creativity of Ukrainian artists who are directly fighting or acting as military volunteers, - project curator, journalist and art manager Olena Kotlyar told ArmiyaInform. The idea of ​​the project arose at the end of last year, it was supported by the National Union of Artists of Ukraine in the person of its head, Honored Artist of Ukraine Kostyantyn Chernyavskyi, as well as the famous artist and philanthropist Mykhailo Pozhivanov. — The exhibition introduces the work of 11 artists. Styles and genres are different - from classical art, such as the works of Volodymyr Gurin, to the works of Serhiy Gerasimenko, who works in the style of modern art. And, for example, Serhiy Smetankin's paintings are painted on boxes made from shells, said Olena Kotlyar. The exhibition also features works by Roman Kravchuk, Ihor Talalai, Serhiy Burbelo, Viktor Solovar, Volodymyr Vakulenko, Vasyl Telychko-Evert, Artem Shevchenko, and Mykola Medinskyi. In total, there are more than 40 works in various genres — painting, graphics, installation, art objects. The exposition opens with an icon of St. Severinus, placed on the lid of a shell box — on a base designed by an eight-year-old boy. This is the work of military chaplain Mykola Medinsky with the symbolic title -Ukraine will win-, which was proposed by the young son of the Defender of Ukraine. — This is the icon of the Holy Martyr Severin, which I painted for the child of one of our soldiers, who serves in the GUR. His father is now at the front, in the war. The icon itself is small, so I decided to put it on the lid to give it a larger shape. And then the little one says: -Can I write a message for my father on this board?-. And he wrote: -Ukraine will win!- and drew the Ukrainian flag and coat of arms, - said Mykola Medynskyi. The chaplain decided to leave the icon with this design, so the words of the little boy became a true slogan for the entire exhibition. — When you enter the hall, this exhibition opens with a work by Mr. Medinsky with a symbolic title expressed by a child: -Ukraine will win!-. And I think it's very symbolic, very powerful, very life-affirming. Ukraine will really win, Olena Kotlyar emphasized during the opening ceremony. Another of the works presented at the exhibition — a painting by Serhiy Smetankin — is called -Sviatohirsk during the Kharkiv Offensive.- It depicts real events during the famous Slobozhan offensive operation in the fall of 2022, as a result of which it was possible to liberate most of the Kharkiv region from the Russian invaders. — We are very pleased that today's works include the work of Serhiy Smetankin, who in 2024 was recognized as the laureate of the Bohdan Khmelnytskyi Award competition for the best coverage of military themes in works of literature and art, which is awarded annually by the Ministry of Defense for the best coverage of military themes in works of literature and art, — the deputy head of the department, head of the department of planning and organization of humanitarian support emphasized in a comment to ArmiyaInform of humanitarian support of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine Oleksiy Sergienko. Serhii Smetankin won a well-deserved victory in the nomination -Works of fine art on a military theme- for a series of fine art works -Thanks- that the author drew on blackboards from boxes for cartridges and on fragments of rockets. — We can see by the quality, by the content of these works, by their fullness, what spiritual power these paintings carry. Additionally, this effect is enhanced by the fact that these works were created at the front, in the trenches, in the dugouts. They have an extremely strong emotional effect, - stressed Oleksiy Sergienko. He noted that all works submitted for the Bohdan Khmelnytsky Prize are extremely powerful, and the acceptance of works for the 2025 competition, which will last until August 1, has already begun. — Creativity became a certain psychological reliever for me during the war, which took away many people - my brothers, godfathers. I created the first of the paintings specifically in honor of the memory of my deceased godfather, - says Serhiy Gerasimenko, who joined the ranks of the Territorial Defense Forces from the very beginning of the large-scale invasion. The exhibition presents the artist's works of various genres - from iconographic images to art installations using front-line artifacts - shell casings, fragments of boxes from BC and burnt boards. -These shell casings cut by fragments,- the artist points to the installation, -stood at the entrance to the dugout.- I don't know whose exactly it was, but the shell casings may have saved someone's life because the shrapnel hit them and got stuck there. Recalling his first work during the war, Serhiy Gerasimenko notes that it was -Pieta-, or -Lamentation of Christ-. He created it from several support boards from a slot machine box. Combined with numerous prongs that once held weapons, they form a whole composition that symbolizes the strength of the unity of Ukrainian society. Artist, architect and designer Volodymyr Vakulenko came to the opening of the exhibition on crutches - he is currently in Kyiv undergoing treatment. However, all the thoughts, all the experiences of the artist are now at the front, where his comrades from the Third Assault Brigade are fighting. — I live here, but in my thoughts and in communication I am always with the boys. I call every day to find out who went to war and who left. I'm afraid it's hard for civilians to understand, but this is not the end of the war. Therefore, in my works, I want to convey to society that sooner or later it will touch everyone - you can't relax. Even if now there will be some kind of calm for a few years, then the enemy will go to Kyiv again, - says the artist. Volodymyr Vakulenko emphasizes the responsibility of everyone - citizens and the state, representatives of the authorities. Because if we relax, next time the Russian invaders will not only reach the capital, but will also be able to capture it. — Those who are mobilized now are often unmotivated, indifferent. How to send them to -zero-? And there are few patriots left. Society needs to understand that what I said, we are fading away, we are becoming very few. And if the attitude does not change on the part of society, on the part of the country, on the part of the state&#8230; It is necessary to stop pretending that the war does not affect anyone, because it directly affects all of us, the military does not hold back its emotions. &nbsp; A short speech by Volodymyr Vakulenko, who stands firmly on crutches during the long opening of the exhibition, leaves no one indifferent. Against the backdrop of the peaceful Kyiv front, he reminds us that the terrible war for the very existence of the state of Ukraine and the Ukrainian nation continues, and it is still far from a victorious end. The exhibition -Artists on the Front- will continue in the -ABS-art- gallery until March 8, 2025. Address: str. Hlybochytska, 32 B, 3rd floor. Opening hours: from 12:00 to 18:00. Entrance is free.

Usually, these are 3-5-7 people who move on foot, sometimes on motorcycles, ATVs, buggies and cars. -The pride of the Soviet automobile industry. They cut the roofs off their -Nivs-, get into such convertibles and try to fly as fast as possible to our previous border. But they are successfully destroyed by our drone operators,- said Orest Drymalovskyi. According to Orest Drymalovskyi, 18 occupiers were killed, 12 were wounded, and one more was captured in just one day of such assaults. Actual losses — 30 people. -We had a case - the Russian occupiers handcuffed their person, put him in an armored personnel carrier and untied his hands immediately before landing. They put a machine gun in his hands, and all he had to do was storm. But lucky. Our paratroopers had reception hours then, took him, saved his life,- said the representative of the press service of the 79th Infantry Brigade. As ArmyInform reported, the enemy is actively attacking in the Novopavlov direction. Mostly these are assaults on foot in a typical Russian style, when several people are gathered and thrown to their death.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/19/zrizayut-dahy-sidayut-v-kabriolety-okupanty-zakovuyut-svoyih-pihotyncziv-u-kajdanky-i-vidpravlyayut-v-shturmy/	2025-02-19T05:29:24-08:00
One person died and seven were injured as a result of the Russian bombing of Kostyantynivka	This was announced on February 19 by Vadym Filashkin, the head of the Donetsk military administration. -At least 1 person died and 7 were injured as a result of today's strikes on Kostyantynivka. In addition to the victims, about whom it is known for sure, one more person may be under the rubble of one of the houses. 34 private houses, an administrative building, 3 power lines and 3 gas furnaces were damaged.

Exhibitors of the General Staff are suspected of embezzling UAH 246 million for the creation of the ...	About reported February 19 NABU. Important examinations in criminal proceedings were carried out with the active involvement of the Ministry of Defense. Among the suspects: Their actions are qualified under ch. 5th century 191 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine. According to the investigation, in 2016 the Ministry of Defense signed a contract for the development of the system with a commercial company that had no experience in creating software. During the four years of development, the technical task was changed 13 times, which made it possible to increase the cost of the works by 300 million hryvnias. Without justification, the number of prototypes of the system was increased from 4 to 12, which caused additional costs for adjusting the documentation — 115 million hryvnias. As NABU and SAP found out, the developed system did not meet the technical task at all: from incompatibility with NATO protocols to lack of integration with other military systems. Moreover, some of the software is not used at all. Of the 200 information and calculation tasks set, only 10 were actually implemented. During the investigation, detectives and prosecutors encountered attempts to hinder the investigation: persons involved in the scheme began to hide key documentation related to the financing and development of the project. Also, after the investigation began, they accelerated the work and even modernized the system for free, trying to make it more similar to the original design. However, due to fundamental errors in the architecture, finalization of the -DZVIN- system is impossible. Despite the obvious shortcomings, at the end of 2022, the DZVIN system was officially adopted by the Armed Forces. And already in 2024, instead of eliminating shortcomings or abandoning an ineffective solution, they planned to allocate additional funding to -DZVIN-. This may indicate attempts not only to hide previous corruption abuses, but also to continue them. As reported by ArmyInform, law enforcement exposed the -Ukroboronprom- exposadors for embezzling more than 107 million hryvnias. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/19/eksposadovcziv-genshtabu-pidozryuyut-u-rozkradanni-246-mln-grn-na-stvorenni-systemy-dzvin/	2025-02-19T05:08:55-08:00

An exhibition with evidence of Russia's war crimes will open in Kyiv tomorrow	The organizers of the exhibition informed ArmiyaInform about this. The exhibition is timed to the third anniversary of the large-scale invasion of the Russian Federation - an unjust war launched against Ukraine, as well as the decade since the beginning of Russia's hybrid aggression since 2014. This is a unique format and project that allows you to see the indisputable evidence of Russia's war crimes up close: fragments of deadly weapons used by the aggressor to destroy Ukrainian cities and villages, draw attention to the crimes of the Russian Federation and the heroic resistance of the Ukrainian people, see with your own eyes the real evidence of the war and realize the scale of the destruction caused by the occupier. A photo exhibition dedicated to the decade of hybrid warfare, which has been ongoing since 2014, will be presented separately. The photos captured the key moments of Ukraine's struggle, starting with the occupation of Crimea and the first battles in Donetsk and Luhansk regions until today's events. Also, with the support of the Department of Education of Kyiv, an exposition will be opened dedicated to the Hero of Ukraine Andrii Pilshchikov, a fighter pilot with the call sign -Jus-. Together with Hero's mother, the teachers of the CPSU organize Andriy's personal belongings, awards, and a collection of chevrons, so that visitors feel the pain of losing such bright, dedicated defenders, and, at the same time, pride for the soldiers who gave their lives for the independence of Ukraine. This is not the first joint project of the CPSU and the National Military Historical Museum aimed at preserving historical memory and truthfully covering the events of the war. -The incurable pain of lost lives, broken destinies of Ukrainians, difficult traumatic experience of entire generations of Ukrainians - these are our realities today. We have no right to forget everything that the war brought, we will not have the strength to forgive the enemy for the crimes committed. Such projects form the historical memory of our people,- said Oksana Dobrovolska, director of the Communist Party of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/19/u-kyyevi-zavtra-vidkryyetsya-vystavka-z-dokazamy-voyennyh-zlochyniv-rosiyi/	2025-02-19T04:54:02-08:00
-They have a style — to send to slaughter-: Russian commanders like to use -live- explosives	Anatoliy Marynyuk, chief of staff of the first infantry battalion of the 42nd separate mechanized brigade, told about this on the air of -Suspilne.Novyny-. According to him, in urban development, the enemy almost does not use equipment - it is slow, poorly maneuverable and easy to destroy. Therefore, the enemy uses small groups of infantry, and sometimes even single soldiers. One by one, they infiltrate from house to house, try to go around, accumulate in shelters and then storm Ukrainian positions. -They have such a style here. When single their infantryman has two anti-tank mines. They are sent to slaughter with anti-tank mines to blow up the buildings where the Defense Forces are located,- said the chief of staff of the first infantry battalion of the 42nd separate mechanized brigade. As ArmyInform reported, the enemy is actively attacking in the Novopavlov direction.

Either death or capture - in the Third Assault, it was told how long a Russian assault fighter lives	-Motya-, commander of the 1st company of the 2nd assault battalion of the Third Assault Brigade, told about this on the -Suspilne Novosti- broadcast. According to him, the fighters of the Third Assault Division regularly manage to take prisoners, and the description of the Russian fighters is short - they are people devoid of intelligence by 100 percent. Their motivation, says -Motya-, is exclusively financial. Nowadays, the occupiers are not even taking convicts into the army, but people who are still only under investigation. But these soldiers do not live long. -The lifespan of an ordinary Russian attack aircraft is approximately three weeks. From the moment when his military ID is stamped. That is, a week of training ground, logistics to Ukraine, and then the war. And either -200- or we are in captivity,- said the officer of the Third Assault Brigade. As reported ArmyInform, in the Novopavlov direction, the enemy continues to carry out assaults and tries different attack methods. In recent weeks, there have been half a dozen options.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/19/abo-smert-abo-polon-v-tretij-shturmovij-rozpovily-skilky-zhyve-rosijskyj-shturmovyk/	2025-02-19T04:07:23-08:00
Two FSB informants were detained in Kharkiv Oblast, who were correcting Russian strikes	The SBU informs about this. According to the investigation, the perpetrators, residents of Kharkiv, acted separately from each other and were recruited by the Russian special services through Telegram channels. Their task was to collect information about the places of greatest concentration of personnel and military equipment of the Armed Forces in the region and to pass it on to the Russian occupiers. One of the detainees turned out to be a former teacher of a local university. On the instructions of the enemy, he collected geolocations of reserve command posts and fortified areas of Ukrainian defenders in Kharkiv. To do this, he drove around the northern outskirts of the city in his car, secretly recorded the location of the Ukrainian military and submitted reports to the FSB. Another informant worked as a security guard at a local hotel. Under the guise of walks, he spied on the temporary bases of the Defense Forces on the territory of the community. He sent the collected information to his Russian handler via messenger in the form of text messages and screenshots of Google maps with potential targets for strikes. Thanks to the operational actions of the SBU, both criminals were exposed and detained at their places of residence. During the searches, mobile phones and computer equipment containing evidence of cooperation with the Russian Federation were seized from them. Investigators of the Security Service informed the detainees about the suspicion for h. 2 Art. 114-2 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (unauthorized dissemination of information about the movement, movement or location of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation for the possibility of their identification on the spot). They face up to 8 years in prison. This case once again emphasizes the importance of vigilance and conscious attitude of citizens to information security. The enemy uses various methods to obtain information, so each of us must be attentive and careful not to become an unwitting helper of the occupiers. As reported by ArmyInform, the Security Service and the National Police during the day detained agents of the Russian special services who were preparing a terrorist attack on the order of the Russian Federation in Mykolaiv on February 14 of this year.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/19/na-harkivshhyni-zatrymano-dvoh-informatoriv-fsb-yaki-koryguvaly-rosijski-udary/	2025-02-19T03:57:50-08:00
-In one sortie - minus ten-: how a fighter -Mark- destroyed an enemy dugout with occupiers	The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. Mark, an FPV crew commander in the Antares Unmanned Systems Battalion, joined the Defense Forces in the first months of the full-scale Russian invasion. Before the war, he worked as a trainer in a gym and had plans to develop his own clothing brand. However, the events of 2022, and especially what he saw in Buch, forced him to make a decisive choice. -The question arose before me: am I ready to close my eyes to this? I came to the military commissariat, asked to be enrolled as a volunteer. I even thought of writing a statement that I would refuse the salary of a military man - the main thing is to take it. It took a long time to persuade them,- the fighter recalls. During his service, -Mark- tried himself in different positions: he was a physical training instructor, served in the infantry, worked as a scout on Maviks, and eventually became an FPV drone operator. -FPV is a precise, filigree piece of work. It is not suitable for everyone, but if a person has a desire, he can learn. If I succeeded, then 90% of motivated people can also succeed,- explains -Mark-. Thanks to accurate strikes, FPV pilots repeatedly thwarted plans of enemy assaults. -Once we worked on landings where there were enemy fortifications. Later, from the interrogation of a prisoner of war, we learned that during one of these sorties, we -minus- ten occupiers who were hiding in a dugout,- the National Guardsman recalls. Nevertheless, Mark plans to return to his civilian dream of developing his own clothing brand and bringing it to the international level. However, if his combat experience is still needed by the country after the war, he is ready to pass on his knowledge to a new generation of UAV operators. As reported by ArmyInform, Rodion from -Jupiter- is a soldier of the 58th separate motorized infantry brigade, originally from Khmelnytskyi. His story is an example of how a person can change his life and stand up for his country.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/19/za-odyn-vylit-minus-desyat-yak-boyecz-mark-znyshhyv-vorozhyj-blindazh-z-okupantamy/	2025-02-19T03:48:27-08:00

This time, they managed to hit two such points at once within just one day. Also in our possession is another fat target - the Strela-10 self-propelled air defense system (no longer produced, and its analogue, the Pticelov air defense system, costs $3-4 million). And for dessert, a traditional ``loaf'',- the battalion commented on the video.

In January 2025, the SBI exposed and arrested the defector before he began full-time service,- the statement said. The court chose a measure of remand for the defendant — detention without bail. -The figure is accused of collaborative activity (Part 7 of Article 111-1 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine). The sanction of the article provides for punishment in the form of deprivation of liberty for a term of up to 15 years,- the SBI noted.

Teroborona is one of the main elements of the System of National Resistance — the Ministry of Defens...	This was reported by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine on February 19. -Since the large-scale invasion, territorial defense has evolved from a reserve component to a full-fledged combat force. Until 2022, territorial defense was perceived mostly as an auxiliary tool for the Armed Forces, but the realities of war proved that its importance is much greater. Today, territorial defense is an effective mechanism for deterring the enemy and ensuring the stability of the state. In the future, it should become even more prepared, integrated into the general security system and able to quickly adapt to new challenges, turning into a real foundation of national resistance,- said Yuriy Yelenych, head of the national resistance policy department of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. aggression. What is territorial defense? Territorial defense is a system of national, military, and special measures aimed at protecting territories, maintaining population security, and countering threats in a specific area. TrO can perform tasks both in peacetime and in a special period, in particular during the legal regime of martial law. It is a holistic mechanism that unites military units, local authorities and civil society to ensure security and defense at the local level. Territorial defense activities are regulated by the Law -On the Basics of National Resistance-, which entered into force on January 1, 2022. The history of the formation of the modern system of territorial defense began back in 2014, when the first battalions of TrO became part of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces. In 2020, a separate Territorial Defense Command appeared as part of the Ground Forces Command. Before the start of the full-scale invasion, the full-time personnel of TrO was 580 servicemen, but it was this structure that laid the foundation for the further large-scale deployment of territorial defense forces. What is the place of ТРО in the system of national resistance? Territorial defense is one of the three key components of the system of national resistance, along with the resistance movement and the system of preparing citizens for national resistance. Unlike the resistance movement that operates in temporarily occupied territories and the system of citizen training, which forms the base for the resistance, TrO provides direct protection and control of the territories under the control of the Ukrainian authorities. Such a structure makes it possible to create a multi-level defense system, where each component complements the others and works towards a common goal — protecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. What tasks are assigned to territorial defense? Tasks of territorial defense cover a wide range of defense and security functions. The priority is the protection and defense of the territory, which includes a timely response to threats within the defined area and strengthening the protection of the state border. In the same direction, TrO units oppose sabotage and reconnaissance forces and other armed formations of the enemy. The second important task is the protection of critical infrastructure. Territorial defense units provide protection and defense of important facilities and communications, on which the population's livelihood depends. This includes both objects of state importance, determined by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, and objects of local level - oblast, district and city importance. A significant part of the tasks is related to ensuring public safety. TrO, together with law enforcement agencies, participates in maintaining law and order in populated areas, controls movement in emergency zones and areas of hostilities. In the event of the introduction of martial law, territorial defense units are involved in the implementation of appropriate measures of the legal regime. A separate role is assigned to the protection of the civilian population. TrO forces participate in the protection of the population from emergency situations and liquidation of the consequences of hostilities. They also provide conditions for the safe functioning of state authorities and local self-government. An important aspect of activity is the creation of favorable conditions for the defense of the state — from ensuring the strategic deployment of troops to participating in information activities aimed at increasing defense capabilities and countering hostile information operations. In addition, territorial defense participates in the preparation of citizens of Ukraine for national resistance and provides legal assistance to the population in accordance with the law. What does territorial defense consist of? Territorial defense has a complex, but clearly structured organization, which includes three main components: military, civilian and military-civilian. Each of these elements has its own unique functions and tasks, but they all work as a single mechanism. The basis of the military component is the Territorial Defense Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. It is a professional military structure, which includes: This component provides the main military potential of the TR, professional training of personnel and coordination of all military aspects of activity. By decision of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, additional formations may be involved in the performance of territorial defense tasks. The Commander-in-Chief also determines the composition of security and defense forces and means involved in territorial defense, coordinating it with the heads of the relevant management bodies. The civil component is represented by state bodies and local self-government bodies. They provide administrative support, coordination with the local population and resolution of organizational issues - from material support to interaction with local communities. The military-civilian component includes headquarters of territorial defense zones and voluntary formations of territorial communities (DFTG). This element provides direct communication between military structures and local communities, allowing effective coordination of efforts of all participants of territorial defense. On what principle does TrO function? Territorial defense organization is based on the territorial-zonal principle, which takes into account the military-administrative division of Ukraine. This allows you to create a clear management system where each level has its defined tasks and area of ​​responsibility. In practice, this means that each oblast of Ukraine is a separate zone of territorial defense, and districts within the oblast form territorial defense districts. Each such zone and district has its own headquarters. They coordinate all aspects of defense activities on their territory. Such a structure contributes to the effective use of available resources and provides the possibility of prompt response to threats. It also allows maneuvering of forces and assets between zones and districts depending on the operational situation. Who manages territorial defense? The territorial defense management system is built on a clear hierarchical principle. At the highest level, general leadership is exercised by the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces through the Commander of the Territorial Defense Forces. At the regional level, leadership is exercised through regional military administration bodies and the relevant headquarters of the territorial defense zones. They coordinate the actions of all units and formations within their area of ​​responsibility, interaction with other military formations and authorities. At the local level, the headquarters of territorial defense districts operate, which directly organize the implementation of assigned tasks. How does TrO differ from other military formations? Territorial defense has a number of unique features that distinguish it from other military formations. First of all, it is its close connection with local communities and territories. The second important difference is the combination of military and civilian components. TrO not only performs military tasks, but also ensures interaction between military structures, local authorities and the civilian population. Thus, if mobilized individuals can be sent to different units of the Armed Forces, then the TrO consists of both mobilized and volunteers who serve in their local communities. Also, as noted earlier, territorial defense has a wider range of tasks that go beyond purely military functions. In particular, it is the maintenance of law and order, the protection of critical infrastructure and assistance to the population in emergency situations. What is the role of the Security and Defense Forces in repelling Russian aggression? With the beginning of the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation, territorial defense became one of the key elements of the defense of Ukraine. Only during the first month of the great war, more than 110,000 volunteers of various professions and ages joined the ranks of the Territorial Defense Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. This made it possible to quickly form combat-ready units that played a decisive role in the defense of many cities and settlements. The contribution of TrO units to the liberation of Kyiv and the northern regions of Ukraine from the Russian occupiers became particularly important. By ensuring the security of the rear areas, they enabled regular units of the Armed Forces to focus on the most threatening directions. Since 2023, the Territorial Defense Forces have significantly expanded their capabilities - in addition to infantry, they have included mechanized units, aerial reconnaissance units, and mortar units. Special attention is paid to the training of sappers. Today, units of the Territorial Defense Forces continue to perform combat tasks in the most difficult areas of the front, participate in the defense of the southern and eastern regions of Ukraine. The experience of their combat use in the conditions of a full-scale war has become the subject of study in many countries of the world, confirming the effectiveness of the concept of territorial defense as an important component of the national resistance system.

Tested by war: Israeli company modernized active defense system to combat kamikaze drones	According to the authors of site Army Recognition, the management of this manufacturer of various types of weapons from Haifa made such a statement within the framework of the Defense IQ International Armored Vehicles (IAV) conference, which was held in the second decade of January in Farnborough, Great Britain, ArmyInform notes. According to a company representative, the improvement is aimed at solving problems related to low-altitude air threats. Namely: commercially available drones, kamikaze drones and larger fixed-wing UAVs. The upgrade, which requires software tweaks and minor hardware changes, is compatible with existing systems used by operators in the United States and Europe. During testing, the updated Trophy system, mounted on a 30 mm turret, successfully intercepted a fixed-wing jet drone classified between UAV groups 2 and 3. At the same time, in the attack, the drone was directed in an almost vertical dive. Rafael emphasized that these improvements were achieved without changing the system's core hardware. In addition to intercepting drones, the Trophy has been updated based on operational experience, including lessons learned by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) during conflicts in Gaza and northern Israel. These improvements address the system's effectiveness against short-range threats in urban environments and long-range threats such as ATGMs in open terrain. A representative of EuroTrophy, a joint venture between Rafael, GDELS and KNDS to sell the Trophy in Europe, said the system achieved high interception rates during conflicts. The company is working on the integration of Trophy on such platforms as the MGCS and ASCOD infantry fighting vehicles, as well as three types of European armored vehicles with the 8×8 scheme. Representative Rafael noted that the Trophy contributes to operational efficiency by providing consistent vehicle protection, which is critical to mission continuity. The company also highlighted the operational challenges commanders face when vehicle losses threaten the success of an operation. The Trophy APS complex, also known as -Windbreaker-, was developed by Rafael Advanced Defense Systems in cooperation with another Israeli arms concern Elta Systems to counter modern anti-tank threats such as ATGMs, RPGs and other anti-tank weapons. Development began in the 1980s to increase the survivability of armored vehicles in urban environments and on open battlefields. The system became operational in 2009, and its first recorded intercept took place in 2011. Variants were developed for different weight classes of vehicles, including Trophy HV for heavy vehicles, Trophy MV for medium vehicles and Trophy LV for light vehicles. The Trophy's functionality is based on the Elta EL/M-2133 fire control radar, which uses four planar antennas to provide 360-degree coverage. When a flying projectile is detected, the approach vector, threat type, time to impact, and angle of attack are calculated. Rotary launchers deploy Explosive Penetrators (EFPs) in a precise pattern to neutralize threats at a safe distance. The system counters ATGMs, high-explosive anti-tank missiles, RPGs and similar threats. It can engage multiple threats simultaneously on stationary and mobile vehicles and integrates with C4I systems and remotely controlled weapons. Newer models have automatic reloading for continuous combat. Trophy APS has been in service since 2011, demonstrating success in low and high intensity combat in urban, open and forest environments. This system intercepted such threats as Kornet ATGM and RPG-29. By 2017, all Trophy systems had accumulated a total of 50,000 combat hours, and by 2023 production had reached 40 units and 500 countermeasures per month. The radar system can share data with other vehicles, providing improved coordination for threat detection and targeting. It can determine whether or not a projectile will hit a target, holding countermeasures and exchanging data for tactical use. According to reports, the radar provides protection against certain missiles when attacked from above and is used by Israel and the United States. However, Trophy APS has certain limitations in its application. It cannot resist kinetic energy penetrators and is vulnerable to direct attacks from above, as was demonstrated in Israel in 2023 when enemy drones dropped grenades on IDF protected vehicles. It should be taken into account that the weight of this equipment is approximately 500 kilograms. This may affect the performance of light vehicles. The use of EFPs creates risks for infantry that may be near the station, complicating operations involving soldiers in a hurry. Techniques such as rapid succession rocket fire, ultra-close-range RPG attacks, and supersonic projectiles exploited the system's weaknesses. Conflicts in 2023 and 2024 highlighted cases where the system was overwhelmed, and video evidence shows some failures. Rafael representatives emphasized that, despite the new capabilities of combating drones, the Trophy alone cannot provide comprehensive air defense against drones. The company's specialists advocate a multi-level defense strategy that includes mobility, lethality and survivability, supported by technologies such as lasers and electromagnetic spectrum control. The approach is aimed at addressing the growing challenges associated with unmanned aerial vehicles, including the threats of UAV swarms and attacks from the top, which complicate operations for maneuverable forces. Production of the Trophy APS began in Israel in 2007 and in the United States in 2012, with a total production of 40 systems and 500 countermeasures per month by 2023. Since 2010, the device has been deployed on such platforms as the Israeli Merkava Mark 3 and 4 tanks, Namer, armored personnel carriers, and American M1A2 Abrams tanks. The system has been tested on Stryker armored personnel carriers and Bradley fighting vehicles. The lighter version of the Trophy MV/VPS was designed for medium and light vehicles, while the Trophy LV is designed for vehicles up to 8 tonnes. It was also integrated into the German Leopard 2A7A1 tanks and included in the order for the Leopard 2A8. Great Britain has signed contracts to install devices for Challenger 3 tanks. Other potential buyer countries could be Croatia, Lithuania and the Czech Republic. Visualization of the combat application of the Trophy protection system.

Adaptation course of mobilized before deployment -to zero-: ArmyInform report from Donetsk region	-In the areas of hostilities in each military unit, sergeants and officers organize additional training for servicemen who come from training centers after BZVP or after long-term treatment. We call it the adaptation training course. This is a very important element of training, &#8211; says Master Sergeant Yevgeniy. - Why is it important? They are trained here directly by the instructors of units who have extensive combat experience and an understanding of the nature of combat operations in the area of ​​responsibility of the brigade in a specific direction of the area. Mobilized after the BZVP already work in those full-time positions in which they will perform combat tasks. Here they are intensively trained to fight and taught the skills and abilities that they will definitely need on the front line. I will say this: based on my own combat experience, in those military units where this preliminary training is carried out seriously, there is a much better structured combat work on the front lines, and a better level of combat tasks. We are going to the training ground of the 79th separate airborne assault brigade of the Tavrian Armed Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. There, the adaptation course for the training of newly arrived servicemen is currently underway. Optimally, it lasts at least 14 days. Of course, this depends on the combat situation at the front and the capabilities of the brigade. The boys are divided into small training groups, and experienced paratrooper instructors work with them. The range itself is divided into training sectors: tactical, fire training, mine and explosives, engineering training, intelligence, tactical medicine, work with/against UAVs, communications, topography. -The mobilized are chased away very carefully. Here they are adapted to new conditions, taught to survive in battle and destroy the enemy. Today, we organized a meeting with chief sergeants of combat brigades, units and units of the operational-tactical group -Donetsk- at the training ground. These meetings are held in order to increase the level of training of the non-commissioned staff, improve their skills and abilities, in particular, by working out the order of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine regarding the procedure for issuing operational (combat) documents with tactical signs, expanding communication and sharing experience, as well as developing the non-commissioned officer corps. We are developing a certain algorithm of actions so that the sergeants-in-chief of the units already in their units work with their subordinate sergeants-instructors on how to effectively prepare new arrivals for combat operations. Studying new experience and implementing it in parts is the key, constant development of the training system, because the war does not stop for a moment. Here they look at what can be improved in training, what needs to be -trusted- and so on. Each military unit trains its personnel in a different way plus a different educational and material base. The 79th brigade was not chosen by chance - it is one of the best units in the system of conducting preliminary training of servicemen before sending them on combat missions. Experienced and combat instructors, a strong educational and material base of the training ground: this synergy gives good results of combat work in the future. After the -pumping- in the preparatory training, the newly arrived servicemen become more confident and better trained to act in a real combat situation,- &#8211; says Roman. Fighters train on those samples of weapons that are specifically in their unit. Working with weapons and shooting different types of small arms and grenade launchers day and night, throwing grenades. The tactics of actions in urban areas, plantations, fields, ruins of cities and villages are being worked out. Actions in defense and offensive, assault actions, which tactical movements are inherent in various types of combat. The tactics of using small groups: hit and roll back. The actions of clearing trenches, conducting fire at a short distance from the enemy are practiced. Each exercise takes place using FPV drones, drones of various types. The military gets used to the constant -buzzing- of drones, they become less afraid. The boys learn to counter -fpvishkas-, run to cover, shoot down drones in the air. The classes are conducted in the most realistic way, where UAV drops on our military are simulated. FPV drones carry balls of water and sand and deliver -hits- from above. Plus smoke screens, imitation of explosions, that is, people work in conditions that are close to the combat zone. Working on stress resistance, guys need to know how to act in a combat situation, when there is panic, stress or a -stupor-. They are taught how to correctly and quickly cope with stress, make decisions under pressure, and so on. Plus they learn to use electronic devices. It is necessary to be able to suppress the work of enemy UAVs. How important is it for an infantryman to know the basics of mines and explosives? The question is very important. An infantryman or stormtrooper may not know how to properly defuse a mine or other explosive object, but he must be able to identify it, understand what he is dealing with, and how to bypass such a mine. He must have an understanding of what mine obstacles the enemy has placed on the front line. The range of ammunition used by the enemy is simply huge. Anti-personnel, anti-tank mines, various types of stretchers, mine traps. raiders resort to the most diverse ways of mining the terrain, traps can be everywhere: in fields, in bushes, in houses and basements of some settlements. Newcomers are taught how to break through the defense of the occupier, what the enemy mines in the first place, and so on. Training is conducted both during the day and at night with simulation of explosive devices. At the range, paratrooper instructors teach newly arrived soldiers how to properly operate and inflict fire damage on enemy air targets using portable anti-aircraft missile systems. These weapons can be used to destroy low-flying planes, helicopters, UAVs and even enemy missiles. In the classes, visual reconnaissance and identification of aerial targets are mastered. Next, they practice pointing and firing at targets. The guys work on both the Igla MANPADS and the American Stinger. The Stinger is better than the Igla in its tactical and technical characteristics: the target range is up to 8 km, and the height is up to 3.8 km. It has a digital signal processing system, unlike the analog one in the -Igla-. But the -Igla- MANPADS also effectively destroys enemy air targets, but with a slightly shorter attack distance of up to 5 km and an altitude of up to 3.5 km. Tactical medicine is the basis of the adaptation course for military training in combat units. Classes are held daily. The main thing here &#8211; initial medical examination and stopping of critical bleeding. The ability to correctly apply tourniquets and bandages. It is not always possible for combat medics to reach a position on the front line. Therefore, in the conditions of battle and intense shelling, it is extremely important to save one's own life and help a brother if he is wounded. Evacuation of the wounded with the help of various stretchers, homemade wheelbarrows and quadricycles is practiced by itself.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/19/adapczijnyj-kurs-mobilizovanyh-pered-vidpravkoyu-na-nul-reportazh-armiyainform-z-donechchyny/	2025-02-18T20:44:02-08:00
Recruiting in a dress with a backpack -frog-: war -on the screen- UAV operator Siri	Ininterview ArmiyaTV, she said that today she controls drones, watching the war through a screen. Her story is more than a UAV story. It's about a generation coming of age in war. About those who are forced to be torn between civilian and military life. And about those who, despite everything, find the strength to fight. The first thoughts about joining the army appeared in Syria since the time of the ATO. At that time, the girl dreamed of joining -Hospitaliers- - a volunteer organization of paramedics, which was founded by Yana Zinkevich at the beginning of hostilities in Ukraine in 2014. But at first she decided to finish university and get a higher education. The large-scale invasion of the Russians in February 2024 did not allow the girl's dreams to come true. Being in the Kyiv region, she and her parents were at risk of falling into the occupation. I had to leave home and move out with my family. Later, her parents sent her abroad, although she strongly did not want it. Siri understood that she did not belong here and firmly decided that she would definitely return to Ukraine. Eventually it happened. After returning to her homeland, the girl began to search for herself in a military specialty that would not require a lot of physical strength. — And then I started thinking about the possibility of working with drones. At that time, FPV had not yet been used on such a scale. I was looking at Maviks, or large reconnaissance drones. But I knew for sure that I would finish university first, says the girl. The girl remembers the first steps on the way to the 37th Marine Brigade with a smile. Knowing that women were not accepted into the Marine Corps, Siri decided to give it a try. — I came for recruiting through Lobby X. Without a -relationship-, I simply directly asked the sergeant: -Will you take it?-. She was in a dress, with a -frog- backpack. They asked: -Are you sure you're here?-. I say: -Yes, I called you!- she laughs. The girl's motivation convinced the command, and she was taken. Weeks of training, courses and training began, during which the girl learned to work with drones and thought that she would be a Mavic operator. After studying in Britain, where she saw FPV for the first time, she finally decided that she wanted to work in this direction. In general, almost a year passed from the moment of decision on mobilization to departure on a combat mission. — I remember there was a long learning process. At first we waited two weeks for the shipment to Britain. Then study there. They came back and waited another two weeks. We were told that there will be training on the -Maviks-, then the actual training on them&#8230; In general, I was in the training centers for about two months, if not more. And then everything happened very quickly - I arrived, stayed somewhere for four days, they told me: -Do you want to go?- I answered: -I want,- the girl recalls. The first line of responsibility. The first combat task. Only the beginning and immediately difficult and difficult direction - Krynyk. For her, they became the first realization of what war is. How scary it is, how many losses. And on the other hand, understanding how much these people really are titans. Human potential is huge. We can do things that were difficult to even imagine. - I have never been so close to death. But I'm lucky - I'm not in the infantry. I see the war on the screen and it's a little easier. Sometimes the brain sees it as a movie or a game. But when the realization comes that this is reality&#8230; it's scary,'' Siri recalls. - It is difficult to realize how large-scale it all is. When you're in civilian life, you just read the news: -so many occupiers have been destroyed,- -so-and-so died,- it's kind of in the background. Here, on the front line, you see how technology is rapidly developing. One method worked yesterday, but today it no longer works, because Russia is also developing. This is a rather ambivalent perception. I felt it for the first time in Krynyk. After the Kherson region, her brigade was transferred to the Kurakhiv direction, where the battle tactics were significantly different. The enemy quickly adapted, their intelligence worked more efficiently: - It is hotter here in terms of assaults. First, there are new working conditions. In Kherson region, we did not work from the landings. It's not that it's harder or easier, it's just a little different. We prefer to work in the countryside because basements are safer than dugouts. A different situation has developed here: the enemy can reach you on foot. There was water in the Kherson region, even if they wanted to, they couldn't get that close. Now it's a new danger - DRG. Fortunately, we did not have any cases when they came to us or were noticed close. For now. But everything can change. Yes, this is a new threat, new conditions. You have to be on duty, preferably at night, to listen if someone is there or not. Well, it's hotter here in terms of assaults. It was easier there: driving into a position was easier. At the time we were there, FPV drones weren't working that efficiently. The main fighting took place in Krynyk itself, so their intelligence was also there. We were on our shore, so they did less reconnaissance. Although it sometimes happened, but not that often. They usually adjusted the artillery. A new threat has appeared: their intelligence works very well. Unfortunately, they quickly notice the antennas, can see when you take the drone out, even in landing. Even if you place the antenna between the trees, it is still visible. We don't have a very good radio horizon here. Our antenna is higher than the trees, so they figure us out very quickly and start coming at us. There was less of this in Krynyi, because they simply conducted less intelligence. And now they work from all sides - from above, directly, from the left, from the side. They find us very quickly. That's why it's hotter here in this respect, the girl says. By education, she is a specialist in social work, and now she is a military servicewoman who talks about the situation, the nature of hostilities, using general terms and concepts, having her own experience of hostilities in difficult conditions, but she does not feel completely military: - They tell me: -You are a soldier.- And I'm like: -No, no, you shouldn't call me that!-. I am too civilian for the military, too military for civilians. Siri still intends to continue his military career: - If the war does not end before the end of the contract, then perhaps I will consider the option of taking courses and obtaining an officer's rank, but it is too early to talk about it. It's so much responsibility to be honest&#8230; Well, I haven't really thought about it yet. But I don't know how long the war will last. We all imagined that it was for 10 years, and we did not think about civilian life at all. Looking at the contract, I still have two years left. I don't remember how old I am, but I think I'll be out of the army at 25 and&#8230; I can't do anything. So, of course, I'm thinking about something related to the military. I would be interested in international cooperation, because I know the language and understand military affairs, she says. — I don't consider myself a veteran. For me, it was always people who came to us at school: adults, serious, who talked about their military actions, says the servicewoman. — But sometimes you look at that paper&#8230; Yes, it's just a bill. In fact, it can break at any moment. And you are like: -Damn, but it's cool!-. But it was very difficult for me to come to the fact that I really deserved it. For example, when I was given a UBD, I put it down. And it wasn't that I was ashamed, I just didn't feel that I deserved it. But over time&#8230; So I even bought a pink case for him! It's certainly not very military, forgive me!&#8221; Siri smiles. Understanding the difficulties that the modern generation of young Ukrainians has to face in the conditions of war and constant stress, she herself, like no one else, realizes how important it is to communicate with young people on the topic of raising healthy patriotic attitudes in them and constantly preparing them for possible challenges in the future: - I want them to graduated and had the opportunity to live in a peaceful, civil, beautiful Ukraine, went to university and had a normal life&#8230; A life that, unfortunately, we do not have, but it will be as it will be. And it seems to me that it is necessary to prepare for this. Russia is not going anywhere, unfortunately. And at any moment, she can attack again. That's why you need to prepare, you need basic military training. I think absolutely for everyone. And I'm not just talking about boys now. I don't know if they are reviewing the curricula now? It would be cool to introduce classes on drones in computer science. Why not? This is our future. Everyone needs to prepare. And this does not mean that you will necessarily fight. It would be great to invite young veterans to the school, ask them about their experiences, just show the reality. I believe that the youth should communicate with the youth, because in this way they would feel more comfortable than in communication with the older generation, taking into account the social and psychological component of the behavior of young people, - emphasizes the servicewoman.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/19/rekrutyng-u-sukni-z-ryukzakom-zhabka-vijna-na-ekrani-operatorky-bpla-siri/	2025-02-18T20:27:22-08:00
rosfake about -paid evacuation- in Kherson: how everything actually happens	Russian mass media and information resources controlled by them claim that Ukrainian authorities in Kherson are forcing local residents to pay for evacuation from the city. According to them: In reality, the situation is radically different from what Russian propagandists portray. Ukrainian authorities organize evacuation for those who wish to leave dangerous areas, and this process is absolutely free for citizens. In particular: The main goal of such information attacks is to sow distrust in the Ukrainian authorities and create chaos among the population. Russian propaganda is trying: it is not the first time that Russian propaganda has used such methods to destabilize the situation in Ukraine. However, with critical thinking and trust in reliable sources, we can withstand these informational attacks and stay calm in difficult times.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/19/rosfejk-pro-platnu-evakuacziyu-v-hersoni-yak-vse-vidbuvayetsya-naspravdi/	2025-02-18T20:13:18-08:00
Steel -Ty-: The story of a warrior who grew up in -Country- and returned to books	The 23-year-old fighter with the call sign -Tai- (in honor of the antagonist Tai Lung from the children's cartoon) quickly realized that war is not like computer shooters. And if in Counter-Strike you can restart the game after a failed mission, then there is no second chance on the front line. During half a year of service, David gained serious combat experience. The most difficult test was the battle in Toretsk, where his unit faced the enemy literally through the wall - in the neighboring entrances of a four-story building. -At first it was scary,- admits the fighter. -But the comrades knew how to find words that encouraged them to beat the enemy with all their might.- Now they are a real family to him. Despite the brutal realities of the front, David does not lose himself. In between tasks, he returns to books, his old passion. But -Taya's- biggest dream is to go home. To Sumshchyna, where his wife and little son are waiting.

Series -Ы- and -Ъ- - GUR told how the Russian army is modernizing -Shakhedi- and other attack UAVs	The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine informed about this on February 18. Since the beginning of 2025, a number of significant changes have been recorded in the structure of Shahed-136 (-geran-2-, -harpy-): -On the tamper-proof 8-channel satellite navigation CRP antenna with a circular arrangement of peripheral patch antennas, a sticker with markings in Chinese and English -Agricultural equipment parts- and a number indicating for production in 2024,- the statement said. It is noted that the manufacturing method and the color of the body of this antenna are similar to other units and units of the -Ы- series of -Shaheed- manufactured by Iran and the Russian Federation, so the discovered sticker is probably used to mislead about the real origin and purpose of the CRP antenna. -Increasingly, the aggressor state uses products manufactured in China as an alternative to components from the USA, the EU and other countries,- noted the GUR. For example, in the above-mentioned 8-channel antenna of the latest versions of the Shahed-136, the Russians replaced the US-made XILINX Kintex-7 programmable logic integrated circuit, which is a critical component of the CRP antenna, with an integrated circuit manufactured by Beijing Microelectronics Technology, China. UAVs produced on the basis of the special economic zone -Yelabuga- in addition to -Ы- received a new series - -Ъ-. UAVs produced at the -Kupol- electromechanical plant (Izhevsk) received a new -KC- series in addition to the previous -K- and -KB- ones. -There is information that, in addition to the 8-channel comet M8 antennas, new Russian 12-channel comet CRP antennas are also used in the production of enemy attack drones,- the GUR said. Russians use disposable Telegram bots and a Raspberry Pi mini computer, a web camera, and 3G/LTE modems to capture and transmit a video image of the target. According to the scouts, manufactured at the factory in Yelabuga UAVs -Gerbera-, which previously performed a simulation function, the enemy began to equip them with combat units OFBCH-2.5 produced by the enterprise -Basalt- and engineering ammunition KZ-6. A detonator connected to the flight controller via a RUICHI SSR-10DD solid-state relay is used to activate the warhead. Russia is also setting up production of an analogue of the Shahed-238 jet, the Geran-3, with a Tolou-10/13 small-sized turbojet two-circuit engine, which provides a flight speed of up to 550-600 km/h and a range of 2,500 km. -There are a number of tools in the world to create a component famine in Russia for its nuclear weapons - sanctions, export control, compliance, KYC, CHPL. Competent authorities of various countries are capable of cutting off the aggressor from the elements she needs, from OFAC to TAXUD, as well as companies producing components, journalists on different continents,- the GUR summarized. As reported by ArmyInform, soldiers of the -Stugna- special unit, which is part of the -Timur Special Unit- of the GUR of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, in the Kupyansk direction, conducted an operation to eliminate the Russian invaders.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/18/seriyi-%d1%8b-ta-%d1%8a-%e2%80%95-u-gur-rozpovily-yak-armiya-rf-modernizuye-shahedy-ta-inshi-udarni-bpla/	2025-02-18T08:16:04-08:00

Vitaly Pyasetskyi, chief sergeant of the 93rd separate mechanized brigade -Kholodny Yar-, told about this on the air of -Suspilne Novosti- href=-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4XONrDJWsc->. According to him, the brigade constantly conducts aerial reconnaissance, monitors the possible accumulation of the enemy. So far, there are no signs of preparation for a major assault. -They're trying to keep us in tone so that our unit can't do some kind of rotation, positional substitution, or some kind of counter-offensive action. We don't let them relax, and they also don't let us relax somewhere,- Vitaly Piasetskyi said. Also, Vitaliy Pyasetskyi notes, the weather does not allow one to relax. There are several factors that have influenced the decrease in temperature. -Firstly, the sky has cleared with the frosts, and UAVs of various types can carry out reconnaissance almost 24 hours a day.

More and more often, wounded enemy stormtroopers limping towards our positions with sticks or on homemade crutches fall into the field of view of the -Spartan- air reconnaissance in the Pokrovsky direction. They are driven by the fear of being destroyed by their own commanders, the understanding that there is no point in waiting for evacuation, and the hope of Ukrainian capture,- the message says.

But they are three or even five times more than the Defense Forces. -At this time, all their creativity is connected with the use of manpower. The enemy is trying to flood the city itself with his infantry. It takes advantage of the weather when there is fog or precipitation and limited use of our drones.

Repair -Vampire- in the field: how the drones of the -Hart- brigade use the rule of three -C-	Vampire repair video published on the brigade page. During one of the sorties, a Vampire of the Fury unit of the Garth brigade made a hard landing, which resulted in minor damage. Sending the drone immediately to the rear for repairs is not the best solution, because any unnecessary movement in the combat zone increases the risk of being spotted by enemy UAVs. In addition, it is a waste of time, and the task of destroying enemy tanks in the direction required immediate implementation. Therefore, border guards-drones decided to carry out repairs directly in the field, using improvised means. In this, they were helped by the rule of three -Cs-, which they always follow. What is the rule of three -Cs-? The rule of three -Cs- is a kind of code of drones of the Gart brigade, which helps them to make quick and effective decisions in difficult situations. It reads as follows: It was thanks to these three -C's- that the Vampire crew was able to quickly assess the damage to the drone, find the necessary materials and tools, and promptly carry out repairs right at the crash landing site. How was the repair? Repairing the Vampire in the field is always a challenge. However, thanks to their ingenuity and professionalism, the drones of the -Hart- brigade successfully coped with this task. They used materials at hand such as tape, iso tape, plastic ties and others to restore the damaged parts of the drone. Special attention was paid to the restoration of critical systems such as the engine, wings and control system. Thanks to coordinated work and strict adherence to the three -C- rule, repairs were carried out quickly and with high quality. As reported by ArmyInform, Ukrainian border guards from the -Gart- brigade continue to clear the Kharkiv region from the Russian invaders and their fortifications.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/18/remont-vampira-v-polovyh-umovah-yak-dronari-brygady-gart-vykorystovuyut-pravylo-troh-s/	2025-02-18T03:38:49-08:00

-I traded metal hearts for live ones-: the story of a combat medic -Takmeda-	The story of the fighter was made public on the page of 141 separate infantry brigade. -I come from Dnipro, studied at the National Metallurgical Academy, worked as a car mechanic. At the beginning of the full-scale invasion, I was stopped at a checkpoint and taken into the army. And I don't regret it, because now I help people stay alive,- says Takmed. After basic training, he entered the combat medics. Military instructors quickly realized that he had the necessary skills and determination. -At first it was unusual, but then I got involved. I saw a guy pass out when he saw blood at a training session. And I was interested - I even voluntarily went to an autopsy to understand how the human body works. It helped in the real world.- Evacuating the wounded is now a daily risk. -It used to be easier - we drove to the disembarkation point and moved to the positions. Now the enemy controls every meter, uses drones, mines roads. Any exit is a potential ambush.- Once, comrades came to Takmed's position, chatted and returned. -After six hours, the guys run in and shout: -Trouble!- Explosions, shelling&#8230; I am leaving - they are dragging the wounded. One has his legs torn to the knees - I saw all the bones. Tourniquets, hemostatic measures, transportation—everything happened under fire. 82mm and 120mm mortar fire began. While he was helping one, others ran in - every 10 minutes more wounded were brought. We pulled out five in total that day.- -I tell the guys all the time, at least learn how to put a turnstile! It could save your life or someone else's life. When I see that a person can go on his own, I send him on his own so as not to endanger the evacuation transport. And when there is internal bleeding, injuries to vital organs, then without immediate help you cannot survive.- Once, -Takmed- had to evacuate a dead comrade. -The 200th brothers went, and the enemy began to throw petals at us. One guy was blown up, his foot was blown off, another had his whole body cut by a landmine. These were my friends, and for the first few seconds I just froze.

Major Viktor Tregubov, spokesman for the Khortytsia operational-strategic group of troops, told about this on the air of -Suspilne Novosti- . According to him, the Russians understand that without Pokrovsk, the capture of the southern part of the Donetsk region is simply impossible. That is why they concentrated all their efforts in this direction. However, it was near Pokrovsk that obvious signs began to appear that the Russians were starting to run out of steam. -Despite a great advantage in manpower, the Russians have lost what in English is called momentum. This is the same moment of momentum that allows you to press. Because, first of all, it is impossible to maintain such pressure all the time. They are also exhausted. Second, the Ukrainians managed to build an effective defense based on the interaction of infantry and drones. the Russians encountered resistance that they did not expect,- Viktor Tregubov said. The enemy's losses, the spokesman of the Khortytsia operational-strategic troop grouping, noted, are very high. And not only soldiers. -They are losing a record number of armored vehicles. They started to lose even RSZV. This means that they are affected quite deeply. And manpower losses are also very high. 7 thousand killed and total losses of 14-15. This is in a month and this is the Pokrovsky direction. Under one Pokrovsk, Russians bury as much in a month as the Soviet Union could bury in Afghanistan in a few years,- Victor Tregubov summarized. As reported by ArmyInform, the enemy is attacking with infantry units in the Pokrovsky direction. Armored vehicles are almost never used, because as soon as they start to -come forward- for an assault, units of the Defense Forces immediately detect and destroy them.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/18/okupanty-vtratyly-momentum-u-rosiyan-pid-pokrovskom-vtraty-bilshi-nizh-u-srsr-v-afganistani/	2025-02-18T01:53:03-08:00

Two days of war, one wound, zero machine guns: new records of Russian paratroopers	The video of the interrogation of the captives was made public on the brigade's page. One of these -fighters- fought for only two days, managed to get wounded, lose his machine gun and surrender. Another, more experienced, justified himself during interrogations: he said that he personally did not want to shoot captured Ukrainians in the back, but was ready to carry out such an order. If someone in the Russian Federation still believes in the -greatness- of their army, it is enough to look at these poor paratroopers. Some surrender after the first fire, others run away without weapons, and some are completely confused in their own testimony, talking about orders not to take prisoners, but at the same time happily surrendering themselves. As reported by ArmyInform, the battle for Chasiv Yar does not stop for a moment. The Russian occupiers do not stop trying to storm the city, throwing airborne and motorized rifle units into the battle.

Military cooperation between the DPRK and Russia poses a serious threat to the international communi...	This stated the head of the GUR of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, Lieutenant General Kyrylo Budanov, in an interview with the South Korean publication The Chosun. According to him, the North Korean group lost about 4,000 soldiers killed and seriously wounded in the war against Ukraine. But despite significant losses, North Korean forces continue to actively participate in joint operations with Russian troops. There is also an increase in the number of North Korean artillery at the front. -This war mobilized all the military capabilities of the countries involved. Only three states—Ukraine, Russia, and North Korea—gain direct experience of full-scale war in the 21st century. The future North Korean army will be radically different from the past,- Kyrylo Budanov emphasized. The head of the GUR of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine emphasized that the aggressor state Russia and the DPRK are deepening military cooperation in the sphere of technology, science and industry. -This cooperation reaches the highest level and poses a serious threat to the international community. [&#8230;] North Korea is using this war to gain combat experience and modernize its military technology. This will have long-term consequences for the security system in the Asia-Pacific region,- noted Kyrylo Budanov. As an example, he described the changes that North Korea's KN-23 missile has undergone. -At first, its accuracy was very low, with an error of 500 to 1,500 meters, but Russian specialists made technical modifications. Now the missile has become much more accurate and is a much more serious threat,- noted the head of the Ukrainian intelligence service, adding that this missile weapon threatens the security of South Korea and Japan. Kyrylo Budanov expressed hope that cooperation between Kyiv and Seoul will deepen. -Both Ukraine and South Korea are facing the same enemy - North Korea. South Korea has decades of intelligence on North Korea, and that information would be extremely valuable to us. Ukraine is now gaining combat experience on its own battlefield. The exchange of this experience and intelligence would be mutually beneficial,- the head of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine emphasized.

Volodymyr Zelenskyi and Emmanuel Macron discussed security guarantees for Ukraine	This was reported by the head of the Ukrainian state on his page. According to Volodymyr Zelenskyi, France and Ukraine share a common vision of the need for reliable and strong security guarantees. He emphasized that any other decision, including a fragile ceasefire without clear guarantees, would be just another deception on the part of Russia and could lead to new aggression against Ukraine or other European countries. Emmanuel Macron, for his part, informed the Ukrainian leader about his negotiations with other European and world leaders. As a result of the conversation, the parties agreed to maintain constant contact and continue work on strengthening the security of Ukraine and the region as a whole. -It is necessary to ensure reliable, lasting peace. It can only be a consequence of strong security guarantees,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy emphasized. As reported by ArmyInform, President Volodymyr Zelenskyi said that Ukraine should have clearly defined security guarantees: NATO or reliable alternative.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/18/volodymyr-zelenskyj-ta-emmanyuel-makron-obgovoryly-garantiyi-bezpeky-dlya-ukrayiny/	2025-02-17T21:19:34-08:00
The daring French, 10 Polish billions and the fleet in Naples: who in Europe is the world leader in ...	-On February 18, the first serious negotiation process should take place between the United States of America and representatives from the Russian Federation to find a formula for exiting this phase of the war. This is a very fundamental event indeed. And representatives of European countries clearly react to it, especially in the context of the Munich conference that took place. Because it is known that the Europeans will not be involved there (in the negotiations between the USA and the Russian Federation - ed.). France takes the most active position. And the French say they are beginning to rebuild a major security process that may be independent of the United States. And here there are several pitfalls, very serious ones. Europe after the Second World War was under the nuclear umbrella, primarily of the United States of America. And we must understand that 90% of the NATO bloc is the United States. At the same time, the Europeans still remain major arms producers. Let's say, according to the results of 2024, the French for the first time in their history as a weapons manufacturer came in second place after the United States. Will such a peculiar military demarche of the French be crowned with success? In my opinion, it is still too early to draw a conclusion. Because there are countries in Europe that directly sympathize with the Russian Federation. I mean Hungary, Slovakia. Let's not forget that right-wing and left-wing forces are gaining momentum. What is Marine Le Pen's party worth in France itself? Not to mention the fact that -Alternative for Germany- in Germany is a right-wing populist party, and I would call it the extreme right, which is very much claiming a serious role in the parliamentarianism of this country. Will Europe try to build some kind of collective system? Yes, it will definitely be. Large manufacturers of weapons and equipment have already announced joint projects, both with Ukraine, and the restoration of entire production chains. And, let's say, a country like Poland bought more than 10 billion dollars worth of weapons. Which is an unprecedented phenomenon on the European continent since the collapse of the Warsaw bloc. However, here we really need to be patient and wait, because the interests of the big players do not always coincide. Let's not forget, there is Great Britain, which left the European Union and remembered that it was once a powerful empire. The Scandinavians started militarization very seriously. For the first time since World War II, both Sweden and Finland joined NATO. In fact, the voices are getting louder and louder that every country should spend more than two - and some already say even 3-4% - of the gross domestic product on defense. The process has begun. And it will grow. But in view of the fact that there are 28-30 countries of the European Union and NATO countries on the European continent, it will not happen all at once. This will take some time. And I have no reason to say that it will all be very fast and very high quality. But even if we just focus purely on the financial part, I must remind that over 140 billion dollars were allocated to us during this war, primarily by the countries of the European Union. The USA is on the second step in these indicators. So, in the strategic sense of understanding that war as a tool of geopolitics has returned to our history, the Europeans have. And they will gradually develop their own outlines of collective security. Will it come to a point when Europe will completely follow America? In my opinion, no. Because we must understand that the presence of American troops in Europe is not only a security part. This is also finance. One aircraft carrier strike group, which is, say, in the Mediterranean and is based in the city of Naples, that's a huge cost of maintenance. And these, accordingly, are the funds of manufacturers of both weapons and maintenance. And countless examples can be drawn here. But speculation in this direction will continue. Indeed, Trump announced a strategic concept called Make America Great Again. Which means let's make America great again. And such strategic processes of isolationism are now visible in them. The most important takeaway from all of this. Both Europe and the world in general are entering a zone of enormous geopolitical turbulence. And the cascades of small, medium and, perhaps, one big war will only increase.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/18/zuhvali-franczuzy-10-polskyh-milyardiv-ta-flot-u-neapoli-hto-v-yevropi-svitovyj-lider-u-pytannyah-bezpeky/	2025-02-17T21:10:24-08:00
The aggressor keeps a missile carrier in the Black Sea: there is a threat of a strike	This was reported by the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. At the same time, there are currently no enemy ships in the Sea of ​​Azov. Four more Russian ships, three of which also carry Kalibr cruise missiles with a total salvo of up to 26 missiles, remain in the Mediterranean Sea. During the day, in the interests of the Russian Federation, passage through the Kerch Strait was carried out: the Russian Federation continues to violate the International Convention for the Protection of Life at Sea of ​​1974. (SOLAS) by disabling automatic identification systems. As reported by ArmyInform, the Naval Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces monitor mine safety in the water area around the ports. Odesa, however, in other places it is quite problematic.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/18/agresor-trymaye-raketonosij-u-chornomu-mori-ye-zagroza-udaru-2/	2025-02-17T21:07:43-08:00
Additional 70,000 -combat-: who has the right, the calculation procedure and whether it is possible ...	And although it is called -disposable-, but is essentially reusable. After all, you can receive it several times. How it works, ArmiyaInform tells. This payment is intended specifically for those who directly perform combat or special tasks on the front lines of the enemy or in his rear: This payment works on an accrual basis for every 30 days of tasks. That is, if, for example, you were on the front line for 15 days in February and another 15 days will be in March, then already in April you should receive 70,000. If there will be, for example, 18 days in March. So in April you will still receive 70,000, and another 3 days will go into the account for the next payment. And so every time 70 thousand for every 30 days of combat (special) tasks. So it turns out that the -one-time- reward turns into a multiple one. Importantly! The performance of such tasks must be confirmed on the basis of a combat order, combat log, or combat report, and a unit commander's report on the performance of tasks by each serviceman. If a serviceman is seconded to another unit, then it is the unit that must keep track of the days of tasks and transfer this data to the staff unit where the serviceman is serving. And on the basis of these data, the staff unit must issue a payment order. Data is transmitted by the 5th. That is, if in June a military serviceman accumulates 30 days of performing tasks on the front line, then by July 5 these data must be in his regular part to calculate the payment. It is worth making sure that this data is transferred. If the serviceman was transferredto another unit, then information about the number of days of combat missions (if there were less than 30 and the payment has not yet been made) must be in the order of the commander of the military unit. Therefore, during the transfer, it is worth checking that these days are included in the order. We will remind that these 70 thousand are not a replacement for 100 thousand -combatants-, but an additional reward to them.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/18/dodatkovi-70-tysyach-bojovyh-hto-maye-pravo-poryadok-obchyslennya-ta-chy-mozhna-otrymaty-ne-raz/	2025-02-17T20:47:51-08:00
The Middle East -Spider- is spreading its webs: the demand for the products of the Israeli manufactu...	The authors of the Dutch portal for the study of defense processes Army Recognition (AR) note that representatives of the military department of this Asian island state announced the relevant intentions in the first decade of February, ArmyInform reports. At the same time, AR experts emphasize the fact that for official Manila, the products of Rafael Advanced Defense Systems from the Israeli city of Haifa are well known. After all, the Spyder-MR complexes are in the arsenal of the Philippine Air Force. It is worth noting that the Spyder family of systems (Ukrainian: -Pavuk-) was developed by Rafael with the participation of another Israeli defense giant, Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), and has several versions that differ in range and launch methods. Spyder-SR (Short Range) and Spyder-ER (Extended Range) are designed for close and medium range protection. The Spyder-SR has a maximum engagement range of up to 15 km, while the Spyder-ER can intercept targets at a distance of up to 25 km. These complexes use inclined launchers, which speeds up the targeting process and reduces reaction time. The Spyder is built on a modular basis and is designed to intercept a variety of aerial threats, including aircraft, helicopters, cruise missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles. The main advantage of the complex is its mobility, ability to work in difficult radio-electronic conditions and flexibility in integration with different platforms. Python-5 missiles with an infrared guidance system and Derby missiles with an active radar correction head are selected as standard ammunition for hitting targets for this complex. Python-5 has high maneuverability and the ability to capture the target -after launch-, which allows the operator to change the pre-selected target to another already in the direct flight mode of the missile. An important feature of the Spyder is the use of modern radar systems. The standard version uses various radars from IAI Elta, such as EL/M-2106 ATAR 3D and EL/M-2138M Green Rock AESA. The variants of the medium and long-range systems (Spyder-MR and Spyder-LR) integrate the EL/M-2084 multifunctional radar, which is also used in the famous Israeli system -Iron Dome-, which has been repeatedly discussed site IKK Defense Express, the Spyder All in One system can be used both as an independent unit and as part of a battery. The maximum number of targets fired at the same time is 4. The minimum time to prepare for combat readiness is 3 minutes. The weight of the machine, including eight missiles, is about 30 tons. Spyder, according to the official portal of the manufacturing company, is actively exported to various countries, including India, the aforementioned Philippines, Singapore and the Czech Republic. India uses the complex to protect its military facilities, while the Philippines has adapted the system using modified radars. High mobility and modularity make this air defense complex attractive to states seeking to provide reliable airspace protection without the need to deploy large fixed systems. Current trends in Spyder development include improving targeting algorithms, improving jamming and adapting to new types of threats, including stealth drones and hypersonic targets. Israeli developers are working with the experience of using this defense equipment during recent military conflicts of IDF fighters in the Gaza Strip and in the north, actively working to increase the range of detection of enemy objects and the effectiveness of missile interceptors, which will allow the system to remain relevant in the conditions of a permanent military situation. The Spyder family of Israeli air defense systems is air defense against all threats.

-Magic montage- from the FSB: in the swamps they create -horror stories- for their own population	Russian propagandists traditionally rely on cheap editing, primitive scripts and actors who, in a peaceful life, probably work as porters. In a recent video released by the -public- of the FSB, Ukrainian soldiers seem to be shooting at their comrades. Everything would be scary if it wasn't so funny. The problem is that the -murder- is filmed as unconvincingly as the Russian -referendum- in Mariupol. The camera shakes on purpose, at the climax of the -shot-, the video cuts, and the body of the -killed- never enters the frame after the -execution-. No splashes of blood, no real fall physics are classic signs of a fake video created in the best traditions of Russia's TikTok troops. Facebook movie fans do not particularly burden themselves with the thoughtfulness of the script, so their -exclusives- are easy to check: Sharp editing - frames are cut exactly at the moment of a shot or other -violent- scene. No aftermath – no blood, bullet marks, or physical body reactions. Inadequate quality - the camera is deliberately shaken or shot at dusk to hide details. Lack of confirmation - There is no evidence that the video is related to the ZSU. the Kremlin again resorts to dirty tricks, because it simply has no other methods of influencing the world. War crimes, terror and propaganda are the three pillars on which the Russian empire of lies rests. However, with each such fake, they only prove their weakness. Because while the Russians are filming production videos, Ukrainian soldiers are destroying their warehouses, headquarters and equipment. The reality is this: mass shootings do take place in the Russian army, only the mobs themselves, who are thoughtlessly thrown to the front lines, become the victims. But this is no longer a fake, but a reality. And no editing will hide it.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/18/magiya-montazhu-vid-fsb-na-bolotah-stvoryuyut-strashylky-dlya-vlasnogo-naselennya/	2025-02-17T20:11:41-08:00

He said that he called the principal of the school with the demand to conduct an internal investigation and collect explanations from all those who participated in this act. -I personally find it strange that none of those who participated in the preparation and direct participation in this scene felt resistance.

And the Russians are methodically destroying them along with the houses. It is currently impossible to find out how many Russians have died, because the work is made very difficult by the constant operation of drones, which hit vehicles and even armored vehicles at the entrance to the city. Accordingly, the delivery of humanitarian aid, namely food and medical supplies, becomes more difficult. Russians hit ambulances with FPV drones. Therefore, the process of searching for people under the rubble is currently impossible. There are territories located in the zone of activity of the units of the Armed Forces. If our fighters have time, they provide assistance and evacuate people. Yesterday, for example, at night, a husband and wife were taken to a medical facility. A man lost an eye as a result of an aerial bomb explosion. In general, there were 13 aerial bomb strikes in one day and, characteristically, all the bombs fell near the houses, that is, they did not hit the houses, but they hit nearby and people were left without homes at all. In fact, the entire street was completely destroyed. People live in basements. Instead, the Russians are proud of the fact that they have great success in conducting hostilities. Although success is minimal. Russia does not need these people, and this is evidenced by the fact that a decision has not yet been made to accept these people on the territory of Russia. They should have been taken out a week ago. All the necessary assistance to the people was provided, but Russia is still silent about the reception of its citizens. Both the enemy and the population of Russia now know clearly what a war on their own territory is like. Interestingly, Russians pray a lot&#8230; for our soldiers. I'm serious, they call and say that they are visiting monasteries now, ordering God's service for our health and so on. One woman right here gives me a report - she calls and tells: -I was in such a monastery this weekend, I ordered a service for you, collected notes from the people of the Suzhan district and wrote a lot about you, your boys, so that you are all alive and healthy. She said that until the end of her life she would pray for us to God.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/17/na-kurshhyni-rosiyany-zamovlyayut-bozhu-sluzhbu-za-zdorovya-nashyh-voyiniv-polkovnyk-dmytrashkivskyj-rozpoviv-pro-evakuacziyu-poranenyh-czyvilnyh/	2025-02-17T07:15:15-08:00
The Ombudsman reacted to the video of the alleged shooting of Ukrainian prisoners of war	He wrote about this on February 17 on his channel. In particular, Russian military channels publish videos of the probable execution of Ukrainian servicemen who were captured by the Russians. On the video, Russian soldiers are repeatedly ordered to shoot prisoners of war. -This underlines that executions are a conscious policy of Russia. Such actions violate international humanitarian law and the Geneva Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners of War. As the Ombudsman of Ukraine, I immediately sent letters to the UN and the International Committee of the Red Cross,- said Dmytro Lubinets. He emphasized that organizations should put pressure on the Russian side so that the Russian Federation feels the consequences of such actions and does not commit them in the future. -If you witnessed or have any information regarding the specified fact of a crime against Ukrainian servicemen, please report it immediately to the -hotline- of the Ombudsman of Ukraine at the number 0800 50 17 20,- the message reads. As reported by ArmyInform, since the end of August 2024, the UN Monitoring Mission on Human Rights in Ukraine recorded 79 strata of Ukrainian prisoners of war by the Russian Federation in 24 separate cases.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/17/ombudsman-vidreaguvav-na-video-jmovirnogo-rozstrilu-ukrayinskyh-vijskovopolonenyh/	2025-02-17T07:13:55-08:00
Three armored columns — none reached: near Velika Novosilka, the Russians fought their way with mech...	Major Ivan Sekach, head of the communications department of the 110th separate mechanized brigade named after Corporal General Mark Bezruchka, told about this on the Espresso broadcast. According to him, there were three columns, each of which had 5-8 units of -armor-. The equipment did not fulfill its task - not a single column reached. However, a large number of infantry still gives the enemy an advantage, since the Russians have small advances. -Currently, we don't have enough infantry to counter infantry itself. Yes, we use shells, FPV drones and everything else. This stops the enemy, but he has opportunities to advance at the expense of infantry,- said the head of the communications department of the 110th separate mechanized brigade named after Colonel-General Mark Bezruchka. As ArmyInform reported, the situation in Kharkiv Oblast is currently under control, the enemy is unable to realize its assault potential. Although he is trying, and is now making the most of mechanized connections.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/17/try-bronovani-kolony-zhodna-ne-dijshla-poblyzu-velykoyi-novosilky-rosiyany-probyvalysya-mehanizovanymy-kulakamy/	2025-02-17T07:09:20-08:00
The US special representative discussed at the NATO headquarters how to end the war in Ukraine	This was reported by the press service of the Alliance. -Today, he held consultations with members of the NATO Alliance regarding joint work to ensure a just and lasting peace in Ukraine.

He emphasized the value of extensive consultations with the US administration, including during the meeting of NATO defense ministers last week, and emphasized the importance of a fair and long-term settlement of the conflict to ensure a stable future for Ukraine. -Mark Rutte welcomed the initial responses from Allies to the US call for increased engagement, noting that today's discussions provided another opportunity to align views on how best to support sustainable peace,- the statement said. It is noted that after the meeting of the North Atlantic Council, Mark Rutte went to Paris for an informal meeting of European leaders organized by the French president. President Volodymyr Zelenskyi announced today that on February 20, Keith Kellogg will visit Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/17/speczpredstavnyk-ssha-obgovoryv-u-shtab-kvartyri-nato-yak-zavershyty-vijnu-v-ukrayini/	2025-02-17T06:56:44-08:00
The Ministry of Defense initiates the creation of an innovation hub for the implementation of the la...	deputy head of the Main Department of Mine Action, Civil Defense and Environmental Safety Oleg Shuvarskyi told about this during the session -Mine Action in Ukraine-. -One of the tasks of such a hub will be the assessment of modern technologies, comparison of global innovations, classification of potential solutions in accordance with international and national standards of mine action, testing of the latest developments,- Oleg Shuvarskyi noted. According to him, this will make it possible to form a -bank of technologies in the field of mine action- and prioritize them for implementation and scaling up in the country. He also reminded that the Ministry of Defense is working on the possibility of creating a modern testing ground for testing innovative technologies, including artificial intelligence, in demining processes. The session was organized by the Geneva International Center for Humanitarian Demining. In addition to representatives of the IOU, the event was attended by corps diplomats, the UN, the OSCE, the secretariat of the National Mine Action Authority, as well as international experts, experienced specialists in the mine action sector and developers of innovative technologies. As reported by ArmyInform, a group of Ukrainian servicemen passed a training course for specialists in the disposal of explosive objects the highest level 3+ (IMAS EOD LEVEL 3+) and obtained the relevant qualification. The training took place at the MAT Kosovo certified training center, which has been operating in Kosovo since 1999.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/17/minoborony-inicziyuye-stvorennya-innovaczijnogo-habu-dlya-vprovadzhennya-novitnih-tehnologij-rozminuvannya/	2025-02-17T06:39:52-08:00
Ukrainian drones hit the enemy's key defense enterprises in the Kuban	This is stated in the message of the SSO. About 20 explosions rang out at the Ilya oil refinery, about 400 kilometers from the territory controlled by the Ukrainian army. The fire is still raging at the facility. The plant has six technological units for oil refining with a capacity of 6.6 million tons per year. This month, Ukrainian drones have already hit this plant, which provides fuel for the Russian army to wage war against Ukraine. Another affected facility — one of the largest energy facilities in Russia — completely shut down after a Ukrainian drone strike. The enemy is pumping oil bypassing the Kropotkinskaya station at minimum speeds. Such facilities not only supply fuel to the Russian army, but also directly finance the war against Ukraine with oil revenues.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/17/ukrayinski-drony-vrazyly-klyuchovi-oboronni-pidpryyemstva-voroga-na-kubani/	2025-02-17T06:36:41-08:00

Peacekeeping mission: how Europe reacts to the idea of ​​sending troops to Ukraine	An important point of such an agreement may be the placementof peacekeeping forces on Ukrainian territory, which will ensure a ceasefire. The USA, which so far communicates only directly with the Russians, without involving either Ukraine or Europe, has already declared that there will be no American soldiers in Ukraine under any circumstances. Therefore, the most likely option at the moment is the formation of such peacekeeping forces from the European military. And some countries have already expressed their support for participating in this mission. ArmyInform collected the reactions of European capitals regarding their readiness to send their troops to Ukraine. At the beginning of January, French President Emmanuel Macron took the initiative to deploy European peacekeepers on the territory of Ukraine. However, this was before all the loud statements and actions of the White House regarding the start of negotiations with the Russians. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said last week that, taking into account the length of the front line, according to the calculations of the Ukrainian side, 100,000 troops will be needed for the peacekeeping mission, and Kyiv has already prepared a corresponding map for the allies. Actually, this is a very high figure. For comparison: the number of the German Bundeswehr is about 180,000 soldiers, and the armed forces of Great Britain — 148,000 soldiers. However, London was the first to officially declare that it was ready to send British troops to the territory of Ukraine to ensure the implementation of any peace agreement. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer in an article for The Telegraph emphasized that Europe faced -a once-in-a-generation moment for the collective security of our continent-. -This involves further support for the Armed Forces of Ukraine, as well as the introduction of our troops into the territory of the country, if necessary,- he said. After that, Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson also stated that sending Swedish troops to Ukraine as part of peacekeeping forces is possible. -There has to be a very clear mandate for this force, and I don't think we'll be able to get that until we get further in the negotiations. But Sweden, as a rule, is involved in strengthening security in our part of the world, so I predict that we will be part of this process this time as well,- — he explained his position. The German government, as usual, issued a cautious statement, noting that it is premature to talk about sending peacekeepers at the moment -We have repeatedly said that we should first wait and see if he comes peace, as we hope, to Ukraine, and if so, in what way. Then we can discuss the conditions and how it can be organized,- — German government spokeswoman Christiane Hoffmann said. The German government also expressed reservations about the announced talks between high-ranking Russian and American officials, warning that they should be aimed at -achieving lasting peace in Ukraine.- At the same time, neighboring Poland declared that it will not send its troops to Ukraine, but will support other countries that agree to this mission. -We do not foresee sending Polish soldiers to the territory of Ukraine, but we will support countries that may want to provide such guarantees,- — Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk assured, adding that his country will also continue to provide military and financial support aid. Hungary, which traditionally opposes any military aid to Ukraine, criticized European leaders. The head of the Foreign Ministry, Peter Sijarto, said that Europe is allegedly -obstructing- the US president from concluding a peace agreement in Ukraine. -We welcome the resumption of the Russian-American dialogue at the highest level. We are pleased and relieved to learn that Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin had a long conversation-, — said the Hungarian minister. Tonight in the capital of France, an emergency meeting initiated by Emmanuel Macron will take place after Donald Trump's special envoy to Ukraine Keith Kellogg said that the United States does not see Europe at the negotiating table to end Russia's war against Ukraine. In the meeting will be attended by Great Britain, Germany, France, Poland, Italy, Spain and Denmark, which will represent the Baltic and Scandinavian countries. A number of countries, in particular, Romania, the Czech Republic and Slovenia, expressed their disappointment that they were not invited to the summit. The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, who will also be at the summit, has already arrived in Paris. -Europe's security is going through a turning point. Yes, it is about Ukraine, but it also concerns us. We need an urgent rethink. We need to strengthen the defense. And we need both now,- she wrote on the social network Kh. European leaders will obviously discuss further joint actions against the background of the first steps of the new administration in the White House and the meeting of the US and Russian delegations organized by Washington on February 18 in Saudi Arabia regarding the end of the war in Ukraine. Among the issues should be a possible peacekeeping mission as part of the future agreement, as well as security guarantees for Ukraine. Europe's position is currently unequivocal — any peace agreement with Russia is impossible without European participants. Ukraine maintains the same position. -Ukraine will not take part in negotiations in Saudi Arabia and will not recognize any agreements about Ukraine without the participation of official Kyiv,- Volodymyr Zelenskyi said on Monday while visiting the United Arab Emirates.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/17/myrotvorcha-misiya-yak-yevropa-reaguye-na-ideyu-vidpravyty-vijska-v-ukrayinu/	2025-02-17T06:18:11-08:00
They made money from the relatives of the mobilized: an employee of the Mykolayiv RTCC and the SP ar...	This is reported by the State Bureau of Investigation on February 17. Money was demanded from the relatives of the men who were taken to the recruitment center for verification of military registration documents. -If their relatives came to pick them up, the civil partner of the TCC employee approached them and offered to -solve the issue- for money. For 4.5 thousand USD plots promised to influence TCC officials and send the conscript home,- the report says. On February 13, 2025, law enforcement officers detained an employee of the TCC with an accomplice while receiving payment for such a service from the relatives of a mobilized person who had already joined the ranks of the Armed Forces. He learned about the fact that money was demanded from his family only after the arrest of the participants of the arrangement. -The employee of the TCC and his accomplice were informed of the suspicion of obtaining an illegal benefit for influencing the decision-making by a person authorized to perform state functions (Part 2, Article 28, Part 3, Article 369-2 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine). The issue of choosing a preventive measure for the detainee is being resolved,- the SBI said. The article is punishable by up to 8 years of imprisonment. The investigation is ongoing, the SBI is identifying all persons possibly involved in the device. As reported by ArmiyaInform, DBR employees detained an instructor of the recruiting department of the Mukachevo RTCC and SP, who for money helped men of draft age to escape from the premises of the assembly center, and to servicemen who were returned after voluntarily leaving the unit - from the reserve battalion.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/17/zaroblyaly-na-rodychah-mobilizovanyh-pidozryuyut-spivrobitnyka-mykolayivskogo-rtczk-ta-sp/	2025-02-17T06:02:35-08:00
Volodymyr Zelenskyi told what security guarantees Ukraine should have	He said this during a video conference with media representatives while on an official visit to the United Arab Emirates. According to him, security guarantees for Ukraine should be comprehensive and include weapons, as well as economic and political support. -If we don't have NATO, then, relatively speaking, NATO should be built in Ukraine. Conditionally speaking, but do not conditionally, but do objectively. That is, a million-strong army, and money is needed here, and who gives money for it. Besides money, there are weapons. If a contingent, then the size of this contingent, where they will be, from which countries, what and how they are armed. And if there is a contingent, it is very important not to lose the USA in one way or another,- the head of state said. He noted that there is significant progress in the issue of the contingent. In particular, it will be discussed today at the meeting of European leaders in France. The military contingent in Ukraine can also become the first platform for the creation of the future armed forces of Europe, which in the sky, on water and on land, with the help of drones and artificial intelligence, will be able to respond in the event of an attack. -We can create a platform from strong countries - only those who want to. This is very important: not those whom we force, but those who want. You know perfectly well that a warrior who was forced and a warrior who came on his own are completely different armies. We want security guarantees not on paper, but on the ground, on the water and in the sky. Air defense, planes, ships,- summarized Volodymyr Zelenskyi. As reported by ArmyInform, the President of Ukraine paid a working visit to the United Arab Emirates, where he held a meeting with the President UAE by Muhammad bin Zayed Al Nagayan. The key topics of the negotiations were the release of Ukrainian prisoners of war, economic cooperation and humanitarian initiatives.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/17/volodymyr-zelensky-rozpoviv-yaki-garantiyi-bezpeky-povynna-maty-ukrayina/	2025-02-17T05:34:02-08:00
The Cabinet made important decisions for the military: from motivation to digital innovation	reported this by Nikita Nikitenko, Acting State Secretary of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. Among the adopted resolutions of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine: 1. Increasing motivation for military service for young people: The government approved an experimental project aimed at increasing the motivation of citizens aged 18 to 25 before military service service during martial law. 2. Psychophysiological examination with the use of a polygraph: The procedure for conducting a psychophysiological examination with the use of a polygraph during a special check of foreigners and stateless persons has been approved. This innovation should strengthen control over persons who apply for citizenship of Ukraine or to work in state bodies or the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and will contribute to preventing the entry of undesirable elements into the country. 3. Improvement of the defense procurement mechanism: Amendments were made to the procedure for using the funds provided for in the state budget for procurement of defense goods, works and services by the State Enterprise of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine -Defense Procurement Agency-. These changes are aimed at increasing the efficiency and transparency of defense procurement, as well as at providing the needs of the Armed Forces of Ukraine with modern and high-quality equipment and weapons. 4. and 5. Amendments to the resolutions of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine: Amendments were made to the resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine dated July 12, 2006. No. 964.

Oleksandr Borodin, spokesman of the Third Assault Brigade, told about this on the air of -Suspilne Novosti-. According to him, the Russians are attacking with the mechanized formations of two Russian divisions. The situation is unusual, because usually the enemy tries to preserve the -armor-, instead throwing infantrymen into the assaults. -Earlier, tanks were used as artillery - from closed firing positions. To reduce risks for machines. Now used in assaults. For them, these are valuable assault actions because we destroy a lot. This speaks of a serious motivation or order to advance in our direction,- said Oleksandr Borodin. As reported ArmyInform, very active fighting is going on in the Pokrovsk direction, southwest of the city of Pokrovsk. However, lately the Russians have been getting more trouble there than they bargained for.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/17/dlya-nyh-cze-koshtovni-bojovi-diyi-dvi-rosijski-dyviziyi-spalyuyut-svoyi-tanky-na-harkivshhyni/	2025-02-17T05:23:22-08:00
-Twenty grenades on the helmet-: the fighter -Jupiter- told about his most terrible battle and why h...	The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. According to the press service of the 58th OMPBr, Rodion once graduated from the Ivan Bohun Kyiv Military Lyceum and even studied for three years at the National Academy of Internal Affairs, but due to health problems, he was unable to complete his studies. Later, the man's life turned out to be such that he ended up on the dock and serving his sentence. When the prisoners were allowed to fight, Rodion, without hesitation, asked for the front. After training, he got into an assault unit, part of which is now fighting as part of the 58th motorized infantry brigade. -I remembered one of my first combat missions for the rest of my life,- says -Jupiter-. — We then stormed the enemy's position, which could not be taken before us for two years. We went in, established ourselves, and then everything possible started working on us - artillery, mortars, especially there were a lot of drones. I hid in the hole, so that only my helmet was sticking out of it. It was this helmet that made the resets. I counted twenty grenades. They hit the helmet, bounce and explode next to it. It's a miracle I didn't go deaf - tactical headphones saved me. Then came FPVs. Many. I started running around the trench, distracting myself so that the drones would chase me. I wrote such twists and turns! They couldn't hit me, they exploded nearby.- Unfortunately, one of the explosions still hit Rodion - a fragment hit his hand. Since then, he is very afraid of drones. They came out of those positions also with problems. Rodion helped his wounded brother, and they walked about five kilometers through a minefield. In the end, they got to theirs. As Rodion notes, his hatred of the occupiers and the desire for revenge gives him the strength to fight. He says that at the very beginning of the war, he saw a video with the atrocities committed by Russian inhumans in the captured cities and villages, and then he decided that he must go to the front to fight this evil. -I have a son growing up, and I want him to live in his own, free country, so that no one dares to tell him what language to speak and what to think. That is why I am here today and I will not leave here while the war continues. This is my choice and my position,- says Jupiter. As reported by ArmyInform, two Ukrainian soldiers - -Vishnya- and -Kolomiya- - spent 45 days surrounded, resisting the Russians invaders and eventually making a bold breakthrough to his fellow men. Their story is proof of the courage, resilience and indomitable spirit of Ukrainian soldiers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/17/dvadczyat-granat-po-kasczi-boyecz-yupiter-rozpoviv-pro-svij-najstrashnishyj-bij-ta-chomu-vin-voyuye/	2025-02-17T05:07:50-08:00
New opportunities for veterans: free driving lessons for people with disabilities	The Ministry of Veterans Affairs of Ukraine informs about this. On the initiative of the Ministry of Veterans Affairs, the Government made changes to the Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers No. 432, which open new horizons for veterans with disabilities. From now on, they can receive not only high-quality medical care and rehabilitation, but also the opportunity to return to an active life, in particular, thanks to driving lessons. Where can you get training? The project -Driving Schools for Persons with Disabilities-, initiated by First Lady Olena Zelenska, is already operating in six regions of Ukraine: In these regions, there are specialized driving schools of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, where veterans can receive training on specially equipped cars. In order to take advantage of the program, disabled war veterans and their family members must contact the Department of Veterans Affairs. Detailed information on the conditions of participation and necessary documents is available on the website of the Ministry. As reported by ArmyInform, the Ministry of Veterans Affairs and the Ministry of Health are launching an experimental project that expands the list of free medical services for combatants.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/17/novi-mozhlyvosti-dlya-veteraniv-bezoplatne-navchannya-vodinnyu-dlya-osib-z-invalidnistyu/	2025-02-17T04:52:11-08:00
The government adopted changes to the procedure for keeping military records	The main innovations were explained by Oleksandr Zavitnevich, chairman of the Committee of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine on National Security, Defense and Intelligence. -Persons with disabilities, for whom there is already relevant information, are not referred to the Military Medical Commission (MMC),- he explained. According to , persons who have serious illnesses (cerebral palsy, oncology, mental disorders, type I diabetes, the need for organ transplantation, etc.), but do not have an established disability, can submit relevant medical documents to the TCC and SP. -The conclusion on their suitability for military service is made on the basis of submitted documents and data from state registers without the presence of a person,- the statement said. In addition, data of men aged 16 (those who turn 17 in the year of registration) to 25 years old, including those who are abroad, are entered into the Unified Register of Conscripts. All information is transferred between registers in electronic form. -The State Migration Service submits to the Ministry of Defense information about men who applied for a passport abroad by April 24, 2024, but never received it. On the basis of these data, they will be included in the military register without passing a medical examination,- said Oleksandr Zavitnevich. As reported by ArmyInform, data on disability will be received through interaction with the Unified Information System of the Social Sphere. Thanks to this, information about the establishment or change of the disability group will be displayed in the Reserve+ application automatically or at the request of a person, without the need to undergo a medical examination and a military medical commission (MMC).	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/17/uryad-uhvalyv-zminy-do-poryadku-vedennya-vijskovogo-obliku/	2025-02-17T04:36:17-08:00
The Ministry of Defense received the green light to launch military escort services	This is reported by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. According to the regulation, escort services will operate within the framework of the Ministry of Defense, the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the State Special Transport Service. In the Armed Forces, the functions of these services will be performed by units of civil-military cooperation. They will provide servicemen and their families with advice and assistance on legal, social, and medical issues. The launch of escort services involves the creation of a support system that will provide servicemen and their families with comprehensive assistance, from legal advice to the organization of medical rehabilitation. -Our defenders need to know that they and their families will not be left alone at a difficult time. We are creating a support system that will help in any situation - they will help you make a statement, resolve issues with receiving payments, advise you on the possibilities of rehabilitation after injury, provide legal advice and psychological help,- said the Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine, Brigadier General of Justice Serhiy Melnyk. In preparation for the launch of escort services, the first groups of specialists were trained.

He did not come to the TCC and refused to be drafted: the evader was convicted in Kharkiv	The Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office informed about this on February 17. Prosecutors proved that in November 2023, the man received a summons to come to the Kyiv District Territorial Center for Recruitment and Social Support of the city of Kharkiv. Later, he passed the military medical commission, which found him fit for service, and received a summons to be sent to a military unit. It is noted that during mobilization, citizens are required to report to military units or assembly points of the TCC and SP within the time limits specified in the received documents. -However, the man from Kharkiv did not come to the Kyiv district TCC and SP and later submitted a written statement refusing to be called up for military service in connection with mobilization.

-Prickly- skill: the gunner-scientist turned the occupiers' tank into scrap metal	The story of the fighter was made public on the page of the Land Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The fighters of the artillery brigade received the coordinates of the enemy tank and began preparing for a fire attack. -Prickly-, the gun commander, cold-bloodedly set about the task. -Everything happened very quickly. We worked at night and were ordered to destroy the target. Two shells were fired, and the enemy tank turned into a burning pile of metal. The ammunition detonated, which increased the effect even more. - says the fighter. Before the start of the full-scale invasion, -Prickly- worked as a researcher at the University of Bioresources and Nature Management. He was fond of fishing and devoted his time to research in the natural sciences. But the war made its adjustments, and now he is one of those who bring Ukraine's victory closer to the front line. As reported by ArmyInform, two Ukrainian soldiers - -Vyshnya- and -Kolomiya- - spent 45 days in the environment, resisting the Russian invaders and eventually making a bold breakthrough to his fellows. Their story is proof of the courage, resilience and indomitable spirit of Ukrainian soldiers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/17/majsternist-kolyuchogo-artyleryst-naukovecz-peretvoryv-tank-okupantiv-na-metalobruht/	2025-02-17T03:56:21-08:00
Impunity breeds indignation: why residents of TOT of Luhansk region do not believe in the personnel ...	reported this by the head of Luhansk OVA They are expected to have -fresh ideas- and -willingness to take responsibility for the future of the population.- However, local residents are not at all delighted with such an initiative, because they see with their own eyes the level of impunity with which the Russian military commits numerous crimes in the occupied territory. According to Artem Lysohor, the head of the Luhansk OVA, this program caused outrage among the local population. People are rightly indignant that -heroes- and -managers- become those who break the law, commit arbitrariness and do not bear any responsibility for their actions. In addition, despite loud statements about the involvement of local personnel, attractive positions in the occupation authorities continue to be occupied by middle-ranking Russian officials. This indicates that the personnel program -Heroes of Luhansk Region- is just another propaganda campaign aimed at creating the illusion of support for the occupation authorities among the local population. The real situation in the temporarily occupied territories of Luhansk region is far from ideal. The Russian military feels impunity and commits numerous crimes against the civilian population. Local residents are oppressed, harassed and discriminated against. As reported by ArmyInform, a financial crisis is raging in the temporarily occupied territories of Luhansk region, which is hitting ordinary people the hardest. As Artem Lysohor, the head of the Luhansk OVA, reported, the debts to state officials of the -lnr- reach a colossal amount of 1.2 billion rubles.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/17/bezkarnist-porodzhuye-oburennya-chomu-zhyteli-tot-luganshhyny-ne-viryat-kadrovij-programi-lnr/	2025-02-17T03:43:37-08:00
-VIP-passage- for 9,000 euros: the organizer of illegal border crossing was detained in Lviv Oblast	informs DPSU about this. According to the State Border Service of Ukraine, the attacker developed a simple scheme: after receiving an advance of 6,000 euros, he was supposed to take the client through one of the checkpoints, and receive the rest of the amount after a successful -transfer-. However, these plans were not destined to come true. Dilka was detained while trying to cross the border illegally. He has already been informed of the suspicion of committing a crime. Now the criminal faces a new route – not across the border, but to court. For what he committed, he faces punishment in accordance with the current legislation of Ukraine.

According to Volodymyr Zelenskyi, the mediation efforts of the UAE have already saved many lives, and both countries have agreed to continue this cooperation.

The First Lady of Ukraine Olena Zelenska also played an active role in the visit. The main areas of her work were humanitarian issues: rehabilitation of injured Ukrainians, support of large adoptive families, and assistance to citizens who found themselves in difficult living conditions. Volodymyr Zelenskyy emphasized that such cooperation not only saves lives, but also makes both states stronger.

Give him a target and he will destroy the enemy: why the master sergeant of the UAV platoon feels th...	The story of the fighter was published on page 32 of a separate mechanized brigade. -I was always attracted to the army - its physical exertion, tests, risks, adventures. Apparently, I am a victim of exciting adventure films of Western cinema,- says Valentin. And this -adventurism- bore fruit. According to the official statistics of the Army of drones, the drones of all battalions of the 32nd OMBr were ranked 15th among the 304 UAV units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in terms of the effectiveness of impressing the enemy's equipment and manpower. And in this there is a great merit of Valentyn, who works conscientiously in combat positions and with personnel. For his contribution to the defense of the Motherland, Valentin was awarded the Order of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine - -Golden Cross-. However, the fighter himself does not flaunt his achievements. -I sent home my Award of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the Golden Cross,- says the soldier. — There my wife decides what to do with my awards. I love what I do in the army, but I do not fully perceive myself as a soldier. I adore our -two-, but I don't flaunt it. For me, this award is about gratitude, respect and understanding that I am in a place where I am needed and useful.- Together with his unit of attack UAVs, Valentin fought in the Kupyan direction, defended Sumy, Toretsk, Zaporizhzhya direction, and now Pokrovsk. -To this day, the personal bravery of my brothers remains a role model for me,- he adds. -There is something that in a difficult moment, when it seems that everything is lost, a flame of hope is lit, which turns into a full-fledged fire of retribution.- Valentine considers as an example those who perform assigned tasks better than him, who do what seemed incredible, who are not afraid to take risks to reach their goal, no matter what; people who can reboot their lives, step out of their comfort zone to achieve their dreams. -The longer I am in the army, the more motivated I become,- says Valentin. — I don't know what has changed, but now I feel great satisfaction from the effectively performed work. Don't feed me, but give me a target for destruction. My team knows and feels my despair when things go wrong, when things don't work. They also begin to feel that responsibility and excitement in hunting the enemy. We become one family at this time. When we come back from the position, we can truthfully say to ourselves that we are the best.- As reported by ArmyInform, the Main Directorate for Support of the Life Cycle of Weapons and Military Equipment of the Ministry of Defense (GU ZSZHC OVT) prepared for developers and manufacturers a standard package of documents necessary for codification of a wide range of OVT samples.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/17/dajte-jomu-czil-i-vin-znyshhyt-voroga-chomu-golovnyj-serzhant-vzvodu-bpla-vidchuvaye-azart-na-vijni/	2025-02-17T02:47:00-08:00

Major Viktor Tregubov, the spokesman of the Khortytsia operational-strategic group of troops, told about this on the broadcast of the -Yedini Novyni- telethon. According to him, we are talking, among other things, about the recent liberation of the village of Pischanoy by the Defense Forces. And although such small settlements change hands from time to time, the enemy now has a lot of problems. Thus, enemy soldiers actively complain about the dominance of Ukrainian FPV drones in the air and the mistakes of their own commanders. -Their attempts have been consistently unsuccessful, and there is nothing to indicate that they can reverse this trend. This is primarily due to the more efficient operation of Ukrainian drones. Evidence that the Ukrainian troops have become more effective,- said Major Viktor Tregubov, spokesman for the Khortytsia operational-strategic group of troops. As ArmyInform reported, in the Kursk region, the Defense Forces defeated a column of a brigade of Russian marines. The column included a dozen tanks and about a company of soldiers who went into battle under the flags of the USSR.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/17/skarzhatsya-na-dominacziyu-v-povitri-poblyzu-pokrovska-rosiyany-ne-mozhut-perelamaty-syly-oborony/	2025-02-17T02:34:07-08:00

A traitor in uniform: a former policeman who helped the occupiers in Kupyansk will be tried in Khark...	The Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office informs about this. The investigation established that the traitor voluntarily began working for the enemy in July 2022, taking the position of -acting senior operational officer of the criminal investigation department.- Later, he was promoted to -senior operative of the criminal investigation department of the Police Department No. 1 (dislocation of Kupyansk).- While in the service of the occupiers, the traitor helped them create a punitive body, conducted -investigative actions- and took explanations from local residents. In addition, he identified pro-Ukrainian citizens and passed on information about them to the occupation leadership. After the liberation of the Kharkiv region of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, the traitor fled to Russia and was declared wanted. He will be tried in absentia at the Chervonozavod District Court of Kharkiv. The maximum penalty he faces is life imprisonment for treason and collaboration. This case is another evidence of how the Russian occupation encourages some people to betray and collaborate with the enemy. However, sooner or later, all traitors will be punished for their crimes. As reported by ArmyInform, the Kharkiv regional prosecutor office approved and sent to the court an indictment against a 32-year-old man, a citizen of Azerbaijan, who has a permit for permanent residence in Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/17/zradnyk-u-pogonah-na-harkivshhyni-sudytymut-kolyshnogo-policzejskogo-yakyj-dopomagav-okupantam-u-kupyansku/	2025-02-17T02:12:35-08:00
45 days surrounded: The story of the heroic breakthrough of the fighters of Vyshny and Kolomyia	The story of the fighters was made public on page 141 of a separate mechanized brigade. Fighters entered the position on March 22. Later, their unit was completely surrounded, and the enemy was gradually capturing positions around it. -For two weeks, positions were taken piece by piece. If a shot was heard, it meant that an assault was underway there. If a person did not answer, then he is no longer there. - says -Vishnya-. To survive, the boys set up a shelter where they hid from enemy drones and shelling. Food and water were dropped to them with the help of drones. However, their shelter remained in the zone of active hostilities. When the enemy occupied their previous position, setting up a mortar there, the situation became even more critical. Water and food were running out, and the risk of being discovered was increasing every day. -We were not noticed in that first position, but they captured it. They put a mortar there and started working from it. After four days, food and water ran out. - recalls -Kolomia-. The fighters were forced to move to a new hiding place, where they stayed for another three weeks. All this time, they avoided fighting, realizing that any open battle would mean the end. The command developed an exit plan for them, which was transmitted via a drone. Along with the instructions, camouflage robes were thrown over the soldiers to avoid detection by thermal imaging cameras. -We were waiting for the exit code. No backpacks, just armor, helmet and weapons. When they heard the command, they rushed forward- - says -Vishnya-. Breaking through the enemy positions, Vyshnya diverted fire on itself, while Kolomiya looked for an opportunity to hide. After a long movement in difficult conditions, relying only on their own strength, the fighters finally reached the Ukrainian positions. -I went out for five days. Walked all night. In the morning I reached the landing, heard voices. I crawled closer and heard the Ukrainian language - I realized that it was my own.- - recalls -Kolomia-. As reported by ArmyInform, his story is deeply touching. -Cossack- is a combat medic of the 126th separate brigade of TrO, who spent three days in real hell on one of the Dnieper islands. Under continuous shelling, among the wounded and dead, he fulfilled his mission - saving lives. For this feat, the serviceman received an order -For courage-, but his main reward remains his saved brothers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/17/45-dib-v-otochenni-istoriya-geroyichnogo-proryvu-bijcziv-vyshni-ta-kolomyyi/	2025-02-17T01:57:56-08:00
-Residents- did not want to fight: in Voronezh, electronic warfare complexes burned down even before...	This is reported by the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. According to the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, a fire broke out at night from January 27 to 28, 2025, on the territory of the Protek plant, where, in fact, these EW complexes are produced. The two -Residents- who were there burned to the ground. The R-330Zh -Zhitel- is a modern Russian electronic warfare complex designed to suppress enemy communications, including mobile and satellite communications. It is able to create serious obstacles for the enemy's radio-electronic means, which makes it an important component of the Russian military arsenal. The destruction of two such complexes is not just a loss of equipment. This is, first of all, a disruption of the plans of the Russian command to strengthen its grouping at the front. After all, these -Residents- were supposed to go to war against Ukraine, where they could cause significant damage to our military. However, as we can see, the firefighters, or perhaps not quite the firefighters, made adjustments to these plans. Ironically, the EW complexes, designed to jam the communication, themselves -shut down- in the fire. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine destroyed the Russian installation of the Orlan reconnaissance drone.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/17/zhyteli-ne-zahotily-voyuvaty-u-voronezhi-kompleksy-reb-zgorily-shhe-do-vidpravlennya-na-front/	2025-02-17T01:37:32-08:00
- Another sur from the Russians - in Kurshchyna opponents are burning in tanks under red flags	This information was confirmed on the broadcast of the Yedyni Novyni telethon, Sherkhan, deputy commander of the 47th separate mechanized brigade battalion. According to him, the enemy is very actively trying to storm. It is obvious that it is important for him to win back his territory. That's why the red flags are for motivation. -Another sur from the Russian army, which they like to do. There have already been cases when they stopped at red flags. It was as if they were going to some kind of victory parade, all under big red flags,- said the deputy commander of the battalion of the 47th separate mechanized brigade. If you take a chronology, Sherkhan noted, the last few months have seen assaults every day. Often these are attacks with equipment, which the Defense Forces destroy with their UAVs. In addition, the Koreans who had a period of regrouping returned to the battlefield. -They try different tactics. They are trying to drive in on equipment - they cannot pass due to the fact that we successfully change their approach routes and work with FPV and resets on them. They are trying with infantry — they also have heavy losses,- stated the deputy commander of the 47th OMBr battalion. As ArmyInform reported, the enemy's tactics in the Kharkiv direction are unchanged. From time to time, the Russians attack in small assault groups of 2-3 people. Most of them are destroyed by Ukrainian drones, because the clear sky allows you to see the advance of enemy groups in advance.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/17/chergovyj-syur-vid-rosiyan-na-kurshhyni-protyvnyky-goryat-u-tankah-pid-chervonymy-praporamy/	2025-02-17T01:28:11-08:00

The situation is so critical that even the Russian -authorities- recognize the problem. However, it seems that the case does not go beyond the establishment of facts. In those cases where there is documentary proof of the debt, some repayment mechanisms are still being considered. But if the money is -stuck- between some links of the bureaucratic machine, then -even if the grass doesn't grow- here. The occupiers simply refuse to look for ways to solve the problem. This problem has been going on since 2014, when the Russian occupation of part of the Luhansk region began. Since then, thousands of people working in the budget sector have been left without their honestly earned funds. As reported by ArmyInform, the invaders continue to take the property of Ukrainians in the temporarily occupied territories of Luhansk region. In Severodonetsk, the occupation administration has already -recognized- 504 apartments as ownerless in high-rise buildings, whose owners did not have time to declare their rights within 30 days after fixing their absence.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/17/dirky-v-kyshenyah-byudzhetnykiv-lnr-borgy-syagayut-milyardiv-a-vlada-rozvodyt-rukamy/	2025-02-17T01:16:36-08:00

The group moved on foot for ten hours under the constant threat of enemy FPV drones. No water for the last few hours. Burning ruins and broken equipment all around showed fierce battles. Movement had to be made from bush to bush, avoiding open areas where one could become an easy target. -This is intelligence, the bullet does not choose here - you are a lieutenant colonel, a major or a general. There is a task, it must be completed and returned,- says -Rocky-. Moving forward, the group realized that they had been counted out - most likely due to interception of radio communications. At that moment, scouts noticed an approaching enemy vehicle. The decision was made instantly: to hide in the bushes and wait. But the enemy changed tactics and started chasing the group's car. -I jump out in front of our driver and shout: -Pasha, pedal to the floor, go ahead!-. He understood everything without words. And immediately - an explosion. Scouts called Pasha on the radio for a few minutes. The answer came - he broke free and is moving towards the shelter. The decision was made immediately: to leave the position and join the brother. The operation was a success, with all members of the group returning alive. -There are no ranks in war, only missions and a chance to come back,- Rocky concludes. As reported by ArmiyaInform, before the full-scale invasion, Viktor Ponomaryev worked as a civilian journalist, but after the deoccupation of Kyiv Oblast in 2022, he realized that he wanted to do more.

Terrorist attack near the TCC in Kamianets-Podilskyi: Russian agents who blew up a courier with expl...	informs the SBU about this. According to the press service of the SBU, the perpetrators used a courier from the delivery service to -darkly- deliver the explosives to the TCC building. The perpetrators of the crime turned out to be a local drug addict and a 17-year-old student of the city college, who were recruited through the Telegram channel in search of -easy- earnings. Both agents operated separately, but shared a Russian curator. Under his instructions, the juvenile agent made an improvised explosive device, stuffing it with nuts and scraps of rebar for maximum damage. He used a mobile phone for remote detonation. The student planted explosives in a hiding place and gave its geolocation to his supervisor from the FSB. The Russian intelligence officer gave the coordinates to another drug-addicted agent, who took the explosives. The latter, fearing for his safety, ordered delivery to the TCC building through a courier service. When the courier arrived at the site, the occupants detonated the explosives remotely. During the searches, mobile phones with evidence of contacts with the Russian special services, as well as tools and components for making an explosive device, were seized from the detainees. Both detainees were informed of suspicion for h. 3 Art. 258 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (a terrorist act that led to the death of a person). They face life imprisonment with confiscation of property.

In addition to problems with hygiene, the woman also complained about constant conscription among the personnel of the Russian army. She is outraged by the fact that the occupiers are forced to buy all the necessary equipment for the war against Ukraine at their own expense: -Belyy also made an attempt somehow!

There were no significant changes in other areas of the front.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/17/na-fronti-117-bojovyh-zitknen-za-dobu-najbilshe-vorog-atakuvav-na-dvoh-napryamkah/	2025-02-16T21:06:47-08:00
NSATU and JATEC: how the new NATO structures working to help Ukraine work	Initiatives adopted last year turned out to be surprisingly relevant and timely now, when the new administration of the US president can stop aid at any moment, and then European allies will independently support Ukraine. In 2024, European members of NATO and Canada gave Ukraine about 60% of the total amount of military aid. And now there are two special structures that are supposed to ensure proper logistics of weapons and the study of the Ukrainian experience of the war against the Russian Federation. How exactly these structures work and what their tasks are - see below in the ArmyInform material. Today, February 17, in the Polish city of Bydgoszcz, a solemn event will take place - the official opening ceremony of the Joint Ukraine - NATO-Ukraine Joint Center for Analysis, Training and Education (NATO-Ukraine Joint Analysis, Training and Education Center, JATEC). This is the first joint structure of NATO and Ukraine. The decision to establish the center was made a year ago. In fact, it has been functioning for some time and today's opening will have a more symbolic nature. The director of NATO's defense and security cooperation department, Piers Cazalet, in an interview with ArmiyaInform last year, said that the new center will be a location where NATO and Ukraine will be able to meet and discuss the lessons of the war together. -We will conduct an analysis, develop training programs based on this analysis and train ourselves, NATO, and Ukrainian troops to be better prepared for any conflicts in the future,- he explained. In January 2025, it became known that NATO and Ukraine have already formed a plan for the work of the center, and its tasks will include the integration of Ukraine's experience into the military preparation, training and conduct of hostilities. -We seek to record all the lessons and all the experience of what you are doing now in Ukraine, fighting against the Russians, as well as how we, as a collective Alliance, can learn from you and apply these lessons,- — NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said last week at a meeting with the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Rustem Umyerov in Brussels. NATO Supreme Commander for Transformation, Admiral Pierre Vandier, previously explained that one of the main areas of research is the combination of modern technology during the war in Ukraine with brutal trench warfare and artillery fire. -Ukrainian soldiers are fighting in the trenches and using artillery as it was customary more than a century ago, but they are also using drones, artificial intelligence and space communication As a result, Ukrainian artillery has become more effective and more lethal,- he said. NATO is confident that studying Ukrainian experience will allow it to respond quickly to modern threats and remain a strategically reliable organization. Ukraine has already formed a list of 70 projects for joint work and suggested to partners which of them should become priorities. The second important structure that was created to help Ukraine has more practical dimension. NATO Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine (NATO Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine, NSATU) During its formation, the American Security Assistance Group in Ukraine (SAG-U) was used as a basis and the new structure became a kind of logistical Ramstein. The meetings of the Contact Group on the Defense of Ukraine have a political dimension, and NSATU is already helping to implement them practically. The command staff is about 700 people, the structure is headed by the American Lieutenant General Curtis Buzzard, who is accountable to the Supreme Commander of the Combined Armed Forces of NATO in Europe (SACEUR). The Ukrainian team at NSATU was recently led by Brigadier General Gennady Shapovalov, who until recently commanded the OK troops -South-. The command in Wiesbaden works in two main directions. The first is the coordination of the training of Ukrainian servicemen and the transfer of military equipment and equipment to Ukraine. The actual process of training and provision of everything necessary is organized by individual countries, but it is NSATU that coordinates all this, gathering information about the needs of Ukraine and the capabilities of allies. As for the transfer of weapons and equipment, before the creation of NSATU, this assistance was provided on a special bilateral basis, and last year it was decided to combine it into a single system to make more predictable and coordinated in the long term. -This is done in order for Ukraine's combat capability to be effective and well-planned. NSATU also combines into a single coordination structure a significant part of the international security assistance provided to Ukraine by donors,- explained a high-ranking NATO official last week in Brussels. In addition to its headquarters in Germany, NSATU has logistics centers in the eastern part of the Alliance. In addition, the structure has two operational partners — New Zealand and Australia. NATO has also taken over the mission of protecting these logistics centers on the eastern flank from the United States. Therefore, they are now also under the command and control of the Alliance. The second direction of NSATU's work is to help in the development of the Armed Forces of Ukraine for the future, in particular, in achieving interoperability with NATO forces. -We not only support Ukraine when it comes to short-term supplies, but also help it in long-term planning. We have the so-called interoperability roadmap, which was agreed at the summit in Washington last year, and which helps Ukraine build a future for Ukraine. We advise on what is needed in terms of capabilities, what is needed in terms of personnel, what is needed in terms of funding,- said a NATO official in Brussels. At the same time, NATO emphasizes one important detail: NSATU's activities do not make them a party to the conflict and the Alliance will not deploy military forces in Ukraine. Likewise, he will not conduct training or deliver aid to the territory of Ukraine. That is, all the aid comes to a certain point in one of the NATO countries in the east, and from there Ukraine takes this aid to its territory on its own, and this is already its responsibility. NATO assures that NSATU has a very clear understanding of Ukraine's needs in the near future, and these requirements are immediately transferred to donors so that they can meet them as quickly as possible. -We are putting Ukraine in the best possible position situation so that it will be strong in the future, and our ability to support Ukraine will determine the trajectory of security for decades to come,- another NATO official emphasized in a conversation in Brussels. By creating these structures, NATO guarantees Ukraine constant and predictable support despite all political turmoil.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/17/nsatu-ta-jatec-yak-praczyuyut-novi-struktury-nato-shho-dopomagayut-ukrayini/	2025-02-16T20:50:49-08:00
Self-propelled guns -Bohdana-: about the destruction of the enemy tens of kilometers away, counter-b...	In February 2022, he became a volunteer for the defense of Ukraine. Ruslan was awarded the Order of Courage III degree, the Golden Cross and Steel Cross badges from the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces. His calculation has been fighting on the -Bogdan- for more than a year and is considered one of the strongest calculations in the brigade in terms of the accuracy of hitting racist targets. How many Russian artillery systems did the -Bohdana- destroy in counter-battery duels and other targets of the occupiers, what are its combat capabilities and advantages over Soviet artillery installations, about battles with the enemy in different areas of the front of the Russian-Ukrainian war and what life hacks are used by gunners in order to qualitatively equip a firing position - in the ArmyInform material. It has a NATO caliber of 155 mm. The main advantage of the self-propelled guns is the filigree accuracy of damage and the range of effective fire. The combat installation has already managed to prove itself excellently on the battlefield. According to the characteristics, the declared fire range is up to 42 km with a high-explosive fragmentation projectile, and it can reach the enemy up to 60 km with an active-reactive projectile. But here, in Donetsk region, gunners strike at the enemy up to 30 km. For example, on the self-propelled howitzer -Akatsiya- the firing range of a high-explosive shell is up to 18 km, and an active-reactive one is up to 24 km. Agree, this is a significant difference. The Soviet machine is less fast and does not accurately hit the targets. The guys say that there are almost no problems with the undercarriage of the -Bogdana-, the machine is quite passable in hard-to-reach areas of the terrain, overcomes swampy roads, but is afraid of sand. After all, its weight is 32 tons, so it can get stuck there. What is interesting, the engine -Bohdany- works much quieter than the Soviet self-propelled guns. And in general, in many parameters, it is much better than the Soviet models. -The self-propelled guns have a computer guidance system. This greatly simplifies combat work and saves time. There is no need to turn any gears or anything like that, &#8211; says the commander of -Bogdana- Ruslan. &#8211; There is an automatic platform where special buttons for modes, sectors, barrel operation and so on are placed. With the help of this system, the car steers itself. Of course, the gunner adjusts the details and -corrects- aiming at the target. The installation is equipped with a special charging system. We have an automatic projectile launcher, but we don't use it in real combat. Much faster if we do it manually. The service room charges the projectile and sends it using a special manual mechanism. During a combat mission, every minute counts. The vehicle is well armored and has a significant degree of protection. For example, the cabin can withstand impacts from FPV drones, Lancets and fragmentation shells of various calibers. We were recently attacked by a group of enemy -fpvishok- and -Lancet-. The windshield was cut by splinters, the cabin survived, the boys are alive and well. Also, the car's armor can withstand blows from 152 mm shell shells. What is interesting, the armored car cabin is also adapted for driving in the dark without the use of headlights in light-masking mode. Inside there are monitors for monitoring from the front and rear infrared cameras. In the wheels of the car, rubber is installed, which works according to the principle of a pillow. If the wheel is pierced by shrapnel, the car will still be able to move and leave the firing position. But it works when the rear wheels are affected. -Bohdana- leaves for a safe place without any problems, the speed is, of course, slightly lower. We inflict fire damage on various enemy targets. Coordinates of targets and correction of fire is carried out through air reconnaissance units. We mainly hit the front edge of the Russian troops: infantry, heavy military equipment, mortar positions, shelters and fortifications of the Rashists &#8211; it is stable. We can strike deep into the battle formations of the enemy troops. We fire up to 100 shots per day, sometimes 120 shots. If we attack the enemy with high-explosive and cluster projectiles, the debris can fly at a high speed for 200-300 meters. You yourself understand what a destructive force this is. 155 mm artillery ammunition is a much more powerful and serious striking force than a drone. With such strikes, we immediately stop the advance of enemy assault groups advancing on our infantry positions. The most difficult thing is to destroy small assault units that move simultaneously and from several directions. As was the case near Toretsk, there was not enough of our artillery in the square where we stood. Plus enemy tanks and artillery. It was very difficult, in fact, the work on extermination of roaches did not stop. The speed of calculation work on this installation is also a significant advantage. We can fire three or four shots at the enemy in one minute. We recently hit a large Russian mechanized column that was trying to break through to our positions on the front edge. It was in the Lymansky direction, in the area of ​​Terna settlement. The column consisted of five tanks and six infantry fighting vehicles along with infantry. the Rashists attacked us. Before that, our positions were attacked with artillery and tanks. Then other self-propelled guns and artillery systems of the brigade worked together with our calculation. With the first accurate strikes, we stopped the movement of the column and continued to inflict fire damage. Everything burned then, the equipment, the occupants almost all burned alive, those who somehow managed to get out of the BPM did not live long. as usual, the Russians do not withdraw their troops from the battlefield, some detonated grenades and killed themselves. Once in the Serebrian Forest, our aerial reconnaissance found a concentration of enemy equipment. 15 km away in the forest stood tanks, BMP, armored personnel carriers and MTLB. They were immediately covered with shells. Our calculation shows simply impressive indicators of effectiveness in destroying the enemy's artillery. As part of the counter-battery fight, we use active-reactive projectiles. How it works: special vehicles detect enemy artillery, aerial reconnaissance confirms that our artillery continues to work. In just one year of combat work, the artillery unit of the 45th brigade, armed with the -Bohdana- self-propelled guns, destroyed more than 200 units of various enemy artillery systems. These are towed and self-propelled artillery, mortars, Grad anti-aircraft guns. This is the enemy's artillery that has been officially confirmed by our UAVs, there is still a certain amount that could not be recorded. We are setting up the position for firing very carefully. We tear out the caponira. We strengthen everything well, mask it so that no one burns the location of the installation from the air. This is a well-protected fortress, we will not tell all the secrets in detail. But I will say that the occupiers have never found us. The dugout for personnel is nearby, also camouflaged. The enemy is raging furiously, we heard more than once in radio intercepts that they cannot detect the work of our -Bogdana-. How many times have there been cases when enemy UAVs flew over us and could not detect us. I have a very good team. In the calculation of 5 people. Guys from Ternopil region, one from Lutsk. My gunner is 25 years old, I am 26, the driver is 45, the service numbers are 46 and 48, respectively. The boys are very active, patriotic and motivated. They are fighting for their families, homes and Ukraine. The team has been formed since the beginning of the large-scale invasion of the Russian Federation. For three years now, as part of the 45th separate artillery brigade, we have been destroying the occupiers in various areas of the front. We had no experience in artillery, we learned everything from wheels. None of us were born ready-made artillerymen. In 2022, we fought in Kryvorizha, knocked out the enemy from the right-bank Kherson region and liberated Kherson itself. Then the Lyman direction, the battles near Toretsk, the defense of Bakhmut, the Serebryansky forest area, again the Toretsk direction. Now we are piling on the occupiers in the Siver and Lyman directions. The boys have tremendous combat experience, we are always together as one family. We started fighting with a 152-mm howitzer gun D-20, then destroyed the enemy with a French 155-mm field howitzer TRF1. This howitzer had technical features. For example, it has an engine installed, it could drive into position, unfold itself, fold itself up and leave independently to the point where the tractor pulled it. Despite its longevity, this weapon showed itself quite effectively in battle. When the brigade was reinforced with self-propelled guns -Bohdan-, we were immediately offered to work on it. Our calculation was taught by those guys who in 2022 destroyed the Russian garrison with equipment on the island of Zmiiny in the Black Sea on the first model of the -Bohdana-. The fire was carried both on the water from pontoons and from the coast. The first crew of -Bogdana- taught us, told us how to properly operate and maintain the machine. We lived with them 20 km from the front line, went out together on combat missions, fired shots. Then, over time, they went out on their own and hit the occupiers. Now artillerymen from various units of the Armed Forces are coming to us. We teach them how to efficiently destroy the enemy. Here, in a combat environment, it is much more effective to undergo training, people learn much faster.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/17/sau-bogdana-pro-znyshhennya-voroga-za-desyatky-kilometriv-kontrbatarejni-dueli-ta-pozycziyu-forteczya/	2025-02-16T20:41:34-08:00
Russia does not control 70% of Ukrainian resources: the swamps are already crying about -inevitable ...	It seems that while the Russian army roams the fields of Donbass and receives a beating from the Armed Forces, their propagandists have decided to fight on another front - in the world of fantasy. According to the version of the Kremlin -analysts-, Russia seems to have seized the main Ukrainian deposits containing coal, oil, gas, ores and other resources. The main -evidence- is the traditional anonymous -experts-, cloudy maps and slogans in the style of -hooray, we beat them all-. They claim that after seizing part of the Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhya and Kherson regions, they now have in their hands critical deposits of everything that can only be mined. Yes, part of the deposits are indeed located in temporarily occupied territories. But there is a nuance - just capturing the territory is not enough to get resources from it. Mining requires complex infrastructure, machinery, energy supply and personnel. Coal mines of Donbas are not -black gold-, but black money for the budget of the Russian Federation. Without the support of Ukrainian energy systems, most mines are flooded and unusable. Mining there right now is more of a loss than a profit. Oil and gas fields? And tell us about the sanctions! Russian-controlled reserves in southern Ukraine do not compensate for its own deficit. Mining in the Black Sea is almost impossible due to the actions of the Armed Forces and limited access to technology due to sanctions. Metallurgy? The occupiers simply destroyed the factories: Mariupol Azovstal and MMK Ilyich - not -controlled resources-, but burned down after Russian bombings. Without these enterprises, most of the metallurgical industry in the occupied territories simply does not work. the Kremlin is trying to create the illusion of victory. They are losing on the battlefield, the economy is bursting at the seams, sanctions are stifling, but it is necessary to show the people that everything is not so bad. That is why they invent that -now we have 70% of Ukrainian wealth.- This lie is necessary for: The reality is this: Russia does not control 70% of Ukrainian resources. She controls a pile of ruins, flooded mines, destroyed factories and unusable territories. And if the Kremlin somewhere finds even a drop of profit on these lands, then all this -oil- or -gas- will be burned in the next cotton from Ukrainian FPV drones. Therefore, let them continue to dream about 70% of minerals there. Because the only thing that Russia really controls is its own impoverishment, default and the path to the abyss.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/17/rosiya-ne-kontrolyuye-70-ukrayinskyh-resursiv-na-bolotah-vzhe-volayut-pro-nemynuchyj-uspih/	2025-02-16T20:08:49-08:00
The financial forecasts of the Central Bank of Russia are exclusively political and have no relation...	reports this by the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. Against the background of the Russian-Ukrainian war and the maintenance of Western sanctions, the forecasts of the Russian regulator regarding the improvement of economic indicators for 2026 are primarily political in nature. The Central Bank of the Russian Federation raised the inflation forecast for 2025 from 4.5–5%, which was predicted in October 2024, to the level of 7–8%. According to the average key rate for 2025, the forecast worsened from 17-20% to 19-22%, and for 2026 - from 12-13% to 13-14%. The forecast for the rate for 2027 remains at the level of 7.5-8.5%. Prerequisites for lowering the discount rate may appear no earlier than in the second half of 2025 if inflation slows down. Under this scenario, by the end of 2026, the rate may drop to only 18-19%. The Central Bank of the Russian Federation recognizes high inflationary pressure, which makes it impossible to reduce the discount rate. Worsening forecasts for inflation and the average annual refinancing rate for 2025 testify to the deepening of economic imbalances in Russia. We remind you, the occupation authorities of Crimea will -nationalize- more than 720 objects.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/16/finansovi-prognozy-czentrobanku-rosiyi-vyklyuchno-politychni-i-ne-mayut-vidnoshennya-do-realnoyi-ekonomiky/	2025-02-16T10:56:23-08:00

Russians intensify propaganda on TOT	reports this by the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. At this time, the development of a television signal retransmission network is part of the strategy of consolidating the Russian regime on the lands newly occupied from 2022. The invaders are investing heavily in the total modernization of television and radio broadcasting facilities in the occupied Luhansk region. In January 2025, Luhansk was visited by a delegation of managers of the Russian state company -Российская телевизорная и радиовечательная сеть-. Their task was to establish broadcasting in the so-called -white zones- - populated areas that have recently been occupied and are not covered or poorly covered by Russian television. The Russians assigned more than 70 settlements to such zones. The main criteria when choosing the potential locations of new relay towers were the inaccessibility for barrel artillery, the signal coverage factor of the -white zones-, as well as the promising possibility of their use for broadcasting across the front line. At the same time, for the third year in a row, the occupiers have been conducting a preferential program for issuing equipment for receiving Russian satellite signals in -white zones-. -Dishes- and receivers, together with installation services, are provided free of charge at the expense of the Russian budget. The Luhansk branch of -Российской телевизорной и радиовечательной сети-, created on the basis of the captured regional branch of the Ukrainian Concern of Radio Broadcasting, Radio Communications and Television, now broadcasts four digital multiplexes and provides broadcasting of Russian state and private radio stations. The third multiplex contains the largest number of propaganda TV channels. Among them, we can mention -Luhansk 24-, -Pobeda-, -Solovyev Live-, -History-, -Mir 24-, etc. This activity is carried out in parallel with the eradication of at least the potential possibility of access of residents of Luhansk region to Ukrainian television. The general supervision of this entire -modernization project- is carried out by the first deputy of Putin's administration, Sergei Kiriyenko, and the direct executor is the head of the -Russian Television and Broadcasting Network- Andrei Romanchenko. We remind you that during 2024 the amount of gold on the balance sheet of the National Welfare Fund (NFB) decreased from 359 tons to 187.7 tons (minus 48% for the year).	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/16/rosiyany-posylyuyut-propagandu-na-tot/	2025-02-16T09:36:19-08:00
The occupiers are once again robbing the Ukrainian Crimea	reports this by the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. Among them are the premises of the dolphinarium -Nemo- in Sudak, Feodosia and Alushta, -Saksky mineral waters- and property of citizens of Ukraine. The Russian occupiers plan to sell the stolen goods and spend the money received on the soldiers fighting against Ukraine and their families. the Russian occupiers have been systematically carrying out -nationalization- in Crimea since 2014. Since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, the pace of plundering of the peninsula has accelerated. propagandists of the Russian Federation actively highlight the -nationalization of the property of the enemies of Crimea-, often using the rhetoric of the times of Stalinism. Such a policy is not only banal robbery, but also part of a campaign to intimidate people who, for disloyalty to the occupiers, risk losing their freedom and all their property. We remind you that in the annexed Crimea, the Russian administration continues to impose the cult of war on young people.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/16/okupanty-vchergove-obkradayut-ukrayinskyj-krym/	2025-02-16T09:11:10-08:00

In Russia, gold and currency reserves are falling rapidly	This is reports the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. The reason is the sale of gold by the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation to cover the deficit of the federal budget. In January 2025, 8.7 tons of gold were sold, as of February 1, 2025, the reserves were only 179 tons. A significant decrease in the volume of gold in the FNB indicates a lack of funds in the federal budget in the context of the Russian-Ukrainian war and Western sanctions. In the short term, the government of the Russian Federation will be forced to limit the sale of gold and consider other instruments for filling the budget, including fiscal ones. Ordinary Russians will once again pay for the continuation of the war against Ukraine. We remind you that International Institute for Strategic Studies in the annual report -The Military Balance 2025- notes an increase in world defense spending by 7.4% to $2.46 trillion in 2024.

The occupiers are killing Crimean youth	This is reported by the Center of National Resistance. Recently, the so-called -opening of the year of the defender of the fatherland- took place there - another propaganda event aimed at preparing young people for mobilization. The ceremony, which was supposed to create the impression of mass support, turned out to be another performance. Budget officers, students and teachers were forced to attend in order to fill the hall with simulated supporters of Russian aggression. In fact, the majority of Crimeans remain hostages of a repressive system that destroys any resistance. The biggest cynicism of this event was that the representatives of the -Storm- assault unit of the 810th Marine Brigade of the enemy army were speaking in front of the young people. This unit was staffed not only by conscripts, but also by ex-prisoners, including people convicted of serious crimes. The occupiers seek to make -heroes- out of these criminals, as well as to hide real losses among the ranks of the occupying army. In addition, in the territory of the occupied peninsula, educational institutions have actually been turned into centers of propaganda. Students are taught how to properly obey the occupation regime. The invaders are also trying to recruit new so-called -volunteers- through universities, using blackmail and threats. Thus, the occupiers are most afraid of losing Crimea, and that is why they are trying to suppress any resistance with mass propaganda. They know that the people of Crimea remember what freedom is - and it cannot be erased by any lies. We remind you that the occupiers are strangling people with taxes and sending them to war.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/16/okupanty-zombuyut-krymsku-molod/	2025-02-16T07:52:57-08:00
Defense spending in the world is increasing	This is reports the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. In 2024, global defense spending increased to an average of 1.9% of GDP, compared to 1.8% in 2023 and 1.6% in 2022. The largest increase was recorded in Russia, where defense spending increased by 41.9% and amounted to 145.9 billion dollars. USA. The share of Russian defense spending was 6.7% of GDP, and in 2025 this indicator may increase to 7.5%. In 2024, defense spending in Europe increased by 11.7% to 457 billion dollars. USA. The reasons are the growth of threats caused by the Russian-Ukrainian war, as well as the commitment of NATO member countries to achieve the level of defense spending of 2% of GDP. The largest increase in 2024 was demonstrated by Germany, which increased its defense budget by 23.2%. In Poland and the Baltic states, defense budgets exceeded 3% of GDP, other states, in particular Spain and Italy, continued to spend less than 2% of GDP on defense. China's defense budget grew by 7.4%, well above the average for the rest of the Indo-Pacific region (3.9%). However, due to greater growth in defense spending in other regions, Asia's share of global defense spending has declined to 21.7% in 2024. In 2021, this figure was 25.9%. Sub-Saharan Africa was the only region where defense spending declined, with a 3.7% drop. We remind you that considering the position of the Russian Federation regarding the accident of flight J2-8432 of the airline company -Azerbaijan Airlines-, the deterioration of relations between Baku and Moscow continues.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/16/oboronni-vytraty-u-sviti-zbilshuyutsya/	2025-02-16T07:36:05-08:00
Relations between Baku and Moscow are deteriorating	This is reported by the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. In particular, the leadership of Azerbaijan plans to limit the activities of the Russian editorial office of the Sputnik agency. The publication's staff will be reduced from 40 employees to one. This effectively means closing the branch. Official Baku pays attention to the principle of reciprocity: Sputnik will be able to keep as many employees in the country as there are working in Russia in the Azerbaijani state news agency -Azertaj-, i.e. one journalist. In addition, a member of the State Duma of the Russian Federation was declared persona non grata in Azerbaijan. value, he is included in the list of persons who are prohibited from entering the country. The reason is Valuev's statement after Baku's decision to stop the activities of the -Russian House- on the territory of the country. In particular, he stated that it is necessary to pay attention to the activities of the Azerbaijani diaspora in Russia, hinting at their financial activity. Previously, the first deputy chairman of the Russian State Duma Committee on CIS Affairs was declared persona non grata. Zatulin and deputy head of the committee for family protection in Milonov for their statements contradicting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Azerbaijan. In this context, the Kremlin is developing measures to increase pressure on Azerbaijan, namely: Blocking money transfers. The amount of money transfers from Russia to Azerbaijan for January-September 2024 amounted to more than 410 million dollars. USA. Stopping oil exports through the port of Novorossiysk. The share of Azerbaijani oil transported by this route is 4% of total exports. The main supply is carried out through the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline bypassing the territory of the Russian Federation and the Baku-Supsa pipeline, which passes through the territory of Azerbaijan and Georgia. Support for separatist movements in Azerbaijan. One of the most dangerous threats is the -Lezgin problem-. The Lezgins, who live in the north of Azerbaijan on the border with Dagestan, have historical prerequisites for unification with the Lezgins of Russia. In early February 2025, the State Security Service of Azerbaijan conducted a special operation in the Husar district (bordering the Republic of Dagestan, Russia). As a result of the operation, eight members of the group associated with the -Forest Brothers- terrorist group were eliminated and six were detained. Members of the group planned terrorist attacks on the territory of Husar district. As a result, Azerbaijan, with the support of Turkey, is increasingly showing an independent position in relations with Russia. For its part, the Kremlin has limited opportunities to put pressure on Baku. In the short term, tensions in Russian-Azerbaijani relations will grow, and Azerbaijan will continue to distance itself from the Russian Federation. We remind you that Russia continues its aggressive war against Ukraine, using daily shelling as a method of pressure and intimidation.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/16/vidnosyny-mizh-baku-ta-moskvoyu-pogirshuyutsya/	2025-02-16T07:12:00-08:00
There were 79 clashes at the front: the hottest in the Pokrovsk and Novopavlovsk directions	This is reported by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/16/na-fronti-79-boyezitknen-najgaryachishe-na-pokrovskomu-ta-novopavlivskomu-napryamkah/	2025-02-16T06:54:04-08:00
The invaders are introducing a new stage of repression on TOT	reports this by the Center of National Resistance. Therefore, among the servicemen of the Russian occupation forces, they will begin to be appointed en masse to the so-called -administrative positions- in the occupation administrations, etc. This means that from now on, incompetent security forces, among whom there is a small number of people with a criminal past and other -cream- of Russian society, will be in charge of managing settlements, dealing with -economic issues- and other activities. Along with this, the occupation sources officially present it as a -personnel competition- that should -celebrate the merits of the defenders-, but the reality is different. The occupiers cannot find civilian personnel among the locals who are ready to work in their occupation structures. In connection with this, they are trying to integrate the invaders from the DOM in order to raise their status and try to justify their crimes, which they committed against the local population and Ukraine as a whole. It is obvious that these appointments will lead to the strengthening of repressive measures, looting and new corruption schemes. And former mercenaries and previously convicted occupiers do not have management skills, however, they have experience of intimidation, torture and uncontrolled violence. Therefore, they will use their new -powers- in their own interests, including for their own enrichment. We remind you, occupiers continue the systematic destruction of Mariupol.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/16/zagarbnyky-zaprovadzhuyut-novyj-etap-represij-na-tot/	2025-02-16T06:31:59-08:00
Occupiers strangle people with taxes and send them to war	This is reports the Center of National Resistance. Almost two-thirds of the amount, or about 65%, are compulsory levies in favor of the occupation administration in the form of taxes, fees, etc. Therefore, intimidation and repression became the main working method of the invaders. Among the harshest methods of influence is the ban on driving vehicles, as well as the seizure of bank accounts and even the confiscation of wages. But the worst thing is that those who cannot or refuse to pay the occupiers are forcibly taken to war, forcing them to fight against their own people. The invaders are trying to strangle the local population economically, leaving the people without a means of livelihood and forcing them to either pay or become cannon fodder. But they will certainly bear responsibility for their crimes. We remind you, the occupiers continue the systematic destruction of Mariupol. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/16/okupanty-dushat-lyudej-podatkamy-i-vidpravlyayut-na-vijnu/	2025-02-16T06:13:43-08:00

The video shows how FPV drones skillfully hit enemy equipment and manpower. -Anyone who comes to our land with a weapon will receive his -ticket- home in a black bag,- the statement said. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the -Force of Freedom- battalion of the 4th operational brigade -Rubizh- of the National Guard of Ukraine two Russian soldiers were captured during a combat mission.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/16/ne-chorna-pantera-a-chornyj-mishok-slobozhanski-desantnyky-dopomogly-inozemnomu-najmanczyu-zavershyty-karyeru/	2025-02-16T05:54:32-08:00
Drones against infantry: Taurian paratroopers defeated the occupiers	The video of combat work was made public on the brigade's page. The result of this carelessness of the occupiers is obvious: none of them survived. Ukrainian pilots competed not only with the enemy, but also among themselves - for the title of the most effective liquidator of invaders. In the end, it was not possible to determine the winner, because every shot was perfectly accurate. The brilliant work of the soldiers of the 79th brigade once again demonstrates that modern war is not only about fighting on the ground, but also high technological skill in the air. Ukrainian defenders continue to destroy the enemy, leaving him no chance for survival. As reported by ArmyInform, the situation is stable in the Novopavlivskoye direction in the area of ​​Ulakla and Kostiantinopil villages tense. The occupiers try to maintain a high intensity of their attacks. They mostly go forward in small assault groups.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/16/drony-proty-pihoty-tavrijski-desantnyky-vlashtuvaly-rozgrom-okupantam/	2025-02-16T05:37:12-08:00
The occupiers continue the systematic destruction of Mariupol	This is reported by the Center of National Resistance. There are not so many such houses left, as the occupiers destroyed a large part of the city with their massive shelling. Therefore, in the central part of the city, representatives of the ROA decided to allow the construction of so-called -new- housing under mortgage for Russians from depressed regions of the Russian Federation and immigrants from Asia. This is a purposeful policy aimed at changing the ethnic composition of the population and creating the illusion of -returning life- to the destroyed city. At the same time, residents of Mariupol remain homeless, because they are not allocated compensatory apartments - all construction is aimed exclusively at the resettlement of Russians. Despite loud statements by the occupiers about -repairs-, construction works are frozen due to lack of adequate funding, and imported workers constantly complain about non-payment of salaries. Therefore, the occupants often make only cosmetic repairs to the facades, while the inside of the house remains unlivable. However, the picture for the Russian mass media is presented in the best traditions of the Russian propaganda machine. We remind you, on the Kursk direction, Russian troops resumed assaults with the involvement of armored vehicles, as well as units from the DPRK.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/16/okupanty-prodovzhuyut-systemne-znyshhennya-mariupolya/	2025-02-16T05:12:37-08:00

22-year-old gun commander -Iskra-: how a young gunner destroys enemy positions	The defender's story was made public on the brigade's page. During the war, artillery remains one of the most effective combat forces, causing the most losses to the enemy. In conditions of active use of radio electronic warfare, it is howitzers, mortars and cannons, devoid of complex electronics, that become a decisive factor on the battlefield. The soldiers of the 65th separate mechanized brigade of the Veliky Lug Armed Forces operate with such formidable force. At the head of one of the cannon calculations is 22-year-old Maria with the call sign -Iskra-. Despite her young age, she already has considerable combat experience and confidently leads her team. Its task is to quickly and accurately destroy targets that threaten Ukrainian positions. Recently, Maria's calculation completed an important combat mission - suppressing an enemy mortar that was firing at our infantry. Thanks to the coordinated work of the artillerymen, the enemy lost the opportunity to fire, which allowed the Ukrainian military to strengthen its defensive positions. -Sometimes there are misfires, but our calculation works as a single mechanism. We solve problems quickly, because everyone knows their role,- explains Maria. In her voice is the confidence of a person who not only knows what she is doing, but also believes in her business. Gunners continue to work on making each of their shots accurate and effective. Thanks to such commanders as Iskra, Ukrainian artillery remains a formidable weapon in the struggle for independence. As ArmiyaInform reported, Yuriy Kameny could write the history of Ukrainian art, but instead he creates history on the battlefield.

Yes, for some time I was under the influence of Russian propaganda and their narratives, for example, about the Holodomor, the collapse of the USSR, etc. All these thoughts then circulated in my environment and I had no alternative. But then I began to have certain questions, in particular, I began to watch and read more about the same Holodomor. We had a very cool teacher of the Ukrainian language at the university - a Holodomor researcher in the Luhansk region, she once made a film about the Holodomor. This is the first. Then I started asking my relatives, like my grandmother. And she told such things that did not fit into my head and resonated very strongly with what was happening around. I also became interested in the history of the same UPA and why they were demonized in the end. The fact that I was born and lived in Luhansk, and my relatives - in the region, in Ukrainian-speaking villages, probably also had an influence. And I spent a lot of time there. And it also begged the question: why so? Why is it that when you leave 10 kilometers from Luhansk, you hear the Ukrainian language, and when you arrive in Luhansk, only Russian? This is how it all took shape for me: at first, questions arose, and I tried to find answers to them. - How did everything start in Luhansk in 2014? - Russian aggression did not start in 2014. In 2008-2009, when I just entered journalism, certain moments were already felt. For example, they started to hold the -Georgiivska tape- campaign, some guests from Moscow were constantly coming, -Don Cossacks-&#8230; Then I had to search for answers to the question, what is St. George's ribbon? In the fall of 2013, Luhansk also joined the Revolution of Dignity and had its own Euromaidan. But there were also a lot of anti-Maidan activists - the so-called local -kids-, some -wives-&#8230; Also, in Luhansk, a lot was built on administrative resources - these are large enterprises controlled by the -party of regions-, for example. Their employees were constantly -pumped up- with anti-Ukrainian narratives. And involved in various actions and protests. I didn't understand the scale at the time. At first it was thought that the local authorities, the so-called -elites-, were trying to maintain control over the region. Although Russia had already taken control, it was not clear at the time. In the information field, for a long time Luhansk region lived precisely in the information field of Russia, not Ukraine. You turn on the TV and all the first channels are Russian. And, for example, in the summer of 2014, it seems, there was a decision to turn off the broadcasting of absolutely all Russian channels. And when the Russians took over the regional television and radio company where I worked, the first thing they did was turn on all the Russian channels and turn off the Ukrainian ones. Therefore, answering the question, what shaped me, including lies that I did not believe and tried to understand what was happening. - Do you remember the first time you saw the tricolor on the streets of your hometown? - When the first Anti-Maidan meetings were held, many people already came with Russian flags. And when the Russian flag was raised over the Regional State Administration, Russians who came either from Belgorod or Rostov regions took part in it. —You left your native Luhansk region twice: Luhansk and Seversko-Donetsk. What was the most difficult for you in these two cases? - We left Luhansk at the end of July 2014. On July 4, armed men came to the village and kicked us out of work. They surrounded the building, walked through the offices, told everyone to go to the corridor, and see you. Then we stayed in Luhansk for some time, tried to work, because we still had a website and we were filling it. And it was our site in July 2014 that was almost the only source of information, and we worked until the last: as long as there was an opportunity and as long as the security situation allowed. At that time, the city was already being shelled quite often from the inside, it was becoming quite dangerous, the fighting for the Luhansk airport was actively going on, and a lot of people were flying in. The last straw was the day when two explosions rang out and windows flew out on the balcony. Then he and his wife decided to leave the city. It was difficult with the railway, we went first to Berdyansk, then to relatives. Was it difficult? The first time is hard. You don't know what to take with you, they just started repairing the apartment&#8230; In the end, they took documents and some clothes with them. And at the beginning of 2015, the manager wrote to me that broadcasting is planned to be restored in Seversko-Donetsk. It was the time when the first Minsk agreements were signed and there was more or less a lull, there were no checkpoints yet, only roadblocks and we decided to go to Luhansk to pick up some things. When we were going to Severskodonetsk, we were basically going nowhere. Yes, we're told there are plans to resume broadcasting, but so far only on paper. There was not even a room. I was going to a city I had visited once in my life on a business trip. There is no housing. We just arrived. The first night we lived in a children's camp outside the city, the next day we were already looking for an apartment. To work, we were given a press center room in the regional administration, for a while we just came there with our laptops, sat down and worked on our knees. Everything was made completely from scratch. Later they got the premises. It was the building of the Institute of Chemical Industry, which had not been used for seven years. With one exception: during the occupation of Siverskodonetsk, the -ghost- gang was based there. Although the premises felt as if they had not been used for seven years, but for 27 years: old walls, no sewerage. - That is, it was easier to leave Luhansk Region for the second time, already in 2022? - There was an understanding of what to do, how to do, what to take, what not to take. Yes, there was no understanding where to go - but this is not the first time. We left in the early days. I, my family, and my company were preparing for the invasion. We gathered at the beginning of 2022 and explained the situation to the team. I clearly remember that at the meeting at the beginning of January, I told everyone: if the Russians really go with very large forces, then the speed with which they will reach Seversko-Donetsk may be so high that we may not have time to pack up and leave. Many colleagues said that they would not leave. I warned: if it gets hot, everyone will leave. In principle, that's almost what happened. On February 23, we issued work books to people. I remember how Ira Tsybukh called me at 5 a.m. on February 24. That day, February 24, she was to present her film in Seversko-Donetsk. And here is the call. It's still dark. Ira asked if I was going somewhere. I asked why I would be going somewhere at 5 in the morning. She replied that rockets were flying and the invasion had begun. Afterwards, we left with friends. It was a long way: Dnipro, Uman, some village near Khmelnytskyi&#8230; I had the most important thing in my hands: a backpack with documents in one, a carrier with Ted the cat in the other. - Tell us more about the incident at the checkpoint, when the FSB officers asked, -Where is Marchenko?- - Some of our colleagues left Luhansk region some time after the beginning of the large-scale invasion - already from the occupation. The route ran through the territory of the Russian Federation to European countries. One of my colleagues left anyway. Before starting the journey, he cleaned the phones. But FSB officers checked at the border: questioned, checked phones, including, apparently, they have a program that restores everything on the phone. And during this inspection they asked for me and for my colleague. Why such meticulous attention? Because, I can assume, we were, in essence, branch managers. - Tell me, when did you find yourself in the ranks of the Defense Forces? - I am conscripted. He graduated from the military department while studying in Luhansk. When they left Seversko-Donetsk for Lviv Oblast, they went to register. Passed the VLK, received a combat summons, but they said that there is no request for my aviation specialty. And so it continued throughout 2022: I went to the Military Commissariat as if it were work, and I had already gotten to know many people there. And the subpoena was simply rewritten for me. This continued until the beginning of 2023. I went through VLK and in a few days they told me to prepare things because there is demand. But for another SSC. As it turned out later - military intelligence. It surprised me a little: where am I, and where is the intelligence. But hey, let's go, let's go. Then there was training at the Military Academy in Odesa, actually on the seashore, resort&#8230; And then I led the platoon after that. Why did I do this - join the ranks of the Defense Forces? As my compatriot said in a recent interview: -Need - yes must-. Not even what is needed&#8230; This is my duty and my convictions, that is, I could have stayed in Luhansk, spit on everything and said: -Well, that's fine, the main thing is to survive, so I'll adapt to this and that's it.- But I have a conviction that I want to live in Ukraine - independent, free, which sometimes makes strange choices from time to time (laughs - ed.). But these elections should be made by Ukraine, and not by someone instead. —You went from civilian journalism to the intelligence unit. What, in your opinion, facilitated this adaptation? - During my studies at the Academy, I talked to a teacher, and he asked what I was doing in my life. I replied that I was in journalism and ended up in military intelligence, and expressed my astonishment at how such a thing could happen. What did the teacher answer me: -What do they work with in journalism?- With information. Scouts also work with information. Although there are nuances.- But I'm not the first and I'm not the last to find myself in such a situation. And nothing: they learn, move forward. The main thing is to have a desire, to want to learn something new, to strive to be efficient. Because if you are not effective, you will not be needed. I wanted to be as useful as possible: I went to all classes. We had very cool intelligence teachers. And also with us were sergeants from the DSHV brigades. They served as reconnaissance platoon commanders and attended courses to become officers. These are guys from the 25th, 95th, 81st, 79th brigades. With vast combat experience. They taught me a lot. So I can say that we are lucky. On the last day of my training, when we took the exam, I found out which unit I would be in - it was the 30th separate mechanized brigade. At that time, it stood in the direction of Bakhmut. I drove to my unit, which I was supposed to lead - he had already been there for a long time. They asked me who I was and where I was from, what my combat experience was. I honestly answered them that I had no combat experience and that I would focus on them. Because he is interested in the fact that we perform the task normally, without losses or with minimal losses. And for this I need their experience. This approach more or less worked: they really helped me, told me a lot, there were no refusals to complete tasks or any large-scale scandals. —On October 20, 2023, you were wounded in the Bakhmut direction. Tell me, please, under what circumstances? — It was an assault on our positions by the Russians. We knew and expected that he would. The night before, the pilots were conducting a reconnaissance of the front edge and saw that some group of Russians had arrived. We looked closely and saw that they were removing their mine barriers so that equipment could pass through. We were immediately reinforced - that is, we were, in principle, ready. On October 20, the Russians first tried to seize one position, then entered from the other side. We went to the aid of one of our companies - their positions were badly -hit- by the enemy. We entered those positions not on equipment, but in two groups on foot. No losses. I remember that we were walking, I looked where we were going - and there everything was exploding, burning, shooting range, tracers, constant arrivals. And I thought to myself, -My God, this is the last place on earth to go, but we're going there.- To say that I didn't want to is to say nothing. But we knew that there were many wounded, we were aware of the risk of this position being captured by the enemy, and we understood that we had to go to help. When they arrived, they saw that almost everyone in that position was wounded, some were seriously injured, with amputations of limbs, unfortunately, died. The Russians tried to level that position with the ground - everything went one after the other: mortar, artillery, AGS, and so on. Then -Grad-, then a tank. After a while, the position just turned into mush. It was saved by the fact that there was one dugout under the asphalt, and it was not damaged by enemy fire. Although it was very small and not everyone could fit there. Later, the night drone with resets began to work and it was he who brought us the most losses. Yes, our drones were also monitoring the situation, our civil service officers were covering us - by the way, they also saved our lives, because the Russians came very close to us at one point. At one point, the wounded were evacuated - our medical M113 rushed. She endured several hits, but was able to leave. Unfortunately, at that time they could not take out one soldier whose legs were broken. And we decided to drag him closer to the exit from the cover position. And at that moment I heard a drone above us. I tried to ask on the walkie-talkie whether it was ours or not, but almost immediately there was an explosion. On the left, I felt a powerful blow to my face. I felt something in my mouth - as if hard and redundant. I thought that the tooth had fallen out. Well, spit it out. Went back to the dugout and really wanted to drink. I started to drink, and I realized that the water seemed to be leaking out of me somewhere on the side. I say to our doctor: -Doc, tell me what I have.- To which he replied, -Commander, through and through: the cheek is pierced.- And then I realized that a few minutes ago I had not spit out a tooth, but a fragment. —Since January 2024, you are a correspondent of the Information Agency. What, in your opinion, is the role of military journalism in the context of the war with the Russian Federation, both physical and informational? - In short: we see what is happening now with the TCC, mobilization processes, etc. And there is only one conclusion: if you do not create an appropriate information field, the enemy will create it. And we all know what hostile propaganda can create. Therefore, we must do everything in our power so that we dominate the information field, not the Russians. To perceive you, to listen to you. It is important to communicate about all problems. It is hard work, but very necessary. And if we don't do it, they will do it for us. Because in the information war, the Russians let their tentacles go very, very deep. There is only a gap where they can breed their narratives - they crawl through it. And this is not only a problem of Ukraine - many countries of the world suffer from such influences of the Russian Federation. - What would be a just end to the Russian-Ukrainian war for you? - Just revenge is when all Ukrainians feel that they are Ukrainians. Because this is exactly what the Russians are afraid of: that Ukrainians feel like Ukrainians. And I also want all Russians to be punished. Not necessarily all at once, but gradually. I would very much like to return to our internationally recognized borders. But not at the cost of the lives of a huge number of people. - Do you want to return to Luhansk? - Live? Unlikely. Why? Because I just know what and how it happens there. The population there changed a lot, a lot of Russians came there. If we de-occupy the territory, what to do with them? Maybe they will escape. Or maybe not. I don't want to live near them. But you can come and walk the streets of your hometown. Work for a while, too. - What do you dream about above all else? - I dream that our people will stop dying. I really want to go back to the life I had. Although I understand that it is unrealistic. Civil journalism will be somewhat different &#8230; But I want to go back to my civilian work, really - I like it. And again I want to prepare materials about those topics that were very annoyed during the conditional information lull. For example, sowing. Now I would love to return to these -boring- topics: how many hectares were sown, how many quintals harvest were harvested &#8230; And that there is no news about the destruction of our cities and death of our people. P.S.: November 15, 2024 Special Alexander Marchenko's information agency was marked by the Order -For Merit- of the 3rd degree.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/16/dumav-shho-vyplyunuv-zub-a-to-buv-ulamok-granaty-polyuvannya-fsb-poranennya-ta-dvichi-vtrachena-luganshhyna-istoriya-voyenkora-armiyainform/	2025-02-15T20:55:40-08:00
Defense mix: Britain may choose an American air defense system on a German armored vehicle	As the authors of the defense portal Army Recognition (AR) note, these two machines have been presented as potential candidates for participation in the British Army's Ground Air Defense (GBAD) program, which aims to meet the requirements of Short Range Air Defense (SHORAD) and countermeasures unmanned aerial systems (C-UAS), reports ArmyInform. The Supacat HMT and Dingo 3 were also proposed for the British Army's Land Mobility Program (LMP). This program aims to optimize the fleet by reducing the number of vehicle chassis types to 15 by 2030. The program focuses on consolidating more than ten types of protected patrol and light vehicles into three -Common Platforms- replacing legacy systems such as the Land Rover and Pinzgauer. These modernization efforts aim to simplify the fleet while supporting a range of roles with fewer, more versatile platforms. The Supacat All Terrain Mobility Platform (ATMP) was identified as a low-risk option for the LMP due to its existing service history, with nearly 1,000 units in service since 1988. The ATMP supports 4×4 and 6×6 configurations, offers a payload capacity of 4,000 kg, and a gross vehicle weight of 12,000 kg. The platform has a length of 7.1 meters, a range of 800 km and a maximum speed of 120 km/h. The vehicle includes an armored cabin with ballistic and blast protection for four crew members and can be adapted for roles such as a mobile fire platform and logistics vehicle. The Dingo 3, developed by KNDS Deutschland, is based on a Unimog chassis with a V-shaped body design to increase resistance to mines and improvised explosive devices. It is available in 4×4 and 6×6 configurations. Moreover, the latter offers increased cargo capacity and space for up to 12 crew members and equipment. The car is equipped with a six-cylinder turbodiesel engine, which is paired with an automatic transmission and a central tire inflation system. Dingo 3's modular structure allows integration of various weapon systems, including Starstreak missile pods and an RIwP turret. The unveiling of the Reconfigurable Integrated Weapons Platform (RIwP) at the current Farnborough Defense Show, according to AR experts, was the first operational demonstration of the RIwP outside the United States. This platform, which is already in use on the BTR Stryker M-SHORAD, is a modular tower system designed to integrate various systems weapons and sensors to counter multiple threats, including drones and helicopters. In Britain, it was shown equipped with the Thales High Velocity Missile (HVM), also known as the Starstreak, the Northrop Grumman M230 LF 30x113mm Bushmaster cannon and a 7.62mm machine gun. Additional capabilities include Light Multi-Missile (LMM) integration and the L3 MX series electro-optical/infrared sight. Moog stabilization technology reduces shock and vibration during cross-country operations, and the turret's modular design allows integration of new weapons and sensors without requiring significant redesign. The Starstreak missile launcher, which was a key feature of the RIwP weapon configuration presented at the British exhibition, is being used effectively in Ukraine to engage air and armored targets. About this weapon, our editors previously told in one of its materials. Its ammunition uses three laser-guided tungsten submunitions with a range of 7 kilometers and a speed of over Mach 3. This missile system is designed to combat low-flying aircraft, helicopters and unmanned aerial systems. The complex is manufactured by Thales Air Defense and can be fired from the shoulder or mounted on mobile platforms. The addition of XM1211 ammunition for the M230 LF gun can improve RIwP effectiveness against smaller and more maneuverable drone-type targets in the British Army's Ground Air Defense program (GBAD). The British Army's GBAD program is part of a wider modernization drive to counter growing air threats. As part of the Land GBAD initiative, activities are based on SHORAD, Medium-Range Air Defense (MRAD) and Counter-Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (C-sUAS), and partially replace air defense systems Stormer HVM. The Supacat HMT and Dingo 3 offer advantages for the Land Mobility Program (LMP) and the Ground Air Defense (GBAD) initiative when equipped with the RIwP turret, making them serious contenders in their respective weapon categories.

Living by war&#8230; It is through their eyes that not only Ukraine, but also the whole world sees all the cruelty of the Russian invasion and the crimes of the occupiers, but also the courage, sacrifice and heroism of Ukrainian defenders. ArmyInform is part of a large family of military journalists. Our correspondents are constantly in the war zone and prepare reports on the work of our defenders. Many of our colleagues, before becoming military journalists, defended the country from the aggressor in different directions and in different units of the Defense Forces of Ukraine with weapons in their hands. Military Journalist Day is not a holiday. The holiday is when military journalists are not needed! Rather, it is a day to honor the difficult, painstaking, but very important work that is an important part of the country's defense&#8230;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/16/bachyty-vijnu-pokazuvaty-vijnu-zhyty-vijnoyu-koly-drajv-v-roboti-must-have-hto-vony-voyenkory-armiyainform/	2025-02-15T20:31:09-08:00
Day of the military journalist: what is known about the officer in whose honor today the soldiers ar...	There is a corresponding order of the Minister of Defense of Ukraine. Dmytro Labutkin &#8211; military correspondent, captain of the 3rd rank (posthumously). Died on the morning of February 16, 2015 while leaving Debaltseve. The advanced group, which he was part of, was ambushed. -Dmytro suffered 7 serious injuries as a result of the fighting. One of the large-caliber bullets penetrated the body armor and almost completely tore the liver. Later, during the identification of my son's body, I saw that the hole from the wound reached almost seven centimeters,- - said father Vitaly Volodymyrovych Labutkin. Footage of the shot Ukrainian with an armored personnel carrier, the occupiers put it on the network. -That day I went to the city. The godfather came up to me and said: -Uncle Vitaly, there was a video about your Dima on YouTube...- At that moment, I was struck by lightning, - I realized that this was the end,- the father recalls. Dmytro was in different clothes in the video. But the father didn't know at the time that his son was disguised because he gave his brand new uniform to a wounded soldier on the front line, whose camouflage was tattered by debris. Later, the parents find out that the video with the dead fighters was not taken immediately. Dmytro's brother told that after the clash, the occupiers did not dare to approach the Ukrainian armored personnel carrier for six hours. -The Russians were afraid that the boys would shoot back, because they did not know that they had used all their ammunition in the battle,- the father said. And when they realized that the combat vehicle did not respond to provocations, the separatists attacked. The video was shot in another location. laying out the bodies of the killed servicemen in the same way. ...Dmytro Labutkin was one of the last to leave Crimea. Debaltseve was the last of the journalists to leave surrounded by the aggressor, recording evidence of the criminal actions of the Russian army until the last moment. For personal courage and high professionalism, shown in the defense of the state sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, loyalty to the military oath by the decree of the President of Ukraine, Captain 3rd rank Dmytro Labutkin was awarded the Order of Bohdan Khmelnytsky III degree (posthumously), by order of the Minister of the Defense of Ukraine - with the award -For Military Valor- (posthumously).

A horror story about medical experiments on military personnel: why is the Russian Federation invent...	Well, in response, I want to ask: why not supplement this fake with something brighter? For example, about secret bases where Ukraine is creating a super soldier, or laboratories where an army of cyborgs is being produced. What was invented this time? Propaganda resources of the Russian Federation spread the -testimony- of anonymous sources (read - drunk screenwriters from Olhino), who talk about the fact that Ukrainian doctors allegedly perform cruel experiments on patients. For example, the wounded are not provided with ordinary care, but -dubious experiments- are conducted - from testing new drugs to some mysterious genetic manipulations. As always, there is no proof in their -sensations- - only blurry photos taken out of the context of the video and the stories of some nameless -eyewitnesses-. Ukrainian medicine works according to clear international standards. Ukrainian doctors, who save the wounded at the front and in the rear, have earned immense respect both in the country and in the world. The treatment of military personnel and civilians is carried out in accordance with international norms, including the Geneva Convention, which prohibits any medical experiments on people without their consent. Ukrainian hospitals and hospitals receive humanitarian aid, modern equipment and drugs from partners, and are not -testing unknown substances-, as Russia is trying to present. Medics save even captured Russian soldiers, which completely destroys their myth of -cruel experiments-. This fake has several purposes: This is far from the first -horror story- from the Kremlin. They have already talked about -war mosquitoes-, -black transplant specialists- and -secret NATO laboratories-. Now they decided to add more medical experiments. We are waiting for new stories about the fact that Ukrainian doctors not only save lives, but also turn military personnel into cyborgs, and civilians into Marvel superheroes. Well, it's nice to know that even in their lies, the Russians admit that our medicine is so advanced that they can only invent myths about its extraordinary capabilities. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/16/zhahalka-pro-medychni-eksperymenty-nad-vijskovymy-chomu-rf-cze-vygaduye/	2025-02-15T20:02:49-08:00
Ukraine and Germany signed a declaration of intent to create Ukrainian Unity Centers	This is reported by the President's Office on February 15. The head of state thanked Germany for its support to Ukraine and noted that this country is the second largest recipient of aid. In total, it amounts to more than 43 billion euros since the beginning of the large-scale Russian invasion, which is a huge contribution to saving lives. -It is important that Europeans have a united position on a just end to the war and strong and reliable security guarantees. The future of not only Ukraine, but also the whole of Europe depends on this,- the message says. The President emphasized that for this it is necessary to strengthen Ukraine's positions at the front, strengthen air defense and support Ukrainian production of long-range drones and missiles. Separately, during the meeting, they discussed opening a unity hub in Berlin in the near future. In the presence of Volodymyr Zelenskyi and Olaf Scholz, Deputy Prime Minister - Minister of National Unity Oleksiy Chernyshov and Minister of the Office of the Federal Chancellor Wolfgang Schmidt signed the Joint Declaration of Intentions to Create Ukrainian -Unity Centers-. In such spaces, IDPs will, in particular, be supported in adaptation, training and implementation of their initiatives, as well as help with their return home. As reported by ArmyInform, the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyi held a meeting with the CEO of the German company Rheinmetall AG, Armin Papperger and discussed with him the development of joint projects between the Ukrainian and German defense industries.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/15/ukrayina-ta-nimechchyna-pidpysaly-deklaracziyu-pro-namiry-shhodo-stvorennya-ukrayinskyh-czentriv-yednosti/	2025-02-15T11:05:13-08:00

The story of the fighter was made public on the page of the Land Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. -Ghost- was the commander of a group that had to return after a five-day combat duty. The enemy noticed the movement of the unit, so the command left the group for a while to reduce the risk of casualties. When the exit from the positions began in the dark night, the enemy fired drones and mortars at the retreat road. -Understanding the risks, -Spirit- went first, because there could be mines ahead. He stretched the group. In complete darkness, the warrior fell twice, getting a fracture and severing a ligament. Despite the excruciating pain, he did not evacuate in order not to put the rest of the group at risk. Clenching his teeth, the -Spirit- continued to move, and then hid the group in the bushes,- the report said. The enemy was actively looking for defenders, but could not find them. The endurance of the commander saved the fighters - everyone returned to the PPD.

In 2025, Russia plans to create 15 new divisions - the President of Ukraine	President Volodymyr Zelenskyi said this during a speech at the main session of the Munich Conference on Security Issues. He emphasized that in order to achieve a fair and long-term peace, European countries should strengthen their defense capabilities, pursue a coordinated foreign policy and, together with the United States, provide Ukraine with effective security guarantees. -Many leaders spoke about the fact that Europe needs its own armed forces, the army is the army of Europe. And I truly believe that time has come. It is necessary to create the armed forces of Europe. It is not more difficult than resolutely resisting Russian attacks, as we are already doing,- he said. According to the President, Europe needs a single voice, not a dozen separate ones. That is why diplomacy and a unified foreign policy must be coordinated. In particular, regarding the just end of the war. -Ukraine will never agree to agreements concluded behind our backs, without our participation. And this very rule should apply to all of Europe. No decisions regarding Ukraine without Ukraine. No solutions for Europe without Europe. Europe must have a seat at the table when decisions are made about Europe,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed. Voladymyr Zelenskyy expressed his belief that Russia does not want peace. As Moscow plans to create 15 new divisions, Ukraine needs reliable security guarantees after the end of the war. They will be strong only with the participation of the USA and the proactive position of Europe. -Some say that the new year does not come on January 1, but during the Munich Security Conference. This new year begins now, and let it be the year of a united, strong, safe and peaceful Europe,- concluded the head of state.

- We need to take advantage of this now, not later - Volodymyr Zelenskyy called his recipe for peace...	He shared his thoughts on this matter on Saturday, February 15, during his speech at the Munich Security Conference. -The fate of this war cannot be determined by just a few leaders: neither Trump and Putin, nor me and Putin, nor anyone here in Munich together with Putin. We must press together to achieve true peace. Putin cannot offer real security guarantees. Not only because he is a liar, but also because Russia in its current state needs war to hold on to power. And the world must be protected from this,- the head of state said. According to him, the recipe for peace has five main components. -First, the Armed Forces of Europe as an update of NATO. Secondly, common European foreign policy. Third, the level of European cooperation that Washington should take seriously. Fourth, international law. And fifthly, the continuation of pressure on Russia,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy emphasized. He explained that only pressure on the Russian Federation, -and not some words of Putin-, can guarantee peace, since the Kremlin dictator's promises cannot be trusted under any circumstances. -Putin is lying. It is predictable. And he is weak. We have to take advantage of it now, not later. And we have to act as Europe, not as a group of disparate individuals. Let this year be the year of a united, strong, safe and peaceful Europe. Peace for Ukraine. Peace for Europe. Peace for the whole world, for all your families,- added the President. As reported by ArmyInform, earlier Volodymyr Zelensky warned that, according to intelligence, Moscow is now preparing not for peace talks, but for further escalation, planning to send its troops to Belarus under the pretext of alleged -training-.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/15/treba-czym-skorystatysya-vzhe-a-ne-potim-volodymyr-zelenskyj-nazvav-svij-reczept-myru-v-yevropi/	2025-02-15T04:52:58-08:00

The US is seriously concerned about the difference in presence between it and Russia in the Arctic -...	Answering the question of the ArmiyaInform correspondent, what the declaration of intention to buy Greenland from the Kingdom of Denmark, doctor of philosophy in the field of social and behavioral sciences, Major of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Andriy Rudyk could mean, said that this is not the first time that the United States has claimed Greenland, and most of the existing infrastructure was built there by the Americans during their stay on the island during the Second World War. -Many of us look at the world map incorrectly. We look squarely at it, and in Arctic issues, we need to look at the globe from above in order to understand what the mileage is and whose ownership is there. The Americans in the Arctic have no permanent large port city, no settlement that will provide them with permanent sea communications. There are only two bases that are slightly above the Arctic Circle in Alaska. But Russia has a huge Murmansk base with a population of more than 200,000 people, has several military bases, one of which is 65 km from the outermost island of the Norwegian archipelago, Svalbard, which is completely demilitarized. This base is called -Arctic Shamrock- near the village of Nagurske on the island of Zemlya Oleksandry. It was commissioned again in the 20th year. And on the 24th, Russia launched a number of nuclear icebreakers. Currently, the Russian fleet, both civil and military (there they have a combined grouping of the northern fleet), has 41 icebreakers in operation, in particular, a number of nuclear icebreakers armed with sea-based cruise missiles of the caliber and Kh-35 anti-radiation missiles of various modifications. The operational distance is from the smallest 130 km to the largest 2300 km. And in order not to go into details, here is the answer to the question why the United States is so interested in Greenland. Because we need to deploy ballistic missiles there, including,- Andriy Rudyk said. The expert also emphasized that Russia is interested in the Arctic due to the fact that 85% of Russian gas production is in the Arctic region. And it protects it with three main military bases, where it has more than a thousand military personnel, including the Federal Security Service, which takes care of a number of border issues there. In addition, Russia has 10 full-fledged airfields and icebreakers with cruise missiles in the Arctic, in addition to military bases. Meanwhile, according to open data, only 100 personnel are stationed at the Danish military base in Greenland, most of them civilians. -In addition to the Arctic Shamrock base, which I mentioned, there is a Polar Star base (opened in 2014 - ed.) on Wrangel Island, which is adjacent to Chukotka. And they also have one base on the Novosibirsk Islands (Northern Klyver - ed.), which are adjacent to the Nenets Autonomous District. Therefore, it is clear that the United States, or rather the Trump administration, in my personal opinion as a scientist, is a little shocked by the difference in presence. By the way, why the question was also raised about Canada, about Nunavut (the territory that covers most of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago - ed.) - because Canada only has radar stations there. And you can't repel missiles with radar stations. Their task is only to identify them,- the expert noted. To continue the topic, candidate of political sciences, head of research programs of the USSD National Academy of Sciences Yuriy Oliynyk drew attention to the fact that the shortest flight paths of intercontinental missiles from Russia to America are precisely through the Arctic. -And in addition to Panama, where Chinese influence is very large, China is also trying to negotiate with Denmark in Greenland to advance its investments. There is also Cuba, also from that block. Obviously, this is increasingly becoming a threat for the US, because it can be surrounded by China's friends on all sides,- said Yuriy Oliynyk. Oleksandr Chupak, the head of economic programs of the USSD National Academy of Sciences, in his turn, expressed confidence that Denmark will most likely offer the United States to increase its military presence in Greenland, and this will be the real consequence of all these statements in question.

Conventional missile attacks are also carried out, and there are more air strikes. And this year it plans to create 15 new divisions. Putin can afford it, because the prices for energy resources are quite high,- the President explained. In addition, according to him, Ukrainian intelligence data indicate the possible preparation of a new Russian offensive, because in the summer the Soviet Union plans to send its forces to Belarus again under the guise of -training-. -But this is how the invasion of Ukraine was prepared three years ago. Are they intended to attack Ukraine? Maybe not, maybe to attack you,- the head of state said.

On Saturday, February 15, reported in the press service of the DPSU, publishing pictures of destroyed targets. It is noted there that although fiber-optic drones, which are not affected by means of radio-electronic warfare, are still a new threat on the battlefield, the troops of the aggressor country are using them more and more often. -However, border guards continue to successfully destroy such enemy air targets. The DPSU effectively protects the state border and is an integral part of the Defense Forces of Ukraine,- Ukrainian defenders emphasized. As reported by ArmiyaInform, within the framework of the programs for the implementation of innovations and development of the army, the Main Department of Defense Innovations of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine conducted a presentation test of domestic FPV drones controlled via fiber optic cable.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/15/na-sumshhyni-syly-oborony-zbyvayut-optovolokonni-drony-rf-zi-strileczkoyi-zbroyi/	2025-02-15T01:50:43-08:00

The dynamics of military confrontation in 2024 increased by more than 5% compared to 2023 — analysts	The principle of formation of the study is the ranking of military-political conflicts and diplomatic clashes from the most heated and large-scale to the least visible, but potentially dangerous. The great war in Europe, the powder keg in the Middle East, the appearance of North Korean troops on the Russian-Ukrainian front, escalation in the Pacific region, Trump's expansionist statements and the -destruction of the principle of territorial integrity of states- - is this already a hot third world or is it still a creeping -quiet phase-? This was discussed by the co-authors of the study: Yurii Syrotyuk, director of the non-governmental analytical center -Ukrainian Strategic Research Studies-, chief sergeant of the fire support company of the 5th Armed Forces Brigade; Andriy Rudyk, Doctor of Philosophy in the field of social and behavioral sciences, major of the ZSU; Yuriy Oliynyk, candidate of political sciences, head of research programs of the National Center for National Development of Ukraine -USSD-, serviceman of the Armed Forces of Ukraine; Oleksandr Chupak, head of the economic programs of the National Center of the National Academy of Sciences -USSD- and Kateryna Shymkevich, candidate of historical sciences, expert of the Analytical Center for Balkan Studies. Last year, there were 8 interstate wars in the world (Ukraine, Israel, Syria, Yemen, South Sudan, Sudan, Ethiopia, CAR), two border clashes (Armenia - Azerbaijan and Kyrgyzstan - Tajikistan), 18 local conflicts (Afghanistan, Libya, Myanmar, Mali, Burkina Faso, DR Congo, Somalia, Nigeria, Mozambique, Chad, Cameroon, Western Sahara, Niger, Senegal, West Papua (Indonesia), Baluchistan (Pakistan and Iran)), Guerrilla War (Thailand), 5 Domestic Political Crises (Latin America (Multiple Countries), Bangladesh, Balkans (Multiple Countries), Iraq, Iran), 4 Power Diplomatic Conflicts (Guyana-Venezuela, Greece-Turkey, Korean Peninsula, Taiwan), a total of 38 cases of resolution of inter-state and intra-state confrontations by military methods. In 2024, the dynamics of military confrontation in the world increased compared to 2023 by more than 5%. And by more than 10% compared to 2022. Thus, in 2024, the main event on a global scale continued to be the Russian-Ukrainian war, which, in terms of the intensity of technical means, became one of the largest after the Korean War, as well as the largest conflict in Europe since 1945. The Palestinian-Israeli war has serious consequences for the world and the Middle East region, which began with a terrorist attack by the Hamas group on Israel, and then turned into an Israeli military operation in the Gaza Strip, and then spilled over into Lebanon and led to an exchange of airstrikes between Iran and Israel. At the end of the year, the rapid fall of Bashar Assad's regime in Syria led to a radical restructuring of the balance of power in the region and a decrease in Russia's influence. Tensions are rising in the Pacific. The situation around Taiwan is traditionally difficult in the context of China's regular naval exercises. Of particular concern is the demonstration of a military threat and declarations of the DPRK's readiness for war, accompanied by Pyongyang's direct participation in the Russian-Ukrainian war. On the territory of less developed states, long-term conflicts continue, although a significant part of them reduces the intensity within the framework of the negotiation process (for example, in Ethiopia). At the same time, a potentially large-scale conflict is unfolding between DR Congo and Rwanda. Yemeni Houthi attacks on civilian vessels in the Red Sea continue to threaten the security of global supply chains. The situation in West Africa remains traditionally tense, where Russia increases instability and supports military coups. Force continues to be the main argument for the resolution of international disputes. The restoration of conventional means of warfare, with the frontal collision of numerous armies, has become a characteristic feature. On the other hand, the importance of the technical level became obvious, primarily in the field of accuracy and speed of data transfer. Along with the proxy confrontation between the USA and the PRC, regional leaders — Iran, Turkey — are actively intervening in the force competition. The influence of network paramilitary formations and the emergence of the instrument of quasi-states is increasing. These quasi-states fill the lacunae of the -dead zones- that form outside the influence of nation states, regional leaders, and as a result of the strategic confrontation of superpowers. Private armies are engaged in full force. The War Index is an analytical product that has been published for the seventh year in a row. This is an analysis of the conflicts taking place in the world, their ranking, an expert opinion and a forecast of how they will change and affect world politics. You can download the publication -Index of War - 2024- to read more about the military conflicts that took place last year and are continuing today, following the link.

According to the woman, local authorities and propagandists completely ignore the problems of the population, which finally faced the consequences of the war launched by the Russian Federation against Ukraine. -They don't say anything about it. And our Bogomaz (governor) does not write anything. We only have eavesdropping on what people will write. Everything is fine with Bogomaza, everything is calm. Suzemka, White Birch - that's all. Daily. Like our Lomakovka. No one pays attention anymore. Every day they beat there. This whole thing will probably take a long time. And then even if it all ends with a nuclear war,- the Russian laments. As reported by ArmyInform, the Russians also complain that hungry soldiers of the Russian Federation are wandering around Bryansk, begging locals for any food.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/15/hoch-by-yadernoyu-ne-skinchylosya-na-bryanshhyni-skyglyat-shho-misczeva-vlada-ignoruye-vijnu-ta-yiyi-naslidky-dlya-rosiyan/	2025-02-15T00:32:35-08:00

Restored -techik-, the battles near Bakhmut and the broken spine: the story of Oleksiy, a military o...	Aleksii told our correspondent about the defense of Kyiv and the tasks he performed in the Bakhmut region. -On the second day of the large-scale invasion, he found his military ID at home and went to the TCC in Kyiv. I remember that there was a long queue. They asked me if I was ready for the front line. He replied that he was ready. And soon he was already in his military unit. I got into one of the famous artillery brigades. By the way, I came to the TCC with two boys. They are from Donetsk. They moved here back in 2014. And one of them said: -Lyokha, we used to sit out, now we don't have a home there, we have to go fight.- Before the invasion, I had a good life, I have no regrets. Management position in one well-known company. By the way, they still wait for me there and support me constantly. When it's all over, I'll go back to my normal life. My parents didn't approve of my decision to go to war at first. And then over time they accepted this situation. He wrote to his wife and son, who had left for Poland, that he had joined the army. They understood me. My mom and dad also left with the start of the large-scale invasion. To Austria. My father died there. ...My civilian job was related to automotive engineering, so it came in handy in the army. The war cannot exist without cars. So I started. It was the defense of Kyiv. We were constantly loading and sending shells. The military didn't have many vehicles at that time. I saw a semi-dismantled Volkswagen T4 standing in the area. I say to the company commander: -Give me this car, let it go for two days, and it will drive with us.- So they did. and I have first dealt with this car with this renovated car. Sometimes it was very dangerous to break through to some of them. But at speed it was possible. And went through Sumy. And we caught up with them on two trawls with guns. They stopped, decomposed, fired on them, made up and reconciled again. They invited me because I never refused even the most difficult tasks. He passed his studies, finished him perfectly. And I voluntarily &#8211; there. And there, everything is completely different. Almost round-the-clock work. In the crew, someone is resting for three hours, at which time the other works, then on the contrary. Sometimes you can work in the field for a whole day when there is frost, snow and enemy birds in the sky. And the tasks were completely different then. Sometimes we hit important enemy facilities, which were located sometimes 30 kilometers from the contact line. Sometimes, we scouted where the Katsaps attracted some heavy equipment, or the same -Grades-. The Katsaps then carried mortars, heavy weapons and periodically tried to break through. And when they artillery began to hit our infantry, then we engaged in counter-battery fighting: we searched for their guns and hit them with our means. And there, just in the direction of Bakhmut, a mine landed almost next to me. As a result &#8211; broken spine, damage to all its departments. Then I was found to be of limited fitness and transferred to the TCC to serve. Now I periodically undergo rehabilitation. After the procedures, the pain goes away for a month and a half. Although even before that landmine landed, my spine had already begun to collapse, because they were loading heavy shells. ...My colleague, who is also currently serving in the TCC, does not respond to reproaches directed at us by civilians, who say, why are you here and not there. And I am in solidarity with him, I also do not pay attention to such phrases. There is no point in explaining something in the third year of a large-scale invasion. The one who is interested, he knows everything very well. There are a lot of people who tell us this at assembly points: we know, we read, we see that the military in the TCC &#8211; these are those who cannot fight because of their health. That is, the majority just understands who we are.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/15/vidnovlenyj-techik-boyi-pid-bahmutom-ta-perebytyj-hrebet-istoriya-vijskovogo-z-tczk-oleksiya/	2025-02-14T21:04:31-08:00
In the Pokrovsky direction, the armored column of the Russians was unwound: the scouts discovered th...	The intelligence officer of the 117th separate heavy mechanized brigade with the call sign -Cornet- told ArmyInform about how brigade intelligence works during the modern war. -Radio-electronic intelligence deals with intercepts and direction finding. As soon as the enemy presses a tangent and transmits some information, we catch this information and, with the help of certain resources, transmit it to the point of collection and processing. Then, from this collection point, all the data comes to my gadget,- says -Cornet-. Of course, the enemy tries to encrypt his messages. To do this, radios are flashed using special equipment and keys. This is necessarily done before groups leave for positions, however, after a certain time, the enemy's encryption keys can be broken - this forces the Russians to periodically flash the radio stations. -You can break it in a couple of hours, you can in a day. We crack their encryption and start listening to them. In three days they have to come back to reflash the radio stations, because by that time we can definitely listen to them,- the officer explains the work of electronic intelligence. After the enemy reflashes the radios, the encryption keys have to be cracked anew. This requires additional time, but Ukrainian scouts always cope with the task. Especially since, if necessary, more powerful means can be turned on at a level higher than that of a brigade. -If we don't have the appropriate means and capabilities, you can always turn to higher-level management and ask them to break one or another key. Then they help us, break the enemy's encryption key - and we can listen to the enemy's radio communications again,- says the intelligence officer. Capturing enemy radio stations is a significant advantage for scouts. This makes it possible to extract from them all the information necessary for breaking the keys and to listen to all the radio communications of the enemy. -If we have samples of radios, samples of telephones that the infantry brought from the front, that's a very big plus. They are connected, all keys and information are extracted, and we can hack all radio stations without any questions,- explains -Kornet-. Of course, the advantage gained in this way has its expiration date, because sooner or later the enemy will change the encryption keys again and they will have to be cracked anew. -Almost every captured prisoner has a radio station. These are -Here-, -Baofeng-, -Azarty-. -Baofeng- is the easiest to listen to, -Azarty- is the hardest. However, if they are captured, everything can be hacked if you wish and have the appropriate resources,- the intelligence officer says. This is how a classic military -battle of sword and shield- takes place in REP: scouts break through enemy defenses, invaders restore defensive barriers - and the struggle for preemption begins all over again. Radio interception, according to the intelligence officer, is today one of the most valuable sources of information about the intentions, plans and actions of the enemy. It is from them that the main information that allows effective countermeasures against the Russian invaders in the area of ​​responsibility of the brigade comes. -These intercepts contain all the information - what they plan, how they lead the groups, how long the equipment will leave. The commander sits -on a stretcher- somewhere and communicates with his own personnel on the front edge, gives certain guidelines: -Move forward, go to the right, you will see a green hangar-. And we listen and understand that the green hangar is only in one place - and it's a good reference point for artillery,- Cornet smiles. Then everything happens simply - after receiving visual confirmation, the scouts give a reference point and the artillery inflicts fire damage on the enemy group. Its effectiveness can also be determined by radio interception, from which it becomes known that the enemy has a lot of -two hundred- and -three hundred-, so he is forced to retreat. -Radio intercept detects, -mavik- flies there, confirms the radio intercept visually - and the artillery strikes. Therefore, it can be said that the second wing of the PEP is aerial reconnaissance - apparently, they are on the same level and allow protecting the lives of fighters, who, thanks to this, do not need to sit at an observation post and take risks,- the military officer explains. The enemy is usually unable to even understand where exactly he has pierced. To understand all the enemy's code designations, special maps and databases are created, which allow you to find out literally by one word what the intercepted message is about. The least valuable source of information is the captives, who usually do not know any valuable information and are poorly oriented in space. They know nothing even of their immediate commanders. -Prisoners don't know anything. They have a command that instructs the assault group before going out. They have their phones with them, the AlpineQuest program on their phones. A stormtrooper is given a route from point A to point B, where he must arrive. But they turn on the program not from the point where the briefing was held, but 5 kilometers from there,- says -Kornet-. Thanks to this, the captive only knows this route and only from there can you follow his path with the AlpineQuest application on the phone. In the best case, the name of the location and the call sign can be extracted from the prisoner. -Out of ten, at best one or two know something. We ask them if they have anti-tank means, what kind of artillery they have, what tanks they have, what kind of weapons they have in the infantry that goes to the front line, whether they have anti-tank means on the front line,- says Kornet. But in most cases, enemy foot soldiers have an extremely low level of intellectual development. They are used purely as suicide bombers for -meat- assaults, issuing one machine gun, two shops and a one-way ticket. Visual surveillance of the enemy's actions is provided not only by fighters at observation posts or aerial reconnaissance vehicles, but also by a network of cameras installed at the front edge. In adverse weather conditions, when it is impossible to raise reconnaissance drones into the sky, cameras become the main eyes of scouts. -We go to the front and install CCTV cameras. When the weather does not allow us to raise a -wing- or -mavik- into the sky, we watch everything on cameras,- says -Kornet-. The enemy, of course, tries to detect and destroy CCTV cameras of the Defense Forces. Such a hunt becomes especially persistent on the eve of planned assaults, which the Russians try to carry out under favorable weather conditions. This is how the enemy thinks at this time, according to the scout: -We are planning assault operations when there is fog. The terrain is a beam. The enemy—that is, us—will not see us. He will not be able to lift -mavics- or -wing-. Therefore, we will work on this day in this direction. But before that, we need to destroy their cameras that are on the front line here, here and here.- After the enemy hits the cameras, he conducts reconnaissance and reports the result. However, the very act of destroying cameras is a sign of the Russians' preparation for offensive actions, so Ukrainian intelligence officers are increasing their vigilance in this direction. Regular collection of information from all possible sources allows you to learn in advance about the intentions and plans of the enemy and make the necessary preparations to disrupt them. -We monitor everything, we know about all their movements and meetings. For example, there is an interception of the PEP on the gathering of mechanics-drivers in -Leshego-. This means that the enemy is planning some actions and will conduct briefings with personnel. If we are talking about mechanized vehicles, this means that the occupiers will form an armored group for an assault,- the officer says. The intercepted message is a signal to Ukrainian scouts to strengthen aerial reconnaissance and monitoring not only of the front edge, but also of the enemy's rear areas. After all, if it is possible to detect an enemy assault armored column further from the combat line in the depth of enemy lines, the Ukrainian fighters will have more time and opportunities to destroy it. -Recently, we had such an armored column in the Pokrovsky direction - 11 units of armored vehicles, approximately 120 enemy soldiers per company. Total losses were suffered - the column was broken, all the equipment was destroyed. Of the personnel, even before the start of the assault, there were already 40 -two hundred- and 37 -three hundred-, says -Cornet-. Suffering critical losses, the remnants of the enemy assault group were forced to retreat. It was possible to stop the assault thanks to the professional actions of scouts - the occupiers were already found at a depth of about 30 kilometers from the combat line. -We were warned and knew that the convoy would be moving. Therefore, our entire personnel was warned in advance, anti-tank weapons were brought to readiness, tanks were taken to closed positions, and drone crews were prepared. This allowed the brigade, with the help of confederates and attached units, to completely destroy all enemy equipment, and the remaining enemy personnel were ordered to retreat,- says the officer. In this way, it was the comprehensive intelligence that made it possible to prepare in time for the enemy's offensive actions and to effectively repulse an enemy assault attempt with the use of a significant amount of armored vehicles. Under the command of -Cornet- are people from purely civilian professions who, after training and during service, became highly professional scouts capable of performing the most difficult tasks. -My guys are not from the regular army, they are not military personnel, they are all mobilized. But in three years, they have already reached the level where they can compete on equal footing and outpace the personnel of the Russian Federation army,- the officer says about his subordinates. They are not inferior to the best enemy developments and equipment that Ukrainian intelligence officers work with. And in case of need, colleagues from structures with even more powerful capabilities can always come to their aid. -Cornet- notes that rising to their level is one of his aspirations. -We also want to develop in the direction of breaking the most difficult key at the brigade level, which the enemy uses to encode his communication in the radio station at the position from the commander to the position. In fact, the question is only about finances, because there are specialists, experience and a desire to learn. There will be better equipment - we will master it quickly,- he emphasizes.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/15/na-pokrovskomu-napryamku-rozmotaly-bronekolonu-rosiyan-rozvidnyky-vyyavyly-vysuvannya-voroga-za-30-kilometriv/	2025-02-14T20:44:01-08:00

Another Russian fake: Ukraine mobilizes orphans? Well, of course, and also - pokemons and pets	Fake Russian -media- (read - factories of lies) spread the -news- that Ukrainian military commissars are forcibly taking orphans to the army. The -evidence- includes blurry videos, footage taken out of context, and anonymous -testimonies-. Everything according to the standard scenario of Kremlin storytellers. Ukrainian legislation clearly defines who is subject to mobilization. Citizens between the ages of 25 and 60 are subject to the draft, not teenagers, and even more so not children of orphanages. In addition, only those who have a military specialty or have served are subject to mobilization. Therefore, even 18-year-olds without experience are not -taken- just like that, let alone minors. The propaganda machine of the Russian Federation works according to the principle -the more ridiculous the lie, the faster it will be believed.- The purpose of such fakes is to cause panic, sow distrust in the Armed Forces, and provoke the indignation of the international community. But every time they overestimate their audience, because even their supporters are not always ready to swallow such nonsense. the Russians have already figured out that: Ukraine sends -war mosquitoes- into battle, the Armed Forces of Ukraine use -black magic- against the invaders, the soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are aliens, and now here are -mobilized children.- We are waiting for new masterpieces. For example, that Ukraine is raising an army from pets or cloning Cossacks from the DNA of Bohdan Khmelnytskyi. And for now, let's spread the truth: no one is mobilizing teenagers, but it seems like it's high time for Russian propagandists to rest. It is better in a sanatorium somewhere in Siberia. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/15/chergovyj-rosijskyj-fejk-ukrayina-mobilizuye-ditej-syrit-nu-zvisno-a-shhe-pokemoniv-i-domovychkiv/	2025-02-14T20:13:47-08:00

They said that, in addition to the fact that the attackers called for the overthrow of the constitutional order, they also denied the armed aggression of the Russian Federation and tried to artificially discredit the command of the Defense Forces. According to the investigation, in order to spread Kremlin narratives, the perpetrators created their own informal associations and movements, the members of which were promised immunity from mobilization and -positions- in the leadership of pseudo-social organizations. -In Chernihiv Oblast, the head of one of the currents of the fake -people's government- was detained. The -branches- of the pro-Kremlin cell in the Cherkasy and Odesa regions were also neutralized. The extras did not recognize Ukrainian statehood, authorities and current legislation,- the message reads. Among other things, the attackers incited men of draft age to evade mobilization. -For this purpose, conscripts were offered to join the ranks of the so-called -power bloc of the People's Government-, where they were promised to issue an army uniform and assign a fake -rank-. In order to publicly declare a pseudo-social association, its organizers created their website, where they published hostile content,- the SBU said. In addition, in Volyn, a local resident was suspected of trying to create -self-governing bodies- in the regional center in support of the Kremlin regime, calling for a seizure of state power through his YouTube channel. Currently detained on suspicion of crimes committed under several articles of the Criminal Code of Ukraine: -The perpetrators are in custody. They face up to eight years in prison with confiscation of property,- the special service added.

In Odesa, six minors on the order of the Russian Federation ransacked military vehicles	The SBU informs about this on February 14. -According to the instructions of the occupiers, their henchmen burned the cars of the Ukrainian military. When the minors tried to -cooperate- with the occupiers, then representatives of the Russian special services resorted to threats and blackmailing the schoolchildren,- the report says. According to the case materials, the defendants acted separately. First, they looked for potential targets, and then -agreed- them with their Russian handlers and set them on fire with the help of flammable mixtures. So, one of the participants turned out to be a 14-year-old student of the Odessa Lyceum. The young man burned the car of a soldier of the Armed Forces, and, not receiving money for it, tried to cut off contact with the occupiers. -After that, the Russian special service officer began to blackmail the lyceum student with a -pour- of compromising material in order to force him to complete the next task,- the SBU said.

Volodymyr Degtyarev, a representative of the public relations service of the -Charter- brigade, told about this on the -Suspilne Novosti- broadcast. According to him, you can even not use thermal imagers under the moonlight. Such -transparency- of the battlefield limits any movement. -In the first two weeks of February, we managed to destroy 44 Russian military personnel and wound more than 20. The number of their dead is twice as high as the wounded, which may indicate, for example, that they are trying to gather in their shelters, which hit our pilots with accurate drops and artillery,- Volodymyr Degtyarev said. As for who the -Charter- brigade has to fight against, Degtyarev notes that these people are not too trained. Another fact is that there are fewer ex-convicts. -At least those are the ones we are fighting against now. Fewer people from prisons. Most of the people are from the Russian -Glubinka-. Judging by everything, they washed their prisons and colonies and switched to signing contracts with people from distant villages,- noted the representative of the public relations service of the -Charter- brigade. As ArmyInform reported, the enemy is trying to overcome the Siverskyi Donets-Donbas canal and throw his infantry into the ruins of the city. where enemy stormtroopers are trying to survive.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/14/vony-vymyly-svoyi-tyurmy-ta-koloniyi-na-harkivshhyni-proty-syl-oborony-voyuyut-nenavcheni-selyany-z-glubinky/	2025-02-14T00:27:22-08:00

Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced this on February 14. -Ukraine built this shelter together with other countries of Europe and the world, together with America - with everyone who wants real security for people. Today's Russia is the only state in the world that can attack such facilities, occupy the territory of nuclear plants and conduct hostilities without considering the consequences.

Currently, the radiation background has not increased, and this is constantly monitored. According to the first estimates, the damage to the shelter is significant. -Russia carries out such attacks every night against Ukrainian infrastructure and our cities. Russia continues to increase its army. Russia does not change its crazy anti-human state rhetoric. And this means that Putin is definitely not preparing for negotiations. He is preparing to continue deceiving the world. That is why we need the united pressure of all those who value life, pressure on the aggressor. Russia must bear responsibility for what it does,- Volodymyr Zelenskyi said.

Jump in and try to survive — in Chasovoy Yar, the Russians are experimenting with their infantry	Andrii Polukhin, a representative of the press service of the 24th mechanized brigade named after King Danylo, told on the ArmiyaTV stream about this. -The enemy is attacking towards the center of the city, the battles are taking place in the city buildings.

There is shelter and the enemy is using it,- Andrih Polukhin said. According to him, from time to time the enemy manages to throw his infantry into the ruins, but it is worse when it comes to providing them with ammunition or food. But after the destruction of some infantry groups, new ones arrive, the enemy continues its assaults. As ArmiyaInform reported, there is a lot of destruction in Chasovoy Yar.

- I have nothing to hug you-. The story of love, injury and support of Alexander and his Nadia	This ward is a temporary home for Alexander and Nadia. He was seriously wounded during the operation of the Defense Forces of Ukraine in Kurshchyna, his two upper limbs were amputated. She is a beloved wife who will always be there: both in grief and in joy. They have been together since 9th grade. Both are from Poltava Oblast. A quarter of a century as acquaintances. 21 years in marriage. They are raising two sons. And the war and the serious wounding of Alexander, unfortunately, only emphasized how strong the feelings of this couple are. This short story, recorded by the correspondent of ArmiyaInform in one of the medical institutions of Kyiv, is about love during war, mutual support and understanding during war, as well as plans for the future. -I studied in the 9th grade, Sasha was four years older than me. He used to visit my brother on business, and he introduced us,- recalls Nadiya and adds that, unfortunately, her brother died seven months ago in the Russian-Ukrainian war. The initiative in the relationship was mostly shown by Nadiya. There were many evenings at dances, discos. In 1999, Oleksandr served a term of service in the PPO. Worked with a radar station. Nadiya studied, and Alexander served his time and started working in Pyryatyn. Sometimes the girl went to visit her lover. -And we are from the village! That's what they said in the village: -And why does she go there?!- Let's either sign up or not go.- So we applied on my birthday, March 23rd. April 25 was the wedding.- They got married when Nadiya was 20 years old, Alexander was 24. A year later, the first-born Dmytro was born, and at the age of 29, Nadiya gave birth to her second son, Roman. Alexander lived a civilian life. By 2024. Then he went to the TCC, because he had to update his military registration data by July 16. I updated the data and received a combat summons on the same day. First, the training center in Chernihiv Oblast (30 days), then Kryvyi Rih (additional staffing), and from there the Kursk direction. At first he was in the ranks of the 47th separate mechanized brigade, then the 25th separate assault battalion. Position: Grenade Launcher. -I had enough for six days. Told to take a stand. We got there, and it turns out that there were already people sitting there. The landing was dense, nothing was visible - they started working on us with machine guns. The right hand was wounded as a result of machine gun fire, an artery was hit. The left hand was injured due to mortar shelling. The first was the wounded right hand. While they were evacuating, a mortar arrived literally in 10 minutes. As soon as it got dark, the FPVs arrived with cameras and began to cover. I still hid properly, in a hole&#8230; And thanks to my brother with the call sign -Father-. If it weren't for him, I would have stayed there. He pulled me out and dragged me into the evacuation vehicle. He is also injured now, undergoing rehabilitation,- the soldier recalls the circumstances of the injury. -&#8230; My brother put tourniquets on him. If it weren't for him, Sasha would have bled and been the 500th. Because many boys from the Kursk region are missing,- adds Nadiya. The evacuation lasted a long time. The tourniquet was applied for 34 hours. -If everything had been faster, the right arm would have been saved,- says the soldier. All this happened in October 2024. Since then, treatment and rehabilitation. -When Sasha was mobilized, I cried every day. I waited, went to work. When he was taken to the battlefield, he did not confess to me, only told his eldest son. But he called every day: morning and evening. Then a few days of silence and suddenly a call. Sasha calls. Said it was fine. At that time, he was in intensive care. And then in the evening he called again and told what had happened: -I have nothing to hug you.- I was glad that he was alive. While I was in the positions, I cried every day. When she found out that he was injured, she did not cry. I came to Kyiv, saw him, and didn't cry either. Yes, when they were taken to the war, there were tears. When I'm already near him, I try not to cry,- the woman says firmly and confidently. After she left for her husband in Kyiv, Nadia was fired from the Kremenchug Carriage Works. -As far as I know, when our colleagues go abroad to earn money, they have three months in reserve. I thought that I would go to Sasha in Kyiv - it would count for me either as a vacation or at my own expense, etc. I warned that I would not return to work anytime soon, because my husband is without two hands. But two weeks passed and I was fired. I worked for 17 years,- says Nadiya. -&#8230; And in two weeks they were fired. But she is next to me!-, adds Oleksandr. Followed by further treatment and prosthetics. The application was submitted for state prosthetics at the Ortho-pro company. For the time being, there will be mechanics on the left hand (while the stump is prepared - ed.), bionics on the right. Oleksandr's plans for the future are to learn to work with new hands. In rehabilitation, he emphasizes, time is of the essence. Nadia plans to breed chrysanthemums in the future. This is what she was still doing at the factory: breeding indoor plants, cuttings, etc. -I want to buy chrysanthemums that no one has yet. And breed them. Work should be such that you can be at home. Next to the man. And the most insulting thing is that Sasha was called a universal soldier, because no matter what he did, he succeeded in everything. And here it is,- says Nadiya. -&#8230; But never lose heart: I have two sons who need to be put on their feet!-, Oleksandr seems to conclude his wife's thoughts. The 11-year-old son continues his studies. He is especially interested in mathematics, music, football. Parents help with lessons remotely. The eldest son is already working. -As soon as Sasha was taken into the army, he immediately showed himself as a man. Dad used to give a sample,- says Nadiya. In the end, I ask Nadiya what she would advise wives who, unfortunately, find themselves or may find themselves in the situation in which she herself found herself - when her husband was seriously injured. After all, cases are not rare, according to doctors, when spouses separate after the injury of a defender. To this the woman replies: -I don't understand how this is possible&#8230; We are always together. 20 years!..- says Nadiya. -21,- Alexander corrects. -&#8230; But, for example, we go to the store together, visit together, visit our mother together. We are all in this together. And when he was taken to the war, I came home from work, went into the yard, passed the arch made of grapes, and began to cry. I go in and he's gone. Therefore, I do not understand how I can leave him after he was taken to war. So he was taken away and there is no part of the family. Is our heart not there? Oleksandr continues the idea of ​​mutual support in a couple: -When you are lying alone and being treated, it is psychologically very difficult. And when a woman is around, there is nothing to compare it with! And we'll talk, and we'll laugh, and we'll joke. When your significant other is around, it's wonderful. And we are out of Kyiv, we can go for a walk. When the children arrived, they went to the water park and Fairyland. We try not to lie in one place, because the tummy will grow,- Oleksandr says with a laugh. And the couple walks a lot. Walks alternate between procedures: either go out for coffee, then go to the market for beads, or just take a walk in the park. And everything, of course, together.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/14/meni-nemaye-chym-tebe-obijmaty-istoriya-kohannya-poranennya-i-pidtrymky-oleksandra-i-jogo-nadiyi/	2025-02-13T21:02:34-08:00
Standby mode: how Donald Trump's statements affected the NATO meeting and what Ukraine should prepar...	But very quickly the focus of the discussions shifted to one and only one topic - potential negotiations on ending the Russian war against Ukraine. The trigger for this was US President Donald Trump's statements about telephone conversations with Kremlin dictator Volodymyr Putin and President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky. Usually, such topics concern diplomats, but it was impossible to ignore this flow of information. Therefore, the ministers of defense expressed their positions and had to respond literally on the go to new and new statements from the White House. How European allies perceived the actions of the USA and whether this will affect the further support of Ukraine - read more in the article of the ArmiyaInform correspondent from Brussels. In a certain sense, this ministerial ended up being a preparation for the Munich Security Conference, which begins on February 14. It is in Munich that the American diplomatic mission will arrive, which, as expected, will outline its position regarding support for Ukraine for the first time and will talk about its vision of possible negotiations to end the war. However, events developed so rapidly that two days before Munich, drastic changes occurred. It all started with the harsh statements of the new head of the Pentagon, Pete Hegseth, who arrived at the ministerial for the first time and also took part in the Ramstein meeting held at the NATO headquarters for the first time. ArmyInform wrote in detail about his demands to the allies to increase defense spending and the statement that returning to the borders of Ukraine by 2014 is an unrealistic goal. As it turned out, this was only the beginning. A little later, Donald Trump announced that he had a phone conversation with the Kremlin dictator, and an hour later - with the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyi. Trump also said that preparations for the negotiations have actually begun and that he is ready to meet with Putin in Saudi Arabia. He did not mention the meeting with the Ukrainian president. Next, the American president questioned the need for Ukraine's future membership in NATO and avoided answering whether Ukraine should even be part of the negotiations. And therefore, he actually called into question the subjectivity of Ukraine. However, already on February 13, Pete Hegseth announced at the final press conference in Brussels that the US president will hold talks with the presidents of Ukraine and Russia. -Any negotiations that are held will be held with both. President Zelensky understands the realities on the ground, Putin understands the realities on the ground, and President Trump, as a person who makes agreements and conducts negotiations, also understands these dynamics,- he said. The American minister also suggested that a -demarcation that will not suit either side- will be carried out as part of the peace agreement. On the same day, Donald Trump himself declared that Ukraine would be part of the negotiations: -We will have Ukraine, Russia will be there, and there will be other people... I believe that he (Putin. - Ed.) wants peace. I think he would have told me if he didn't want to.- These statements hardly convinced anyone, given the changeable position of the US president. In addition, Europe's participation in the negotiations remained unclear, for which the head of the Pentagon assigned a -certain role-, without specifying what exactly. This scenario obviously does not suit the US's European allies, and many of them immediately made it clear. Mark Rutte stated at the final press conference that the members of the Alliance are already holding consultations among themselves, including the USA. -As NATO, of course, we coordinate intensively. And I know that many allies and EU members are doing the same with Washington. And what we have been doing for the last 24 hours is that the clocks were ticking,- the NATO Secretary General added. At the same time, he emphasized that NATO's commitment to Ukraine's membership does not apply to future negotiations. Mark Rutte reminded that at the summit in Washington, NATO adopted commitments regarding Ukraine's future membership. -But there was never an agreement that whenever peace talks began, these peace talks would end - in any case and always - with NATO membership,- he explained. The head of EU diplomacy Kaya Callas, who was invited to the meeting of the Ukraine-NATO Council yesterday, reacted much harsher to the US statements. -Any agreement concluded without us will fail, because Europe and Ukraine are necessary to implement this agreement. Without us at the negotiating table, you can agree on anything, but it will all fail due to the lack of implementation,- she emphasized. German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said Europe should be involved in the negotiations, especially if the US expects European allies to play a peacekeeping role in any future deal. He emphasized that Putin should stop the attacks on Ukraine if he is really serious about negotiations. -It would be better if the US did not make concessions to Russia even before the start of negotiations,- the German minister added. Before leaving for Munich, President Volodymyr Zelenskyi made it clear that Ukraine will not accept the results of the negotiations if the USA and Russia conduct them themselves. -We simply will not be able to accept as an independent country any agreements without us. I articulate this very clearly to our partners. Any bilateral talks about Ukraine - I am not talking about other topics, here they are free - we will not accept any bilateral talks about Ukraine without us,- the head of state said. It is safe to say that today all discussions regarding potential negotiations will resume with renewed vigor in Munich. The Secretary General of NATO will meet with Volodymyr Zelenskyi and the US delegation, and the Ukrainian leader is also scheduled to meet with representatives of the US administration. The previous evening, Donald Trump announced that a meeting of high-ranking officials of the USA, Ukraine and Russia will be held in Germany. The Office of the President of Ukraine replied that negotiations with the Russians are not foreseen. -The Ukrainian position is unchanged. Ukraine should first talk with America, Europe should participate in any serious conversation. And only then an agreed joint position should be on the table for discussion with the Russians,- the OP said. Placement of peacekeepers in Ukraine may become one of the points of a potential agreement. The USA immediately ruled out sending its troops, shifting the responsibility to Europe. According to Volodymyr Zelenskyi, 100,000 military personnel are needed for the peacekeeping contingent. However, even before the meeting in Brussels at the beginning of this week, the Russians clearly demonstrated their attitude to the negotiations by launching another missile attack on Kyiv. Likewise, they continue daily assaults on Ukrainian positions at the front and bomb the houses of civilians. Meanwhile, Europe has obviously realized that it will have to rely much more on itself in defense matters and also take on the support of Ukraine. Great Britain has already held the first -Ramstein- under its leadership and announced an increase in military aid to Ukraine from 3 to 4.5 billion pounds. London is also preparing a major defense deal with the EU and could replace Washington amid continued pressure from the White House. All this shows that Europe is clearly aware of the Russian threat and is not going to leave Ukraine alone with the Russian invaders.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/14/rezhym-ochikuvannya-yak-zayavy-donalda-trampa-vplynuly-na-zustrich-nato-i-do-chogo-gotuvatysya-ukrayini/	2025-02-13T20:35:26-08:00
Love at first sight -Kenobi- and -Acid-: about service in the Legion, annual injuries and the comman...	After all, they are both military professionals who never hid behind other people's backs during a brutal war with an insidious enemy. How to be able to speak without losing your mind when the monitor of the combat control point shows the burst of a 152-mm projectile at the place where your beloved was just performing a task? How do you keep your composure after reading a message that the father of your unborn son is injured and may not survive? How to go into battle, having more than one wound and many contusions, and most importantly, how to let a loved one go on a dangerous mission? Their path has never been simple or easy, but despite all the trials, they confidently look to the future and have no intention of backing down from their chosen goal, because they understand how much Ukraine needs them. - How was your first meeting? — Ian Kenobi: The Year 2022 Far Away. Kruglyakivka settlement. I was the commander of an infantry company in the Legion at the time. Anastasia just joined us, served at the medical station. The company commander injured his back and medics came to help him. Then we saw each other for the first time&#8230; — Anastasia -Acid-: When I first saw him, I immediately liked him - so manly, you know, serious. It was love at first sight&#8230; — How did you manage to combine relations with service in combat conditions? — Ian -Kenobi-: She was originally in the medical unit. Then I knew that her duties were limited to evacuating the wounded, providing aid and delivering to stabilization points and it was safe. But already, when I went to a higher position and became the deputy commander of the battalion, Anastasia was transferred to an infantry company. Then, I'll be honest, it was difficult for me at times. Especially when you are on the other side of the screen (video surveillance at the command post - author), and she is on a combat mission in the field at the time. There were a couple of situations that were simply heart-stopping. We immediately drew a clear line between relationships and tasks. There was no such thing as -you're not going there because you're my girlfriend.- There was a distribution of personnel: who, when, how and what tasks are performed. In Anastasia, it was mainly medical support of assault groups during missions, evacuation of the wounded directly from the battlefield and evacuation of dead soldiers, etc. I remember one such moment. I then lost the ability to speak literally somewhere for a minute of time. I watch how they evacuated the soldier, unfortunately, the deceased. She and another serviceman. They put him on a stretcher and began to tie him up. And at that moment I see: a large white spot appears on the entire screen. Arrival of a 152 mm projectile. It was literally a few meters away from them. I thought it was all over&#8230; — Anastasia -Acid-: We went to evacuate the soldier who died. All we had to do was take the body. I had such a partner who was funny, who moved very slowly behind me with these burdens. We did not take anything extra with us, no medical backpacks - only our first-aid kits, because we understood that the soldier could no longer be helped. He just had to be evacuated. There was a landing and an open area. He was right in that open area. Before this corpse, I had only seen the corpses of Russians who had been lying for a long time. And to come face to face with a dead person right after death was the first time. We squatted down, began to unfold the stretchers. And, by the way, these stretchers, I think, saved us. I cut the plate carrier. We were right above the ground when it hit. Everything happened very quickly: you turn around, there is some smoke. I look, -Zulu-, that's the callsign of that guy, he's already running. I think it's clear, so I have to run somewhere too. And then already on the radio station: -Some back! Come back!-&#8230; And then we turn around. From my side, it's always on adrenaline. And you don't think for what was thought on the other side of the screen. - Ian -Kenobi-: And then, literally in 30 seconds, the duty officer shouts, tries to communicate with them on the radio station. They answer. The weather helped us. Wet, mud around, so the projectile just buried itself in the ground. The main shock wave went up. They were very contused then. The fighter was evacuated and left. — Anastasia -Acid-: The first time he went on a combat mission, and we were not yet in a relationship, it was just the year of the large-scale invasion. He went out as a company commander with his guys, because they needed to raise morale. - Ian -Kenobi-: To put it simply, it was just the anniversary. It is February 24, 2023. And the guys were a little wary. They thought that now a mass attack of the enemy would begin or something else. We know, the enemy loves such significant dates and doing something bad on these days. Then I went out with the guys on a combat mission. On the way, we were fired upon with cluster munitions, a mortar caught us, then there was remote mining. But we got to the position, thank God. It's standard there: -nightmare- a little with resets. At that time, they were not yet very popular, but drones with ammunition drops were already working. The position itself was shelled. During the three days when we changed, the way back was also -fun-. Repeated remote mining, the route was changed four or five times during the advance to the exit point. All these remote mines started going off. A witty situation - already when we reached the exit point, an armored personnel carrier of friendly units passed by us. Apparently, the enemy decided to inflict fire damage on it. But this was a very bad decision for us - they wanted to -nightmare- the -beha- with an 82 mm mortar. It is not very effective against armored vehicles. Another thing is that we were walking along this road at that moment. Mine landed literally eight meters from me. But I was walking in the center of the formation, and the fighter who was walking first was probably two or three meters away from him. We were saved by the fact that there were tracks rolled by armored vehicles, it was winter and everything froze. We moved with a night vision device. They saw the flash and how the exit from the mortar takes place. At that moment, a nightlight dazzled. We turn our heads in that direction, we hear that it is starting to whistle. I give the command: -Lie down!- Foreigners understood this command. Because if I fall, everyone falls. Well, we just fall into this rut. I had an easy view from the track, I saw this mine land. On the one hand, it is scary, on the other hand, it is very beautiful. To see how the mine breaks, and on the ice such sparks go. The warrior who went first, to whom the closest distance was, runs to me and says: -Sir, my seals were knocked out by the shock wave.- I'm like, -Dude, let's get the hell out of here!- I'll send you to the hospital later, you'll get new ones.- — Anastasia -Acid-: I was already five to six months pregnant. And I just went on vacation and did not know that he went to war. I'm reading a message in the group: -Kenobi 300- and another guy. And then they convey that maybe -200-. And I am like that&#8230; (sigh - ed.). — Ian -Kenobi-: I didn't run much back then. I was more carried back&#8230; At the moment when the boys were pulling out, I thought more about the fact that the child would remain without me. This was really the most stressful for me at that moment (at this moment in the story, the son of Jan and Nastya, who was sleeping peacefully in the cradle, woke up and cried - ed.). — Anastasia -Acid-: I will say yes&#8230; I talked about this (injury - author) with him for a long time afterwards. — Ian -Kenobi-: A long time! That's it, don't cry! (cradles the baby - ed.). I'm around now. To be honest, the very first month of my son's life is very similar to being on duty at the command post. It's the same: you don't sleep, there's no time to eat, there's no time to take care of your personal affairs, even to wash yourself. Constantly screams, wants something from you, you can't understand what. Very similar work in the legion with foreigners, and just being on duty at the command post (smiles - author). — How many wounds did you have while repelling a large-scale invasion? — Ian -Kenobi-: Nastya has one wound and a hell of a lot of other injuries. — Anastasia -Acid-: Five concussions. - Ian -Kenobi-: I have three wounds during the period of the large-scale invasion. The extreme was the most serious. Yes, once a year is stable. I hope I can get by this year (smiles - ed.). — Anastasia -Acid-: By the way, when the 152 mm shell arrived, I was already pregnant. I just didn't know that. So the child should be given the status of a participant in hostilities (smiles - ed.). — Ian -Kenobi-: I already have at least three official reasons to resign from the Armed Forces. But I just can't leave the unit. I invested a lot of my energy in him. I literally shed my blood in this unit. And I have no intention of leaving him. — Anastasia -Acid-: We have discussed this more than once. But I saw him at work and I understand that I simply do not have the right and will not deprive Ukraine of a commander like him. And these are not just my words. When he thought he was going to leave the service because of his health, many people from our Bravo company wrote to me that they would not be able to trust anyone else the way they trusted him. Without him, this legion will be different. RS: People have different family photo albums. Yan and Anastasia's photo and video archive will definitely stand out. Life gave them little time for theaters, flowers, ice rinks or romantic walks. But there will be trophy rare weapons and equipment, captured prisoners and personally removed enemy flags in settlements freed from the invaders, shelling, battles and injuries, evacuation from the battlefield. Anastasia has retired from military service, but her soul is always with the Legion. When Yang, an outwardly intelligent, fit, thin young man of average height, enters the unit, many people immediately appear around him. The sincere respect and communication style of experienced, battle-hardened warriors from different countries of the world, often much older in age and stockier in stature, is visible to the naked eye. They are worth a lot and testify to a lot. One can only guess at what price and under what conditions such authority was gained and what an officer is capable of when he has to make a decision or act personally. To the question -What is the Legion for you?- Yan and Anastasia answered in one voice, without thinking: -Family, family-&#8230; You can learn more about the International Defense Legion of Ukraine on the official website https://ildu.mil.gov.ua/ Photo from the archive of Yan and Anastasia Volodymyr Patola for ArmiyaInform	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/14/kohannya-z-pershogo-poglyadu-kenobi-ta-acid-pro-sluzhbu-v-legioni-shhorichni-poranennya-ta-syna-komandyra-v-lyulczi/	2025-02-13T20:24:12-08:00
Changing the approach to combat operations: German machine builders offer ground drones to support t...	The manufacturing company on its official portal positions this line of ground drones as those designed to support the military in dangerous missions, difficult terrain and in adverse weather conditions, ArmiyaInform notes. According to the authors of the Dutch defense website Army Recognition, the Mission Master family of unmanned vehicles is famous for its versatility and state-of-the-art capabilities. These autonomous ground vehicles (A-UGVs) are designed to perform a variety of missions, ranging from reconnaissance and logistical support to medical evacuation, CBRN detection, use as signal relays and fire support. Their modular architecture allows for rapid configuration changes to suit specific mission requirements. Central to their functionality is the autonomy suite PATH, a navigation and operational control system that enables autonomous operation while retaining human oversight of any lethal functions. PATH maintains control over potentially lethal human functions in compliance with safety and ethical standards. This approach ensures that autonomous systems remain a reliable and secure tool in the hands of operators. The Mission Master family consists of three different models, each tailored to specific operational needs. The Mission Master SP is a compact and stealthy platform designed for missions where maneuverability and stealth are required. It is equipped with an electric propulsion system that ensures quiet operation and low visibility, making it ideal for reconnaissance operations or transporting small loads such as sensors and consumables. The minimal noise and environmental friendliness of this model make it irreplaceable in difficult operational scenarios. The Mission Master CXT is built for tougher operations and features a hybrid powertrain. This platform is distinguished by its strength, the ability to transport loads up to 1000 kg and work in extreme conditions. The CXT is suitable for logistics support tasks and can perform short silent operations thanks to its built-in battery system. Such characteristics allow CXT to be used in areas with harsh climatic conditions or difficult terrain. Mission Master XT is optimized for longer missions. With a maximum range of up to 750 km and the ability to overcome water obstacles, the XT offers exceptional autonomy and amphibious capabilities. This model supports the integration of heavy weapons and complex optical systems, which expands its application in combat conditions, increasing situational awareness and firepower. Autonomous UGV Mission Master platforms have already proven themselves as versatile and reliable systems, but their potential continues to grow. It is planned to integrate more complex sensor systems, improve artificial intelligence algorithms to increase autonomy and adaptability, as well as develop new modules that meet specific needs. Increasing energy efficiency and communication capabilities will also be prioritized to make A-UGVs even more practical in operations of varying complexity. The UGV Mission Master demonstrates how modern technologies can effectively combine autonomy, modularity and reliability, providing new opportunities for military and civilian missions, reaching hard-to-reach places.

SZCH, studio -Krylya- and unidentified actors: new cinema from Moscow fakers	In fact, this incident has no corroboration. The filming is done in such a way that it is impossible to identify the place and the actors, and people behave unnaturally, so the video has all the signs of being staged. Even last year, the Center for Countering Disinformation of the NSDC found out the source of such fake videos, which are distributed exclusively by propaganda resources of the Russian Federation. -Krylya studio, which is connected to the Russian Ministry of Defense, is involved in the production of fake videos with allegedly Ukrainian military personnel on the front lines, in the trenches. Contractors related to Novorossiya TV are also working on such videos, and infrastructure acceleration is provided by agencies working with the Russian Federation,- says the head of the CSDP of the NSDC, Lieutenant Andriy Kovalenko. The purpose of such fakes is to discredit and demoralize the Armed Forces of Ukraine, so they should not be trusted.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/14/szch-studiya-krylya-ta-neidentyfikovani-dijovi-osoby-nove-kino-vid-moskovskyh-fejkorobiv/	2025-02-13T20:03:17-08:00
Communal -horror show- at the TOT of Luhansk region: the occupiers brought the city to the state of ...	informs about this the head of Luhansk OVA Artem Lysohor. Instead of looking for missing budgets for repairs, the occupation administration turned to Moscow for help. They are not only asking for funding, but also demanding to send emergency teams - because there are almost no qualified workers left. The reason is simple: due to forced mobilization, Luhansk lost most of its specialists, and now virtually no one can work in the communal sector. Restrictions on freedom of movement are added to infrastructural problems. The occupying forces blocked civilian traffic on the highway between the front-line Rubizhnye and the relatively rear-facing Starobilsk, citing the -security situation.- At the same time, the Russian military themselves continue to use this road without hindrance. Now local residents have to choose an even more dangerous route, which runs close to the battle line. Destruction, chaos and lack of responsibility are the realities of the temporarily occupied Luhansk Region. And while the invaders cover their own failure with loud statements, the city literally sinks into a sewage crisis. As reported by ArmyInform, the temporarily occupied territories of Luhansk continue to plunge into chaos and degradation. The other day it became known about the mysterious death of the head of the occupation administration of Severodonetsk, who was accused by the Russian security forces of creating a criminal group and a number of serious crimes..	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/13/komunalnyj-horror-show-na-tot-luganshhyny-okupanty-dovely-misto-do-stanu-sos/	2025-02-13T11:52:16-08:00
Bloomed and burned: how the soldiers of the Defense Forces turned the enemy -Tulip- into scrap metal	The video of combat work was made public on the brigade's page. Russian self-propelled mortar 2C4 -Tulip- is a formidable weapon that has a caliber of 240 mm and can deliver devastating blows to fortifications. However, this time this -flower- was not able to harm the Ukrainian forces - it was in the field of view of the UAV operators. Thanks to the well-designed plan and the jewelry work of the FPV drones, the -Tulip- burst into flames like a Christmas garland. The lightning strike of the -Voron- fighters did not leave the occupiers a chance to save the equipment - it burned to the ground. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the VORON unmanned systems battalion of the 100th separate mechanized brigade of the -Steel Hundred- installed the Ukrainian flag over by the Tsentralna mine in Toretsk. This mine is the oldest not only in Toretsk, but also in the whole of Donbas and Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/13/rozkvitla-ta-zgorila-yak-bijczi-syl-oborony-peretvoryly-vorozhyj-tyulpan-na-metalobruht/	2025-02-13T11:36:48-08:00

Survived the sniper, survived three aerial bombs and returned to battle - the story of Yuriy Kameny	The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. As a member of the 61st separate mechanized Steppe brigade, Yurii worked his way up from a grenade launcher to the battalion chief sergeant. He fought for the Kherson region, personally provided logistics of ammunition and evacuation of the wounded under mortar fire. In Soledar, he was wounded by a sniper's bullet, but after treatment he returned to the front. -I came back because I have a great responsibility to the soldiers, I have to take care of them. I can't leave mine, they are all heroes for me. They went to war because they understand that if they don't defend their homeland, the enemy will be in their homes and will mock their loved ones,- says Yuriy. In 2024, during the defense of Orlivka and Semenivka in Donetsk region, Kameny sent reinforcement groups to the most difficult areas of defense. During one of the operations, his car was hit by an enemy FPV, but the man remained unharmed. At the beginning of the Kursk operation, Kameny's battalion raised the Ukrainian flag over Souzha. During one of the tasks, the man was injured again. -Three CABs have arrived. Pure luck - I remained alive. Wounded his left hand, put out his eye. Eyesight has worsened. But I take responsibility for my position and again with my boys. We must remember that we are of the Cossack family and our great-grandfathers fought with everyone who entered our land,- emphasizes Yuriy. As reported by ArmyInform, when the combat medic of the -Rubizh- Brigade with the call sign -Sam- decided to go to the front, he had a choice - to stay in a civilian job thanks to -armor- or to defend the country. He chose the second and not only became a combat medic, but also set a unit record for destroying enemy armored vehicles.

Oleksiy has numerous awards, including the -Badge of Honor-, -Military Cross- and -Silver Cross-. Taras Andreychuk is a captain, a BpAK battery commander, and in civilian life he is a judge of one of the Kyiv district courts. He was also awarded the -Exemplary Service-, -Military Cross- and -Silver Cross-. These two examples are just a drop in the sea of ​​stories about how representatives of various professions and social statuses came to the defense of Ukraine. Their stories prove that patriotism and the willingness to defend one's land do not depend on position or status. -I have been in local self-government and state authorities since 1995. And I think that this experience helps,- says Oleksii Kaida. -I got into the army, like most of those who continue to serve. On February 26, 2022, after taking my family out of the city of Kyiv, I went to the military and was called up for military service. As reported by ArmyInform, on the page 32 separate mechanized brigade there was an interesting story about mechanic-driver Vitaly from Vasylkov, who came to the brigade from the Air Force.

Secrets of survival from marine special forces: a first aid kit is always at hand, even underwater	This was reported on the center's page. The combat medic of the 73rd SSO center, -The Spaniard-, said that in their group, all the first-aid kits are located behind on the warbelt, the unloading belt. This location is very convenient, because it does not interfere with the manipulation of the weapon and is always within quick access. If necessary, the fighter can get the first-aid kit himself or his comrade can do it. The first-aid kits are quick-release, and the combat medic of the group deals with their collection. However, before each operation, the composition of the first-aid kit can be adjusted depending on the situation. Usually, medics add more essentials - decompression needles, tamponades, etc. - so that in the event of losing the medical pack, the fighter has a larger supply of aid. Turnstiles are always located in a prominent place - at least four for yourself and a few more for your companions. The most important thing for every fighter is to regularly check his first aid kit: whether the products have lost their airtight packaging, whether something has spoiled, or whether the expiration date has expired. The medic also checks the first-aid kits before each combat mission, but the fighters themselves must control this moment. In some cases, when there is a probability of a large number of wounded, fighters can take two individual first-aid kits with them. One is located on the belt, and the other is in another place. This is done to help the medic and wounded comrades. However, the second first-aid kit is taken only for specific combat tasks. As reported by ArmyInform, in modern combat, where it is often necessary to operate in conditions of limited visibility, a flashlight on a weapon is a critical piece of gear. Operators from the 73rd Naval Special Purpose Center shared their experiences using different types of lights and their importance to operational success.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/13/sekrety-vyzhyvannya-vid-morskyh-speczpryznachencziv-aptechka-zavzhdy-pid-rukoyu-navit-pid-vodoyu/	2025-02-13T10:11:39-08:00
-Tactical crutch- became the last hope of the lame occupant to be saved from the FPV drone	A rather interesting example in this sense was shared on social media by the drones of the 77th separate airmobile Naddniep brigade of the Airborne Assault Troops of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. In the footage they published, you can see a lone Russian occupier limping somewhere on two crutches when he suddenly notices the approach of an FPV drone that has clearly targeted him. At the same time, the Russian invader, of course, did not have any weapons with which he could try to shoot down the quadcopter while in flight, or even more so an electronic warfare device to -silence- it. Realizing that he would not be able to escape or hide either, the Kremlin's -cannon fodder- faced such desperation that he tried to shoot down the FPV drone with one of his -tactical crutches-. You can evaluate the result of this approach on the video. Russian soldier of the Special Needs Forces was treated by an FPV drone of the 77th Airmobile Brigade. The Russian command spares no one. It sends its wounded right across the open area. pic.twitter.com/abUwCFR9Eh — Cloood | (@GloOouD) February 12, 2025 As reported ArmyInform, the Russian invaders tried to hide from the Ukrainian military underground, but the soldiers of the Armed Forces came close to their shelter and threw grenades at the occupants.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/13/taktychna-mylyczya-stala-ostannoyu-nadiyeyu-kulgavogo-okupanta-na-poryatunok-vid-fpv-drona/	2025-02-13T10:03:54-08:00

--Emka- is a rocket, but they break it all the same-: a frank story of a mechanic-driver about milit...	The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. -When I joined the 32nd brigade, they asked if it was interesting to ride on the M113 tracked armored personnel carrier. I agreed,- Vitaly says. At first he was a gunner, and then, after the mechanic was injured, he took his place. -Emka- in control is a rocket. But they break them all the same. There are still no cars that don't break through,- he adds. One of the most vivid episodes shared by Vitaliy took place near Kotlyny. Then his APC was destroyed, but luckily everyone survived. -I'm just leveling up with this -beater- - arrival. The car is full of smoke, everyone is crazy. You feel in your gut that everything. I check myself, my legs are moving - that means I'm alive,- he recalls. After this incident, Vitaliy and his comrades successfully evacuated, although mortar shelling from behind -caught up- with them. Vitaly is the father of two children, and in his civilian life he was a repair mechanic. -I worked at a shoe factory for 15 years. He took care of the technical condition of conveyors and sewing machines. I don't care what nuts to twist,- he says about himself. Now he is the head of REBs and drives American MaxxPro armored vehicles. -The boys were traveling from Pokrovsk, so the FPV with the -zucchini- flew like half a bucket into the lobeshnik. The car flipped over on its side, it is clear that it no longer had controllability, but inside there are all the targets, both mechs and landing gear,- Vitaliy shares his observations about American equipment. In his crew, Vitaly and his gunner-operator are interchangeable professionals. -When I sit in the gunner's seat, I help the infantry to throw out the bags during the landing. I work on the lever of the apparatus, because it is not convenient for me to move. In MilChat, I control the road so as not to drive into p@#$rasiv. Mekhan only steers with the steering wheel, and I tap him on the left shoulder if he needs to turn left,- Vitaliy says about his work in the crew. To be a good mechanic, you need to know your car well. -Don't catch the gav until someone does it, because some people there are used to the fact that fixers have to come from the repair company. No, I went myself, checked the tracks, tightened them properly. So that the machine, as it should be, immediately -jiked- and flew away. This is important,- Vitaly shares his experience. As reported by ArmyInform, war blurs the boundaries between people, changes destinies, destroys and at the same time creates something new. Ian -Kenobi-, commander of the 1st International Legion, and Anastasia, a combat medic, found each other in the midst of hostilities. Their story is one of struggle, loss and a love tempered by war.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/13/emka-raketa-ale-rozbyvayut-vse-odno-vidverta-rozpovid-mehanika-vodiya-pro-vijskovi-budni/	2025-02-13T08:47:50-08:00
NATO Secretary General: We cannot allow Putin to win	He said this at the results of the ministerial meeting in Brussels, the correspondent of ArmiyaInform reports. -All members of the Alliance and Ukraine are united in their desire for peace in Ukraine.

And we end our meetings with a clear sense of purpose, commitment and urgency,- Mark Rutte concluded.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/13/gensek-nato-my-ne-mozhemo-dozvolyty-putinu-peremogty/	2025-02-13T08:38:51-08:00
-Each of our departures brings benefits-: the story of the chief sergeant of the UAV platoon	The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. With the beginning of a full-scale invasion, Nazar joined the territorial defense, although he was not yet eligible for mobilization due to his age. There, he got his first experience with drones, striking enemy shelters. Later, when the commander changed in the unit, many fighters began to transfer to other units. Nazar, knowing about the combat effectiveness of the 128th OGSHBr, decided to transfer there. -I immediately wanted to serve in a combat brigade, but at that time only those with combat experience were hired. I gained the necessary skills in ground defense, and now I work with FPV drones already in the 128th brigade. Our attacks destroy enemy antennas and fortifications, which seriously affects the combat capability of the occupiers,- says Nazar. One of the key aspects of the new service for the military has become adequate command, which not only sets combat tasks, but also helps develop professional skills. -If something doesn't work out, no one here will insult you. On the contrary, they will explain and help correct mistakes. It motivates and gives confidence,- says the fighter. His wife and two sons are waiting for his return in Vinnytsia. The youngest was born already during the war, and the eldest, who is four and a half years old, believes that his father is -fighting zombies.- -It's difficult for him - he sees that dads come to the kindergarten to pick up other children. I communicate with my family via video, but it is no substitute for face-to-face communication. The most difficult thing in this war is separation from family,- the soldier admits. Despite everything, Nazar and his comrades remain on the front lines because they understand that Ukraine's success in the war depends on their work. -Each of our sorties is beneficial - if not destroying the enemy, then at least damaging their logistics. It adds strength.'' As reported by ArmyInform, when the combat medic of the -Rubizh- Brigade with the call sign -Sam- decided to go to the front, he had a choice - to stay in a civilian job thanks to -armor- or to defend the country. He chose the second and not only became a combat medic, but also set a unit record for destroying enemy armored vehicles. On his account includes five destroyed vehicles along with the landing party.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/13/kozhen-nash-vyyizd-prynosyt-koryst-istoriya-golovnogo-serzhanta-vzvodu-bpla/	2025-02-13T08:32:23-08:00

The story of the fighter was made public on the page of the Land Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The warrior went through many hot spots of the war: the defense of Kharkiv, the liberation of the region, battles for Bakhmut, border skirmishes in Sumshchyna. However, the battle in the Zaporozhye direction, near the Chereshnya observation point, is most vividly etched in my memory. That day, Klim spotted an armored infantry vehicle approaching his trench. Five enemy paratroopers were sitting on the armor. He lay in wait, waiting for the right moment. The car stopped five meters away, the paratroopers got out and started moving, unaware of the danger. -As soon as the BMP began to leave, I realized that there would be no machine gun cover. I shot down two or three with a machine gun, they were lying down. Then I threw ``efka'' into the pile. From the fierce, hateful cries, it was clear that I still touched the trio. The guys covered me from behind with machine gun fire and we dealt with him in almost a minute or a half. At that time, the BMP was running at full throttle,- Klim recalled. Before the war, -Klim- lived a peaceful life: he built, repaired shoes, took care of the dacha. -Valery dreams of taking up his favorite work again, leaving the war in the past.

-Shelters- failed: the drones of the Iron Brigade found an enemy tank and deleted it from the game	The video of combat work was made public on the brigade's page. At the forefront of today's chronicle is the Crazy Cats group of the rifle battalion. Their FPV drones sent the enemy into the scrap -Ural- with frontal strikes, destroyed the antenna complex and blew up the mortar. Border guards are not far behind: kamikaze drones destroy a grader engaged for engineering work and a 122-mm D-30 howitzer. Each such blow not only reduces the enemy's potential, but also brings victory closer. But the real gem of this combat selection is the work of the Flint crew from the Control and Artillery Reconnaissance Battery (BUAR). They managed to find and destroy a carefully camouflaged tank. A powerful charge turned the occupants' armored car into a pile of scrap metal. The 3rd Tank Iron Brigade does not give the enemy a chance. Ukrainian soldiers continue their journey, breaking the occupation hydra to pieces. And this is just the beginning. As reported by ArmyInform, on the front lines drones of the 3rd separate tank brigade continue to write their explosive chronicle, destroying enemy with filigree precision. While the occupiers are trying to hide in houses and forests, Ukrainian UAV operators are turning these places into bonfires.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/13/hovanky-ne-vdalysya-dronari-zaliznoyi-brygady-znajshly-vorozhyj-tank-i-vykreslyly-jogo-z-gry/	2025-02-13T06:06:11-08:00

A video of the elimination of invaders was shared on social networks by 60 separate mechanized Ingulets brigade. It shows two Russian soldiers going down to an underground shelter among the ruins of one of the settlements destroyed by the Soviet Union, after which they mask the entrance with some kind of garbage.

As reported by ArmyInform, an attempt to break through a convoy of enemy armored vehicles to Ukrainian positions turned into a disaster for the USSR.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/13/ne-zalyshyvshy-shansiv-bijczi-zsu-pidibralysya-vprytul-do-shovanky-rosiyan-ta-zakydaly-yih-granatamy/	2025-02-13T05:43:10-08:00
From the keyboard to the gun: how the Aitivite -Apostol- became a threat to the Russian invaders	The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. Mykhailo served in the army in 2018-2019, and after the full-scale Russian invasion, he took up arms again. Having an officer rank after the military department, he was trained as a platoon leader, and later became an artilleryman. Since the spring of 2023, Mykhailo has been serving in the 58th motorized infantry brigade, where he first worked with the Soviet D-20 guns, and then mastered the British AS-90 self-propelled gun. -I saw the world a little, because we were taught in Great Britain, at the Royal School of Artillery,- Mykhailo says. — The Allies wanted us to be versatile, able to work both as mechanics-drivers and as gunners, to know the basics of repairing equipment. This helped a lot in a real combat environment. Because there were times when up to 100 shells were fired a day. British guns are more accurate, easier to aim, a lot of automation.- Thanks to the work of -Apostol- and its brothers, enemy columns, Russian tanks and other armored vehicles were hit, enemy positions and manpower were destroyed. The range of ammunition for British guns allows for a wide range of combat missions. -In addition to destroying identified targets on command, our main task is to protect the infantry. Do not let the enemy get close to our brothers. Only the drones see the advance of the enemy or the assault, we open fire to eliminate the invaders while they are on the way. That's how we worked at one time near Urozhany, and then near Prechistivka, in Donbas,- says the officer. At home, Mykhailo's parents and sister are waiting. After the war, he dreams of returning to a peaceful profession and starting a family. But it will be after the victory, when the guns die down. As reported by ArmyInform, on the front line, where every day there is a fierce struggle for every meter of Ukrainian land, fighters of the 21st separate mechanized brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine use unexpected weapons against modern enemies drones - Maksym machine gun, developed back in the 19th century.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/13/vid-klaviatury-do-garmaty-yak-ajtishnyk-apostol-stav-grozoyu-rosijskyh-okupantiv/	2025-02-13T05:32:04-08:00

Fighters, who are called -bombers- on the front lines, demonstrated the filigree operation of attack drones. The occupiers were simply knocked out of their hiding places: FPV drones methodically hit dugouts, trenches and even so-called foxholes - small earthen shelters where the enemy tried to wait out the attacks. However, it was not possible to wait - Ukrainian drones found everyone. The footage released by the military shows Russian fortifications turning into fire traps. The occupiers tried to hide, but they could not escape from the highly accurate Ukrainian -bird-. Each blow is minus one enemy position, minus the next plans of the Russian command and minus the cannon fodder that the Kremlin drives to the front. -This is just another working day for our team. We are methodically clearing the Ukrainian land from invaders,- the stormtroopers comment on their work. As reported by ArmyInform, a column of Russian armored vehicles with an amphibious assault tried to break through to Ukrainian positions, but this attempt turned into a catastrophe for the invaders. to a real disaster.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/13/vykuryly-z-nir-yak-drony-kyyivskoyi-brygady-prygostyly-okupantiv-garyachenkym/	2025-02-13T05:14:00-08:00

Ukrainian veteran won bronze at the Invincible Games in skeleton	This is reported by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Ilya Hayduk covered the distance in 32.67 seconds, demonstrating great skill and strength of spirit. This victory is especially important, because Ilya is a military man who, despite being wounded, found the strength to move on and achieve success in sports. Ilya Hayduk is a 34-year-old serviceman of the 36th Brigade. Before the war, he served in the police and took the Murphy test every year. During a full-scale invasion, he transferred to the Armed Forces, where he was assigned to a company of strike unmanned aerial systems. In November 2023, while performing a combat mission in the Zaporizhzhia region, he was wounded and lost his leg. At the Invincible Games, Ilya again felt lightness and enjoyment of life. Loves adrenaline and believes that the veteran community is very important for an active post-war life. Skeleton is a sport most likely invented by the British military in the late 19th century. This is a sled race, when athletes move along the track head first, maneuvering between turns. Participants must overcome not only the distance, but also their own fear. This year, the skeleton is featured for the first time at the Invincible Games. We are proud of Ilya Hayduk and all Ukrainian military and veterans who, despite being wounded, found the strength to move on! As ArmiyaInform reported, a skeleton was presented for the first time at the Invincible Games 2025, and Ukrainian veterans and military could not miss this opportunity. Our national team made its debut in this sport, showing exceptional results.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/13/ukrayinskyj-veteran-zdobuv-bronzu-na-igrah-neskorenyh-u-skeletoni/	2025-02-13T04:44:04-08:00
Three days in hell on the Dnipro: the confession of a combat medic -Cossack- about an extremely diff...	The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. -I never thought that I would have to crawl over corpses, that I would have another person's brains on my beard, that all my armor would be covered in blood,- says -Cossack.- His words are not just scary details, but the reality of the war that Ukrainian defenders face. The operation on the island was a turning point for him. He already had combat experience - he served as a senior medic of a mortar battery, provided assistance to units' fighters, and detected enemy equipment. But what he experienced on the left bank of the Dnieper was beyond anything that could be imagined. Since the beginning of the assault, the enemy has destroyed up to 20 of his fighters, but Ukrainian units have also suffered losses. The wounded were taken to the island, which quickly became a priority target for the occupiers. At night, the Russians started a massive fire, turning a small patch of land into an inferno. -You're walking through the swamp, debris is flying at you, you're covered in blood, you don't even count the contusions- Among the wounded is a boy who has no life left. In the abdominal cavity there are fragments with which I cut my fingers to the bone, trying to stop his bleeding,- recalls -Cossack-. At a critical moment, it is important not only to save, but also to manage chaos. -Cossack- remembers how he shouted at the wounded and shocked soldiers, forcing them to act. It was the only way to survive. One of the most difficult tasks was to find and extract a wounded comrade nicknamed -Psycho-. When he was being pulled out, another flight happened. -I pressed myself against him, and then I realized that I had his brains on my beard- - recalls the fighter. The -psycho- survived, but when he regained consciousness, he tried to tear off the breathing tube. Then -Cossack- had to tape his hands. Later, in the hospital, he apologized to his friend, although he probably owed him his life. After the evacuation of the wounded and a series of logistical operations, it was time for the -Cossack- itself to leave the island. He remembers that moment with trepidation: -When I stepped on the asphalt of the right bank with my bare feet, I felt such relief that words cannot express it.- Today, -Cossack- not only continues to serve, but also transfers his experience to young fighters. His main rule is to train every day, challenge yourself and never stop. This is how the legendary marines who are making history right now are hardened. As reported by ArmyInform, a junior sergeant with the call sign -Katran- is an example of dedication and professionalism in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. holds the position of commander of the guard company branch of the 15th separate marine support regiment of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/13/try-dni-v-pekli-na-dnipri-spovid-bojovogo-medyka-kozaka-pro-nadskladnu-operacziyu/	2025-02-13T04:37:55-08:00

The Ministry of Defense codified new robotic complexes -Spextr- for the Armed Forces	informs about this Ministry of Defense of Ukraine with reference to the Main Directorate for Life Cycle Support of Weapons and Military Equipment. NRK Spectr is a universal unmanned platform designed to perform a wide range of tasks in combat conditions. These NRK overcome off-road, difficult terrain. Remotely controlled robots make it safer and easier for the military to work where it is important to reduce human risks. Depending on the equipment and attached equipment, the NRK perform tasks of observation, transportation of ammunition, rear property, and others. In a separate configuration, they can perform the task of destroying the enemy by fire. Spextr robots have compact dimensions that make them easy to transport in the body of a minibus or pickup truck. Spectr are equipped with a silent electric motor. The battery charge is enough for several hours of continuous operation. We remind the producers of anti-aircraft weapons that useful information on the codification procedure of new samples of weapons and military equipment can be found here.

- Barrels are also timeless - the Armed Forces explained why the occupiers began to use artillery le...	Major Viktor Tregubov, the spokesman of the Khortytsia operational-strategic group of troops, told about this on the air of the Yedyny Novyni telethon. -Fighting continues near Toretsk, as before. The problem is that we report on the results of battles when there is already a certain consolidation and a certain stabilization of the line on which it is happening. We can say something only when we are already convinced that there is confirmation,- he assured. According to him, the enemy has not changed the intensity of the use of armored vehicles. -If we talk about equipment in other directions, its use is reduced not so much because of weather conditions. The earth was already frozen. The point is rather that it was limited by the use of FPV drones, it was limited by the effective countermeasures of Ukrainian locations. Therefore, we do not observe any serious increase in the use of heavy equipment,- he explained. Viktor Tregubov said that the occupiers cross the Oskil River in small groups that can fit in a boat. -They move as much as a normal rubber boat can fit. They are also crossed by small watercraft. As long as the river does not freeze over, they can only do so. Therefore, they are limited by the number of seats in those plazas that are directly there,- he noted. Also, the spokesman of the -Khortytsia- OSUV said that the Russian troops began to use artillery less in certain directions. -Where there are certain supply problems, there are fewer of them. Supply problems also create strikes by Ukrainian forces. This is no longer our area of ​​responsibility, but when their warehouses begin to blow up or even explode something on the territory of the Russian Federation, it negatively affects the supply of ammunition. Trunks are also eternal,- he summarized. As reported by ArmyInform, the enemy has recently been trying to look for weak spots in our defense in the Novopavlov direction. Attack mainly in small infantry groups. In addition, the weather makes it possible for both Ukrainian and enemy unmanned systems to work.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/13/stvoly-tezh-ne-vichni-okupanty-pochaly-menshe-vykorystovuvaty-artyleriyu/	2025-02-13T03:13:06-08:00

As noted, the detainee was an accomplice of previously detained FSB agents who were planning to blow up the police outfit. -The perpetrator turned out to be a 16-year-old local resident who was recruited by a Russian special agent on the Telegram channel. According to his instructions, the girl independently made explosives, to one of which she connected a mobile phone for remote activation. Then she hid them in a cache, and reset the geolocation to the Russian curator. Subsequently, following these coordinates, two terrorists took the SVP and tried to blow up the Ukrainian law enforcement officers. After the warning of the terrorist attack, the person involved -lay down at the bottom-, hiding at the addresses of her relatives,- the report says. However, despite all these preventive measures, the counter-intelligence of the SBU established her whereabouts and detained her. -It was established that when the suspect was hiding from justice, she received additional orders from the Russian Federation for the production of new SVPs. During searches of the detainee's residence, components for explosives, -replaceable- SIM cards for conspiracy and a mobile phone with evidence of crimes were seized. So far, the SBU investigators have informed her about the suspicion for h. 2 Art. 15, ch. 2 Art. 258 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (completed attempt to commit a terrorist act based on a prior conspiracy by a group of persons). The perpetrator is in custody. She faces up to 12 years in prison,- the special service added.

According to the state secretary of the department, Nikita Nikitenko, -implementation of this project will allow to reduce budget costs and ensure the needs of the army in material means-, since currently in the warehouses of military units there are more than 6 thousand tons of used tires that need disposal, which costs -from 200 to 400 thousand hryvnias for 1000 tons.- -Accordingly, at the level of the Ministry, it was considered expedient to build our own processing line. This will make it possible to reduce costs and provide the repair units of the Armed Forces with their own products. For example, with rubber mats. If the military needs are fully met, it will be possible to consider the production of products for Ukrainian road enterprises and construction companies,- explained the head of the Office for Alienation and Disposal of Surplus Military Property, Colonel Oleg Koval. He also added that for the creation of the line, they have already purchased the appropriate domestic equipment, which is being installed on the territory of one of the military units under the direct control of the Ministry of Defense. In particular, it will allow processing 1,000 tons of secondary raw materials per year and produce finished products worth 1.2 million hryvnias per month, and taking into account the savings in disposal costs, the annual economic effect of the operation of the line will amount to 15 million hryvnias. -The line is already 80% installed. It is expected that the commissioning works will be completed in the near future, and the line will reach its design capacity in March,- said Oleg Koval.

Estonian Defense Minister: Europe must be part of the negotiations, otherwise peace will not last lo...	This was stated by the Minister of Defense of Estonia, Hanno Pevkur, at a press briefing in Brussels, ArmiyaInform correspondent reports. -Europe should be part of the negotiations. This is for sure. Because Europe has imposed sanctions on Russia, Europe is investing in the defense of Ukraine and Europe is rebuilding Ukraine through EU money and bilateral aid. Otherwise, this peace will not last long, it will not be the way we would like to see it,- said Hanno Pevkur. He added that Ukraine wants to be a member of the European Union, and therefore this is another additional reason why Europe should be part of these negotiations. -There will be no peace without Ukraine. It is Ukraine that should say when they are ready for negotiations, when the conditions will be set. It cannot be that someone will come and say when the negotiations will begin,- the Estonian minister added. As ArmiyaInform reported, US Defense Minister Pete Hegseth denied that the latest statements of the White House and the Donald Trump administration regarding negotiations with the Russian Federation are a betrayal of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/13/ministr-oborony-estoniyi-yevropa-maye-buty-chastynoyu-peregovoriv-inakshe-myr-ne-tryvatyme-dovgo/	2025-02-13T01:02:08-08:00

He said this while answering journalists' questions in Brussels, ArmiyaInform reports. -These are your words, not mine. Of course, this is not cheating. There is no betrayal, there is recognition that the whole world and the US are invested in peace, in negotiated peace. As President Trump said, the bloodshed must stop. It requires recognition on both sides that they want it,- said Pete Hegseth. The head of the Pentagon added that his task is to -talk realistically- about what is happening in Russia's war against Ukraine. He added that Russian aggression against Ukraine showed that NATO must change and become stronger. Also, Pete Hegseth reminded that the USA provided the most aid to Ukraine, giving the amount of 300 billion dollars. -That's why President Trump called for increased defense spending. For Europe, Russian aggression is a clear threat signal. The US actively participates in the defense of the Alliance and will continue to do so,- the head of the Pentagon said. As ArmiyaInform reported, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said that Ukraine should be in the strongest position at the time of the start of any negotiations on the end of the war, and the Allies should make maximum efforts for this.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/13/glava-pentagonu-zaperechyv-shho-peregovory-ssha-ta-rosiyi-ye-zradoyu-ukrayiny/	2025-02-13T00:45:57-08:00

How to destroy an enemy mortar attack with three shots: a master class from the commander of the sel...	Is it possible to hit an enemy tank with a 2C1 self-propelled gun? But who are the main targets for our gunners today? The military man told our correspondent about this: -Now, as in 2015, I work for the 2C1 Gvozdika self-propelled guns.- In 2022, he even got into the same battery he was in during the anti-terrorist operation. 2С1 is a Soviet self-propelled artillery system of 122 caliber. In principle, it is quite accurate, considering that there are now drones that provide the ability to adjust fire. This ACS shows itself well. If the ammunition is normal, you can even hit the target area with the third shot. The system is effective for destroying manpower, mortars, lightly armored targets. We mainly work on infantry, enemy mortars. All guidance in Soviet systems is the same, if you once learned, then everything there is more or less similar, you will be able to work on 2C1 as well. Of course, there are nuances. But, in principle, every weapon, every artillery system likes to be serviced after a certain number of shots. -Clove-, in my opinion, is more reliable. It can be compared with a Kalashnikov assault rifle, because it is also not very picky. &#8230;I can remember how we recently destroyed an enemy mortar. We received the command -to battle-. They set up, we aimed, fired. It so happened that we hit this enemy mortar with several shots. It seems somewhere in the three, and that's a very good result. We then destroyed the mortar, the ammunition and the Russians included in the calculation. In fact, the precision of our work is the result of efforts not only of our calculation. Because we are only one of the final chains of this process. It is very important who corrects us. These are our UAV operators. Then they quickly detected this mortar, gave the coordinates. So if everyone did their job well, then the result is good. By the way, if we compare with 2014-15, then there were not so many drones. And there was no such precision. Then we worked harder to cover the defined plane. Now due to the technologies that have moved forward, a bet is placed on accuracy. There were other episodes with hits. If we recall Mykolaiv Oblast and Kherson Oblast in 2022, there was even a time when a tank was hit. Now the enemy does not have so much equipment. And then there was, and they simply dug it in from landings: BMP, tanks. And they didn't worry about them that much. We could hit a buried BMP in the landing, and then the next day the enemy would bury another one next to it. And it turns out that there is one burnt one, and a new one is already in the hood next to it. Now they don't have such stocks of equipment anymore, they are saving. Therefore, our main targets now are infantry, mortars. &#8230;The commander of Maksym told our correspondent about the case when the calculation of his subordinate hit a moving enemy BMP. The commander added that Maxim has a lot of experience as an artilleryman: he has more than two thousand shots under his belt.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/13/yak-znyshhyty-minometnyj-rozrahunok-voroga-z-troh-postriliv-majsterklas-vid-komandyra-sau-gvozdyka/	2025-02-12T20:57:59-08:00
Battalion -Predators of height-: reconnaissance at 50 km, night bombers and records of defeating the...	What is the secret of success of this battalion, due to which it is possible to destroy Russian targets, what is the daily record for defeating enemy attack aircraft, about the specifics of combat missions and the specifics of the operation of the unmanned aviation component, which bombers is the enemy most afraid of and whether the invisibility cloaks save the occupiers near Pokrovsk, the commander of the -Predators of Heights- battalion, Major Maxim with the call sign, told ArmyInform -Condor-. Maxim from Vinnytsia, a teacher by education. Since 2016, he has been serving in the 59th brigade, he joined the unit as an ordinary soldier. Sociable and charismatic commander. He graduated from the leadership course at the National Academy of Ground Forces in Lviv and received the rank of officer. Since the beginning of the large-scale invasion of the Russian Federation, the brigade repelled the offensive of the occupiers in the south of Ukraine. In August 2022, he headed the first infantry battalion of the brigade, which he had formed before that. He has a huge experience in the destruction of rasches in Kherson region, Luhansk region, and now also in Donetsk region. Since September of last year, the command of the brigade offered to lead the battalion of unmanned systems -Predators of Heights-. The performance indicators of this unit are simply amazing. -In the Armed Forces of Ukraine, a rating is conducted on the impact of Russian manpower, military equipment and other enemy targets. This is what specifically applies to UAV damage. Points are awarded there for all destroyed (hit) Russian targets. These points can then be exchanged for different weapons. In addition, it is a good indicator of the work of the units of the Armed Forces. It is not for nothing that for the fourth month in a row, our brigade has taken the leading position in this rating in terms of the number of enemy personnel affected. In January alone, our military eliminated 2,667 occupiers, of which 1,230 were irreparable losses, and 1,437 were wounded. As for the combat work of the -Height Predators- battalion, the numbers of destruction (damage) of various enemy targets speak for themselves. So, about the statistics from January 1, 2024 to February 1, 2025. This is the current data, see for yourself - hit/destroyed: Figures are constantly updated, they can be viewed on the website of the battalion. We like to be tops, this is our job, we stop and destroy the enemy. We go to the command post of the battalion of unmanned systems -Predators of Heights-. The point itself consists of several rooms, workplaces are equipped with large monitors with computers and tablets. There are live video broadcasts from different areas of the line of battle and the depth of the enemy formations. Enhanced aerial reconnaissance is conducted by various reconnaissance UAVs for enemy activity. Absolutely all information about the movement of Russian troops, for example, small assault groups on the front line and the identified targets of the Rashists: shelters, fortifications, KSP, field warehouses, placement of enemy equipment, flows here. Those on duty accumulate all the information and report to the command. Hot targets are identified that must be destroyed immediately. Then the coordinates are transmitted to the attack drone units. The -Altitude Predators- unmanned systems battalion combines two components: the use of unmanned aerial systems and ground robotic systems. This makes it possible to increase the effectiveness of combat missions and preserve the lives of personnel. UAV units carry out aerial reconnaissance and attack the enemy. In terms of reconnaissance functions, there are various UAVs that are engaged in this. These are primarily -Maviks- and -wings- of various ranges. What are our intelligence capabilities? We can close a lane from zero to 50 km deep into enemy territory. If desired, even a little more. That is, different UAVs for different flight ranges. We fly up to 5 km on Maviks, if we need 10 km, we use Autels and the same Maviks, only with a paired battery. If we need to work even further and the weather allows us, we use different types of -wings-. There are -wings- that can fly up to 15 km, and there are those that can fly up to 50 km and even further. The complex application of various reconnaissance UAVs gives a complete picture of informing about the actions of the enemy in our area of ​​responsibility. With up-to-date streams, we can react quickly and destroy the targets of the raiders. We -unwind- the Russians with attack drones of various types with different combat capabilities. These are FPV drones that work as kamikaze drones and drop drones, Maviks with a warhead, heavy large bombers such as Nemesis and Vampires plus shock -wings-. According to the reaction of the Rashists, the enemy is most afraid of large bombers such as Nemesis and -Vampires-. With these bombers, we can effectively destroy enemy equipment up to 20 km or more. Bomber drones can drop different types of munitions on the enemy: thermobaric, cumulative and high-explosive munitions to effectively hit different types of targets. Just last night, our Nemesis and Vampire calculations were hit by two Russian 152mm self-propelled artillery pieces. At the same time, the Russian equipment was on the move, moving quite quickly. They were hit while moving, the equipment stopped and it was already finished on the spot. On the same night, it was also possible to burn a tank and three enemy cars, one of the cars was destroyed on the move. The distance to the enemy targets was approximately 12-15 km from the contact line. The drones struck and returned successfully. Our tactics are simple: we find a target, determine its priority, think about which drones to destroy faster and more efficiently, and take off. There are goals that are nearby and need to be worked on immediately. Depending on the distance, features of the terrain, weather conditions and the goals themselves, we mostly use FPV drones. If the target, such as a stationary one, is far from the front and is well camouflaged, we use other strike UAVs. It is not always possible to destroy equipment with -fpvishkas-, then more powerful means of destruction are needed. If targets are detected at a distance of 50 km or more, then we transmit the coordinates to neighboring units equipped with HIMARS. Recently, our -wing- 35 km from the front line detected the calculation of an enemy UAV, perhaps it was an Orlan-10 complex or a Supercam. The location coordinates were quickly reset and the HIMARS calculation did its job. Our brigade has been carrying out combat missions in the Donetsk direction since November 2022. In principle, here the enemy constantly tried to act actively. Now, already here in the Pokrovsky direction, he continues offensive actions with the involvement of a very large number of infantry. Involves heavy machinery when possible, but very rarely lately. And it is mostly non-armored vehicles: motorcycles, buggies, pickups, UAZs and -loaves-. Large armor can be seen far away, it can be heard, it can be detected faster and, accordingly, there is more time for its damage. But these are quiet and small machines, they are used en masse. They are not particularly visible, they are more mobile and maneuverable. And rashists often use this easy technique just in one direction. The assault group arrived, disembarked and left the car there. Combat work to detect and destroy enemy assault groups is very energy-intensive and intensive. There are a lot of stormtroopers coming from different directions, so all of them must be identified and destroyed. So that you understand, we had such difficult days when, in just one day, we destroyed more than 100 Russian soldiers who were advancing near Pokrovsk with the means of destruction of the -Predators of the Heights- battalion. Rashists were killed with FPV drones, Maviks and other drones. About 80 Rashists were dying on the spot from our blows, others were bleeding for some time. The absolute record of -Predators of the Heights- for a day for the destruction of enemy manpower was at the end of November at the beginning of December. Then 117 raschits lay forever in the Ukrainian soil. In general, if you take the means of destruction of the entire 59th brigade: it is infantry, tanks, artillery plus our battalion, then usually during one day it is possible to destroy more than 200 invaders. Enemy assaults do not stop for a single day. If once stormtroopers moved along forest plantations, attacked key intersections, now they go straight across the field in groups of 8-10. The enemy also learns and understands what points in the area are being scouted, so he tries to act more cunningly and bypass them. Especially often they move in the fog or in the morning, after a while large groups break up into several people and want to bypass our infantry positions. Do not come into fire contact, expecting that new forces will come up and it will be possible to take our infantry into the encirclement. Of course, we will not let the enemy do this. The main thing is to detect the movement of assault groups in time, then drone calculations are connected and inflict damage on the enemy. Infantry units of the Russian Federation are being depleted very quickly, new ones are coming. And so we work monotonously every day. Assault teams have now begun to use anti-thermal imaging cloaks or invisibility cloaks. Let's put it this way, they give a certain effect. When the weather is not very good, the raschits are not so far visible, but they can still be seen by their characteristic features. For example, kamikaze raiders walk across the field at night, hear our drone flying somewhere, immediately lie down on the ground, completely cover themselves with these cloaks, do not move and think that no one has -besieged- them. A few nights ago, our calculations of fpvish, Maviks, Vampires and Nemesis dismantled 30 of these stormtroopers in a 1 km area. Vampire and Nemesis heavy bomber drones are formidable and effective weapons. There are, of course, certain differences between them in combat capabilities and characteristics. These are means of different damage ranges. If the -Vampire- works up to 10 km, then the Nemesis up to 20 km and more. -Vampire- covers a distance of up to 10 km in 23 minutes with a 10 kg reset weight. If it is necessary to carry a warhead over a long distance, then a slightly smaller ammunition is attached to it. In good weather, we can hit equipment and other enemy targets at a distance of up to 30 km. These two bomber drones are particularly effective at night. It is not for nothing that the Katsaps set up observation mobile guard posts in places of deployment, for example, armored vehicles or warehouses with ammunition. These posts at night are supposed to neutralize heavy bombers so that they do not reach their targets. Similar to how our mobile fire groups work on -Shahedam-. Rashists usually use small arms. -Baba Yaga-, as the occupiers call them, is quite noisy at work, so it can be heard from afar. At the front, the enemy constantly uses EW means. Starting from tiny devices in the backpacks of Russian attack aircraft and ending with operational-level EWs located at a depth of 20-30 km from the front edge. Work on their detection is carried out around the clock. We make special maps with the routes of the location of EWs of the occupiers, bypass in the air the zones of their radius of action. Ideally, we find and destroy these means, because they affect the operation of our drones. The enemy is improving and every time it is more difficult to fight the enemy. But we are also developing strongly, we are looking for new ways and methods of combating the EW means of the Russians. In different directions, the enemy uses different means of countering the work of our reconnaissance and strike drones. For example, when we were defending in Krasnohorivka, the Rashists tried to block with their -maviks-. They just dropped an ordinary fishing net on our bomber, then the blades spin and it falls to the ground. I once remember a case when the enemy dropped a net on the -Vampire- a little unsuccessfully, but then the drone's blades did not stop, it successfully hit the target and turned back. FPV drones with thermal imaging are often used to attack our bombers. As this happens, enemy infantrymen report that they have been detected and hear the operation of a Ukrainian bomber drone. Immediately, an enemy -fpvishka- flies out, which should already find and hit our drone. But, usually, when it arrives, the rockets are destroyed and the bomber is no longer in place. Even with a light -Mavik- they went for a battering ram, but nothing came out of them. Our pilots skillfully maneuvered and got out of the attack. From my own experience and combat experience, I can say that the most skilled UAV pilots of various types are our infantrymen who performed combat missions on the front line. We have a lot of guys who have been drafted into the army since 2014 and those who have participated in assault operations since the first days of the large-scale invasion. These are people from different regions of Ukraine, teachers, businessmen, IT specialists, people of other peaceful professions. The guys are united by a single goal - to destroy the enemy and drive them out of our land. Someone was transferred to the -Height Predators- battalion due to their health, someone of their own volition, someone was recently called up for mobilization. No one is better at piloting a drone than a person who understands what it's like to be an infantryman in the trenches and how difficult it is to be there and perform tasks under enemy fire. The infantryman-pilot perfectly understands how to do so in order to save his comrades in -SPeshki- when they are attacked by the invaders. He understands the enemy, how he will act. Of course, anyone can become a strong drone operator, the main thing is the desire to learn.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/13/bataljon-hyzhaky-vysot-rozvidka-na-50-km-nichni-bombery-ta-rekordy-urazhennya-voroga-pid-pokrovskom/	2025-02-12T20:44:20-08:00
New military aid and tough statements by the Pentagon: what Ramstein was like for Ukraine in Brussel...	This meeting was expected primarily because of the arrival of the new head of the Pentagon, who was supposed to outline the future attitude of the US to this format and to the provision of security assistance to Ukraine in general. What agreements did yesterday's meeting bring and whether the format of -Ramstein- will change - read more in the material of the correspondent of ArmiyaInform. Unlike most previous Ramsteins, which took place at a German airbase, yesterday's meeting took place at NATO headquarters. It was decided to combine it with the ministerial meeting of the Alliance in the Belgian capital. Another peculiarity was the presiding of Great Britain — for the first time in almost three years, Rammstein was not presided over by the United States. According to interlocutors in Brussels, London itself initiated such a decision due to the arrival of the new administration of US President Donald Trump and the related uncertainty regarding the future fate of this format. And it was Britain that announced the largest aid package at the end of the meeting. It should also be recalled that the previous -Ramstein- was only a month ago and yesterday's meeting was primarily not about new aid packages, but about coordinating work in the future. The new head of the Pentagon, Pete Gegset, saw with his own eyes how Rammstein works, heard about the needs of the Ukrainian army and for the first time met with the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Rustem Umyerov. Pete Hegseth also spoke at the beginning of Rammstein with a statement that contained a number of harsh messages and caused a heated debate. The main message of the head of the Pentagon was unequivocal — European allies should increase defense spending and share the financial burden of assistance both in supporting Ukraine and in ensuring their defense capability. -We call on your countries and your citizens to redouble their efforts and reaffirm their commitment not only to Ukraine's immediate security needs, but also to Europe's long-term defense and deterrence goals,- Pete Hegseth told his NATO colleagues. The US is the largest donor of military aid to Ukraine, but other NATO countries have actually already seriously increased their spending. In 2024, NATO members in Europe and Canada invested $485 billion in defense, which is almost 20% more than in 2023. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte supported the US demands, saying that last year Canada and European allies provided more than 50% of the total amount of aid to Ukraine. -And I fully agree with President Trump and his team that this is the only sensible way forward. Of course, there will undoubtedly be debates regarding the issue of future support for Ukraine, who will pay for it, where it will come from, etc. But there is also an agreement between all members of the Alliance that Ukraine should have all the necessary military assistance, so that whenever peace negotiations start, it can conduct them from a position of strength,- he explained. Potential peace talks were another point in Pete Hegseth's speech. -Like you, we want a sovereign and prosperous Ukraine. But we must start by realizing that returning to the borders of Ukraine by 2014 is an unrealistic goal. The pursuit of this illusory goal will only prolong the war and cause more suffering,- he said. The head of the Pentagon believes that it is possible to achieve an end to the war only by combining -allied forces with a realistic assessment- of the situation on the battlefield. In his opinion, lasting peace for Ukraine should include reliable security guarantees to prevent the recurrence of war. But how to get these guarantees from the Kremlin, the US Defense Minister did not explain. He also said that the United States does not consider NATO membership for Ukraine to be a realistic outcome of a negotiated settlement. However, not all allies share the US position on this point. Danish Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen disagreed with the US position expressed at Ramstein. -We have decided to offer Ukraine membership in NATO, but it is also clear that for this we must all agree. So we can say that there is a discussion going on now about what future awaits Ukraine,- he said on the sidelines after -Ramstein-. Defense Minister of Ukraine Rustem Umyerov emphasized that Kyiv is not going to abandon the path of European and Euro-Atlantic integration. -Our position is unchanged: we want to be a NATO country, we will be a NATO country, we will be an EU country,- he said in a conversation with journalists in Brussels. However, this -Ramstein- was distinguished not only by harsh statements of the USA, but also provided Ukraine with new packages of military aid from a number of countries. Great Britain hands over 150 million pounds worth of weapons and equipment: thousands of drones, dozens of battle tanks and armored vehicles, as well as air defense systems. Britain plans to provide Ukraine with more than 10,000 drones during the year, and by the end of spring it will deliver more than 50 armored vehicles, including modernized T-72 tanks. Germany will soon hand over to Ukraine about 100 missiles for the IRIS-T anti-aircraft missile complex, which will help strengthen the protection of Ukrainian infrastructure against Russian air threats. The Netherlands is handing over 25 armored tracked vehicles to the YPR, which will be used to transport the wounded. In total, the country has allocated more than 10 billion euros in military aid to Ukraine, of which approximately 6 billion euros have been implemented. -We have to continue our support, especially now, when Ukrainians are having a hard time at the front. Peace against Russia is possible only with the help of military force,- Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans is convinced. The Netherlands also handed Ukraine the last promised T-72 tanks as part of a joint program with the Czech Republic and the United States. In addition, Ukraine recently received a new batch of Dutch F-16 fighters, but the exact number of transferred aircraft is not is disclosed Norway has joined the Drone Coalition for Ukraine and will help strengthen the protection of Ukraine's critical infrastructure. Latvia, which last year spent 0.25% of its GDP to support Ukraine, will hand over 42 more armored personnel carriers. -We are determined to continue supporting Ukraine. It must be emphasized that any peace negotiations must be conducted from a position of strength,- said Latvian Defense Minister Andris Spruds. For now, we can definitely say that -Rammstein- will survive, only technical issues remain, such as the chairmanship. Whether it will be Great Britain in the future, or the format will return under the auspices of the United States, is still unknown. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte is confident that the format should work in parallel with the new command in Wiesbaden (NSATU), which is responsible for the coordination and delivery of aid to Ukraine. -Obviously, both are needed. Because in the Rammstein format, the members of the Alliance and other countries outside NATO undertake to guarantee that Ukraine has everything it needs,- he explained. At the same time, NSATU not only organizes logistics for the transfer of weapons, but also, for example, conducts training for the Ukrainian military. -So we need these two programs. Therefore, I think that the future depends on both,- said the NATO Secretary General. Rustem Umyerov is also convinced of the continuation of Ramstein's work. -I believe that Rammstein was held productively and it was agreed that the next meeting will also take place, the place and time will be announced later,- he said, summing up the meeting in Brussels.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/13/nova-vijskova-dopomoga-ta-zhorstki-zayavy-pentagonu-yakym-buv-dlya-ukrayiny-ramshtajn-u-bryusseli/	2025-02-12T20:30:47-08:00
Mobilization of drones: a Californian firm has redesigned its civilian UAV for the needs of the US A...	As informed by the profile defense edition The war zone, in February 2022 the Californian drone manufacturer Skydio won the army competition under the SRR project, in which the company presented its Skydio X2D civilian drone adapted for the needs of the Pentagon, which in The US Army received the name RQ-28A, according to ArmyInform. As part of the agreement with the Pentagon, the amount of which amounted to $99.8 million, the Skydio company undertook to transfer 1,080 units of RQ-28A quadcopters to the army units of the United States Armed Forces. In turn, the authors of the Dutch defense portal Army Recognition (AR) was informed that as part of one of the first in 2025 Army multinational exercises Combined Resolve 25-1, which took place in mid-January at the Joint Multinational Readiness Center on the Hohenfels training ground in Germany, fighters of the 317th Engineer Brigade of the US Army actively tested the advanced RQ-28A drones in their arsenal. Skydio X2D, an American unmanned aerial vehicle designed for rapid deployment and capable of being fully ready within a minute of activation. This portability is one of its key features—soldiers can carry the drone in their backpacks, making it an ideal accessory for platoon-level operations. Weighing just under 2.25 kg (5 pounds), the Skydio X2D can conduct high-resolution video surveillance both day and night, with a range of up to three kilometers. The drone's robust autonomous capabilities set it apart from other unmanned systems as it can navigate complex environments while avoiding obstacles such as trees and buildings. This level of autonomy reduces the burden on soldiers, allowing them to focus on their mission rather than piloting the UAV. In addition, the drone's ability to operate in low-visibility environments, such as populated urban areas with heavy construction or dense forests, further expands its usefulness. A properly trained operator can access control of the RQ-28A using a dedicated controller with a 6.8-inch 720p LED touchscreen and an internal antenna. The latter is used to communications at a distance of up to 6 kilometers using the 5 GHz band, and such a relatively modest signal transmission range clearly defines the RQ-28A as belonging to the short-range drone class. Speaking of equipment, the RQ-28A provides comprehensive reconnaissance capabilities thanks to the presence of 4K optical cameras with 16x digital zoom and dual sensors, including 12-megapixel color camera and thermal sensor FLIR. Such a set guarantees a 360-degree view of the field of view, the ability to detect people and vehicles, and an equally impressive obstacle avoidance system. A kind of -icing on the cake- is the ability to perform 3D scanning of the environment, which makes it possible to automate the process of observing a given target, although the low battery life on a single charge somewhat limits this efficiency. What sets the Skydio X2D apart from other drones is its exceptional autonomy and obstacle avoidance technology. Equipped with Skydio's proprietary computer vision software, the AR site's authors say the drone can navigate complex environments without requiring constant manual control. This level of autonomy allows it to avoid obstacles while maintaining a smooth flight path and minimizing the risk of accidents. Skydio X2D is designed to deploy in less than a minute, offering soldiers a fast and reliable aerial reconnaissance tool that greatly improves their ability to respond to new threats on the battlefield. Deployment of Skydio X2D as part of the initiative Transformation in Contact reflects the US Army's desire to integrate advanced technology into its warfighting strategies. According to the official website of the U.S. Army, this initiative aims to increase the speed and accuracy of decision-making, enabling a real-time tactical response in crisis or conflict scenarios. Using drones such as the Skydio X2D, soldiers can gather real-time intelligence that can be quickly transmitted to commanders, thereby improving situational awareness and the ability to respond to rapidly changing conditions on the battlefield. Using small drones for tactical reconnaissance is an increasingly common approach as they allow the military to assess enemy positions, identify potential threats, and gather critical information without putting soldiers in direct harm. The transition to wider use of drones in The US military is part of a broader trend in modern military strategy. Unmanned systems, previously used primarily for large-scale surveillance, are now critical tools for small units operating at the platoon level. Looking to the future, the US Army plans to expand the use of drones and other unmanned systems in various echelons of military operations. The increasing deployment of these systems at the platoon level reflects a shift to smaller, more nimble and flexible units that can quickly respond to new threats. The Army is expected to integrate even more advanced drone technology, focusing on improving data connectivity, communication between drones and ground units, and expanding the range of operations. As technology advances, drones will likely incorporate artificial intelligence, swarm capabilities, and even autonomous decision-making, making them even more effective tools in combat. The Skydio X2D drone test during Combined Resolve 25-1 in Germany underscores the U.S. Army's commitment to using new technologies to improve battlefield awareness and operational readiness. This drone is a key element of the US military's ongoing efforts to modernize the way it conducts war, ensuring that soldiers are better equipped to meet the challenges of today's conflicts.

Disrupt the mobilization and demonize the TCC: the enemy continues to -pump- the audience with fakes	This week, the topic of the mobilization of Ukrainian teenagers is actively -rocking-. In particular, a video with a Ukrainian prisoner of war, who says that he allegedly saw teenagers from an orphanage in his brigade, is circulating on Russian resources. The propagandists do not provide any other evidence for their lies. They base the charges solely on the -confession- of a Ukrainian prisoner of war, who in the hands of the enemy could have been subjected to torture and death threats. Another example: the dissemination of information that teenagers are being mobilized for the 41st OMbr. In these messages, pro-Russian resources provide screenshots with various comments of military personnel and relatives on Facebook. However, the screenshots turned out to be drawn in Photoshop and generated by artificial intelligence, and the comments under them were added by fake accounts. In order not to fall into such -throwaways-, it is worth knowing that according to the current legislation, citizens of Ukraine between the ages of 25 and 60 are subject to mobilization. Citizens under the age of 25 can join the ranks of the Armed Forces only voluntarily by signing a contract. Traditionally, fakes related -to the atrocities of the TCC and SP- continue to appear. Their goal, in addition to disruption of mobilization, is destabilization of the internal situation in Ukraine. Unfortunately, such fakes are often spread by Ukrainian men. Mostly those who are violators of the law: have not yet updated their data or fled the country. In January, I went through the VLK and did not see any disdain or prejudice towards me in any of the offices. Also, none of the fifty people who spent several hours with me in the queues complained about something similar. Because those citizens who are conscious reservists know very well that in case of need they will fulfill their constitutional duty. And in the TCC and SP, they also treat conscientious citizens who updated their data on time, passed the VLC, and do not hide in the bushes after seeing a person in a military uniform. Those who do not want to serve, are wanted and evade mobilization are criminals. And the attitude towards them is appropriate. Of course, it is easier for them to blame everything on the TCC and SP, ZSU or the government - anyone but themselves. The enemy dreams that such sentiments will prevail everywhere in Ukraine, because that is the only way he will be able to overcome our resistance. That is why it reproduces staged videos, which it tries to cause fear, panic and shake up the internal situation in our country.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/13/zirvaty-mobilizacziyu-ta-demonizuvaty-tczk-vorog-prodovzhuye-kachaty-audytoriyu-fejkamy/	2025-02-12T20:06:15-08:00
Ukraine and the USA are preparing a new agreement on security and economy	The Office of the President informs about this on February 12. -Just held a meeting of the National Security Council - the decision has been made and will be published tomorrow. We are protecting our state and restoring justice: everyone who destroyed Ukraine's national security and helped Russia should be held accountable,- the President assured. According to him, the billions that were actually earned by selling Ukrainian interests and security should be blocked and should be used to protect Ukraine. He also met with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and announced the preparation of a new agreement. -We plan to work out all the details so that already within the limits of the Munich Conference and our meetings there with American representatives, in particular the Vice President of America Vance, so that we have a ready vision of how we will add more security and what document can record it,- the head of state said. He also talked about the talks with the US president. -Very substantive negotiations with the United States of America. President Trump briefed me on what Putin told him. We believe that America's strength is enough to push Russia and Putin to peace together with us, together with all partners,- the President of Ukraine noted. We will remind you that Volodymyr Zelensky conducted long a telephone conversation with former US President Donald Trump about the possibilities of achieving peace in Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/12/ukrayina-i-ssha-gotuyut-novu-ugodu-shhodo-bezpeky-ta-ekonomiky/	2025-02-12T11:59:00-08:00
Love Through Explosions: The Story of an International Legion Commander and a Combat Medic	The story of the defenders was made public on the page of the Land Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Their paths crossed in 2022 in Kruglyakivka. Jan then commanded an infantry company, and Anastasia served in a medical station. Their acquaintance happened by chance - when medics came to help the injured commander of another company. -He was so courageous, serious - I liked him right away,- recalls Anastasia. But then she didn't allow herself to even think about a relationship. War left no room for sentiment, and war rumors only increased caution. Jan himself took his time. They just talked for a long time, until all his personal issues were resolved, and only then did a real feeling develop between them. Together they went through moments when the heart was clenched with fear. Ian saw on the screen an explosion where his beloved had just been. Anastasia - saved the wounded under fire, knowing that someone who was worried was waiting for her. -We immediately drew a line between personal life and work. It wasn't like, 'you're my girl, don't go there,'- says Ian. She worked in evacuation groups, took the wounded out of the hell of battle. Yang had to come to terms with the fact that he couldn't protect her the way he wanted to. Once, while evacuating a dead soldier, Anastasia came under fire. Ian watched it on the monitor, a huge flash, followed by a few seconds of silence that seemed like an eternity. -I thought - that's it, she's gone- But then I heard a voice on the radio- Shelling, contusions, operations. The war more than once made them wonder whether they would return alive. Ian recalls one of his combat exits: mines exploded a few meters away, and only the frozen ground saved their group from death. Anastasia survived serious injuries. -When you're injured, you don't think about how they care about you. You think about your soldiers, about how to save them,- she says. Their feelings were hardened under the bullets. They passed tests that would be enough for several lifetimes. When Anastasia became pregnant, Ian felt even more afraid of losing her. -When I was injured, I was most afraid that my son would be left without a father,- he admits. -But when you're with the one you love, all fears fade away.- Despite all the difficulties, they do not back down, because they know: together, Ukraine needs them - and each other. As ArmiyaInform reported, she saves lives on the front line, helps the wounded and finds time for creativity. -Shantal- is a combat medic of the 34th separate coastal defense brigade, who has been faithfully fulfilling her mission since 2022. An Odessa resident, artist, writer and big animal lover, she shares her experiences, thoughts about the future and the inspiration she finds even in the most difficult moments.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/12/kohannya-kriz-vybuhy-istoriya-komandyra-internaczionalnogo-legionu-ta-bojovoyi-medykyni/	2025-02-12T11:57:36-08:00
Volodymyr Zelenskyi commented on the possibility of Ukraine joining NATO	He said this during a meeting with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. -We were constantly told about the open door policy. But no one has invited us to NATO yet. The fact that there are appropriate steps and the inclusion of this issue in the Constitution of Ukraine&#8230; You know how it happened. This does not mean that NATO said: -Include this in the Constitution, and you will be in NATO tomorrow,- he noted. The head of state recalled the Budapest memorandum. -Exchange for nothing. On paper. Yes, we all want to be in NATO, we are all adequate people with you. But you must understand that all these talks are about steps, about reforms, about re-equipment of the army, about a new level of the Ukrainian army. Where is higher? We stopped Putin,- Volodymyr Zelenskyi said. According to him, membership in NATO can really become a security guarantee for Ukraine. -But the United States, Germany, Hungary, they don't see us there - yet. When we talk about the alternative, I always say that the cheapest option for everyone is Ukraine in NATO. The most expensive is to build NATO in Ukraine, because you, the Ukrainians, will have no other way. There will be no other way for security in Europe. And then it will be reflected in the security of the United States,- the President assured. He noted that Putin does not want to end the war. According to the head of state, building NATO in Ukraine means keeping the same army as in Russia. -That is, there are 220 brigades in Russia, and we have 110 combat brigades. This is the usual arithmetic. And in Europe, I spoke about this recently, approximately 80-82 combat brigades. If there is no Ukraine tomorrow, Russia will go to Europe and occupy it. And we need real security guarantees. And I ask President Trump to give us these security guarantees, to help Ukraine strengthen us,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy assured. He also reminded that large resources are needed to maintain the Ukrainian army. -Of course we should talk to Europe. We currently have a budget deficit. To have an army at least as small as it is now, and to feed this army and arm it is to have a large resource. This money has to come from somewhere,- he explained. As reported by ArmyInform, the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky conducted a long telephone conversation with former US President Donald Trump about the possibilities of achieving peace in Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/12/volodymyr-zelenskyj-prokomentuvav-mozhlyvist-vstupu-ukrayiny-do-nato/	2025-02-12T11:41:41-08:00

Target Hub is already integrated into DELTA along with Monitor digital map. -In the future, the module will integrate with other components of the ecosystem, such as Mission Control, Vezha and Element. Such a combination of tools ensures full synchronization of data and will increase the efficiency of tasks at all levels,- the message says. The created module was the product of cooperation between the Center for Innovation and Development of Defense Technologies of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, the Center for Scaling of Technological Solutions and the 69th Separate Special Electronic Support Center, which implemented the request of users. Combat units, including the 3rd Separate Assault Brigade, the 45th Separate Artillery Brigade and the Avdiyivka Tactical Group, became experts and consultants for the development of the Target Hub. As reported by ArmiyaInform, the military application -Army+- launched a report on damage to enemy objects, which allows digitizing and to streamline the daily submission of data on the results of combat operations in the army.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/12/keruvannya-vognevoyu-robotoyu-pidrozdiliv-u-delta-zyavyvsya-modul/	2025-02-12T07:41:12-08:00

Ukraine is a reliable partner for the USA: Kyrylo Budanov talked about the prospects for cooperation	He reported this on his page. According to Budanov, Ukraine has one of the strongest armies on the continent, unique military experience, in particular in the use of the latest technologies, as well as attractive prospects for business in the field of the military-industrial complex. -One of the main reasons for Russia's war against Ukraine is to capture our country, our natural resources and the military-industrial complex in order to use them against Western countries in the future,- Kyrylo Budanov emphasized. He also emphasized that Ukraine greatly appreciates the significant support from the American people in the fight against Russia. -For more than 10 years of Russian aggression and three years of full-scale war, our country has suffered many losses, but our heroic Armed Forces of Ukraine and, in general, the State Security and Defense Forces continue the battle with the Russian aggressor, because we have chosen our path - the path of freedom, democracy, and integration into world markets,- said the head of the GUR. Kyrylo Budanov emphasized that the close cooperation between Ukraine and the USA in the field of military industry and the development of the sector of the latest defense technologies has broad mutually beneficial prospects. -Post-war Ukraine as a state with one of the strongest armies on the continent, a powerful military-industrial complex and unique military experience can become the main ally of the US in the region, a reliable partner in the new world reality, where freedom and security are unshakable values,- he concluded. As reported by ArmyInform, Magura V5 naval drones have already attacked enemy air targets several times to date, but the previously shot down equipment still -reached- to the coastline or the airfield.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/12/ukrayina-nadijnyj-partner-dlya-ssha-kyrylo-budanov-rozpoviv-pro-perspektyvy-spivpraczi/	2025-02-12T07:18:23-08:00
- The Koreans have changed their tactics - in Kurshchyna, soldiers from the DPRK are climbing the po...	This was told by Stanislav Krasnov, platoon commander of the 95th separate amphibious assault brigade, on the broadcast of the -Edyny Novyni- telethon. According to him, the expulsion of Ukrainian troops is a matter of reputation for the Russians. After all, the war is now going on in their territory, and they need to get some minimal victory at any cost. That's why they relentlessly throw their infantry into attacks, and that's why they have such heavy losses. -It is not visible from the prisoners that they have more motivation. Of course, this is their territory, but they fight the same way. Not for an idea, not for any patriotic considerations, but for fear of commanders. We all know very well that there are extrajudicial massacres, executions and so on,- said the platoon commander of the 95th separate amphibious assault brigade. The enemy, as Stanislav Krasnov is convinced, threw a lot of forces to prevent the advance of the Defense Forces, which happened a few days ago, but could not do anything about it. Despite the fact that the Koreans returned to the battlefield. -They changed their tactics somewhat. They are already moving in smaller groups. If before that they moved in groups of up to 50 people, now there are 15-20. But their tactics are the same. All the same, they climb like cockroaches on our positions. Somewhere they are accumulating in landings, trying to break through. In this regard, nothing has changed, they will also suffer huge losses,- said Stanislav Krasnov. As reported ArmyInform, in Kharkiv Oblast, in the Borova district, in the area of ​​responsibility of the Third Assault Brigade, repelled an attempt mechanized offensive.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/12/korejczi-zminyly-svoyu-taktyku-na-kurshhyni-soldaty-z-kndr-lizut-na-pozycziyi-syl-oborony-yak-targany/	2025-02-12T07:02:10-08:00
The NATO Secretary General explained whether the Rammstein format will continue to work	He stated this at a press conference in Brussels, the correspondent of ArmiyaInform reports. -Obviously, both are needed. Because in the -Ramstein- format, the members of the Alliance and other countries outside NATO undertake to guarantee that Ukraine has everything necessary, in particular, support with specific material means for waging war against Russia,- said Mark Rutte. He recalled new military aid packages announced in the past two weeks by Canada, Sweden, the Netherlands and France. -So, you need this format, but you also need NSATU to make sure that all the aid goes to Ukraine in the best way, that it will be as useful as possible,- the NATO Secretary General explained. Mark Rutte added that Ukraine needs weapons for defense, such as tanks, air defense systems, but also needs to organize training for the Ukrainian military. -And this is exactly what NSATU is organizing. So we need these two programs. That's why I think that the future depends on both,- the NATO Secretary General concluded. It should be noted that today, for the first time, the meeting in the format of -Ramstein- is being held under the chairmanship of Great Britain, and not the USA, as it was before. As reported by ArmyInform, today at a meeting of Ramstein it became known that this year Great Britain will allocate military aid to Ukraine in the amount 4.5 billion pounds.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/12/gensek-nato-poyasnyv-chy-praczyuvatyme-nadali-format-ramshtajn/	2025-02-12T07:00:56-08:00
Great Britain in 2025 will provide Ukraine with military aid worth several billion pounds	This was stated by the Minister of Defense of Great Britain, John Geely, when he opened the meeting of the Contact Group on the Defense of Ukraine in Brussels, the correspondent of ArmiyaInform reports.

Prince Harry in the Frontier: how the Duke of Sussex supports Ukrainian soldiers at the Invincible G...	This was reported on the brigade's page. Whether this was a planned move or a sincere impulsive decision is unknown. However, this sign did not go unnoticed. Ukrainian military and veterans participating in the competition felt special support from the Duke of Sussex. This is not the first time Prince Harry has expressed solidarity with our country. During the Invincible Games, he actively communicates with the Ukrainian military, inspires them and, it seems, has become even closer to the defenders of Ukraine. -Welcome to the -Rubizh- Brigade, prince Harry!- — humorously remarked the fighters of the brigade in social networks. And although the title of prince does not imply service in another army, it seems that he has already become an honorary -fighter- of the Ukrainian -Rubezh-. As reported by ArmiyaInform, fighters of the 4th battalion -Freedom Force- of the 4th brigade of the operational assignment -Rubizh- of the National Guard hit enemy equipment and finished off the Russian landing party.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/12/pryncz-garri-u-rubezhi-yak-gerczog-sassekskyj-pidtrymuye-ukrayinskyh-voyiniv-na-igrah-neskorenyh/	2025-02-12T06:28:33-08:00
Latvia will transfer 42 armored personnel carriers to Ukraine	He said this before the start of the meeting of the Contact Group on Aid to Ukraine at the NATO headquarters, ArmiyaInform correspondent reports from Brussels. -We will announce new aid in the form of 42 armored personnel carriers, which corresponds to the number of armored vehicles for the battalion. We also continue to co-chair the Drone Coalition and participate in the training of the Ukrainian military,- Andris Spruds said. He reminded that last year Latvia provided more than 0.25% of its GDP to help Ukraine. -We are determined to continue supporting Ukraine. It must be emphasized that any peace negotiations must be conducted from a position of strength. Practical steps are also needed: financial support, military aid,- concluded the Latvian minister. As reported by ArmiyaInform, the member countries of the North Atlantic Alliance have already provided Ukraine with more than the 40 billion euros of defense support promised last year.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/12/latviya-peredast-ukrayini-42-bronetransportery/	2025-02-12T06:05:14-08:00
-Maxim- vs. -Shakheds-: how a 19th century machine gun destroyed a modern kamikaze drone	The story of the fighters was published on the brigade's page. Their comrade-in-arms is -Maxim-, a legendary machine gun that survived two world wars and, as it turned out, is still capable of effectively destroying the enemy. Although its firing range is limited to 800 meters, it was enough to shoot down an enemy Shahed during combat duty. -When we saw the drone, we started working from all six positions. But it was our -Max- that shot him down,- the fighters say. Volodymyr, a builder from Cherkasy region, and Petro, a 58-year-old military man whose son also defends the country, know well the price of accuracy. -If you don't hit the target, it can kill civilians - that's the hardest part,- Volodymyr adds. Such combat experience once again confirms: even century-old weapons can be formidable if they fall into the hands of those who are ready to defend their land. However, the fighters do not hide: they dream of more modern weapons. -We would like something more powerful, DShK or Kanik, then we could shoot down more targets,- says Petro. The Ukrainian army once again demonstrates that war is not only about technology, but also about determination, courage and ingenuity. And if the enemy thinks that his drones will fly through the Ukrainian sky with impunity, he should review history - because even 19th century technologies can work in this game. As reported by ArmyInform, the chief sergeant of the unit with the call sign -Puzzle- is one of those who does not hesitate for a minute when it is necessary to go into battle or save his brothers. His story is a story of courage, bravery and iron will, which became the basis of the battles for Krynky.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/12/maksym-proty-shahediv-yak-kulemet-xix-stolittya-znyshhyv-suchasnyj-dron-kamikadze/	2025-02-12T06:03:46-08:00
-Gifts for an imaginary friend- - violators invented an original scheme for crossing the border, but...	On Wednesday, February 12, reported in the DPSU press service. -First, the young men met with the border guards during verification measures in the controlled border area. They said that they were going to a friend's birthday in one of the border towns, and to be convincing, they took gift packages and food,- &#8211; the message says. However, later the border guards discovered these same citizens in a completely different place. -During the conversation, the boys admitted that they don't have any friends in Volyn - they just wanted to cross the border illegally. During the inspection, it turned out that the -gift- packages contained warm tactical clothing, medicine, canned food, as well as an ax, a saw and other items necessary for the trip,- &#8211; told the DPSU. As a result, the violators were taken to the border division for the preparation of administrative materials under Art. 204-1 of the Criminal Procedure Code (illegal crossing or attempted illegal crossing of the state border of Ukraine). ArmyInform reminds that it is better not to break the law or risk your life, but to use vacancy aggregator in the Armed Forces and recruiting centers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/12/podarunky-dlya-uyavnogo-druga-porushnyky-vygadaly-oryginalnu-shemu-peretynu-kordonu-prote-vona-yih-pidvela/	2025-02-12T05:56:38-08:00

The story of the fighter was made public on the page of the Land Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. A man eliminates enemies with a variety of weapons - from a machine gun to an MLRS. It is noted that one of the most memorable episodes of the war for Roman is related to the destruction of enemy attack aircraft. This happened when the enemy temporarily captured Ukrainian positions. Several fighters went to return them, and -Roks- with a Browning machine gun went behind the Russians and opened fire. -I poured it into the back of their head,- Roman recalls with a smile. The Ground Forces reported that the enemy was completely destroyed, and the positions were returned to the control of the Defense Forces of Ukraine. -Before the war, Roks worked as an energy engineer for more than 20 years.

Mark Rutte: NATO countries exceeded their obligations to Ukraine by providing EUR 50 billion in aid	This was said by NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte on the eve of the ministerial meeting in Brussels, ArmiyaInform correspondent reports. -At the Washington Summit, the Alliance members promised to provide Ukraine with 40 billion euros of security assistance until 2024. They not only fulfilled their obligations. They significantly exceeded them. They provided more than 50 billion euros, more than half of which came from European Allies and Canada,- Mark Rutte said. He emphasized that this is a clear signal of NATO's unwavering commitment to Ukraine. -It's also a big step in the direction of what President Trump has called for. I agree with him that we should distribute security aid to Ukraine evenly. But in order to really change the trajectory of the conflict, we must do even more,- said the NATO Secretary General. Mark Rutte added that the stronger Ukraine is on the battlefield, the stronger it will be at the negotiating table: -The more chances there are to get a good deal to achieve lasting peace.- As ArmiyaInform reported, on February 12, the defense ministers of the NATO countries will participate in the work of the Contact Group on Defense of Ukraine in the Ramshtein format under chaired by Great Britain.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/12/mark-ryutte-krayiny-nato-perevykonaly-zobovyazannya-pered-ukrayinoyu-nadavshy-50-mlrd-yevro-dopomogy/	2025-02-12T05:38:43-08:00

Mobilizing 18-year-olds: when the idea first arose	And it happened in revolutionary France. On August 23, 1793, the National Convention (constitutional and legislative assembly of the period of the French Revolutionary Wars) passed the -Decree on the Mass Levy- (French: Levée en masse), written by Bertrand Barér with Lazare Carnot. The revolution that took place in France in 1789 caused friction between the new republican government and its European neighbors, who decided to invade France to restore the monarchy. The war with Prussia and Austria began in April 1792. And already by March 1793, France was in a state of war with Austria, Prussia, Spain, Great Britain, Piedmont and the United Provinces of the Netherlands. The French army at the time was a mixture of volunteers and what was left of the old royal army. Due to the introduction of conscription on 24 February 1793, the size of the mercenary army was increased to approximately 645,000 soldiers, but this number was insufficient and the military situation continued to deteriorate, especially when Mainz fell on 23 July 1793. The convention began to be demanded to increase taxes, but the assembly solved the problem in a different way, announcing the first general mobilization. A member of the Convention, Bertrand Barrère, asked the convention -to make a solemn declaration that the French people are going to rise up in defense of their independence.- It contained, in particular, the following points: 1. From now on and until the enemies are expelled from the territory of the republic, the French people are constantly in military service. Young men go to battle; married men - forge weapons and provide transport; women make tents and clothes and will serve in hospitals; children turn old rags into lint; the elderly should assemble in public places to stimulate the courage of the warriors and to preach the unity of the Republic and the hatred of kings. 2. National buildings are turned into barracks; public places - in the armory; the soil of the cellars will be washed with lye to remove nitrates from it. 3. Weapons of various calibers should be transferred exclusively to those who oppose the enemy. 4. Saddle horses will be used to equip the cavalry corps; draft horses, other than those used in agriculture, must carry artillery and provisions. 5. The Public Security Committee is instructed to take all necessary measures to immediately establish the special production of weapons of all kinds&#8230; He is empowered to establish all establishments, manufactories, workshops, and factories, as he may deem necessary for the execution of such works, and also to require for this purpose throughout the territory of the Republic such workers as may contribute to their success&#8230; The central establishment of said special production shall be established in Paris&#8230; 8. Bulk collection is general. Unmarried citizens or childless widowers between the ages of eighteen and twenty-five shall be the first; they are to meet without delay at the capital of their districts, where they are to exercise daily while waiting for the hour of departure. 9. Representatives of the people regulate meetings and marches so that armed citizens arrive at places of assembly only in those for which there are sufficient supplies, ammunition and everything that constitutes the material part of the army. 10. The places of assembly shall be determined by circumstances and appointed by the representatives of the people seconded to execute this decree, on the advice of the generals in cooperation with the Committee of Public Safety and the Provisional Executive Council. 11. The battalions organized in each district must be united under a banner with the inscription: The French people have risen against the tyrants&#8230; The mass conscription resulted in the creation of a national army in France composed of citizens rather than mercenaries, which was standard practice at the time. Its maximum number was reached in September 1794 — 1,108,300 people. Most of the soldiers were peasant farmers. The rich and urban workers were given special privileges and exemptions. In addition, the rich could buy replacements (poorer men to take their place) from families who needed money. Men who did clerical work, as well as other men who could read and write, were released from service and worked in government offices. Despite the solemn rhetoric, the mass collection was not popular; desertion and evasion were very high (the number of deserters was later estimated at 175,000). However, these efforts were enough to turn the tide of the war and protect the French borders from all enemies. France's brilliant victory surprised and shocked monarchical Europe. There was no need for further conscription until 1797, when a permanent system of annual conscription was introduced. General mobilization was used in France and during the Napoleonic Wars. Later, the French term -Levée en masse- came to refer to the policy of mass national conscription, often in the face of invasion. But the further practice of mobilizations in the world led to a constant increase in armies with each subsequent war. The culmination was the mass conscription into the armies of various countries during the First and Second World Wars, which claimed millions of lives of those mobilized.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/12/mobilizacziya-18-richnyh-koly-czya-ideya-vynykla-vpershe/	2025-02-12T05:26:25-08:00
A rat in a trap: how the SBU turned a traitor into a weapon against the FSB	This is reported by the Security Service of Ukraine. According to the head of the SBU, Vasyl Malyuk, operation -Rat- made it possible not only to identify the traitor, but also to use him for disinformation of the enemy. During the entire time of being under surveillance, the agent transmitted to the FSB data that was carefully prepared by the Ukrainian special service. The occupiers received information that looked plausible but worked against them. -We monitored his every move, all contacts, communication and correspondence around the clock. He literally lived under the supervision of our special services,- said Vasyl Malyuk. However, in addition to agent activity, the -mole- also had family support in the form of his parents, who openly justified the aggression of the Russian Federation. The SBU is already preparing suspicions against them under Article 436-2 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine. The investigation revealed that the official was recruited in 2018 in Vienna. After a temporary -conservation-, it was reactivated in December 2024, when it began to transmit classified data to the enemy. However, all these actions were under the control of the Ukrainian special services. Together with the -topshurt-, the entire FSB intelligence network was exposed, and its curator - Yuriy Shatalov - was also established. During the operation, a hidden conspiratorial apartment, a mobile phone for transmitting information and other evidence of treason were discovered. The official was charged with treason (Article 111 of the Criminal Code), he faces life imprisonment with confiscation of property. The case is under the control of the Office of the Prosecutor General of Ukraine. The SBU emphasizes that the cleansing of its own ranks from traitors continues, and no FSB agent will remain unnoticed. The enemy can be sure of only one thing - a trap is waiting for him. As reported by ArmyInform, employees of the Security Service of Ukraine discovered a -top- Russian FSB agent in their ranks.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/12/shhur-u-pastczi-yak-sbu-peretvoryla-zradnyka-na-zbroyu-proty-fsb/	2025-02-12T05:13:55-08:00
A downed missile can explode on the ground - the Air Force has revealed the details of a night attac...	About this wrote on February 12 the head of the public relations service of the Air Force Command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, colonel Yuriy Ignat. -The anti-aircraft guided missile of the Patriot air defense system is capable of knocking down a ballistic missile only with a direct -head-on- collision. Due to the kinetic energy during the collision, the enemy missile either explodes or changes its trajectory and falls to the ground. We have no other way to hit ballistics! If the missile did not explode in the air, there remains a high probability of detonation of the warhead on the ground,- Yuriy Ignat said. He attached a video of the downed Iskander-M in Odesa to his post. According to him, there were similar cases in Kyiv (on Lukyanivka) and in other places. -The hit missile will no longer fly to the target where the enemy sent it, but it will definitely fall to the ground! On February 12, suddenly, at 4:30 in the morning, the enemy tried to destroy the objects of critical infrastructure in the capital, to deprive the residents of Kyiv of heat and electricity, to create a humanitarian disaster during the frost! The consequences could have been terrible...- assured Yuriy Ignat. According to him, the anti-aircraft missile division, headed by the Hero of Ukraine, was engaged in repelling the attack on the capital, and on whose account dozens of ballistic missiles were shot down in the sky of the capital. Yuriy Ignat dedicated his post to People's Deputy Maryana Bezuglii, who once again criticized the work of the Air Force and made a statement about the rocket explosion in Kyiv. As ArmyInform reported, as a result of a missile attack on Kyiv one person died, the debris caused fires in the city.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/12/zbyta-raketa-mozhe-vybuhnuty-na-zemli-u-povitryanyh-sylah-rozpovily-podrobyczi-nichnoyi-ataky/	2025-02-12T05:01:15-08:00

The first, but not the last: how the attack aircraft of the Defense Forces eliminated the general of...	He told about this in an interview on the -Defenders of Independence- channel, the official YouTube channel of the Main Communications Department of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. In the first weeks of the full-scale invasion, the Ukrainian military carried out a unique operation, during which an enemy convoy was destroyed along with an enemy general. -We carried out a frontal assault - literally went to the enemy's column. Without losses on our side, we took two prisoners - the general's bodyguards, and destroyed the entire column along with the general himself,- says Brigadier General. The operation took place in Zhytomyr Oblast. The Ukrainian military conducted reconnaissance, determined the location of the enemy and carried out a lightning raid. In just a few minutes they were out of the battle without any casualties, while the enemy suffered a devastating blow. -It was important for us. This was the first case of the destruction of an enemy general on the territory of Ukraine. After this operation, the morale of the personnel rose significantly,- Colonel Vasyl Matiyev admits. The colonel says that the war has evolved over the past two years. The Russian army began to actively use the tactics of small tactical groups, reducing the time of attacks to avoid being hit by FPV drones. -Now they can storm even with two soldiers, trying to break into the shelter as quickly as possible,- explains the commander. Not only the tactics of the enemy have changed, but also the methods of the Ukrainian military. The 5th Assault Brigade uses a multi-layered battlefield surveillance system, including drones that broadcast real-time data. This allows you to make decisions faster than the enemy. -I see the full picture of the battle before the battalion commander has time to report to me,- emphasizes Brig. Vasyl Matiyev also emphasized the danger of excessive dissemination of military tactics in social networks. An example is the use of incendiary munitions from FPV drones, a method that quickly spread online and was soon used by the enemy against Ukrainian defenders. -A free country also has its risks: the enemy learns from our mistakes,- he explains. The colonel emphasizes the importance of psychological training of personnel. -You can't immediately throw newcomers into difficult tasks. They have to experience the first success, and then the fire in their eyes will only grow,- he says. In his opinion, the motivation and morale of the soldiers is the key to victory. As reported by ArmyInform, drone operators of the 5th separate assault brigade of Kyiv turned another offensive of the invaders. in the spectacle fiasco in the Pokrovsky direction.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/12/pershyj-ale-ne-ostannij-yak-shturmovyky-syl-oborony-likviduvaly-generala-rf-na-pochatku-vtorgnennya/	2025-02-12T03:34:16-08:00

Bohdan Petrenko, the head of the communications department of the 48th separate artillery brigade, told about this on the Espresso broadcast. According to Petrenko, the enemy is coming in small infantry groups. Russians do not protect their people. In fact, the history of the Second World War is repeating itself, when the Soviet commanders simply pelted the enemy with the bodies of their soldiers - a kind of -collective Matrosov-. However, from time to time they still attack with highly guarded equipment. And these assaults look as strange as possible. -The -uber-weapon - the Wunderwaffe- is driving ahead. This is a tank, hung with all kinds of protective appendages. -Barbecue-, then -dreadlocks- are such chains that hang on the sides of this -barbecue-. Ahead is an anti-mine trawl, and what is interesting is that on top of the -barbecue- there is dynamic protection. But despite these -wunderwaffe-, none of these columns, and there were three of them, did not even reach the battle line&#8221; — said Bohdan Petrenko.

It didn't sit well - a pedestrian spy with a prison record was detained in Donetsk region	The Security Service of Ukraine reported this on February 12. The man corrected the aggressor's rocket-bomb and artillery strikes on the locations of the Defense Forces on the hottest direction of the front — Pokrovsky. The main targets of the enemy were the places of the greatest concentration of personnel and combat equipment of the Ukrainian troops. In order to get the coordinates for the fire attack, the FSB used its -sleeper agent-. He turned out to be a 39-year-old recidivist who had twice served a prison sentence for robbery. During his first -term- in the colony in the temporarily occupied Makiivka, he was recruited by an FSB personnel officer and transferred to -waiting mode-. After leaving prison, the agent left for the territory controlled by Ukraine and settled together with his roommate in the city of Bilozersk, Pokrovsky district. According to the case file, at the end of 2024, a Russian curator approached him remotely and instructed him to spy on the bases of the Defense Forces. To gather information, the traitor went around the frontline area, where he secretly observed the locations of Ukrainian troops. After such investigations, the person involved would return home to submit the intelligence report to the FSB through an anonymous chat in the messenger. Employees of the Security Service exposed the agent early and detained him at his place of residence. Simultaneously, comprehensive measures were carried out to secure the locations of the Defense Forces on the relevant front line. During the search, a mobile phone and special devices were found in the detainee's possession, which he used to communicate with the FSB. SBU investigators informed him of the suspicion under 2 Art. 111 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (treason committed under martial law). The perpetrator is in custody. He faces life imprisonment with confiscation of property.

-Shot, destroyed and forgot-: near Pokrovsk, our troops destroy the invaders from Stugna-P and Javel...	-Gimli- worked as a truck driver in Europe for 5 years before the large-scale invasion of the Russian Federation. On the first day of the great war, he was in France. When there were thousands of queues of people leaving Ukraine at the western borders, Serhiy, on the contrary, moved back to the Motherland. He is from the Chernihiv region, his wife, children and parents were waiting at home in Nizhyn. The Polish border guards were surprised and asked him: -Are you going to war?-. He answered that yes - to defend Ukraine. They shook his hand and wished him well. At first, Serhiy joined the local DFTG, then enlisted in the ZSU. -Ghimli- is a pro, has tremendous experience in destroying Russian equipment from various anti-tank missile systems of domestic and foreign production at different areas of the front. -Ukrainian Stugna-P ATGMs are part of the unit's armament, and calculations of American Javelin complexes from other units of the Armed Forces have also been seconded to us. The -Stugna-P- complex is a real pride and one of the important achievements of domestic production. Developed and manufactured by Kyiv Design Bureau -Luch-. The complex has a guided anti-tank missile guidance system based on a laser beam, which is carried out in a semi-automatic mode from a closed firing position with the help of a remote control that is carried by a cable at a distance of 50 to 100 meters. Some variants of this complex are equipped with a thermal sight for working on targets at night. ATGM can fire missiles with different warheads: tandem cumulative or high-explosive fragmentation and hit tanks or other armored vehicles and fortifications at a maximum distance of 5 km. Remote installation control is one of the key advantages of Stugny-P over other similar anti-tank systems. This is primarily the preservation of personnel, which is very relevant at the moment, given the intensity of hostilities. How we work: we are assigned a territory, relatively speaking, a square where there are tank-dangerous lines, where the enemy can go to bring in and land his infantry. We take off with Mavik, scout the area and determine the plus-minus point where the anti-aircraft missile position can be set up. Next, our scouts go out and on the spot determine at which specific point of the terrain it is advisable to deploy, from which there will be the best opportunity to destroy the enemy. Be sure to use -Nettle-, a map of the area with heights, whether there is direct visibility, and so on. A dugout is being equipped and only after careful measures to mask the position, we advance there with ATGM. Depending on the direction and actions of the enemy, we decide how many anti-personnel and cumulative missiles we will need at this position. We raise the -Mavik- again so that our pilots from the air can see whether the firing position and the camouflaged installation are visible. The -Stugna-P- installation can be located 100 m away from the calculation, which at the same time is in a shelter or in a dugout, and using the remote control method through the monitor, the guys can determine the distance to the target, and just in observation mode watch the battlefield, and, of course, shoot at a distance of up to 5 km. That is, hit from a safe distance, hit the target and forgot. Such are the obvious capabilities of our ATGM. For example, the calculation of the American Javelin complex makes a shot manually from firing positions and at a shorter distance, depending on the type of missiles. It can be 2, 3 or up to 4 km. Currently, there are three -Stugny-P- calculations and one -Javelin- calculation in constant combat mode. Ideally, what a combat job: one shot, one target. The capabilities of -Stugny-P- plus professional calculations are a formula for success, which gives many great results from hitting enemy combat vehicles. For example, in the Zaporozhye direction, at a distance of 4,800 meters, a Russian T-72 tank, which was moving at the same time, was destroyed with one shot. Or at a distance of 3 km, a racist BMP with occupants was destroyed. Their car came to take away the killed and wounded from the battlefield, the guys waited for the moment when 12 bodies were loaded onto the BMP and struck, the damage is one hundred percent, no one survives the rocket. In total, about 30 units of various enemy vehicles were destroyed in Zaporozhye. Now we are in Donetsk recently, so we are just shooting, as they say. The relief of the area completely does not allow to work. But we are already destroying the enemy. Just the other day, our calculations from the Javelin destroyed two BMPs of the Russian Federation from a distance of 2 km. Enemy combat vehicles tried to break through to the rear of our infantry and land a landing party. The situation developed very dynamically. It was only three or four minutes for two damage to the enemy. The guys were sitting at a good height, there was good visibility. One car was completely destroyed, the other was hit and stopped. Then the FPV drones took up the work, which until the end dismantled this BMP and the Russian attack aircraft that ran out of the burning car. Our unit is specially strengthened with calculations of FPV drones, which work in the interests of anti-tank calculations -Stugny-P- and -Javelin-. Another interesting story. In the last week, the Russians have tried to break through our positions on the front line 4 times. And all 4 attempts fail for them. These were columns with equipment. A tank with a minesweeper was ahead, followed by 3-4 BMPs and another tank. So, the first tank with a trawl destroyed the Javelin anti-tank calculation from the neighboring unit, it was most convenient for them to hit it. Then the total destruction of this mechanized convoy began. Everything flew there: artillery shells, drops from drones, tanks joined. Moreover, not only the units of the 117th brigade, but also the artillery of the neighbors hit the occupiers. Destroyed everything! &nbsp; All our calculations have undergone professional training in the operation and combat use of -Stugna- and received educational certificates. The guys are professionals, motivated to beat the enemy, quick learners, mastering new ways and methods of destroying the enemy. What is interesting, in addition to the main work of destroying enemy equipment and fortifications, our calculations, together with air reconnaissance units, adjust artillery fire against small enemy assault groups and Russian equipment advancing in the Pokrovsky direction. Again, the calculation at a safe distance from the complex in a specially prepared shelter remotely monitors the designated area of ​​hostilities. In the radio communication mode, artillery unit strikes are being adjusted. These things about the interaction of brigade weapons significantly affect the success of the process of destroying the enemy. Somehow in the Zaporizhzhia direction, we captured the Katsap anti-tank missile -Kornet- and missiles for it. Interestingly, we even destroyed a Russian tank later with this complex. The disadvantage of this anti-tank installation is that the settlement is directly next to it, and this greatly increases the chances of being spotted, for example, by the Mavik UAV from the air. Our calculation, on the contrary, is at a distance of 100 meters from the camouflaged -Stugna-P-, that is, in cover and in safety, it strikes the enemy's equipment. We value our people, unlike the Russians. -Cornet- also works on the principle, like -Javelin-, -see and hit-. But the installation is heavy, it is difficult for two people to carry it. -Thigh- is also heavy, but it is more adapted to defensive actions. Like any ATGM calculation, we are tied to height and line of sight. The range of use of the -Cornet- is the same as that of the Ukrainian installation. Another minus is that it has poor optics, there is a Soviet sight, while the Stugny-P, on the contrary, has modern optics with a zoom that allows you to change the picture scale three times. Even if there is thick fog for 3-4 km, some signatures will be visible. And you won't be able to do this on a Russian ATGM, you just have to look at the sight. -Kornet- is actually a Soviet type of anti-tank weapon, so of course our ATGM is much better. The enemy is trying to improve its combat capabilities, but so far I have not come across a modernized version of the Rashist ATGM. Enemy anti-tank calculations are always a fat target for us. As we are for the enemy. Russians, because of their stupidity or because of something else, it is not clear, make mistakes. And that's good. I remember a case: a Rashist ATGM calculation fired three or four shots from one and the same place. Then there was a thick fog and our guys just saw by flashes, even the signatures were not visible, that it was an enemy calculation. They waited until the occupiers fired one of the shots. And as soon as their missile went off, we fired our shot and that was it, the damage was done - the enemy calculation was destroyed. After that, the enemy is already afraid to deploy their ATGMs near the contact line. This, in turn, allows our tanks to strike at the enemy with direct fire in the zone of responsibility of our unit. If the enemy does not use armored vehicles in the area of ​​hostilities, we conduct surveillance and identify the locations of enemy FPV drones, reconnaissance and attack UAVs. It is an effective weapon in the fight against dandruff. The missile has a thermal homing warhead, so the operator of the missile complex does not have to follow and correct the flight of the missile after launch while it approaches the target. That is, if you fixed the target, fired a shot, then you do not need to prove this missile, it hits the target automatically, simply by aiming. If there is direct visibility, you can work at a distance of 4 km. The big advantage is mobility, it is a portable installation, not as bulky as the stationary Stugna-P ATGM. One Javelin complex weighs only 22 kg. And, of course, the question of the price of missiles. If the Ukrainian rocket costs about 20,000 dollars, then the American one - at least 175 thousand. dollars But if you look at the price of, for example, a destroyed Russian tank, then the cost of even American missiles does not seem so high. But the Javelin installation has some peculiarities in terms of hitting targets. For example, if the first target, let's say, is hit and a second target is spinning near it, then the missile will again fly into, relatively speaking, a burning BMP, which gives off more heat, even though the aiming device is already fixed on this second target. Everything depends on the successful actions of the calculation, which already has similar experience. That is, you have to wait for the second target to move a little further, or move forward, or, on the contrary, roll back, and only then shoot. This is the -principle of heat transfer- in -Javelin-. You have to have a desire. You can learn absolutely everything. Our unit consists mainly of volunteers who came from the very beginning of the large-scale invasion and are not professional soldiers. That is, they did not have the concept of green in anti-tank complexes. A lot still depends on the professional training in the Training Centers. But the main thing is to constantly learn and develop. Now the preparation lasts a month. I will say from my own experience: if a person is motivated and wants to learn, ten days will be enough for him to study. I still studied on a shortened course - two weeks. You yourself understand that due to the cost of the Stugna-P missile and the limited number of these missiles, we did not have training shots during training. Worked at training complexes. Therefore, the first combat shots were already on the front line. Of course, there are some issues with this setup. When you see that the enemy column is moving towards our infantry, you forget absolutely everything, the adrenaline kicks in and you work on automaticity. You gain more and more experience with each subsequent shot at the grids.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/12/vystrilyv-znyshhyv-i-zabuv-pid-pokrovskom-nashi-nyshhat-okupantiv-zi-stugny-p-ta-dzhaveliniv/	2025-02-11T21:05:43-08:00
-Poles- and -Czechs- are repaired along -Shustrom-: who -fixes- the tanks of the 117th brigade	During his military service in 2008, Oleksandr became a mechanic-driver of the T-64 tank, the then main battle tank of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Then he worked in his native Khmelnytskyi region as a forest feller and believed that a military specialty would no longer be needed in peaceful life. During the anti-terrorist operation, the serviceman recalls, he was called to the military commissariat four times, but each time everything ended with a verification of credentials and a warning to be ready to appear at the next call. A large-scale invasion changed everything, when Shustroy's knowledge and skills made him one of the most experienced tankmen in the 117th separate heavy mechanized brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. — When we came to Poland for training, the Poles showed us their PT-91 Twardy tanks and said that we would go to the training ground. I then asked if it was possible to -take a ride- - drive the tank by yourself. Only, I say, show how to launch, because the -sixty-four- has a different launch system. The Poles were surprised, but they allowed us - three of us from the entire battalion immediately sat down like that and drove off, - Oleksandr recalls. However, Shustrom did not have to use the privilege of driving for a long time - already after several trips, the Polish instructors recognized the high level of qualification of the Ukrainian tanker driver and ordered to hand over the driving of the armored vehicle to less experienced comrades. - I haven't been there for a long time, maybe I've been riding for a week - and I was told that it's enough, let those who know worse drive. That's why I went to the test site as a passenger for another month, - the tanker driver smiles. -Shustriya- remembers training in Poland with gratitude, noting the extremely friendly and at the same time demanding attitude of the instructors, well-thought-out living arrangements and good financial support for the cadets. - They taught us very well - everything was explained, chewed up. Everything was explained very clearly. The main thing was not to be ashamed to ask - everything you need will be shown, everything you are interested in will be analyzed. And together with you, everything will be collected and disassembled, and then they will be allowed to sort through everything themselves, says Oleksandr. The tank driver practically did not feel a language barrier when communicating with the instructors, because he had previously visited and worked in Poland for some time. Not needing an interpreter, he not only had more opportunities to study personally, but also helped his fellow students in this. Thanks to good basic knowledge, diligence and the help of instructors until the end of training, Oleksandr mastered PT-91 Twardy -excellently-. This allowed him to become responsible for the technical condition of armored vehicles in the tank company. Since the Twardy -Poles- are in many respects identical to the T-72, on the basis of which the Czech modernization of the T-72 Avenger was also created, -Shutriy- eventually became a universal specialist in the repair of the entire tank fleet. Now, under his leadership, a team of high-class specialists is working, capable of carrying out technical maintenance of all tanks of the company in field conditions. — Now I am considered to be the senior among the driver mechanics, I am responsible for all the cars so that they are in good working order, on the move. I sit down with the boys, go where necessary, organize and help. Is it for the evacuation of equipment that has been knocked down or is broken there. I make sure that the drivers do their work correctly, maintain the equipment, -Shustriy- explains his tasks. The tanker is convinced that a fully functional machine that will work flawlessly on the battlefield is the key to the completion of the combat mission and the survival of the crew. After all, if even a small thing in the tank does not work like clockwork, it can have irreparable consequences. Oleksandr praises PT-91 Twardy and T-72 Avenger, although he notes that, in his opinion, there are no fundamental differences from the basic T-72 model. However, he admits that the more powerful engine, fire control system and sights of modernized armored vehicles are important on the battlefield because they increase their combat capabilities. — The running gear is all the same. This T-64 is very different from them, and they are not really different from T-72. If you learned on the T-72, you can relearn on them very quickly - if you wish, -Shustriy- assures. So, when necessary, Oleksandr himself takes the seat of a mechanic-driver and can lead any tank of the company even for repairs, even for changing positions, even for battle. The senior mechvod, jokes -Shustriy-, is like a universal soldier - he must be -on you- both with equipment and with personnel. — If someone doesn't know something, doesn't know how, I have to show, explain, teach. It is necessary to do it together so that the guys in the process understand how it is done and then they can repair, sort through, fix it themselves, - explains Oleksandr. He is convinced that the main thing in the war is brotherhood, mutual understanding and mutual assistance in the team. After all, a well-coordinated team is able to perform the most difficult tasks precisely by insuring each other and offering a shoulder of friendly support. — Help the boys, show, do. And for everyone to be together. Unfortunately, we have losses. Very good guys are no longer with us. But this is a war, you can't do anything about it. We need to get together and hold on, do our work, because otherwise, nothing will be solved without us. If we don't do it ourselves, it won't get better or easier, the tanker explains his position. Fighting is hard, losing comrades is even harder. However, it is much worse to be defeated, because then nothing can be fixed, because the conditions will be dictated by the enemy and you will have to follow his whims. Therefore, the Shustriya tanker is convinced that he is now in his place - exactly where he should be at this time - among his brothers in tank company 117 of the separate heavy mechanized brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/12/polyakiv-i-chehiv-remontuyut-po-shustromu-hto-fiksyt-tanky-117-brygady/	2025-02-11T20:40:52-08:00
Availability and mass: the well-known American manufacturer of drones will master the production of ...	This company is well known in the world arms market as a manufacturer of reconnaissance and attack drones, such as MQ-9 Reaper and MQ-1C Gray Eagle, which ArmyInform talked about in detail in its materials, did not previously specialize in the creation of air-to-surface missiles. As the authors of the defense portal The War Zone (TWZ) told, the latest charge was presented at the annual Surface Navy Association symposium, which testifies to the growing need of Armed US forces in available and mass-produced air-based munitions. TWZ writers who visited the General Atomics (GA) booth firsthand pointed out that the company's website mentions past experience in the development of surface-to-surface and surface-to-air munitions, including low-cost and modular munition designs. Its Aeronautical Systems division also has extensive experience with drones. In general, as TWZ noted, the line between unmanned aerial systems, especially long-range kamikaze drones, and cruise missiles, as well as decoy UAVs carrying electronic warfare payloads, is becoming increasingly blurred. A single modular design can also be configured to perform different sets of missions. The fact that GA had not even chosen a name for it at the time of the presentation of the idea for a new charge can speak of the urgency and speed of implementation of this project. At the exhibition stand at the Surface Navy Association, the missile was given the tentative name Strike Missile, which in the Ukrainian version can be translated as -Strike Missile-. TWZ analysts noted that, according to the sketches, the newest charge has a compact and modular flat design. Its distinctive features include: At the moment, the size and technical characteristics of the rocket remain unknown. However, a representative of the General Atomics company noted in a comment to reporters that the project is at the development stage, and the name of the missile may be changed. TWZ believes that the new missile is also likely to be no exception to the trend towards an increasingly blurred line between drones, cruise missiles and air defense systems. What's more, the Strike Missile could be a cost-effective solution that the US military has long needed. And the creation of mass-produced and inexpensive air-launched munitions is driven by necessity: Analysts also noted that the presence of such weapons in the portfolio of General Atomics means that they can be offered directly in conjunction with its proposals for unmanned aircraft and other unmanned systems. -The shock missile can fit both in the internal compartments and under the wings of other drones, including the one that General Atomics is developing as part of the Air Force Collaborative Combat Aircraft program (CCA),- TWZ experts concluded.

-Biolaboratories-, -troll factories- and something else: what propagandists are trying to accuse USA...	In fact, the US Agency for International Development (USAID) financed Ukrainian mass media quite differently. Some grants, indeed, amounted to 100% of the budget, some - 40-60%, some even less. After all, the media in Ukraine receive support not only from USAID, but also from the European Union, the United Nations, other countries, foundations and organizations. Therefore, the propagandists' statements that practically all mass media in Ukraine -remained on the verge of bankruptcy- after the newly elected US President Donald Trump suspended all grants from USAID for 90 days are not true. But the fakers did not stop at these -throw-ins- and published several portions of their favorite nonsense about -troll factories- and -biolaboratories-. So, pro-Russian sources spread a fake video with the Bloomberg logo on the network, in which it is claimed that USAID -lost control over biolaboratories in Ukraine, although it invested $20 billion in their creation and development.- In fact, it is no longer a secret to anyone that under the pretext of the presence of so-called -biolaboratories- on the territory of Ukraine, which are allegedly engaged in the development of biological weapons, the Russian Federation has been continuing a large-scale disinformation campaign for years, aimed both at discrediting Ukraine and the United States, and at whitewashing its own crimes. Accusing the US Agency for International Development of financing so-called -troll factories-, the Russians shared a screenshot from the USAID website, which allegedly proves the financing of -students from Eastern Europe writing Russophobic comments on the Internet.- Allegedly, almost 500 thousand dollars were allocated for this. However, USAID did not actually fund any -troll factories-. The funds were directed to the implementation of the SURE program - Students for a United and Resilient Europe (-Students for a United and Resilient Europe-). As part of the program, students from 16 Eastern European universities conducted research and implemented campaigns aimed at countering propaganda that sows discord between refugees and local communities. As is known, it is Russian propaganda that actively uses the so-called -botfarms- to manipulate public opinion and spread disinformation. Thousands of automated or human-operated accounts flood social media with fake news, comments and fake likes, creating the illusion of mass support for pro-Russian narratives. But the avalanche of fakes, misinformation and manipulations regarding USAID did not end there. In the X social network, for example, a fake spread that the Agency sponsored the arrival of Hollywood stars to Ukraine during the war&#8230; -The worst thing is that the Russians are trying to use X against US interests. It is the same as if the Tomahawks were flying not at America's enemies, but at America itself. And for this, the Russians will have to be punished,- said the head of the CSDP of the NSDC, Lieutenant Andriy Kovalenko.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/12/biolaboratoriyi-fabryky-troliv-i-shhe-deshho-v-chomu-propagandysty-namagayutsya-zvynuvatyty-usaid/	2025-02-11T20:08:01-08:00
Life and death in the same hands: how combat medic -Sam- set a record for the destruction of armored...	The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. Before the war, Sam had no medical education, but when he was offered to become a combat medic, he accepted without hesitation. He passed the school of combat medics, attended numerous courses with foreign instructors and obtained a certificate. -I have never regretted my choice,- he admits. But his mission at the front is not limited to saving lives. -Sam- is also an anti-tank gunner. And although he helps his wounded brothers every day, the destroyed occupiers are on his account even more. His first combat operation took place on May 12. Together with his partner, he was on duty all night, waiting for the assault. At four o'clock in the morning, the enemy forces launched an attack with two MTLBs. The first was destroyed from the Javelin, the second the next day. Later, -Sam- was sent to another position, where he worked at a height. On May 22, a large convoy - seven units of equipment - went to Spirne. As a result of the battle, they knocked out one tank and three -motorcycles-. These successful strikes made -Sam- the unit's record holder for the number of vehicles destroyed. -I don't turn up my nose, we are all equal. After a successful job, the boys were praised, everyone was happy. Everyone does their own thing here,- he notes modestly. But war is not just about hitting shots. Sam clearly remembers the moment an 82 mm mine hit their position. One comrade died instantly, and he stabilized the other and handed over for evacuation. Today, that fighter is back in action. -I have a great team: the guys are cheerful, positive, will always support me and will not leave me in trouble. I am very happy to serve here,- says Sam. His story is an example of dedication, resilience and true love for his country. He not only saves lives, but also does everything to prevent the enemy from advancing further. As reported by ArmyInform, a fighter of the Defense Forces Major Dmytro Polonchak under the pseudonym -Coyote- knows well how to disrupt -hunting- an enemy sniper, turning him into prey, and willingly shares his experience.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/11/zhyttya-i-smert-v-odnyh-rukah-yak-bojovyj-medyk-sem-vstanovyv-rekord-iz-znyshhennya-bronetehniky/	2025-02-11T11:58:19-08:00
Desperadoes from the Air Force: how -Pazl- and his comrades defended Krynka	The story of the fighter was made public on the page of the Eastern Air Command. After the decision to join the Armed Forces in 2022, -Pazl- got into the anti-aircraft missile regiment, but when the need arose to strengthen the infantry units, he did not think twice. Arriving at the position, -Puzzle- immediately went to work. Not paying attention to the skeptical attitude of the marines, he and his brothers began to train intensively under the guidance of experienced fighters. They practiced anchoring on the shore, maneuvering on the river and battle tactics. -Puzzle- often sailed for evacuation. When the soldiers came under enemy fire, he did not hesitate to gather an evacuation group, get into a boat and, under fire from mines, he sailed after his men. According to Puzzle, the marines quickly changed their opinion of them and started calling them desperate warriors. He told several heroic stories about his fellow Air Force men. One of the exceptional stories was the feat of the -Deputy-. Together with a group of six fighters, he took up positions in Krynk, holding the defense for six days without communication. At a critical moment, the -Deputy- crossed two rivers under enemy fire, reached the headquarters, transmitted the coordinates and returned the same way with the necessary equipment. Or the story of -Kuzi- - a 46-year-old soldier who, after undergoing combat training, together with his comrades destroyed two enemy armored personnel carriers, leaving no chance for the Russian landing party. Eight months of fighting in the Kherson region, endless risks, saving brothers and incredible endurance - this is what is behind the stories of these soldiers. And -Pazl- has no doubts: he is proud of each of them, because it is such people who are creating a new history of Ukraine. As reported by ArmyInform, a serviceman of the 11th brigade named after Mykhailo Hrushevskyi of the National Guard of Ukraine, nicknamed Melman, originally from Dnipro region, began his military service in the ranks in December 2021. 11 brigade named after M. Hrushevskyi NSU, and in two months, Russia launched a full-scale invasion.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/11/vidchajduhy-z-povitryanyh-syl-yak-pazl-ta-jogo-pobratymy-boronyly-krynky/	2025-02-11T11:43:42-08:00
Left without wheels: how drones of the Defense Forces turned an enemy armored personnel carrier into...	The video of combat work was made public on the brigade's page. The video shows how the calculation of the FPV drone skilfully adjusts the flight of the UAV, pointing it precisely at the enemy armored personnel carrier that was trying to escape from our pilots. The result did not take long - after a good hit, the car burst into flames. -And the enemy did not hesitate to provide our pilots with their APC to improve accuracy and efficiency. The knight warriors performed the practical task perfectly. It was burning brightly,- the brigade said in a statement. As reported by ArmyInform, the Ukrainian military continues to mercilessly destroy the enemy at the front. In the Pokrovsk region, the fighters of the 32nd separate mechanized brigade showed how UMBRELLA BBS pilots work without days off , delivering precise strikes on positions around the clock invaders.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/11/zalyshylys-bez-kolis-yak-dronari-syl-oborony-peretvoryly-vorozhyj-btr-na-kupu-bruhtu/	2025-02-11T11:23:47-08:00
Masquerading as a man, fake certificates and illegal routes: 4 schemes for evaders have been elimina...	informs about this on February 11. For bribes from 3 to 20 thousand US dollars, they issued fake documents to the evaders or transported them across the border bypassing checkpoints. Thus, in Kyiv, a citizen of the Russian Federation who organized the escape channel of conscripts to the European Union as drivers of international flights was arrested -in the heat of the moment-. -For the purpose of the conspiracy, the person involved acted under the guise of a man - cut her hair short, wore men's clothes and introduced herself under a fictitious name. -According to the investigation, before committing this crime, the Russian woman had previously been held criminally responsible for kidnapping and fraud,- the SBU said. Also in Lviv Oblast, a 32-year-old local resident was suspected of offering potential conscripts to flee across the border -bypassing- checkpoints. The attacker assured his clients that his accomplice would meet them outside of Ukraine, who would help the evaders to -legalize- in EU countries. In addition, a local resident was detained in the Poltava region, who decided to make money by -trading- fake medical certificates on disability. The suspect used personal connections among doctors to forge documents. In Ternopil, the military counterintelligence of the SBU detained a local businessman who, with the help of accomplices in the TCC, -wrote off- evaders from the military register based on their health status. -According to all the facts, the persons involved were notified of the suspicion in accordance with the committed crimes under Part 3 of Article 15, part 3 of Art. 332 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (illegal smuggling of persons across the state border and attempt to commit this crime). Perpetrators face up to 9 years in prison with confiscation of property,- the report says. ArmyInform reminds that it is better not to break the law or risk your life, but to use the aggregator of vacancies in the Armed Forces and recruiting centers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/11/maskuvannya-pid-cholovika-falshyvi-dovidky-j-nelegalni-marshruty-likvidovano-4-shemy-dlya-uhylyantiv/	2025-02-11T11:09:31-08:00

The caption to the video reads: -There are no easy days on the front lines. One of the units of the 153rd OMBr, holding positions on the hottest part of the front, repelled the enemy's attack and prevented a breakthrough.- The footage shows how, thanks to aerial reconnaissance, an enemy column was detected moving in the direction of the positions of the Ukrainian defenders. After that, an artillery attack was made on the enemy column, as a result of which the enemy suffered losses and fled into the bushes. However, the story did not end there. Aerial reconnaissance drones continued to monitor the area and found all the hiding places where the occupiers tried to hide. After that, they were subjected to mortar fire, which forced the enemy to finally retreat. As reported by ArmyInform, the drones of the 153rd mechanized brigade could not destroy the enemy tank shed, but forced the crew to leave it.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/11/ochi-v-nebi-grim-na-zemli-yak-bijczi-syl-oborony-rozgromyly-vorozhu-kolonu-ta-vidbyly-shturm/	2025-02-11T10:54:19-08:00
-Contract 18-24-: The Ministry of Defense launches a new format of voluntary service	This is reported by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. The project opens up new opportunities for volunteers aged 18-24: a decent financial reward, professional combat training according to NATO standards, and social guarantees that no civilian profession provides. The main emphasis is on voluntariness. Entering into a contract is a conscious choice of anyone who wants to contribute to the defense of the country and receive real opportunities for personal development. -The 18-24 contract is not coercion, mobilization and obligation. This is an opportunity for people to make a conscious choice, gain combat experience and financial stability in just one year. The volunteer decides for himself: whether to continue his service or return to civilian life, having unique perspectives,- stressed the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Rustem Umyerov. -Contract 18-24- offers financial stability guaranteed by the state: a contract for UAH 1,000,000, of which UAH 200,000 is paid immediately, and the rest - during service. Volunteers will receive a monthly stipend of up to UAH 120,000, have the option of a -zero- mortgage, education at state expense, free medical care, including dental prosthetics, as well as the right to travel abroad after a year of service. Freedom from mobilization is also guaranteed by law for 12 months after the end of the contract. -We create conditions in which the service becomes prestigious and competitive. Ukrainians who join the Defense Forces will receive everything they need: the best training, high salaries, social guarantees and opportunities for career growth,- added Rustem Umyerov. You can apply on the website 18-24.army.gov.ua or through the application Reserve+ with the latest update. Next is a consultation with a recruiter, signing a contract and undergoing training in combat units. -The Ukrainian army is changing. It becomes modern, strong and flexible. -The 18-24 contract is one of the steps towards the formation of a professional army of a new level, where every volunteer is the value and strength of our defense,- concluded the head of the Ministry of Defense. As reported by ArmyInform, information about the creation of -Drone Line- appeared on the website of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine - initiative aimed at developing and scaling effective units of unmanned systems.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/11/kontrakt-18-24-minoborony-zapuskaye-novyj-format-dobrovilnoyi-sluzhby/	2025-02-11T10:45:13-08:00
-Sumoshedsha- — a former Ukrainian athlete was convicted as a traitor	This was announced on February 11 by the Prosecutor General's Office. The convict is a former Ukrainian athlete and multiple European and world champion in sumo, who began competing in the Russian national team in 2016. Prosecutors proved in court that in 2023 the convict founded and led a volunteer movement in Crimea. She held numerous fundraisers for the purchase of diesel generators, walkie-talkies, thermal imagers and other resources for Russian military personnel who were fighting against Ukraine, in particular in the city of Bakhmut.

Special officer -Georgian-: how a teacher became a master of mortar fire	The story of the fighter was made public on the page of the 8th Special Purpose Regiment of the SSO named after Prince Izyaslav Mstislavich. With the beginning of a full-scale invasion, -Georgian- immediately decided: his place was in the army. The choice of the unit became obvious for him thanks to the instructor who gave him important knowledge during the training. It was he who advised the 8th SSO regiment, and the fighter did not regret his decision. He chose his nickname -Georgian- not by chance: his father is a Georgian who moved to Ukraine in 1985 because of love. The family is closely connected with the struggle for freedom, because during the war in Georgia, relatives of -Georgians- also fought, and some gave their lives for it. The fighter himself considers the war for Ukraine to be a war for Georgia at the same time - because we have a common enemy. The work of a mortar gunner requires perfect calculations. From the moment of receiving the coordinates to the first shot, usually 2 to 5 minutes pass. The accuracy of shots depends on the knowledge of mathematics, geography and geometry - disciplines in which the -Georgian- understands not only as a soldier, but also as a teacher by profession. Among the most effective operations of the fighter was the destruction of the enemy column near Chasov Yar. Together with their comrades, they hit 30 infantrymen under the cover of tanks and -Grads-, forcing the enemy to retreat. For -Georgyn-, the biggest motivation is his three children. He raises them in a patriotic spirit, teaching the history of Ukraine and Georgia so that the next generation does not repeat the mistakes of the past. On the front lines, the fighter has his own talismans: a bracelet from his wife, given to him on SSO Day, and the image of Vikings and Cossacks, which he embodies in his hairstyle and earring. -Georgian- and his comrades continue their struggle, forcing the enemy to pay for every meter of Ukrainian land every time. And he is sure: victory is only a matter of time. As reported by ArmyInform, a serviceman of the 11th Brigade named after Mykhailo Hrushevskyi of the National Guard of Ukraine, nicknamed Melman, originally from Dnipropetrovsk region, in December 2021 year began his term service in the ranks of the 11th brigade named after M. Hrushevskyi NSU, and in two months, Russia launched a full-scale invasion.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/11/speczpryznachenecz-gruzyn-yak-vchytel-stav-majstrom-minometnogo-vognyu/	2025-02-11T09:23:00-08:00

Paladin on the guard of Ukraine: how the guns of the Defense Forces destroy the enemy with American ...	The video of the combat operation of the calculation was published on the brigade's page. -With the appearance of the 155-millimeter howitzer M109 Paladin, our Cossacks have become much more confident, because the American machine allows you to work faster and more accurately, and also expands the range of possibilities: different projectiles perform different functions - damage, mining, illumination,- the brigade said in a statement. The video shows how Ukrainian gunners skillfully aim the howitzer at the target and fire. According to the soldiers of the calculation, with the receipt of 155-mm equipment, the amount of ammunition increased significantly, and the accuracy of fire improved. The firing range of an active-reactive projectile reaches almost 30 kilometers, and the working distance for artillery is about 22 kilometers. -Since a digital guidance and fire control system is installed here, the plus 155 caliber has a wider functionality for projectiles. There are remote mines, there are cluster munitions, there are ordinary high-explosive fragmentation, active-reactive, smoke, lighting and so on,- the fighters say. One of the gunners who was trained on the Paladin in Germany notes the speed and convenience of the machine, as well as its superiority over the 2C3 -Acacia- in terms of loading and aiming speed. -We try so that nothing breaks, we support, fill, lubricate so that it works at full speed,- the fighters add. According to them, they often observe the result of their work from a drone with almost no delay, which brings satisfaction from accurate hits and destroying the enemy. -At this moment, the enemy conducts aerial reconnaissance more actively, uses barrage ammunition -Lancet-, -Privet-82-. It also actively uses FPVs, which have already begun to fly to the firing positions of the artillery,- the fighters note. Despite the threat of enemy shelling, Ukrainian artillerymen continue to perform their work, because they are motivated by the protection of their land and their families. -I am from Kharkiv region, I have four children. And so that they don't reach us, my family, the family motivates,- says one of the fighters. As reported by ArmyInform, in the Kharkiv direction in the Lyptsi-Hlyboke front line zone, the movement of infantry remains stable. and also the movements of enemy equipment are not recorded.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/11/paladin-na-varti-ukrayiny-yak-garmashi-syl-oborony-troshhat-voroga-amerykanskoyu-sau/	2025-02-11T08:52:32-08:00

Marker -self-other-: The Ministry of Defense is strengthening cooperation with the language ombudsma...	This was reported by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine on February 11. Serhiy Melnyk said that the state should promote the comprehensive spread of the Ukrainian language in the interpersonal communication of military personnel. According to him, Ukrainian is used 100% in the defense system at the official level, but in informal communication defenders sometimes use Russian words. -This, in particular, is a consequence of more than three hundred years of Russification of the country. We are fully aware of the importance of the Ukrainian language not only in terms of observing the language law, but also in everyday communication. The Ukrainian language in the Armed Forces remains one of the main factors of unity and identification,- noted Serhii Melnyk. Taras Kremin emphasized that in the conditions of the Russian-Ukrainian war, the state language became a key marker of -own-alien-, allowing to quickly identify the enemy and destroy him. He emphasized that in order to strengthen national priorities, strengthen unity and struggle, it is important to strictly adhere to the current legislation, use the state language, and demonstrate an example of respect for the defining factor and main feature of the nation's identity. -Having an extensive network of educational institutions, language courses, state and local language programs, all of us, overcoming the consequences of the colonizers' assimilation policy, strengthen the power of the Ukrainian word, thereby ensuring the full functioning of the state language in all spheres of social life and strengthening the unity of our Ukraine,- Taras Kremin emphasized. Currently, the Ministry of Defense is an organizer and an active participant in a number of measures to implement the state language policy in the Armed Forces. In particular, this is work on normative and legal acts on cultural and language issues, support for measures to spread and popularize the Ukrainian language, holding language competitions, including: As reported by ArmyInform, in all training centers that prepare mobilization personnel of the Armed Forces of Ukraine href=-https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/10/z-akczentom-na-psyhologichnu-stijkist-v-zsu-onovleno-programu-bzvp/->implementation of the fifth edition of the program of basic military training (BZVP) with an emphasis on psychological stability.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/11/marker-svij-chuzhyj-minoborony-posylyuye-spivpraczyu-z-movnym-ombudsmenom/	2025-02-11T08:24:15-08:00

How a smartphone can become a threat at the front: the Ground Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces r...	The Land Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine inform about this. A fighter's smartphone is one of the most vulnerable points in cyberspace. The enemy can use mobile devices to gather intelligence, track whereabouts, intercept conversations, and even influence military morale. Main Threats and Recommendations: Location Tracking: An enemy can determine the movement of military units by merging geolocation data. Recommendation: Turn off GPS and Bluetooth in a combat zone, avoid connecting to unknown Wi-Fi networks. The IMSI-catcher technique (fake base stations) allows the enemy to intercept calls and SMS. Unsecured messengers can become a source of leakage of confidential information. Recommendation: Use only secure communication channels, avoid personal conversations on the phone on the front line. Photos taken on a smartphone contain GPS coordinates, device model and other metadata. The enemy can track the location of units through this data. Recommendation: Turn off geolocation for the camera and delete metadata before publishing a photo. Fake emails and messages may contain malware. Through infected files, the enemy gains access to the devices. Recommendation: Do not open suspicious links or files from unknown senders. The enemy tracks military groups on social media, analyzing activity to gather information. Recommendation: Limit the use of social networks during service, avoid posts with geotags and personal information. In case of capture or loss of the device, all data can fall into the hands of the enemy. Recommendation: Use two-factor authentication and configure automatic data deletion in case of device loss. A soldier's smartphone is not just a means of communication, but a potential security risk to the entire unit. Best practice is to completely avoid the use of civilian devices in a war zone or to strictly follow cyber hygiene rules. Remember: following simple rules can save lives. As ArmiyaInform reported, the Land Forces were the best in the Defense Forces in implementing electronic reports submitted through the Army+ application in January.

Ukrainian -key- to -Lancet-: how paratroopers effectively counter enemy UAVs	The video of combat work was made public on the brigade's page. The defenders of Donbas already know well how to fight against enemy UAVs. From now on, the -Lancets- of the Russian occupiers do not just lose their effectiveness - they become the next downed targets for Ukrainian soldiers. -Our comrades from BPS (combat application of systems. - Ed.) do not just oppose enemy drones - they actively hunt them. The enemy's drones more and more often end their flight not where the operators wanted, but on Ukrainian soil - in the form of scrap,- the brigade reports. In addition to fighting Lancets, paratroopers continue to conduct active aerial reconnaissance and attack the enemy with FPV drones. Hitting the occupiers' positions, destroying enemy equipment and firing points became commonplace for them. The only thing that changes is the count of eliminated invaders. And it is steadily growing. As reported by ArmyInform, Russian invaders continue to suffer devastating losses from units of unmanned systems and air defense 46 separate airmobile brigade of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/11/ukrayinskyj-klyuchyk-do-lanczetayak-voyiny-desantnyky-efektyvno-protydiyut-vorozhym-bpla/	2025-02-11T07:32:02-08:00

As informs on February 11, Mariupol City Council, the Center for the Study of the Occupation claims this. -The only Institute of Spatial Planning of the Russian Federation disseminated information about the new construction of the center of occupied Mariupol. They focused on building schools and hospitals. However, it is more likely that a total mortgage development is planned on the site of the real historical part,- the report says. It is noted that cultural and historical monuments, which were built at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century, can be destroyed in this way. The Mariupol City Council noted that during the three years of Russian occupation, the local pseudo-administration was hardly involved in the restoration of damaged buildings in the historical part of the city.

21 days on the brink of life and death: how -Student- took his fellow students out of the environmen...	The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. Mykhailo says that at first he received a summons, but then his armor was still active. After being called again, he decided to go to the Military Commissariat on his own. That's how he got to the rifle battalion, and already there he was entrusted with the duties of an orderly. -It was fate,- says the soldier. - In peaceful life, I was not a doctor, but the war changed everything. We were trained in Norway to save lives on the battlefield. There, we experienced firsthand what hypothermia is - we stood in icy water at minus five degrees to understand how to act in critical conditions.- When their unit got into position, they found themselves isolated, with no food, no ammunition, and no way to retreat. Russian troops mined the roads with -Petals-, and the enemy constantly attacked. However, there was nowhere to retreat. -The first two days it was difficult to realize that there was no going back. But no one broke down. Everyone listened to each other, understood that the assault was inevitable, and when it began, everyone gave a fight, even the wounded. No one ran, everyone did their job,- Mykhailo recalls. Twenty-one days in the trenches under constant fire is a test not only physically, but also psychologically. The 15th day became especially difficult, when some fighters began to be unable to withstand the pressure: -Here it was important to find words of support, to give people the opportunity to change their shift schedule in order to preserve their fighting spirit.- On the 21st day, a group of three fighters broke through to them - the rest died in minefields. That's when the order to leave came. However, the confusion with the coordinates almost cost them their lives - they went in the wrong direction, realizing the mistake already on the way: -I ordered everyone to turn back - and everyone turned back. No one objected, everyone knew that time was short, and acted in concert.- Later, their unit was evacuated. Despite the first combat experience, all survived, showed iron endurance and self-sacrifice. Mykhailo has no doubt that war changes everyone. But he believes that he survived for a reason: -If the war ends tomorrow, then I was needed for something bigger. And now the main thing is to survive and win.- As reported by ArmyInform, -It was hell- - this is how the fighters of the 58th Motorized Infantry Brigade with the call sign -Student- describe their three weeks on the front lines. Together with four brothers, he fell into a real trap where every day was a struggle for survival.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/11/21-den-na-mezhi-zhyttya-i-smerti-yak-student-vyviv-pobratymiv-iz-otochennya/	2025-02-11T07:03:08-08:00

But this requires money. From October 2023 to March 2024, the defendant received funds from the victim into his bank accounts and disposed of them at his own discretion. As reported by ArmyInform, a doctor and a soldier were detained in Kiev, who are suspected of extorting money from a veteran	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/11/siv-na-6-rokiv-u-kryvomu-rozi-pokaraly-negidnyka-shho-vyduryv-groshi-v-udovy-vijskovogo/	2025-02-11T02:14:15-08:00
Don't be like Ivan: a resident of the Zaporizhzhia region forcibly mobilized by the Russian army is ...	In this video, the sixth prisoner in a row is from the Zaporizhzhia region. -(unintelligible)&#8230; Ivan Dmytrovych September 14, 2003. Zaporozhye region, Mykhailivskyi district, Mykhailivka village. Group of 34 -I don't remember any more-, - says the boy, who was captured by our paratroopers, about himself. Note that Ivan is only 21 years old. We are still debating whether to lower the conscription age from 25 to 21 or 18. And in the Russian occupation military committee, no one asked Ivan how old the conscript is - he is just 21 years old already on the battlefield, already fighting under the Russian flag and has already failed. Although - remained alive and that's good. And still, a significant number of our contributors in social networks continue to hate the military personnel of the TCC and SP. And positive posts about this topic are simply drowning in hundreds, thousands of reposted -news- from Russian bots. The material of our author about how he passed the VLK to sign a contract with the Armed Forces of Ukraine was subjected to hate by readers (real readers?). In his comments, the author was accused of lying, of living in a parallel reality. Almost the same thing is said in one post from Facebook contributors: -The TCC approached, asked to show documents and drive to the Military Commissariat. They checked what was on the record, gave them tea and sent them home. I didn't have time to call in the sleet.- I can tell you dozens more of these stories. &#8230;Why doesn't anyone say anything good?.. &#8230;Because you are more interested in reading something related to gyno..&#8230; &#8230;The word of mouth radio is still working, one story is told from mouth to ear through 10 people and from one story about 1 mobilized person becomes 10 mobilized boys who storm Donetsk from the Military Commissariat on the 3rd day with an AK-100 assault rifle. It's funny!-. Yes, it's funny. And it is difficult to hear the voices of the active military again in the noisy row of treasonous posts. Thus, on the air of -Public Radio-, the commander of the 3rd separate battalion -Brodyaga- as part of the 411th regiment of control of unmanned aviation complexes Ilya Mashina told-advised what Ukrainian men should do for a long time. And why: -I recommend to young and healthy men: get ready, now the third year is coming to an end, you could take at least basic training courses. Because the enemy will not stop at the borders of the Dnipropetrovsk region, and I know for sure that if you do not defend Ukraine and are not in the Armed Forces of Ukraine, then you will be in the Russian armed forces and storm Europe. And this shows in the practice of Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhya (regions - ed.)&#8230; where the enemy entered, now they (inhabitants of the temporarily occupied territories - ed.) serve there.- But will the Ukrainian men, who in 10 years have not found time to get to the TCC, hear the serviceman Ilya? Will they continue to sit quietly at home, afraid to leave the apartment and catch the eyes of their children and wife?	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/11/ne-bud-yak-ivan-prymusovo-mobilizovanyj-armiyeyu-rf-meshkanecz-zaporizkoyi-oblasti-vzhe-voyuye-proty-ukrayiny/	2025-02-11T01:57:48-08:00
-Having a hat-: a DPSU fighter -Coyote- shared his experience of hunting an enemy sniper	As states in the State Border Service, this Ukrainian soldier took part in combat operations in the Lyman and Bakhmut areas, -where there was no room for mistakes.- -Holding, defending, counterattacking, clearing - these are the tasks usually faced by the border guard. He is not one of those who underestimates the enemy, but together with the unit he led, a sniper rifle, DShK or MK-19, they quite often became the cause of a failed enemy assault, the impossibility of advancing, or other problems for him,- the DPSU said. According to the fighter himself, if the Ukrainian positions get hot because of the overwhelming enemy forces, he takes his sniper rifle to support his comrades. -We made a decision to -give at the drop of a hat-&#8230; If, for example, up to 10 people storm our position, if you overwhelm two, count on the fact that the remaining eight are already starting to run back and take their own. Their assault failed. Perfect,- Coyote explains. When Ukrainian defenders are threatened by a Russian sniper, Dmytro Polonchak also knows what to do. -Heard from the reports that they work on a spot basis. The sniper is working specifically, you have to do something with him. We took a long time to get to that sniper, we got there, the second number gave me his coordinates, where he was, which balcony, which floor, and I was already working directly on him,- the soldier recalls. But how this duel ended in the end, see in the video. As reported by ArmyInform, over the past week, the Defense Forces stopped more than 700 enemy attacks.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/11/dayemo-po-shapczi-boyecz-dpsu-kojot-podilyvsya-svoyim-dosvidom-polyuvannya-na-vorozhogo-snajpera/	2025-02-11T01:42:20-08:00

Volodymyr Degtyarev, a representative of the public relations service of the -Charter- brigade, told about this on the Espresso broadcast. According to him, so far we are talking about a tactical initiative. The enemy has an advantage in artillery, so the Defense Forces have to compensate for this factor with the accuracy and training of drone pilots who destroy bunkers, generators, and generally destroy enemy logistics. -It can be said that our pilots of large drones were offering to the enemy. They offered, as usual, large tank mines that fall on heads. All in order to be as uncomfortable as possible now, when it is frosty and cold. And in order to reduce the main factor in this war - morale. And the ability to withstand all the difficulties that war entails,- Volodymyr Degtyarev noted. As ArmyInform reported, in the Novopavlov direction, the enemy has recently been trying to find weak spots in our defense. Attack mainly in small infantry groups. In addition, the weather makes it possible for both Ukrainian and enemy unmanned systems to work.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/11/piloty-proponuyut-velyki-tankovi-miny-na-golovy-na-pivnich-vid-harkova-dronari-metodychno-nyshhat-rosijsku-logistyku/	2025-02-11T01:27:22-08:00

According to him, shelling is almost 24 hours a day. In the dark part of the day, there are fewer assaults. For the most part, the Defense Forces are finishing off what is left of the enemy's daytime assaults. They try to smoke out the underdogs from their hiding places at night, not to leave even a few people near our positions. -A large number of occupiers is negated. Equipment, mainly passenger cars, is also destroyed as quickly as possible. For them, it is a one-way street. They drove to the positions in passenger cars, disembarked, and then the task was to escape back. They rarely succeed in this,- said Serhii Tsehotskyi. As ArmyInform reported, a video appeared on social networks with a Russian invader that was hit by a drone of the Defense Forces in Toretsk and died right under the Ukrainian flag.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/11/nedobytkiv-vykuryuyut-vnochi-bilya-pokrovska-hvyli-atak-pihoty-na-legkovykah/	2025-02-11T00:32:52-08:00
They turned guns into -pipes- - destruction of enemy artillery	The video of the combat work was published on February 11 on the detachment's channel. Inspired by the example of the Magyar Birds, the Phoenix pilots destroyed the guns by burning holes in their barrels. After this, the gun can no longer shoot, it has to change the barrel, and this part is very scarce. Consequently, the capabilities of Russian artillery in the Kharkiv region were reduced. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the -Phoenix- detachment destroyed a lot of Russian armored vehicles. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/11/peretvoryly-garmaty-na-sopilky-znyshhennya-vorozhoyi-artyleriyi/	2025-02-11T00:22:01-08:00

Bohdan Petrenko, the head of the communications department of the 48th separate artillery brigade, told about this on the air of -Social News-. According to him, the weather in general now plays one of the decisive roles in the course of hostilities. So, for example, the soils in the brigade's area of ​​responsibility are mainly black soil, and when warming occurs, passage for any equipment becomes much more difficult. Sometimes the Ukrainian weather actually kills the occupiers. -For example, there was a case when the Russians attacked. It was snowing in the morning, they put on white masks. But by a certain hour the snow had melted. And their white maschalats were kind of white spots on a gray background. This assault was stopped,- Bohdan Petrenko noted. As reported ArmyInform, fighters of the unmanned systems battalion 110 of the mechanized brigade named after Corporal General Mark Bezruchka tracked down in advance the assault group of the occupiers.

The total combat losses of the enemy from 24.02.22 to 11.02.25 are approximately: As reported by ArmyInform, over the past day the enemy lost 1100 soldiers and three air defense systems at once.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/11/vtraty-voroga-za-dobu-sklaly-1390-osib-ta-395-odynycz-vijskovoyi-tehniky/	2025-02-10T21:16:23-08:00
A real revolution in the field of drones: an expert on the unique Ukrainian experience, the newest W...	Military expert Petro Chernyk answered these questions. -In fact, we, Ukrainians, have now carried out a coup in two parts. Part one: the use of FPV drones. The level of skill of various types, both quadcopters and on the wing (UAV type - ed.) has reached so high that aiming takes place - at the head, even at the knee of the enemy. One very serious example for 2024. In the dry weather cycle from conventional May to conventional September, we destroyed more than 4,500 units of enemy artillery. If you divide by 72 - this is how the full-time trunk brigade is completed - then it is more than 60 brigades. This is a fantastic thing, incredible. If, conditionally, until the middle of 2023, the bulk of damage to equipment was done with the help of artillery, then starting from the middle of 2023 - especially for the past year, when the indicators of the production and use of drones by us, Ukrainians, increased 10 times - then 50% of the destruction of all equipment, and sometimes and up to 80% in individual locations of personnel destruction is FPV drones. We are the first, I emphasize, in the world to use these unmanned systems on such a large scale. We are the first in the world to have systems of unmanned complexes starting from the mouth. We have no doubt that we will be the first in the world to form a separate brigade of unmanned systems, because we already have a separate command, as a separate type of the Armed Forces. This is the first revolution that Ukrainians really wrote on their own battlefield in the eternal Russian-Ukrainian war. But there is one more nuance that we somehow ignored, it is no less important. It was with the help of naval drones — the beautiful Magura-5 and C Baby — that we managed to expel the regular Russian fleet, which was considered one of the best in the Black Sea, from their bases in Sevastopol. What is the conclusion? The state, which did not have a classic fleet, solved this problem (regular Russian fleet in the Black Sea - ed.) precisely thanks to unmanned systems. And this is an unprecedented phenomenon in the history of naval warfare. So, let's summarize. Indeed, the phenomenon called -unmanned systems of various types of purpose- is being actualized on our battlefields. It should also be mentioned here that there are not only air and sea, but also ground robotic complexes. In fact, a revolution of a serious global order is taking place. It will determine the logic of hostilities for several decades to come. But there is a nuance. You can't look at these systems as if they were some new Wunderwaffe, which is, they say, everything - now only drones. Artillery will still have meaning and significance. And still the main fire shafts with a powerful coefficient of action, because after all, 3-5 kg ​​of explosives are not equal to a heavy 50-kilogram projectile - will remain in the war as a phenomenon. Not to mention aviation. As Winston Churchill once said, aviation is the cavalry of modern times. Indeed, the sixth generation of aviation is being developed in a binary sense: that there will be both a pilot and an aircraft with an unmanned system based on machine learning. But drones will not fully replace the main strike capabilities of artillery and aviation. Therefore, it is necessary to carefully approach the part that they (UAVs - ed.), they say, have no alternative. This is a serious high-quality weapon that needs to be developed, but we also remember about other weapons systems.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/11/spravzhnya-revolyucziya-u-czaryni-droniv-ekspert-pro-unikalnyj-ukrayinskyj-dosvid-novitnyu-wunderwaffe-ta-4-tysyachi-vorozhyh-stvoliv/	2025-02-10T21:06:08-08:00
The occupiers took a missile carrier with -Calibre- to the Black Sea	This was reported in the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. -There is 1 enemy ship in the Black Sea, which is a carrier of Kalibr cruise missiles with a total salvo of up to 4 missiles,- the message reads. At the same time, there are currently no enemy ships in the Sea of ​​Azov. Five more Russian ships, two of which also carry Kalibr cruise missiles with a total salvo of up to 22 missiles, remain in the Mediterranean. During the day, in the interests of the Russian Federation, passage through the Kerch Strait was carried out: -the Russian Federation continues to violate the International Convention on the Protection of Life at Sea of ​​1974. (SOLAS), turning off automatic identification systems,- the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine noted. As reported by ArmiyaInform, the Commander of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine discussed the security situation in the Black Sea with the Commander-in-Chief of the Swedish Armed Forces.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/11/okupanty-vyvely-u-chorne-more-raketonosij-z-kalibramy/	2025-02-10T21:04:22-08:00
-Innovator- at the front: what the modern Ukrainian armored car is capable of. Report from Donetsk r...	The brigade notes: -Novator- combat vehicles demonstrate good combat capabilities when performing tasks on the front line. -Now, without armored vehicles, it is almost impossible to deliver infantrymen to the front line, transport food or ammunition, and evacuate the wounded. Armor protection, speed and passability on country roads and hard-to-reach areas are especially valuable in cars,- says the driver of -Novator- Kostyantyn. A boy from the Kirovohrad region, mobilized in the Armed Forces since the beginning of the large-scale invasion. Served in the 69th Rifle Battalion, then joined the 117th Brigade. -We work mainly at night and in the morning. Cars in gray weather or even better in fog are not too visible to the enemy, so they are effective for us. Quickly deliver people, weapons and BC to the positions, and just as quickly left the front line. That's it - the task is accomplished,- says Konstantin. The cabin can accommodate 5 military personnel together with the driver. In the rear part, the landing compartment is quite large, designed for 8 people, but 10 soldiers in full equipment and with equipment can fit in there. Plus the transportation of BC, the car can even fit the Stugna-P ATGM, which is a large stationary installation, along with missiles. -The armored car is completely Ukrainian-made, has a basic Ford chassis, has a diesel engine, and an automatic transmission. The maximum speed on the highway is 140 km/h, a very maneuverable car. It can overcome a small swampy area and softened fields, of course, the speed is not the same as on the highway, but it is quite decent. On a normal road, it rips from under itself, but you need to be careful on turns, reduce speed, it can skid. If FPV drones attack, there is a much better chance of running away from them. The armored capsule can withstand shrapnel damage, hits from large-caliber machine guns, and even detonations from anti-tank mines. Fortunately, the boys have not yet had to fall on mines. Infrared lighting is installed for driving at night. By itself, the car is equipped with a EW to counter enemy UAVs and a communication system. Also, the car is equipped with NATO-style anti-mine seats and a fire extinguishing system. Each wheel of the -Innovator- is additionally equipped with rubber that works on the principle of a cushion. If the wheel is punctured by fragments, this cushion allows the car to continue moving without stopping. The 117th brigade received Roshel Senator armored vehicles from Canada as part of international military-technical assistance. These vehicles are also used by infantry and other front-line units. -I traveled on both Rochely and Novatori. I can already compare. The main advantage of the Ukrainian car is its chassis. Springs were installed at the back, so the -Novator- -catches potholes- much more gently. And -Rochelle- has springs, so it is thrown a lot on a bad road. The guys who go in the landing gear are not very comfortable. But instead, more people get into the Canadian armored car. The obvious disadvantage of the Canadian is the high center of mass located at the back, and if you drive carelessly and make a sharp turn, you can turn over on its side. Plus, the car likes to get stuck, it's hard for her, after all, our swampy roads are given. The armor protection of the -Rochelle- is generally sufficient, allowing it to withstand fragments from projectiles, even 122 mm caliber.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/11/novator-na-fronti-na-shho-zdatnyj-suchasnyj-ukrayinskyj-bronovyk-reportazh-z-donechchyny/	2025-02-10T20:45:56-08:00
Achieving Defense Autonomy: Turkey Moves to Mass Production of New Short-Range Air Defense Complex	As informed the authors of the Turkish Defense Agency portal, this system was completely developed in-house to raise Turkey's air defense capabilities to a new level, ArmyInform reports. Haluk Gjorgun, Minister of Defense Industry (SSB), shared the news on social networks, emphasizing the exceptional accuracy of the system in intercepting targets at a sufficiently long distance and at a considerable height. -The results demonstrated the technological maturity of HİSAR-O and the efficiency of Turkey's manufacturing processes. ASELSAN and ROKETSAN, in cooperation with local subcontractors, play a central role in the supply of competitive defense systems,- the Turkish official emphasized. HİSAR-O is a short-range air defense system designed to counter a wide range of threats, including aircraft, helicopters, drones, cruise missiles and air-to-surface munitions. It has a range of 25 km and can intercept targets at an altitude of more than 15 km using missiles equipped with radar and infrared (IIR) guidance. Its equipment includes a fire control center, a radar, three missile launchers, an optical-electronic system, a transport and handling unit. This modular architecture, combined with the ability to engage 360° targets using vertical launchers, provides operational flexibility. According to the analysts of the Dutch portal defense technology research Army Recognition (AR), the system includes advanced technologies such as mid-course navigation through data channels and remote control using wired or wireless communication. It is compatible with Link 1,11B and 16, tactical data lines, working within the framework of an open architecture that allows the integration of future technologies. Integrated testing and simulation systems provide efficient maintenance and high operational readiness, meeting the requirements of modern air defense scenarios. A systematic approach was followed in the development process of HİSAR-O. After the design and qualification tests, the prototypes undergo acceptance tests. The certification of the production line and the stages of pilot production ensure the compatibility of the project with the requirements of large-scale production. These rigorous processes reduce risk and ensure budgets and deadlines are met. In addition, batch testing during production ensures consistent quality and includes on-site feedback for potential adjustments. Compared to systems such as the American Patriot or the Russian S-400, HİSAR-O offers an intermediate solution. With a range of 25 km, it has a shorter radius than the Patriot (160 km) or the S-400 (400 km), but provides excellent mobility thanks to its integration on the chassis of a Mercedes-Benz 6×6 truck. This mobility, according to the experts of the AR portal, combined with simpler logistical support makes the Turkish air defense complex well suited for the tactical and operational needs of the Turkish Armed Forces, in contrast to the more complex requirements for the deployment of the S-400 complex purchased by it from Russia at the time. The transition to mass production of the HİSAR-O demonstrates Turkey's ability to independently design and manufacture advanced defense systems. By strengthening the strategic capabilities of the Turkish Armed Forces while reducing dependence on foreign suppliers, HİSAR-O makes a significant contribution to the country's defense autonomy. This achievement also highlights the growing competitiveness of Turkey's defense industry on the world stage. Testing of the HİSAR-O air defense complex.

What did a shooter with the call sign -Luga- receive -Golden Cross-: about training, fart, friendshi...	-Skillfully commanded the actions of the assault group, due to which the enemy suffered significant losses in manpower and equipment-, - this is how the actions are described, for which the serviceman of the 142nd separate mechanized brigade Vyacheslav with the call sign -Luga- received the Commander-in-Chief's award - -Golden Cross-. It is difficult for Vyacheslav to remember the details of the battle. What for military statistics is success on the ground comes at a price. Then three of his comrades died: -Let me say this - we simply defended our position, giving our comrades the opportunity to gain a foothold and further destroy the enemy. There were two attempts to take our position. We beat them back. That was the task. I just did my job. And how it feels from the inside, I don't want to talk about it. The guys who died are Heroes: Shaman, Olshava, Gypsy.- While working with the second group, Vyacheslav was injured. When he was brought to the evacuation center, it was unexpected for him that he was congratulated and praised. Then he learned about the award. When asked how motivating this is, he jokes that he would be happy to receive motivation in the form of a monetary equivalent: -Not for myself, of course. You understand, we lose all the time. Sometimes to repair cars, then we need to buy some equipment,- and adds: -Of course, awards for soldiers are important—it's attention, because they see you and your work.- &nbsp; Vyacheslav spent most of his life working in the restaurant business in various positions: from waiter to service manager. He had no combat experience before mobilization, but he felt what war was while still a civilian. The man was born in Luhansk, then moved to Kharkiv Oblast. In 2022, he met the large-scale phase of the war in Kupyansk. Recalls how the Russians taught the local population to call the occupation -liberation-. -Whoever spoke to them -incorrectly- was explained by force. They could be stopped and beaten in the middle of the street. They did not care about people's affection, they had enough fear. At the same time, it was clearly visible that there is no unity among the Russians. They are angry at each other. There was a vested interest in making money from the war. When they fled, they abandoned their own - wounded, drunk. Those who could not get into the trucks were simply thrown at checkpoints. People then wrapped such drunkards with scotch tape and handed them over to our military,- Vyacheslav recalls. Joined the Defense Forces in July 2023. At first he was a cook. But due to the lack of people, he ended up in the infantry. Now he is a shooter with the call sign -Luga- (in memory of his hometown - ed.). -BZVP was held in part. The instructors all had combat experience and were indifferent to their work. For the fact that I managed to persevere in difficult moments, I am now grateful, including to them. Many say that in such a war, luck determines a large percentage. To me, the concept of a fart is like a cat's life. Someone has 9 of them, and someone has only one. But if you are not prepared, no fart will help you. Preparation, attention, concentration are the real keys to accomplishing the task and coming back alive,- Vyacheslav believes. Vyacheslav studied in the Czech Republic for another month, although, he laughs, at that stage Ukrainians could already teach foreign colleagues something. -They didn't expect the way we -navigated- them at practice. They were surprised. It's nice when professional soldiers are beaten by yesterday's civilians. So we have the spirit and flair.- Vyacheslav talks about the need for psychological work with fighters. He himself would not hesitate to contact a specialist. But in parts of psychologists who actually work by specialty, there are few, and during rehabilitation - how lucky. The fighter himself says that when he was treated after his injury, communication with a psychologist was -for a tick- - a standard test survey. Meanwhile, tension levels are high and trigger situations abound. -I was on examination in Dnipro. I was going to the train station in a tram. And the conductor spoke to me, at first it seemed as if everything was normal, a person worried that the front was approaching. And suddenly he says: -we would have already surrendered the city and everything.- So that people are not afraid of destruction.- And I ask her: -What do you think would happen to the military personnel who are here in hospitals and hospitals?- Do you understand that they would be killed?-. And she says: -I didn't think about it-.. You can still find this kind of thinking in people.- Vyacheslav laughs, if he has to deal with psychological problems himself, then the way is simple - to occupy himself with something. For the opportunity to go for a walk and just look around. Call loved ones. He perfectly understands that, like most of his brothers, he postpones painful reflection - dwelling on grief and loss for later. All together, they save themselves with humor and mutual support. -I was lucky to experience true brotherhood. Of course, civil collectives happened to be different. They were also quite friendly. But people there did not become close to each other so quickly and so much, as here. During a year and a half of service, I saw interaction, mutual understanding. Disputes are resolved much more calmly than in ordinary life. What brings people together the most? I will tell you this: after the first exit to zero, the question of whether someone -sent- someone does not arise. But friendship in war has a painful side, and that is losses.- Vyacheslav replaced the struggle with fears in his mind with the philosophical -must, then must-: -It's scary until you enter the battle, then there are no thoughts. Focused on the task of survival for you and those with you. Covers after a few days of silence and awareness. You understand where you came from. Every exit is different. But once you've experienced this delayed fear, it's a normal, healthy feeling that you don't want that experience to happen again. That is, you have to overcome this, not fear. Pick yourself up and go again.- Vyacheslav dreams of returning to civilian life and opening his own bakery. And while he ponders philosophical questions about how to stand when those who are like dogs have been pitted against you for years, and a large part of your society is just learning to make complex adult decisions. In his opinion, the issue of psychological readiness is critical: -Psychological preparation is needed. Appropriate selection is required and physical and professional skills are secondary. Because no matter how diligent a person is on the range, if he drops his weapon when he has to cover his comrades, it can turn into a tragedy. There are people who cannot psychologically cross a certain barrier. And they won't be able to. My personal position is that there is only one harm from a hare sitting under a bush. I've seen them. Most of them are already -two hundred-. They cannot shoot at the enemy, even when they are being shot at. When moving around the landing, it is a burden that falls into a stupor, runs away, hides, screams. And we can't throw them away. What is the point of this to the state? Some costs, I will say harshly. The selection must be realistic. You can still deal with -I don't want to join the army, let my neighbor go,- but not with stupor. The shooter should shoot at a person, not at a target on the shooting range. As an enemy do not name - this is the same person on two legs with two hands. We see the enemy very close. Any indecision is your death or the death of your brothers.- When asked whether he thinks he has become a fatalist, Vyacheslav answers with a smile: -If you are destined to die by choking on a spoonful of soup, you will not drown in a puddle. If I was destined to die from the reset, then so be it. For me, to be afraid is simply to waste vital energy and time for no apparent reason. To clarify the relationship with oneself. You have to live here and now. In actions and deeds. Such times fell to us. Kyiv was already taken in three days, and they received a cap at a time. So, we can -take it easy- more. And we will be-.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/11/za-shho-otrymav-zolotyj-hrest-strilecz-z-pozyvnym-luga-pro-pidgotovku-fart-druzhbu-na-vijni-ta-mriyu-pro-pekarnyu/	2025-02-10T20:10:59-08:00

An article about this was apparently published by a German publication. But the source referred to by the propagandists does not have any real evidence of such an event, including official registers, contracts or public data that would confirm it. Furthermore, the material has neither the posting date nor the author, which is a typical sign of disinformation. In addition, the site, which is used as the primary source of news, does not contain any contacts, and the specified names appearing on it are fictitious. Similar fakes are regularly distributed by the enemy with the aim of discrediting and demonizing the President of Ukraine and his family. Yes, in October of last year, a fake was actively spreading on the Internet that Volodymyr Zelensky allegedly bought Hitler's state car for 15 million dollars. In November, enemy propaganda tried to convince its consumers that the President of Ukraine allegedly bought the Palace Des Neiges hotel in the ski resort of Courchevel in France for 88 million euros. And in January, the enemy spread a fake about the alleged purchase by the President of a -villa with an underground bunker- for 17 million euros on the -island of billionaires- Saint Barthelemy.

It is noted that a 36-year-old resident of Lviv Oblast undertook to prepare a package of documents and further escort through one of the checkpoints in Lviv Oblast for a citizen of Ukraine of conscription age for $1,500. -The woman promised the client that she would help remove him from the military register and secure an invitation for employment in Germany,- the report said. During the searches, law enforcement officers seized mobile phones, bank cards, as well as other things that can be used as evidence in criminal proceedings. -Currently, the person involved in the case has been notified of suspicion for h. 3 Art. 332 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (Illegal transportation of persons across the state border). The sanction of the article provides for punishment in the form of deprivation of liberty for a period of seven to nine years.

A Russian propagandist who called on the enemy to turn Sumy into a -dead zone- was sentenced	The SBU informs about this on February 10. According to the investigation, in June 2023, Mikheev called on the command of the occupation groups of the Russian Federation to carry out a series of massive rocket-bomb and artillery strikes on Sumy. -In this way, the attacker proposed to turn the frontline Ukrainian city into a -dead zone- in which, according to him, -no living people should remain.- Mikheev, who positions himself as a -political scientist-, made this thesis public during one of his broadcasts on the Kremlin's mouthpiece, Vesti FM, the SBU said. In addition, he regularly appears on Solovyov's propaganda talk shows, where he calls for the continuation of airstrikes and shelling of civilian infrastructure in the border areas of Ukraine. On the basis of the collected evidence, the court found Mikheev guilty of committing a crime under Art. 2 Art. 110 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (encroachment on the territorial integrity and inviolability of Ukraine) and sentenced him to 8 years of imprisonment. -Since the perpetrator is hiding in Russia, comprehensive measures are underway to bring him to responsibility for crimes against our state,- the message reads. As reported by ArmyInform, an enemy agent was detained in Donetsk who was correcting Russian airstrikes on Kramatorsk.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/10/zasudzheno-moskovskogo-propagandysta-yakyj-zaklykav-rosiyan-peretvoryty-sumshhynu-na-mertvu-zonu/	2025-02-10T11:21:07-08:00

The return of the Ukrainian flag to the -Centralna- mine is another step towards the liberation of the entire territory of Ukraine from the Russian occupiers. The -Centralna- mine is a historical symbol of Donbas, its age reaches more than 150 years. Placing a blue-yellow flag over it means that Ukraine is returning to its land, that the history of the struggle for freedom continues, and that victory will be ours.

Volodymyr Zelenskyi: Ukraine is strengthening security guarantees and preparing for important intern...	This is reported on the website of the official online representation of the President of Ukraine. The next week will be important for Ukraine in the field of international security. As early as Wednesday, negotiations with allies will start - both in the format of the Contact Group on Defense of Ukraine -Ramstein- and during meetings in Kyiv. On the agenda is the strengthening of military support, the expansion of arms supplies and the strengthening of the Ukrainian army. A key event will be Ukraine's participation in the Munich Security Conference, one of the world's main platforms for discussing security issues. Volodymyr Zelenskyi emphasized that Ukraine is working on consolidating international support, increasing sanctions pressure on Russia and obtaining additional resources for defense. -It is important for all of us to work together for the sake of real peace and effective security guarantees - the safety of people, the safety of our state, the safety of economic relations and our resource sustainability,- the president emphasized. Along with security issues, Ukraine continues to receive financial support from international partners. The President reported on the meeting with the head of the European Investment Bank, as a result of which the allocation of another 2 billion dollars was agreed upon.

Under fire and with a flashlight: how a combat medic - Historian - saved his comrades	The story of the soldier was made public on the page of the Land Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. One of the first combat forays into the trenches was most remembered by the Historian. Then the position was attacked by an enemy drone, and the fighter received a shrapnel wound almost under the armpit. The historian had to perform an operation to remove the fragment. Everything happened at night, under fire, in a cold dugout, by the light of a lantern. The medic, working on adrenaline, managed: the fighter survived and is already back in action. The historian joined the army in 2023. In the 141st OMBr, he underwent training, combat coordination and, without hesitation, decided to become a combat medic. It was his own decision - not just to be in the line, but to save lives at ground zero. Under fire, in cold dugouts and in firing positions, he is the first to come to the rescue: he pulls the wounded out of the fire, stops the bleeding, and brings his comrades back to life. Before the full-scale war, the soldier studied at the history faculty, worked as a guide, and was fascinated by the past. But when it was time to act, he chose the path of a defender. Now he himself has become part of a great story. As reported by ArmyInform, a soldier with the call sign -Fox-, platoon chief sergeant of the 128th separate of the Transcarpathian Mountain Assault Brigade, shared his thoughts about the war, comrades and dodgers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/10/pid-obstrilamy-ta-z-lihtarem-yak-bojovyj-medyk-istoryk-vryatuvav-pobratyma/	2025-02-10T10:02:02-08:00

-Water is a luxury-: 220,000 people were left without water at the TOT of Luhansk Oblast due to the ...	This was reported by the head of the Luhansk OVA, Artem Lysogor. Last week, Russian security forces detained the head of the Severodonetsk occupation administration, accusing him of forming a criminal group behind the murders of 11 people, kidnappings, extortion and embezzlement. However, as it turned out, he did not manage to collect enough money to escape - and the Russians decided to -deal with- another traitor. According to reports from the occupied territories, the other day he allegedly attempted suicide in a pre-trial detention center. If this information is true, it is further confirmation that the Kremlin uses collaborators for its own purposes, and then ruthlessly disposes of them when they become inconvenient. While the occupiers are dealing with their own oppressors, the residents of the temporarily captured cities of Luhansk region are once again on the verge of a humanitarian disaster. Due to the accident on the power lines, the pumping stations that supplied water to Khrustalny, Anthracite, Bryanka, Almaznaya, Petrovo-Krasnosillia and 40% of Kadiivka were cut off. As a result, more than 220,000 people were left without drinking water. The most interesting thing is that this region has not experienced hostilities or shelling - the whole problem is that during more than 10 years of occupation, Russia has not even tried to maintain critical infrastructure. Pipes, stations, power grids are deteriorating due to the complete inaction of the occupation authorities. Problems that could have been prevented with routine repairs are now becoming a real disaster for local residents. As reported by ArmyInform, the Russians continue to implement their best corruption traditions in the temporarily occupied territories of Luhansk region. Now they have officially legalized the robbery of housing, handing over -ownerless- property, and at the same time for ten years they -forget- to pay debts to state employees.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/10/voda-cze-rozkish-na-tot-luganshhyny-220-tysyach-lyudej-zalyshylysya-bez-vody-cherez-bajduzhist-okupantiv/	2025-02-10T09:23:46-08:00

In particular, specialists of the Center of Excellence for Mine Action and Environmental Safety took samples of environmental components. For this, they used equipment received from international partners. The experts of the Center shared the knowledge gained during the training with representatives of the State Environmental Inspection of the Southern District (Zaporizhia and Kherson regions). -The training took place within the framework of the activities of the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) in Ukraine. The organization was supported by the Belgian Nicole Foundation and the NGO -Institute of Public Policy and Consulting-, the report says. As a reminder, on June 6, 2023, the Russian occupying forces committed one of the largest environmental crimes of the 21st century — we blew up the dam of Kakhovskaya HPP. As a result of its destruction, more than 75,000 hectares of land were flooded. The devastating flood caused the destruction of the habitats of many species of animals and plants, pollution and littering of large areas. A lot of pollutants, harmful substances, oil products got into the soil. As a result of the flood, thousands of mines and explosive objects were washed away and ended up under the soil layer.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/10/pidryv-kahovskoyi-ges-vijskovi-ekology-projshly-navchannya-zi-zboru-dokaziv-zlochynu-armiyi-rf/	2025-02-10T09:04:53-08:00

It is often necessary to quickly make decisions on which the lives of soldiers depend. -I don't just provide first aid. If there is even the slightest complaint, the guys can contact me at any time.

And even now, despite the service, she continues to help. -I collected funds for frontline aid, supported the de-occupied territories, and now I also donate to charity initiatives. -I recently helped the Ark shelter in Odessa, which collects funds for laboratory equipment to save animals,- she says. Despite all the hardships of the war, -Chantal- finds solace in creativity. She paints pictures, writes books and even organized her own exhibition, the money from which she gave to charity. -Drawing and writing books is my way of dealing with stress. My dream is to create an art therapy center for military personnel and their families. This is important, because art helps to recover not only physically, but also emotionally,- she shares. Currently, -Chantal- is fully committed to the service, but is thinking about what will happen next. She dreams of returning to Odessa, doing art and continuing to help those in need. -I hope that the war will end already this year. In the meantime, I'm doing everything in my power to make that day come as soon as possible,- she concludes.

Yuriy, like many other Ukrainians, went to war -for the company- with a godfather who received a summons. However, this decision was not spontaneous. According to -Bald-, he always felt responsible for his country and was ready to defend it. Yuriy's first combat missions fell on the eve of Easter. At a time when the whole country was celebrating, he and his brothers held the defense on the battlefield. -Our first event in Bahmut was the night before Easter. People celebrated Passover, and we, together with our brothers, performed a combat mission. Then everything happened quickly. It was very hot around, we were being fired upon. I remember how on the go I jumped into Roshel and tore my back,- the soldier recalls. Despite the injury, Yuriy did not stay behind. -They didn't take me, I went to the doctors, got a few shots in the back and asked for a position with another group. My brothers clearly did not expect to see me there, they were surprised. But it was on this day that I agreed,- says -Bald-. During one of the combat missions, Yuri single-handedly cleared the position occupied by the occupiers. -All the young guys were with me, I didn't want them to take any risks and I went alone. He threw two grenades through the door, three from above through the hole. Three occupiers were eliminated, one remained. He was wounded, I heard him squeak. I asked my brothers to bring more BC, and I shouted to him to surrender, because I would throw a grenade. He came out with his hands raised,- the border guard recalls. During the search of the prisoner, Yuriy discovered that he was well equipped and had narcotic substances with him. According to the prisoner, all Russian soldiers received such -stimulants-. After the battles in Bakhmut, Yuriy realized that the Ukrainian military does not need artificial stimulants, because they are motivated by nature to protect their land and their families. -After Bakhmut, Yuriy understood one simple truth: Ukrainians, unlike Russians, do not need any stimulation, because we are naturally motivated to protect our family and our home,- the message reads. Yuriy is currently serving in the Vovchansk region as a machine gunner in the crew of the Roshel armored car. He is convinced that the Motherland must be defended until the last breath, until the last occupier on our land.

In Kyiv, the prospect of Russia's disintegration was discussed at the Banderiv readings	The participants of the event discussed the history and prospects of the struggle of the peoples enslaved by Russia for their independence. Banderiv readings were held in Kyiv for the twelfth time, they were started during the Revolution of Dignity. For the second year in a row, researchers have been developing and justifying scenarios of the disintegration of the Russian Federation in their reports and during panel discussions. This time, representatives of peoples enslaved by Moscow, who have been fighting for their freedom and independence for many years, have long since become dissidents and are persecuted by Putin's regime, have been involved. The participants of the readings are convinced: only the disintegration of the Russian Federation into dozens of independent states will be a real Victory and the final point in the Russian-Ukrainian war. Recently, more and more military personnel, scientists, and politicians in the world are inclined to this opinion. Recently, during a meeting with students, the ambassador of Ukraine to Great Britain, General Valery Zaluzhny, spoke about this: -Our victory is the collapse of Russia into 27, and preferably 69 principalities, before taking away nuclear weapons from it...-. Each people, nation, on whose land the Moscow occupier came, made a desperate, sometimes more than a century, resistance to the empire. And Moscow, unfortunately, systematically destroyed the disobedient, encouraged traitors, and rewrote history. Only the current Russian-Ukrainian war has opened up a unique opportunity for peoples enslaved by Russia - to throw off the yoke of Moscow colonialism and imperialism and finally become masters of their own destiny on their land. The event began with greetings from the co-organizers - the participants were addressed by Yuriy Syrotyuk - the initiator of the Banderiv readings, chief sergeant of the fire support company of the 5th separate assault brigade of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, director of the non-governmental analytical center -Ukrainian Studies of Strategic Studies- and Oleg Medunytsia - head of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (Banderivites), President of the Anti-Imperial Bloc of Peoples.

Also, on the first day, the finalists of the traditional Youth Essay Competition on the topic of readings were awarded. This year, the first place was taken by an active serviceman, captain of the ZSU, Oleksiy Tkachenko. They also presented signal copies of the book -Involuntary Joining: The History of the Liberation Struggle of Peoples Enslaved by Russia.- This is the first comprehensive publication in Ukraine, which introduces the centuries-old history of the liberation struggle of peoples enslaved by Russia, none of whom voluntarily wanted to become part of the empire and used the slightest chance to try to gain independence and freedom from their enslaver and colonizer. &nbsp; The second day was dedicated to the prospects of the national liberation struggle at the current stage. Researchers of Russian colonialism and the struggle against it, as well as representatives of national liberation formations of peoples enslaved by Moscow, took part in the discussion. Among them: Ruslan Gabbasov, head of the Committee of the Bashkir National Movement Abroad, one of the founders of the -Bashkort- organization; Rafis Kashapov, Prime Minister of the Government of Independent Tatarstan in exile, a political prisoner of the Kremlin regime, Jambulat Suleymanov, a veteran of the wars with Russia in the Caucasus, the leader of the Chechen national liberation movement -United Force- and others. Political scientists and public figures currently serving in the Armed Forces discussed with them: Yuriy Syrotyuk, Yuriy Oliynyk, Mykhailo Basarab. Finally, the partner of this year's Bander readings, the Anti-Imperial Bloc of Peoples, held a panel of teachers and graduates of the University of Free Peoples under the title -Actual issues of the national liberation struggle of peoples enslaved by Russia at the present stage-. Should we die in Russian captivity, being a blind tool in the hands of the Kremlin, powerless on our land, deprived of language, history, identity or remember the glory of our ancestors and fight for freedom- &#8211; the convinced initiator of the Banderiv readings, chief sergeant of the fire support company of the 5th separate Kyiv assault brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Yuriy Syrotyuk.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/10/u-kyyevi-na-banderivskyh-chytannyah-obgovoryly-perspektyvu-rozpadu-rosiyi/	2025-02-10T07:51:03-08:00

A funny episode with a Russian occupier who decided to -teas- our reconnaissance Mavik deserves special attention. -A cheeky or drunken occupier who didn't even hide, but teased our reconnaissance Mavik.- The payoff was quick and hellish,- the team noted. As reported by ArmyInform, servicemen of the 3rd separate tank brigade continue to demonstrate their skill in destroying Russian equipment and manpower.

-Motorcycle blitzkrieg- in Russian: how the -loud- attack of the occupiers in Donetsk ended	This is discussed in a post on the brigade's page. The action begins with three Russian soldiers being sent to attack Ukrainian positions. However, instead of armored vehicles, they are issued&#8230; two motorcycles. The commanders assure: -But you will move quickly, at such a speed no one will be able to catch you.- The task is simple: to quickly cross the field under fire. To the accompaniment of explosions and epic music, the -assault group- rushes forward. However, the ending is predictable: the Ukrainian fighters precisely work on their goals, and the attack collapses right in front of our eyes. The command of the Russians watches the battle live and in desperation shouts into the radio: -Crawl! Don't lie for revenge!

The Kursk operation interferes with raids, but Sumy is suffering from artillery and airstrikes	Andriy Demchenko, the spokesman of the State Border Service of Ukraine, told about this on the air of the Yedyni Novyni telethon. According to Demchenko, earlier there were attempts by the enemy to approach our border line, but they ended unsuccessfully and the enemy gave up such actions. However, the occupiers continue to shell the northern border with artillery on a daily basis. Sumy region suffers the most. -In those places where the defense forces conduct an offensive operation across the borders, the number of shelling decreases, because the enemy cannot actively use artillery. Regarding the Sumy direction, we are observing the continued activity of the enemy's use of aviation. In a certain way, airstrikes have also increased within the borders of Chernihiv region,- Andriy Demchenko said.

A psychotherapist and a deacon went to the pre-trial detention center — Kharkiv was cleared of two t...	The office of the Prosecutor General of Ukraine reported this on February 10. According to the investigation, a psychotherapist at one of the Kharkiv medical facilities was recruited by a representative of the Russian special service several years ago and acted in the interests of the aggressor state. The task of the enemy agent was to collect information about the location of Ukrainian defenders and military equipment, routes of movement of Ukrainian defenders and their personal data. During the performance of his direct duties, in order to find out the necessary information, the doctor, in particular, asked for it from his patients, including servicemen of the Armed Forces who were undergoing rehabilitation. The medical worker took his close friend, a deacon of the Kharkiv Diocese of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (MP), as an -assistant-, who also secretly obtained information about defenders from the parishioners, and then passed it on to the doctor. The psychotherapist prepared a general -report-, which he sent to the direct curator from the Russian Federation. It was also established that the doctor justified the armed aggression of the Russian Federation, expressing contempt for Ukrainians and talking about the need to -liberate- the territories of our state. The illegal nature of the man's statements was confirmed by the conclusion of the relevant examination. The suspects were found at their places of residence and evidence of illegal activities was seized. Currently, preventive measures have been chosen for them in the form of detention without bail. As reported by ArmyInform, a traitorous singer went to court who had more than 9 hectares of land and 9 songs taken from her.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/10/psyhoterapevt-ta-dyyakon-poyihaly-u-sizo-harkiv-ochystyly-vid-dvoh-zradnykiv/	2025-02-10T00:58:57-08:00

-History shows that ceasefires with Russia do not guarantee lasting peace-. An interview with Admira...	During his meeting with Ukrainian political and military leaders, Admiral Cavo Dragone discussed the needs of the Ukrainian Defense Forces and security sector reforms, and saw the capabilities and characteristics of Ukraine&#8217;s long-range weapons. In an interview with ArmyInform, Admiral Cavo Dragone spoke about the urgent needs of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, assessed Ukraine&#8217;s strikes on Russian military targets and the likelihood of negotiations on a peaceful settlement of the war. — What will be your priorities as Chair of the NATO Military Committee, and what are the key challenges now? — As Chair of the NATO Military Committee, my top priority will be ensuring that Ukraine will continue to receive the supports it needs to be in the strongest position, while maintaining NATO’s readiness to deter any threats to Allied territory. The situation on the battlefield remains difficult, with Ukraine holding parts of the Kursk region while facing ongoing Russian advances and air attacks on its power grid. The current key challenges include maintaining the strongest NATO momentum in support for Ukraine, countering hybrid threats such as cyberattacks and sabotage, and ensuring strong NATO defense capabilities. Russia's reliance on support from North Korea, Iran, and China highlights the global nature of the threats we face. Strengthening NATO's deterrence posture, particularly on the eastern flank, and increasing defense production remains critical. We are adapting to ensure we can deter and defend against a broad and evolving range of threats, including in the context of gray-zone or hybrid warfare tactics, with clear destabilization objectives. These threats include international terrorism and terror groups, threats from the South, and challenges in the Arctic, which demand a 360-degree security approach. — What do you see as the main challenges in maintaining Ukraine&#8217;s defensive capabilities? — The primary challenge is ensuring a continuous and predictable supply of military aid, including ammunition, air defense systems, and long-range strike capabilities. Ukraine's forces intercept Russian missile and drone attacks daily, but air defense stocks must be replenished. Another key challenge is Russia's sustained pressure on multiple fronts. Over 700,000 Russian soldiers have been killed or wounded since February 2022. The introduction of North Korean troops is a dangerous development, demonstrating Putin’s reliance on external forces. Russia’s attacks on Ukraine’s infrastructure also weaken its defense production and energy sector. This is why at the Washington Summit last year, Allies agreed a robust package of support for Ukraine for the long haul: — What are the most critical types of military aid that NATO and its member states should prioritize for Ukraine? — Allies are strongly committed to further strengthen Ukraine's defense and we welcome any announcements to provide Ukraine with additional military capabilities. We saw great examples at the last meeting in Ramstein – from the US, Canada, Latvia, the UK and others. We see clearly that Ukraine needs advanced air defense systems, long-range precision strike capabilities, and increased artillery and ammunition supplies. Given Russia's continued missile and drone attacks, NATO and Allies must ensure Ukraine has sufficient air defense to protect its infrastructure. Ukraine also requires sustained deliveries of 155 mm artillery shells, armored vehicles, and long-range weapons to strike Russian military targets. To enhance long-term sustainability, NATO must also support Ukraine in developing its domestic defense production. — How does NATO assess the use and impact of F-16s on the battlefield? — The introduction of F-16s into Ukraine's air force has strengthened its ability to contest Russian air power, intercept enemy aircraft, and strike military targets effectively. These jets are particularly valuable in countering missile and drone barrages. However, their full impact depends on sufficient pilot training, maintenance capabilities, and continued supplies of weapons and spare parts. NATO has facilitated training and logistics support to maximize their effectiveness. — How do Ukraine's strikes on military targets in Russia affect the aggressor's ability to continue the war? — Ukraine's strikes on military targets inside Russia are a legitimate form of self-defense under international law. These attacks disrupt Russian logistics, weaken its ability to launch further assaults, and force Moscow to allocate more resources to its own defense. While these strikes alone may not end the war, they impose significant costs on Russia by targeting fuel depots, airbases, and ammunition stockpiles. Russia's growing battlefield losses, combined with mounting pressure on its defense industry, are gradually degrading its long-term military capabilities. — How long does NATO estimate Russia can continue its war against Ukraine? What are Russia's losses? — Russia has suffered over 700,000 casualties since February 2022, including killed and wounded soldiers. Thousands of tanks, armored vehicles, and aircraft have been destroyed, and the Russian navy has been pushed out of large parts of the Black Sea. Despite these losses, Russia continues the war with support from North Korea, Iran, and China. However, sustaining such high attrition levels is unsustainable in the long run. Continued military support for Ukraine will further degrade Russia’s war-fighting capabilities, placing Ukraine in a stronger position when negotiations occur. Our focus needs to be on supporting the end of the war is to ensure Ukraine can enter any negotiations from a position of strength. — What is NATO’s assessment of North Korea’s involvement in the war? How can its support for Russia be stopped? — North Korea is supplying Russia with ammunition, missiles, and even personnel, escalating the conflict. This poses a significant threat, allowing Russia to replenish its stocks despite heavy losses. It is also another breach of UN Security Council resolutions and a dangerous expansion of Russia&#8217;s war. NATO has called on Russia and North Korea to cease these actions immediately. Stopping North Korea's involvement requires tightening sanctions, increasing diplomatic pressure on China, and intercepting arms shipments through intelligence and naval cooperation. Strengthening deterrence measures against North Korea is necessary to discourage further military collaboration with Russia. — What could be NATO&#8217;s role if individual member states decide to participate in a peacekeeping mission in Ukraine? — Recommend to shift the focus towards bolstering support to Ukraine, so that it is in the strongest position possible when it reaches the negotiation table for peace talks. Discussions about what follows after this depend on how strong Ukraine's hand can be at the table. And to ensure Ukraine has agency in deciding ultimately what comes next once peace talks conclude, on Ukraine's terms. NATO's focus remains on strengthening Ukraine's military capabilities, rather than deploying peacekeeping forces in an active war zone. — Russia has been making statements about its alleged readiness to negotiate, but at the same time it has set the condition that Ukraine cannot be a member of NATO. Should talks begin under such conditions? — Ukraine has the sole right to decide the terms of any peace talks. NATO fully supports Ukraine's sovereignty and rejects any conditions that would force it to renounce its future security. History shows that ceasefires with Russia do not guarantee lasting peace. The best way to bring Russia to negotiations under favorable conditions is to ensure Ukraine remains strong militarily. Furthermore, Ukraine's path to NATO membership is irreversible, as affirmed at the Washington Summit. — If a new U.S. administration reduces military aid, is NATO prepared to compensate? — At the Washington Summit NATO committed to long-term support for Ukraine, with Allies pledging a minimum of 40 billion euros in security assistance for 2024. The NATO Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine (NSATU) assumed responsibilities in December. While I will not speculate on potential changes in U.S. policy, NATO is working to ensure aid is evenly distributed and sustainable. The establishment of NSATU demonstrates NATO's commitment to long-term support regardless of political changes in individual member states. Ukraine's security is our security, and we remain steadfast in our support.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/10/history-shows-that-ceasefires-with-russia-do-not-guarantee-lasting-peace-an-interview-with-admiral-giuseppe-cavo-dragone-chair-of-the-nato-military-committee/	2025-02-09T20:43:37-08:00
Arms supply, F-16 effectiveness and Russian losses in Ukraine: interview with the head of the NATO M...	He headed the committee only three weeks ago and made his first foreign visit to Ukraine. This is a clear signal that NATO will play an increasing role in the coordination and delivery of military aid to Ukraine, in particular through the new structure in Wiesbaden. At a meeting with Ukrainian political and military leaders, Admiral Dragone discussed the needs of the Defense Forces of Ukraine and reforms in the security sector, as well as got acquainted with the capabilities and characteristics of Ukrainian long-range weapons with his own eyes. In an exclusive interview with ArmiyaInform Admiral Giuseppe Cavo Dragone spoke about the urgent needs of the Armed Forces, assessed Ukraine's strikes on Russian military facilities and the likelihood of negotiations on a peaceful settlement of the war. — What will be your priorities as the head of the NATO Military Committee and what are the key challenges facing you? — As the head of the NATO Military Committee, my priority will be to ensure the further support Ukraine needs for to be in the strongest position while maintaining NATO's readiness to contain any threats to the Alliance's territory. The situation on the battlefield remains difficult: Ukraine holds part of the Kursk region, while dealing with a constant Russian offensive and airstrikes on the power grid. Among the current key tasks is to maintain the strongest NATO momentum in support of Ukraine, countering hybrid threats such as cyberattacks and sabotage, and the provision of powerful NATO defense forces and assets. Russia's dependence on support from North Korea, Iran, and China underscores the global nature of the threats we face. Therefore, it remains critical for us to strengthen NATO's deterrence capabilities, especially on the eastern flank, and to increase defense production. We are adapting to ensure our ability to deter and defend against a wide and changing range of threats, including in the context of -gray zone- tactics or hybrid warfare with clear destabilization goals. Among these threats are international terrorism and terrorist groups, threats from the South and challenges in the Arctic, which require an integrated approach to security. — What do you see as problematic issues in maintaining Ukraine's defense capability? — The primary challenge is to ensure a continuous and predictable supply of military aid, including ammunition, air defense systems, and means for lesions over long distances. Ukrainian defense forces are intercepting Russian missiles and drones every day, but the stockpile of air defense equipment needs to be replenished. Another key challenge is the constant pressure from Russia on many fronts. Since February 2022, more than 700,000 Russian soldiers have been killed or wounded. The involvement of North Korean troops is a dangerous development that demonstrates Putin's dependence on external forces. Russia's attacks on Ukraine's infrastructure are also weakening its defense production and energy sector. That is why, at the Washington Summit last year, Alliance members agreed on a powerful long-term support package for Ukraine: — What are the most important types of military aid that NATO and its member states should prioritize for Ukraine? — Alliance members are determined to further strengthen Ukraine's defense capabilities, and we welcome any announcements on providing Ukraine with additional military capabilities. We saw great examples at the last Ramstein meeting from the USA, Canada, Latvia, Great Britain and other countries. We clearly see that Ukraine needs modern air defense systems, the ability to deliver high-precision long-range strikes, as well as increased supplies of artillery and ammunition. Given the ongoing missile and drone attacks by Russia, NATO and Allies must provide Ukraine with sufficient air defenses to protect its infrastructure. Ukraine also needs stable supplies 155-mm artillery shells, armored vehicles and long-range weapons to hit Russian military facilities. In order to strengthen long-term stability, NATO should also support Ukraine in the development of its domestic defense production. — Half a year ago, Ukraine received the first F-16 fighter jets from its partners. How does NATO evaluate the effectiveness of the use of these aircraft? — F-16 aircraft, which have entered the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, have increased the ability to counter Russian air threats, intercept enemy aircraft and deliver effective strikes on military targets. These aircraft are especially valuable in countering missile strikes and drone strikes. However, their full the impact (on the situation at the front, — ed.) depends on sufficient pilot training, maintenance capabilities and continuous supply of weapons and spare parts. NATO contributes to the training of pilots and technical personnel and logistical support to ensure the maximum efficiency of these aircraft. — How Ukraine's strikes on military facilities in Russia affect the aggressor's ability to continue war? — Strikes by Ukraine on military facilities on the territory of Russia are a legitimate form of self-defense in accordance with international law. These attacks undermine Russian logistics, weaken its ability to carry out further attacks, and force Moscow to devote more resources to its own defense. While these strikes cannot end the war by themselves, they do significant damage to Russia, as their targets are fuel depots, air bases, and ammunition stocks. Russia's mounting battlefield losses, combined with increasing pressure on its defense industry, are gradually eroding its long-term military capabilities. — How long does NATO estimate Russia can continue the war against Ukraine? What are Russia's losses? - Since February 2022, Russia has lost more than 700,000 soldiers killed and wounded. Thousands of tanks, armored vehicles, and aircraft were destroyed, and the Russian fleet was forced out of most of the Black Sea. Despite these losses, Russia continues the war with the support of North Korea, Iran, and China. However, in the long term, it will be difficult for Russia to continue to ignore such a high level of casualties. Continuing military support for Ukraine will lead to further deterioration of Russia's military capabilities and will put Ukraine in a stronger position during negotiations. We must focus on supporting the end of the war to ensure Ukraine is able to enter any negotiations from a position of strength. — Have North Korean soldiers been involved in the war against Ukraine since the beginning of the year? How to stop North Korea from further supporting Russia? — North Korea supplies Russia with ammunition, missiles and even personnel. This poses a significant threat, allowing Russia to replenish its reserves amid heavy losses. This is also another violation of UN Security Council resolutions and a dangerous extension of Russia's war. NATO called on Russia and North Korea to immediately stop these actions. Ending North Korea's involvement requires increased sanctions, increased diplomatic pressure on China, and the interception of arms supplies through intelligence and naval cooperation. Strengthening deterrence against North Korea is necessary to prevent further military cooperation with Russia. — What might NATO's role be if individual member states decide to participate in a peacekeeping mission in Ukraine? — We recommend shifting the emphasis to strengthening support for Ukraine so that it has the strongest possible position when it sits down at the negotiating table for a peaceful settlement of the conflict. The discussion of what will happen after that will depend on how strong Ukraine's position at the negotiating table will be. And from the extent to which Ukraine will be able to independently decide what will happen after the end of the peace negotiations, on its own terms. NATO continues to focus on strengthening the military capabilities of Ukraine, and not on the deployment of peacekeeping forces in the zone of active hostilities. — There are statements from Russia about the alleged readiness for negotiations, but at the same time the condition is set that Ukraine cannot be a member of NATO. Should we start negotiations with such demands? — Ukraine has the exclusive right to determine the terms of any peace negotiations. NATO fully supports Ukraine's sovereignty and rejects any conditions that would force it to give up its future security. History shows that a ceasefire with Russia does not guarantee lasting peace. The best way to bring Russia into negotiations on favorable terms is to ensure that Ukraine remains militarily strong. Furthermore, Ukraine's path to NATO membership is irreversible, as confirmed at the Washington Summit. — If the new US administration cuts military aid to Ukraine, is NATO prepared to compensate? — At the Washington NATO Summit made a commitment to long-term support for Ukraine, with Alliance members pledging at least 40 billion euros in security assistance until 2024. In December, the NATO Security Assistance and Support Program for Ukraine (NSATU) began operating. I will not speculate on potential changes in US policy, but NATO is working to ensure that aid is evenly distributed and sustainable. The creation of NSATU demonstrates NATO's commitment to long-term support regardless of political changes in individual member states. The security of Ukraine is our security, and we remain steadfast in our support.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/10/postachannya-zbroyi-efektyvnist-f-16-i-vtraty-rf-v-ukrayini-intervyu-z-golovoyu-vijskovogo-komitetu-nato/	2025-02-09T20:42:35-08:00
Save Private -Scooby-: Ukrainian soldiers pulled out a wounded brother from Britain from the battlef...	-The same thing would have been done for us,- they confidently assert, daily telling ArmyInform the unique story of the rescue of their brothers. -Nike-, -Cat- and Alexander are fighters of a grenade launcher that covered the front edge of the positions of the Defense Forces units. Three soldiers received a message about a wounded soldier who remained in a forest lane on the last line in front of the enemy from another one of the command and observation posts of the battalion. — I went to the guys, informed them about the situation, because their position was the closest. They knew very well that I would not ask them to do something that I would not have done myself under other circumstances. However, the decision was difficult, because their firing position covered the front edge and during the evacuation, it could stop working for one and a half to two hours, says a fighter with the call sign -Afghan-, who was on duty at the KSP. The fighters agreed without hesitation, so their sector was covered by additional surveillance from drones and neighboring positions. All the time, while the mission lasted, the evacuation group and the surrounding area were closely monitored by the battalion's reconnaissance drones. - First of all, we found out the soldier's call sign - -Scooby-, the nature of his injury and his whereabouts. It was clarified whether he remained in the same place where he was given primary medical care, or whether he could have already been moved. There was a danger that an enemy drone was watching the location of the wounded man, waiting for someone to come to evacuate him, says Naik, who was contacted by Afghan radio. The wounded soldier was about 200 meters from the position of the grenade launchers, but this distance was an open field between neighboring forest strips, which was extremely dangerous to cross during the day. However, after reporting that there were no enemy drones nearby and using EW suppression, the fighters rushed to help the wounded man. The terrain was hilly - between the higher forest strips there was a hollow, through which the trio of rescuers ran in a few minutes. An easy descent and a slightly more difficult ascent were made without any particular complications - the ground, frozen during the night, firmly held the infantrymen's heavy berets. — All the time our movement was accompanied by a drone, we kept in touch with the KSP by radio. This added confidence - we are being watched and will be warned about danger and will be told where to look for a fighter. They gave a reference point - a point in the landing, where the last location of the injured person was recorded, - says -Nike-. However, when the fighters reached the indicated place, they could not find the wounded man. The fact that he was there was evidenced only by a bloody stretcher and a checkered -arafatka- scarf. The fighter himself was neither there nor nearby, so the rescue team began searching, rummaging through the trees and bushes of the forest strip. While grenade launchers searched for the wounded on the ground, reconnaissance drones inspected the area from the air. The drone observers were lucky - they found the fighter half a kilometer away from the previous location. Having the strength to move, he tried to get out on his own and managed to crawl a considerable distance. Unfortunately, the efforts of the -Scooby- turned out to be not only useless, but also harmful - all the time it was moving towards the enemy, moving away from Ukrainian positions. Only the end of the line of trees, behind which the open space began, made him stop. Not knowing what to do next, the wounded man froze. — -Scooby- was detected from a drone at the intersection of two landings while the boys searched everything around his original location. Then, on the radio, I went to Naika and said: -He crawled down 500 meters from you, go there,- says -Afghan-. It was lucky to find the wounded person quite quickly - in about 10 minutes, but the time seemed much longer to the fighters of the evacuation team. -Cat- and Alexander assume that they had to search for Scooby in the forest strip for at least half an hour - the time in the high danger zone was unbearably long for them. — But if it is necessary, then it is necessary. No one but us could do it, so we would go and search as long as it took. We just did the human thing. And everyone thought at the moment when we were asked to do it that one of us could have been in his place. That's it, says Oleksandr. The fighters are sure that anyone from the Ukrainian military, being in their place, would have done the same - went to save their brothers, despite the risk. This is military karma, they explain - if you go to save the wounded, then someone will definitely help you in a difficult moment. — We just did our job, did what had to be done. They helped a person. For me, this is not the first time to pull out a wounded person - both -two hundred- and -three hundred- were pulled out. This is not the first time for me, so I went to the rescue without any questions, - continues the fighter with the call sign -Cat-. He earned his nickname -Cat- near Kupyansk, where he saved a kitten with a broken paw. He personally fed and treated the -three hundredth- furrier so that he could stand on all four legs. Since then, in memory of this story, his brothers call him -Cat- or affectionately - -Kitten-. Having learned about the location of the wounded, the fighters picked up stretchers and moved to him as quickly as possible. It was necessary to walk along the forest strip carefully - there were often things left by the fighters, remote mining of the area was not excluded. Bypassing dangerous objects, the fighters got to Scooby. - We were told that there was a drone hanging over -Scooby-, so it was not difficult to find it. They called him by his call sign, made eye contact to make sure he wouldn't mistake us for enemies. And then they provided help and began evacuation, says -Nike-. -Scuba- had a shrapnel wound to the leg, but the bleeding had already stopped, and the injured person's condition after checking according to the protocol was stable. Having secured the wounded man on a stretcher, the fighters marched back to their dugout, from where further evacuation could be organized. Plastic stretchers were arranged like an Indian haystack, into which all three fighters of the evacuation group were harnessed together with the help of belts. -And that's how three ZSUSH forces pulled on ZSUSHNA traction,- -Afghan- jokes. So, first along the forest strip, and then with a jerk across the open field, -Scooby- was brought to the firing position of the grenade launchers' calculation. Descending into the hollow from above was not so difficult, the fighters recall, but it was already very difficult to climb up - by the middle of the day, the frost had subsided and the soil began to turn into a swamp. — -Scooby- is generally handsome. While we were dragging him, he kept his cool, didn't scream. He cried out only once, when he was jumped on some hump. And he held on like that - when we asked him how strong the pain was on a scale from 1 to 10, he said that it was a 6. He was very happy that he was taken away, - recalls -Nike- after the end of the rescue mission. Extracting a wounded man in full protective gear was extremely difficult, so when the fighters reached their position, everyone was extremely exhausted, but extremely satisfied that they had managed to save a comrade in arms. Now -Scooby- is in one of the hospitals of the Defense Forces of Ukraine, and -Nike-, -Kit-, -Afghan- and -Olexander- continue to serve in the 2nd International Legion. They do not consider themselves heroes, but they are happy that they were able to save the life of their brother.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/10/vryatuvaty-ryadovogo-skubi-ukrayinski-voyiny-vytyagly-z-polya-boyu-poranenogo-pobratyma-z-brytaniyi/	2025-02-09T20:34:57-08:00
Bradley anti-laser upgrade: the American infantry fighting vehicle will receive the latest ATGM prot...	As goes in the text of the release posted on the U.S. portal. Army, at the Yuma Proving Ground of the United States Army, the new Vehicle Protection System Base Kit (VBK) protection system was tested, which significantly increases the survivability of this BMP on the battlefield, ArmyInform reports. The statement says that the new system uses advanced sensors mounted on the corners of the Bradley turret. This allows laser threats to be detected around the entire perimeter, providing a 360-degree field of view, increasing the crew's awareness of potential attacks. VBK is designed to detect laser sights that are used to guide guided missiles and anti-tank weapons. If a threat is detected, the crew can quickly identify its source with the commander's vision device in order to take protective measures. -The system alerts the crew with an audible signal and a visual indicator,- explained Alan Vega, test officer. -This allows soldiers to decide whether to repel a threat with available weapons or simply evade it,- publication Defense Industry Europe said. Tests of the VBK system were carried out in the difficult conditions of the Hume proving ground. The total length of the test route was 6.5 thousand. miles (over 10,000 km). This test simulated real combat conditions, which made it possible to find out how the protection system copes with vibration, difficult terrain and other stress factors. In the course of testing, both static and dynamic combat situations were simulated, including movement under the threat of damage. According to the developers, such a comprehensive test demonstrated that the VBK is able to work effectively in the most extreme conditions. In addition, the system was tested for its ability to detect threats coming from shelters or from behind hills. -The VBK offers Bradley aircrews an increased level of protection,- noted Tracy Hafley, another test officer. -Providing this ability to make quick decisions is a significant advance for the safety of Soldiers.- The US Army said in a statement that the modernization of the Bradley, including the introduction of the VBK, is aimed at increasing its resistance to modern weapons, including precision munitions. This technology complements the vehicle's existing armor, providing an additional layer of protection for the crew. Overall, observers noted, the introduction of the Bradley Basic Protection Kit is part of a long-term modernization program aimed at ensuring that the BMPs remain effective and protected in future conflicts. As ArmyInform reported, in September 2024, the Pentagon signed a contract to purchase Iron Fist active protection systems (APS) for its Bradley infantry fighting vehicles. Iron Fist (in Ukrainian - -Iron Fist-) APS is an advanced Hard Kill system aimed at increasing the self-defense capabilities of armored platforms against modern threats on the battlefield.

-Instead of lifeguards — buckets of water-: a new -sensation- from propaganda	Judging by the level of this -news-, Kremlin propagandists were inspired by post-apocalyptic films or simply forgot that science fiction is not their genre. Russian Telegram channels and media resources are spreading -horror stories- about the fact that rescuers are being -massively reduced- in Ukraine, so in the event of a fire, Ukrainians will be left without help and will have to fight the fire on their own - with buckets, pans or prayers. Of course, without any evidence or references to official sources. The State Service of Ukraine for Emergency Situations (SES) is working as usual. Moreover, Ukrainian rescuers daily eliminate the consequences of Russian attacks, dismantle rubble after missile strikes and extinguish fires caused by -liberators- with Russian passports. As for funding, despite the war, it remains stable. Rescuers receive new equipment, and their units receive equipment and equipment. And if optimization changes took place somewhere, this does not mean that Ukrainians were left to their own devices. As always, the purpose of such -news- is to sow panic. The enemy is trying to create a picture of the -collapse of the state-, saying that -everything is bad in Ukraine-, -no one will help-, -we must surrender-. But as practice shows, every such fake is a demonstration of the powerlessness of Russian propaganda rather than a real threat to Ukraine. After all, who really has problems with the liquidation of emergency situations is Russia itself. In Siberia, hectares of forest burn every year, and local residents really put out the fire on their own - with shovels and branches. Only the Kremlin TV prefers to keep silent about it. So the next time you hear another -sensational- Russian hoax, just laugh. Because this is the only reaction they deserve.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/10/zamist-ryatuvalnykiv-vidra-z-vodoyu-nova-sensacziya-vid-rospropagandy/	2025-02-09T20:02:13-08:00
-One summer in Ukraine-: a film about volunteers that will not leave you indifferent	This was reported by the representative of the International Legion of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine Volodymyr in a conversation with Jenny Klochko for the podcast -Ukrainian Jenny meets&#8230;-. Volodymyr spoke about how the Ukrainian audience received the film about foreign volunteers. According to him, the tape does not get boring even after multiple viewings, because each time you discover new details for yourself. The audience is especially captivated by the humor, which is organically woven into the story of military everyday life. -I watched this movie in every new city. Every time I looked, I saw specific micro-details that I had not noticed before. And somehow I caught myself feeling that this film does not bore. [&#8230;] And one lady wrote on Instagram: -Why do I want to watch the movie again? The first is because all profits from the film will go to support the unit. The second is because this movie is sexy. The third is because this movie is very sexy,- Volodymyr shared his impressions. The representative of the Legion also noted that the audience's expectations may not always coincide with the reality depicted in the film. -Maybe some viewers expect more action scenes, you know, in the style of -John Wick- or -Black Hawk Down- - shooting, explosions. But we filmed the usual routine of Ukrainian fighters. It's a job. [&#8230;] Most of this film was shot in a fairly safe place, when the guys are training, eating, arguing, joking, cursing in Ukrainian - as we can see now, this is one of the funniest parts of the film,- he said. It is the depiction of ordinary, everyday moments from the life of fighters that makes this film particularly valuable and close to the viewer. It shows the war without embellishment, but also without excessive drama, with humor and optimism characteristic of Ukrainian defenders. Currently, work is underway to present the film -One Summer in Ukraine- at international film festivals for an English-speaking audience. This will be an important event for popularizing Ukrainian cinema and telling the truth about the war in Ukraine to the world community. As reported by ArmyInform, the premiere of the documentary film -One Summer in Ukraine- took place in cinemas of Ukraine fighters of the International Legion of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/09/odnogo-lita-v-ukrayini-film-pro-dobrovolcziv-yakyj-ne-zalyshyt-vas-bajduzhymy/	2025-02-09T10:53:00-08:00
Relieving stress through virtual reality: new methods of psychological support for fighters	This is discussed in a post on the brigade page. -Now you are watching our soldier go through this meditative technique with the help of VR glasses to switch, firstly, because our psyche is a little overloaded after combat. And in order to remove this burden, we use VR glasses. With their help, we can transfer the consciousness of servicemen to different places,- says a serviceman of the 61st OMBr. With the help of special virtual reality glasses, fighters can -meditate- in the mountains or near the lake, or -let out emotions- in active interactive games. This approach allows the fighters to distract themselves from the war and experience positive emotions. -We owe the VR glasses and the development of the software for them to the Ukrainian technology company Asichi, which helps to make it available to all servicemen and to work with their emotions, fears, anxiety, and also to relieve stress,- the 61st OMBr states. As reported by ArmyInform, the operators of the unmanned systems battalion of the 61st Mechanized Steppe Brigade eliminated the enemy's attempt to cut one of our logistics routes.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/09/zvilnennya-vid-stresu-cherez-virtualnu-realnist-novi-metody-psyhologichnoyi-pidtrymky-bijcziv/	2025-02-09T10:34:58-08:00

We are launching a revolutionary project that will radically strengthen our brigades and scale up the experience of effectively destroying the enemy - the Line of Drones,- said Rustem Umyerov. This project envisages the creation of a new standard of war, where unmanned systems become a key element of combat operations, helping defenders to carry out the most difficult tasks. At the first stage, the -Drone Line- will cover five elite regiments and brigades: According to the Minister of Defense, the project combines infantry and UAVs into a single strike system, which will allow: -This will radically change the battle tactics, giving our soldiers a decisive advantage,- Rustem Umerov emphasized. The Minister of Defense thanked the President of Ukraine for the initiative and the entire defense-industrial complex, which develops unmanned technologies 24/7. -We are scaling the technological advantage. We are changing the course of the war. We are destroying the enemy,- Rustem Umyerov concluded. The launch of the -Drone Line- project is an important step in the development of modern military technologies in Ukraine and should significantly strengthen the country's defense capabilities. As reported by ArmyInform, on the website of the Land Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine information appeared on the website of the -Drone Line- - initiative aimed at developing and scaling effective units of unmanned systems.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/09/ministr-oborony-prokomentuvav-zapusk-liniyi-droniv-cze-kardynalno-zminyt-taktyku-boyu/	2025-02-09T10:24:36-08:00
Volodymyr Zelenskyi: The Baltic countries have finally disconnected from Russia's energy grid	President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated this in his evening address, emphasizing the importance of this step. -Ukraine carried out such a separation back in 2022, and today the Baltic states also got rid of their dependence. Moscow will no longer be able to use energy as a weapon against them. This also means that Europe has become even more integrated,- the President emphasized. The disconnection from the Russian energy grid became part of the EU's strategy to strengthen energy security and diversify the supply of energy resources. The Baltic countries, which were previously part of the Soviet energy system, depended on Russian power grids for a long time. Now they have become part of a single European system that guarantees stability and security of energy supply. Volodymyr Zelenskyi also emphasized the importance of further reducing the energy dependence of Central European countries on Russia. He called for strengthening cooperation with the United States in the supply of LNG gas, as well as expanding the import of energy carriers from the Caucasus, the Middle East and North Africa. -The less Europeans depend on Russia, the sooner it will be possible to guarantee reliable security for everyone in Europe,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy emphasized. Separately, the President noted the role of Poland, which helped implement this step, stressing that cooperation between European countries is a guarantee of their independence. The move by Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia is yet another blow to the Kremlin's ability to use energy as a means of political pressure. Europe continues the course of strengthening its energy security and phasing out Russian energy resources, which is a key element in countering Russian aggression. As reported by ArmyInform, President Volodymyr Zelenskyi emphasized that the Russian army, starting with a full-scale invasion, is being replenished not by personnel officers and trained people, but by a large number of mobilized, who are used as -meat-.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/09/volodymyr-zelenskyj-baltijski-krayiny-ostatochno-vidyednalysya-vid-energomerezhi-rosiyi/	2025-02-09T10:12:58-08:00

-Royal Infantry- in action: how our soldiers prepare for battles during the Yar Times	Photos of combat training were published on the website of the Land Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Recruits of the 24th OMbr go through a young fighter course, where they practice the skills necessary for survival and successful performance of tasks in the conditions of modern combat. Special attention is paid to tactical training, because battles in urban areas have their own specifics. Fighters learn to navigate the terrain, move stealthily, use cover and hit the enemy effectively. An important element of training is fire practice. Recruits master different types of weapons, learn to shoot accurately and reload quickly. They also get knowledge of medical training, because on the battlefield every second can decide a life. In addition to physical and tactical training, fighters undergo psychological hardening. They are taught to cope with stress, keep calm and make decisions under high pressure. After all, success on the battlefield depends not only on physical strength, but also on psychological stability. As reported by ArmyInform, in Chasovo Yaru the enemy is actively using combined assault tactics. However, it advances into the city only when it completely wipes out the Defense Force fortifications from the ground.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/09/korolivska-pihota-v-diyi-yak-nashi-bijczi-gotuyutsya-do-boyiv-za-chasiv-yar/	2025-02-09T09:52:51-08:00
-If he does not want to fight, then they will have to-: the story of the platoon sergeant major with...	The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. As soon as the full-scale Russian invasion began, 30-year-old Ivan from Stryi, together with his father and brother, immediately appeared at the military commissariat. However, only the older brother was mobilized, the father was already over 60, and Ivan was told to wait a little. A year and a half later, he received a summons. After the training center in the Rivne region, Ivan got into the 128th separate Transcarpathian mountain assault brigade. He is now a platoon sergeant major, a sergeant with the call sign Fox. -At the training center, I met Roman from Khmelnytskyi (call sign Elephant), we became close friends, and we both decided that we would join the stormtroopers,- says Fox. — That is why, during the distribution, they asked for the 128th OGSHBr, about which we heard a lot. Do I have any regrets? No. After the training center, we had very good training already in the brigade, including with foreign instructors. There are some pluses,- the fighter jokes. After training, Fox, along with his brothers, began to perform complex combat tasks, which included assaults on enemy positions, mopping up and heavy defense. -Of course, it was scary. This feeling is always present during combat sorties. Everyone is afraid, and that's okay. Fear is one of the basic instincts for self-preservation. He who is not afraid does not live long. But fear must be overcome, especially when you are responsible not only for yourself, but also for your comrades. I went on a mission as a unit commander, and the biggest worries were for people. You need to talk to everyone, explain the combat mission, show routes, listen to questions, help, become a support. The most difficult and cruelest battles Fox experienced in Robotyn. -At first we stormed and cleared enemy trenches, and then we had to entrench and hold the defense. The Russians retreated to a neighboring position 70 meters from us and from there tried to regain what they had lost. But we didn't invite the -guests-, so we didn't let them in. Different fighters stood against us - pros, convicts&#8230; I saw enemy bodies with Wagner chevrons. Rats were gnawing at them, they had been lying there for so long. Many times I observed inappropriate behavior of Russians. They could go on the offensive, bypassing forest strips, at full height with minimal equipment. We mow them, and they still stick. One was wounded, you can see how a bullet pierced his leg, in a few seconds a vog exploded near his feet (a grenade from an underbarrel or an automatic grenade launcher), and he got up and walked on. He was definitely under the influence of some drugs.- During the defense of captured enemy positions, Fox and his comrades took a prisoner. -Aerial scouts reported that a Russian was walking nearby without a machine gun, and we decided to take him. He did not even resist, he began to explain that he was looking for the body of the commander in order to take the walkie-talkie. He is 40 years old, from the Russian hinterland. When we took him, I warned - if you say that you have a weapon, we will pass it on as it is, just tied up. He replied that he had nothing, but during the search I found a knife in his pocket. The prisoner received a light blow to the back of the head for lying, and then we transferred him to the rear. During the fighting, Fox was wounded several times in the back, shoulder and head. -The most dangerous wound was in the head, most likely from a mortar mine. One shrapnel hit the helmet, and the second (about the size of a thumb) flew under the helmet, grazed the head and lodged in the helmet on the inside. You could say I'm very lucky. When they brought me to the headquarters and took off the helmet, everything was covered in blood, although a hot piece of metal cauterized the wound, so the bleeding was not intense. I kept that shard, I even wanted to remelt it into some kind of symbolic decoration. In the war, unfortunately, not everyone is lucky, many of Fox's comrades died in the battles. -Our group went on an assault, and the Russians met us harshly - they fired at us with everything they could. A comrade was wounded in the arm, so I ordered him to retreat and wait for evacuation, accompanied by a soldier. A minute later, the wounded man came under the fire of a tank gun&#8230; The assault did not succeed, we were ordered to withdraw to the nearby positions where my friend Slon was standing. And the three of us with the Elephant and one more soldier dragged the deceased under fire to a trench where he could hide. He was heavy, about 120 kilograms, and when we dragged him 300 meters, I felt like I broke my back. That's why other boys took the deceased, in general, they had to drag him for about two kilometers. Recently, Fox's unit has been holding a defense in the Zaporozhye direction in one of the villages recaptured from the enemy. Due to the danger of drones, combat exits to -zero- have to be delayed, sometimes they last for several months. -We are in a confined space for a long time and in constant danger. From time to time I question my fighters - ask about peaceful life, relatives, hobbies&#8230; It is necessary for a person to speak out, then it becomes a little easier for him. When there is an opportunity, I do light physical education, I do exercises with a bra, so that the muscles do not atrophy. What is the most difficult position? One is superimposed on the other - a closed space, constant danger, lack of contact with relatives, concern for people. During vacations and rehabilitation after his injury, Fox made several visits to the home. I have seen healthy men who do not want to join the Armed Forces and are hiding. -One of them is my neighbor. Having met him once, he began to ask when all this would end. I replied that the war would not end without his participation. And he gave advice to teach his children how to handle weapons. Because if he doesn't want to fight, he will have to.- As reported by ArmyInform, 28-year-old Alexander with the call sign -German- is the operator of a drone-bomber 128 separate mountain-assault Transcarpathian Brigade. Before Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, he worked at a mining and beneficiation plant in Kryvyi Rih.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/09/yakshho-ne-hoche-voyuvaty-vin-to-dovedetsya-yim-istoriya-golovnogo-serzhanta-vzvodu-z-pozyvnym-foks/	2025-02-09T09:36:25-08:00
-Drone Line-: The best unmanned units of the Ground Forces unite to strengthen the defense	The Land Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine inform you about this. This project is extremely important for ensuring superiority on the battlefield and saving the lives of Ukrainian soldiers. As noted in the message of the Ground Forces, the best unmanned units, such as -K-2-, -Achilles-, -RAROG- and -Birds of Magyar-, together with other UAV units, create a permanent line of drones that will strengthen our soldiers to zero, ensure total control over all enemy actions and their destruction. -Drone Line- is not about creating new combat units. It is about the development of the best and scaling of effective units of unmanned systems in various branches and types of troops. Also a member of the -Line of Drones- is a division of the State Border Service - -Phoenix-. The commanders of these units — Magyar, a system commander and an example for fellow soldiers, Achilles, a fearless tactician and master of lightning strikes, Veres, a charismatic and indomitable strategist, Hasan, an aggressive and unpredictable leader for the enemy — know their business, take care of the safety of the soldiers, destroy the invaders en masse, and master new technologies and tactics. The Drone Line project is an initiative of the President of Ukraine, coordinated by the Ground Forces Command, the State Border Guard Service, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, and the Ministry of Digital Transformation. We will remind you that earlier the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskiy announced this initiative, by publishing a corresponding video. This project is another step towards strengthening Ukraine's defense capabilities and ensuring victory over the Russian invaders. As reported by ArmiyaInform, the commanders of the -Phoenix-, K-2, -Achilles-, RAROG and -Birds of Magyar- united in the joint project -Drone Power- and invite you to join their units.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/09/liniya-droniv-najkrashhi-bezpilotni-pidrozdily-suhoputnyh-vijsk-obyednalysya-dlya-posylennya-oborony/	2025-02-09T09:33:45-08:00
Only paint and patches: the occupiers limited -repair- destroyed Severodonetsk	notifies the head of the Luhansk OVA, Artem Lysogor. The occupiers admit that their -Country Doctor- program, which provided cash payments to doctors, has failed. The lack of doctors is especially felt in front-line cities and small settlements, where doctors refuse to go. If the corresponding law is adopted, then already from September 1, 2026, those who refuse the mandatory training will have to pay a fine that will exceed twice the cost of education. In addition, Russia is reducing funding for the pseudo-reconstruction of occupied Severodonetsk. So, in 2025, the occupiers plan to repair only 12 objects instead of 15, as promised last year. These are only cosmetic repairs - replacing windows, radiators and re-roofing. Full restoration or capital repairs are not foreseen. As ArmyInform reported, in the temporarily occupied territories of Luhansk Russians continue to implement their best corruption traditions. Now they have officially legalized the robbery of housing, handing over -ownerless- property to themselves, and at the same time, they have been -forgetting- to pay their debts to public officials for ten years.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/09/lyshe-farba-i-latky-okupanty-obmezhyly-remont-znyshhenogo-syevyerodoneczka/	2025-02-09T09:07:34-08:00
The occupier ran into a Ukrainian drone: a walk through someone else's yard did not go unpunished	The video of combat work was published on the brigade's page. The published footage shows Ukrainian drones carrying out targeted strikes on enemy fortifications and enemy manpower. These are not just attacks - these are carefully planned operations that step by step bring Ukraine closer to victory. -Fight and win!- — under this slogan, the fighters of the 32nd OMBr continue their mission, not leaving the enemy a single chance. As reported by ArmyInform, the Defense Forces caught the Russian invaders when they tried to fix their logistics with the help of a conventional walk-behind tractor.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/09/okupant-narvavsya-na-ukrayinskyj-dron-progulyanka-chuzhym-dvorom-ne-zalyshylasya-bezkarnoyu/	2025-02-09T08:53:15-08:00
-Blondie- on armor: the woman who tamed the tank	The defender's story was made public on the brigade's page. -Blondie- does not just support the fighting spirit of her siblings - she considers them superheroes, protects them like a real team mother, and also&#8230; drives the tank herself! -It's easy to start a tank and go. It's like riding a bicycle,- she says with a smile. Her path to the army began by accident, with a joke in the store: customers said that if she did not make a discount, they would take her to the army. Svetlana was not at a loss - and still kept her promise. There were fewer jokes on the battlefield. One day she decided to see how their tank worked, and at that moment an enemy shell flew nearby. -Looked up&#8230; I don't want anymore,- she recalls that moment. From communications to UAV operatorship, from psychological support to a tank mechanic, Blondie breaks all stereotypes about women in the military. -I would like to appeal to women who are thinking about military service: do not be afraid! If you set your priorities right, there is nothing to be afraid of,- she says, appealing to the ranks of the Armed Forces. And men are advised to treat women in the army with respect - because they stand side by side with dignity. Her son Konstantin, who is 10 years old, is waiting for his mother at home. But he knows: his mother is a real hero, and he is as proud of her as all of Ukraine. As reported by ArmyInform, Oleksandr Maslyuk, military serviceman of the 67th separate mechanized brigade, known among his comrades by the call sign -Fedorovych-. Before the start of the full-scale invasion, he worked as a deputy director of one of the largest Internet companies in Kyiv region, providing people with high-quality communication. But on February 24, 2022, his life changed dramatically.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/09/blondi-na-broni-zhinka-yaka-pryruchyla-tank/	2025-02-09T08:32:25-08:00
Volodymyr Zelenskyi: the Russian army uses the mobilized as -cannon fodder-	He said this in an interview with ITV News. -Even in Kurshchyna, these 60,000 plus were not enough to push out our brigades, which were much smaller. Because their people are not so combat-ready,- Volodymyr Zelenskyi noted. The president emphasized that it was important to show the whole world that the Russian army is not as strong as it seems. According to him, Ukraine feels sorry for its people, while Russia does not feel sorry for anyone. Volodymyr Zelenskyi also emphasized the need for unity with America and Europe in confronting Russian aggression. -You can't lose Europe. This is Putin, and this is a risk for all of Europe. I think that we should unite around this risk for our population, our states,- he said. The President of Ukraine emphasized that the frozen conflict will lead to the fact that Putin will return again with his aggression. -Then who will receive the awards? Who will then go down in history as the winner? But no one. And it will be an absolute defeat for everyone,- he noted. Volodymyr Zelenskyi emphasized the importance of the war not just ending, but also making it impossible for Putin to start a war against Ukraine again. -Putin's victory is the loss of the Western world: both Europe and America. And it will never stop. And as long as he lives, he will take the lives of others, because he will continue to fight,- concluded the President of Ukraine. As reported by ArmyInform, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky believes that the unique experience of the Defense Forces in the fight against Iranian drones is extremely valuable to its Western partners, including the United States.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/09/volodymyr-zelenskyj-rosijska-armiya-vykorystovuye-mobilizovanyh-yak-garmatne-myaso/	2025-02-09T08:14:32-08:00
The rag did not pass: how the Predators thwarted the Russians' attempt to hang the tricolor over Tor...	The video of the combat operation was published on the brigade's page. The first group of occupiers tried to plant a flag on the copper mine. However, the -Predators- struck with a drop shot from a drone, and adjacent units covered the enemy with artillery fire. As a result, the Russian invaders did not even have time to unfurl their flag. Another group of occupiers, looking for an easier way, simply threw the tricolor on one of the buildings in the city. However, here too they were met with failure. The bomber of the -Predator- brigade demonstrated high skill by knocking down the -rag- by dropping the VOG from the drone. This incident once again emphasizes the indomitability of the Ukrainian spirit and the determination of the defenders of Toretsk. The Russian occupiers are defeated not only on the battlefield, but also in their propaganda efforts. Toretsk is Ukraine! As reported by ArmyInform, is there a place for magic on the front? Fighters of the Defence Forces from the patrol police give an affirmative answer to this question and even demonstrate it in action.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/09/ganchirka-ne-projshla-yak-hyzhaky-zirvaly-sprobu-rosiyan-povisyty-trykolor-nad-toreczkom/	2025-02-09T08:06:48-08:00

The former head of the workshop is today the commander of the group: the transformation of the Vikin...	The story of the fighter published on the page brigades Stocky and handsome, a real goatherd - that's what they say about Roman. From the outside, he may seem strict and unspeakable, but behind this exterior hides a person who does not care. His work requires calculation, precision and poise in every movement, and the nickname -Viking- best reflects his appearance and worldview. The former head of the workshop for the production of metal-plastic structures, during the three years of the war, Roman has come a long way - from ground defense to the commander of the engineering support group. The war and army positions shaped his attitude in life: he doesn't care! -The imprint on the personality and worldview postpones every exit to the position, every successful demining or demining. After all, this is a responsibility for completing the task and for one's people. That's why I experience the loss of siblings the hardest, Roman admits thoughtfully. -Every time it makes corrections to the worldview, sharpens the sense of justice, which sometimes covers up to madness, because you pass everything through the heart.- In 2022, when thousands of motivated men and women were standing in line for the TCC, Roman was among them. He knew where he was going and why. With each wave of mobilization, the need for explanations and work with people increased, but this has its positive results. In particular, in this unit, a wonderful team has been created, where brothers stand firmly for each other. The war made adjustments in the lives of many people. Someone decided to defend the country, and someone decided to sit back. -I decided to go to war to protect my family and friends. Someone, on the contrary, decided to sit down. This is everyone's personal matter, says Roman. — But they try not to communicate with me, because they have nothing to talk about. And for my part, I think so: you weren't there when I was bad, so why are you here now, when I'm fine?-. As reported by ArmyInform, a resident of Volyn, Lyudmila Kostyuk, has been serving in the Armed Forces of Ukraine for the third year with her cat No Nickname Grigio.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/09/kolyshnij-nachalnyk-czehu-sogodni-komandyr-grupy-transformacziya-vikinga-na-vijni/	2025-02-09T07:32:25-08:00

The Ground Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces are the leaders in the use of electronic reports in ...	This is reported by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Over the past month, 100 military units of the Ground Forces submitted and successfully processed at least one electronic report for the first time. This indicates significant progress in the digitization of military documentation and the simplification of reporting procedures for servicemen. The Operational Command -West- of the Ground Forces was especially noted, which became the undisputed leader in terms of the number of reports submitted to the Armed Forces - more than 12,500! It is important to note that 100% of the military units that are part of this command already actively use -Army+- to process reports. Among all military units of the Ground Forces that actively use -Army+-, it is worth noting the top 5 brigades in terms of the number of fully processed reports: 23rd separate mechanized brigade - 1,347 reports; 44th separate artillery brigade named after Hetman Danylo Apostol - 1,113 reports; 15th Separate Black Forest Artillery Reconnaissance Brigade - 1,073 reports; 159th Separate Mechanized Brigade - 692 reports; 47th Separate Artillery Brigade - 677 reports. These figures testify to the high efficiency of using the -Armiya+- application and the active participation of servicemen in the process of digitalization of the Armed Forces. The introduction of electronic reports through -Army+- is an important step on the way to creating a modern, technologically advanced army. This application not only simplifies the procedure for submitting reports, but also contributes to increasing the efficiency of military management and reducing the bureaucratic burden on military personnel. The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine continues to work on expanding the functionality of -Army+- and implementing new digital services to meet the needs of servicemen and increase the country's defense capabilities. As reported by ArmyInform, a meeting was held in the Republic of Poland to discuss changes and coordinate further joint actions within the framework of the Main Planning Conference Framework Program for the Development of Operational Forces (OFDeF).	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/09/suhoputni-vijska-zsu-lidery-z-vykorystannya-elektronnyh-raportiv-u-sichni/	2025-02-09T06:26:44-08:00
Ukraine increased drone production tenfold: 200,000 FPVs per month	told First Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine, Lieutenant General Ivan Havryliuk. Separately, Ivan Havrylyuk noted the development of unmanned systems. If at the beginning of 2024, the number of FPV attack drones used to attack the enemy was about 20,000 per month, now this figure has increased to 200,000. This indicates a significant increase in the technological potential of the Ukrainian army. In 2025, the supply level of unmanned systems, especially FPV drones, is about 200 thousand per month and continues to grow. -This applies not only to FPV drones, but also to other unmanned systems used by the Defense Forces. In particular, work is actively underway on the introduction of ground robotic complexes. Special attention is paid to their use for logistical tasks, demining and demining operations, as well as the evacuation of the wounded,- said the lieutenant general. According to him, performing these tasks is particularly dangerous for servicemen because they are in open terrain and are at the highest risk of injury. That is why these functions are planned to be transferred to ground-based robotic complexes so that operators can control them from safe places. As reported by ArmyInform, Ukraine surpasses Russia in the production of FPV drones.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/09/ukrayina-zbilshyla-vyrobnycztvo-droniv-u-desyat-raziv-200-tysyach-fpv-na-misyacz/	2025-02-09T06:11:08-08:00

Large-scale demining: how many explosive areas remain in Ukraine	told First Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine, Lieutenant General Ivan Havryliuk. Thanks to the joint work of mine action operators and demining units, this figure was reduced to 139 thousand square kilometers, and the work continues. -The goal is to clear the territory of explosive objects as soon as possible to ensure the safety of citizens and to restore the full activity of the agricultural sector and other enterprises. However, complete demining of Ukraine may take tens of years,- Ivan Havryliuk emphasized. According to the First Deputy Minister of Defense, Ukraine is working together with international partners to speed up this process. There is an international demining coalition that provides substantial support in the implementation of these measures. As ArmiyaInform reported, the Russian Navy stopped mining the Black Sea after the UDF destroyed the plane.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/09/masshtabne-rozminuvannya-skilky-vybuhonebezpechnyh-terytorij-zalyshylos-v-ukrayini/	2025-02-09T05:35:16-08:00
-Dimas- and -Bogdan-: the story of an artilleryman who destroys the enemy with steel fire	The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. Dmytro comes from the town of Khoroshiv in Zhytomyr Oblast. At 28, he already has considerable combat experience. After his military service in 2018-2019, he signed a contract with the Armed Forces of Ukraine and participated in the anti-terrorist operation/military operation. And on October 7, 2022, he again stood up for the defense of Ukraine. In civilian life, -Dimas- had to work for several years at a slaughterhouse, where he butchered pigs. However, as the fighter himself notes, this did not affect his humanity and devotion to his country. -I will never hurt a person, even with a word. But orcs are non-humans. Both during the time of the ATO and now I see with my own eyes what a terrifying ruin they have turned the once flourishing Ukrainian Donbas into, how much grief they have brought to our people,- Dimas says. In his native Zhytomyr region, his mother, beloved wife and three-year-old daughter are waiting for Dmytro. Family is his biggest motivation and support. -I really want to win this war and return home to my family. Because that is the greatest happiness: you arrive on a long-awaited vacation, you get off the bus, and your child runs to meet you,'' the fighter shares his dreams. This story is just one example of the courage and heroism of Ukrainian defenders who risk their lives every day for the sake of victory. -Dimas- and his comrades from -Staleva Sotka- not only skillfully wield weapons, but also keep in their hearts love for their family and faith in a better future for Ukraine. As reported by ArmyInform, Andrii, nicknamed -Footballist-, chief sergeant of the 100th separate mechanized brigade platoon The Armed Forces of Ukraine is an example of how sport and war can be intertwined in a person's life. Before the war, he played futsal professionally, playing for the Midas club in Lutsk. However, when a full-scale war began, he did not hesitate to defend the country.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/09/dimas-i-bogdana-istoriya-artylerysta-shho-nyshhyt-voroga-stalevym-vognem/	2025-02-09T05:27:51-08:00

As reported by ArmyInform, the fighters of -Donbas- showed what the hell of war looks like in Chasovoy Yar.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/09/protyvnyk-prodovzhuye-tysnuty-na-fronti-na-dvoh-napryamkah-sytuacziya-osoblyvo-skladna/	2025-02-08T21:13:01-08:00
-Cadet classes-, -Russian eagles- and drone racing league: children in the occupation become a poten...	ArmyInform asked the Secretariat of the Commissioner for Human Rights of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine how they record all these cases and violations of human rights, and, in fact, the destruction of Ukrainian identity. Currently, neither Ukraine, nor international organizations and the public sector have access to the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine, so it is difficult to assess the scale and consequences of the systemic policy of the Russian Federation on the destruction of the Ukrainian identity of children, the -mobilization- of Ukrainian children, and militarization. Thus, according to the data of the Kharkiv Institute of Social Research and the -Voices of Children- foundation, as early as 2021, 29,000 children joined the ranks of the Russian -children's and youth military-patriotic- organization -Yunarmiya- in Crimea alone, that is, every tenth student of the peninsula. And in the territory of the so-called -LDNR- there were about 7,500 children in the -Yunarmy- at the end of 2021. In particular, students of the eleventh grade who study on the territory of the TOT of Ukraine are offered training at the faculty of the rear of the Russian Federation of the state-owned educational institution -Perm Military Institute of the National Guard of the Russian Federation-. It is also known about cases when policemen at the TOT of Ukraine campaigned for children from boarding schools to enter specialized educational institutions of the Ministry of Education in the future or, even simpler, to go serve as policemen in occupation administrations without special education immediately after finishing school. The Russian Federation also plans to double the number of students in schools with military training in the occupied territories of Ukraine. In particular, on the base of the Nakhimovsky school in the occupied city of Mariupol, as of September 2, 2024, 240 children between the ages of 10 and 13 lived in the barracks of the military institution, in 2025 there should already be 560 such children. -It is important to note that militarization is one of the main directions of the youth policy of the Russian Federation. In 2023, the -Avangard- year-round training and methodical center for military-patriotic education was opened, on the basis of which 3 patriotic changes were carried out for 300 children and young citizens of pre-conscription age, i.e. high school students,- the ombudsman's office emphasizes. During these shifts, pre-conscription training was conducted for Crimean schoolchildren, they were told about -Novorossiya- as originally Russian lands, including with the participation of the -junarmy-. The Russian occupation authorities are not only militarizing schoolchildren. So, for example, in the sports complex of the Mariupol State University named after O. AND. Kunji- (created by the occupation administration of Mariupol), a master class on drone racing was organized within the framework of the project -All-Russian Student League on Drone Racing (unmanned aerial vehicles)-. -Regarding the fact that Ukrainian children, who by force of circumstances ended up in the Armed Forces of Ukraine, automatically become the -military reserve- of the Russian army, it is important to note that during the survey of children at the Center for the Protection of Children's Rights who returned from the Armed Forces of Ukraine, from deportation from the Russian Federation or forced transfer from the Armed Forces of Ukraine, there are facts of popularization of joining the Russian army. It is a well-known fact that a child who has reached the age of majority in the Ukrainian Armed Forces signed a contract for military service in the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation during his stay in the Ukrainian Armed Forces,- the Secretariat replied. The available facts testify to the targeted policy of the Russian Federation in the temporarily occupied territory of Ukraine aimed at eradicating Ukrainian identity and imposing Russian militarized patriotism, they added. Representatives of the occupation authorities, as part of the project -Patriotic Education of Citizens of the Russian Federation-, -initiate- Ukrainian schoolchildren from the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine into the -Eagles of Russia-. In addition, every Monday in all institutions of the Russian Federation and schools on TOT, the so-called -Conversations about the important- take place, during which children are taught -key aspects of a person's life in modern Russia.- -This program has been in effect since September 2022, it was introduced by the Ministry of Education of the Russian Federation (Russian: Минпросвещения-) for all schools in Russia and in the occupied territories of Ukraine. Classes are held every Monday, the first lesson after the mandatory lineup with the performance of the Russian national anthem and the raising of the Russian flag. Such -conversations- are part of the -patriotic education- of the aggressor country. At the same time, children participate in writing letters of support to the military, which forms psychological loyalty to the armed forces of the occupying country,- the ombudsman's office reports. They emphasize that such actions violate international norms, including Article 38 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. And since the beginning of the full-scale armed conflict and the occupation of the territories of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, as well as Donetsk and Luhansk regions in 2022, Ukrainian studies subjects and the Ukrainian language have been reduced, stopped or banned in schools, the educational process has been militarized, and out-of-school youth movements of -patriotic education- have started to work. Starting in September 2023, schools in the occupied territories of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, as well as in Crimea, will be conducting the -cadet classes- program. Such paramilitary classes are opened on the basis of an agreement between the educational institution or the -ministries of education- of the regions of Ukraine occupied by Russia and the specialized bodies of the Russian Federation, often with the support of the regional office of the United Russia party. In the Zaporizhzhia region, the Russian Guard conducts military training for children, and in the Kherson region, the -cadet class- is opened by the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation. There are currently 128 such classes on the territory of the temporarily occupied Crimea. Militarization of children is a policy of the Russian Federation aimed at forming the loyalty of minors to the use of force methods in the regulation of interstate relations, the ombudsman's team emphasizes. -It involves in-depth military training, including training with the use of weapons, additional lessons or extracurricular activities, participation in military sports, membership in military-patriotic organizations,- the response to the request states. According to the data of the law enforcement agencies of Ukraine, the Russian Federation actively involves minors in the armed conflict in the role of spies and correctors of shelling, as well as in the campaign of forced mobilization of Ukrainian citizens in the temporarily occupied territories. A number of tools are used to recruit children: from video games to the militarization of education, recreation in military-patriotic camps, membership in the -youth army- and other military-patriotic movements. Such actions violate international law, including the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which prohibits the involvement of persons under the age of 18 in hostilities, and the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, which recognizes the involvement of children in hostilities as a war crime.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/09/kadetski-klasy-orlyata-rosiyi-i-liga-z-peregoniv-droniv-dity-v-okupacziyi-stayut-potenczijnym-vijskovym-rezervom-armiyi-rf/	2025-02-08T21:03:22-08:00
-Blockade of Leningrad 2.0-: Russia is again at war with imaginary enemies	But it doesn't matter - the main thing is that the audience grabs their hearts and shouts: -The fascists are coming again!- Propaganda media and Russian -militarists- are actively dispersing the news that -Czech politicians are calling for a new blockade of Leningrad- in view of the strengthening of sanctions against the Russian Federation. For confirmation, there is no official statement, only the twisted words of Czech officials and a little fantasy in the spirit of the Soviet historical drama. The reality, as always, is much less dramatic. The Czech Republic, together with the EU, really supports sanctions against Russia for its war against Ukraine. But no one proposed to repeat the blockade of Leningrad, because: First, to again exploit the theme of the -Great Patriotic War- - after all, in Putin's Russia, the past has long been more important than the present. Secondly, to put yourself in the role of -victim- - they say, -they want to destroy us again.- Third, to divert attention from their own problems - from mobilization, economic decline and total isolation. And if we talk about blockades, the real humanitarian catastrophe is not being arranged by the Czech Republic, but by Russia in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine. But you will not be told about this on Kremlin TV.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/09/blokada-leningrada-2-0-rosiya-znovu-voyuye-z-vygadanymy-vorogamy/	2025-02-08T20:51:38-08:00
Integration of combat missions: Australian aeronautical engineers have created a long-range UAV comp...	As stated in the official release posted on the Innovaero portal, the combination of Insitu Pacific's Integrator reconnaissance drone and Innovaero's One-Way Loitering (OWL) barrage munition promises to significantly increase the effectiveness of military operations, providing flexibility and accuracy on the battlefield, ArmyInform notes. As Insitu Pacific Managing Director Andrew Duggan assures, such a tandem will provide the military with both wide opportunities for intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and direct strikes at a long distance, without at the same time risking the lives of the crews of larger aircraft. Simon Grosser, CEO of Innovaero Group, explained that the Integrator/OWL pair will enable the military to detect targets at a long distance and immediately direct a kamikaze drone to them for effective destruction. -The versatility of the proposed combined ISR and strike solution will significantly shorten the sensor-shooter cycle to combat threats,- he emphasized. The basic concept of the system is to use the Integrator drone for reconnaissance, surveillance and transmission of target data. Equipped with modern optical and infrared sensors, it effectively monitors enemy activity, even in difficult weather conditions and at night. SATCOM BLOS (Beyond Line of Sight) provides control over hundreds of kilometers, making the system ideal for use in restricted access areas. Once the target is identified, the OWL kamikaze drone is launched from a ground catapult. Thanks to its folding wings, it is easily transported and deployed in combat conditions. Using built-in electro-optical and infrared cameras, the OWL is able to accurately target even moving targets. A variety of warheads, including armor-piercing and fragmentation warheads, make it a versatile tool for destroying equipment and fortifications. As reports Insitu Pacific (IPL) on its website, the Integrator is a modern device that provides UAV capabilities of groups 4 and 5 in a drone of group 3. To understand the picture, it is worth telling which means belong to these groups according to the classification of the US Federal Aviation Administration: - Group 3. Weight - more than 25 kg and less than 598 kg, flight height - up to 5.5 km, maximum speed - 463 km/h. - Group 4. Weight - more than 598 kg, flight height - up to 5.5 km, speed - no restrictions. - Group 5. Weight - more than 598 kg, flight height - more than 5.5 km, maximum speed - unlimited. The company emphasizes that it is thanks to the SATCOM satellite communication system that BLOS Integrator is able to operate at a great distance from the operator. The basic version is equipped with an electro-optical thermal imager, a medium-wave infrared camera, as well as an infrared marker for illuminating targets. As IPL representatives assure, the experience of such drones already includes more than a million hours, which makes these drones one of the most innovative and reliable unmanned aerial systems in the world. Integrator Specifications: OWL Specifications: A key element in the successful implementation of the new system will be the integration of a single Insitu Pacific ground control station and INEXA software. This solution will allow both drones to be used within a single operational network, minimizing management complexity and speeding up decision-making. Prospects for the application of this technology include border protection, suppression of key adversary nodes, and prompt response to threats. The developers' long-term plans include improving the autonomy characteristics and introducing artificial intelligence to increase the system's independence in combat conditions. The combination of Integrator and OWL drones reflects a modern approach to warfare where mobility, precision and speed are key. Australian engineers have created a long-range UAV complex for reconnaissance and strikes.

-Registration- at the position, exits -in gray- and Russians-zombaks: an infantryman of the 141st br...	Why is it better for a position to take more BC and less food? But how many times a day did you have to repel enemy assaults? The soldier told our correspondent about it. -In 2023, I was walking around the city, I was met by the military TCC. They offered to go serve. I say: -That's not a question!-. He got into the car with them and drove off. Later he ended up in the 141st brigade. During my term, I had the profession of a signalman. And already after the beginning of a large-scale invasion in his brigade, he learned what it is to be a real infantryman. Well, recently I started learning to fly a UAV for myself. Modern warfare demands it. First, in the year 2023, I performed a task on one of the southern directions. There, by the way, he was wounded and contused. So, in the south, the enemy stormed us in twos, as a rule. And I did not let their infantry closer than 100 meters to my positions. I was pretty pumped up at the time, let's just say. I had everything: I took 10 grenades with me, I had a receiver, and I took grenades on the receiver. I hardly took water with food, but I took a lot of BC (ammunition - ed.). We held our positions, but sometimes in the evening we went out -gray-, we could still storm something there. That is, if you spot an enemy somewhere, you need to go there, throw a grenade there, for example. And back then come back. There was a situation that we also went out into the field to storm. It was in the afternoon. And we had to jump into the hole to hide from the enemy. And there were many of their corpses in the pit. We hid under them for some time, covered ourselves so that we would not be noticed from the sky. Once I entered a position for three days and exited on the twelfth day. It's just that then the situation developed like this&#8230; Someone had to do the job. The guys who changed me joked then: -Did you register here?-. So, in the south, the enemy infantry came at us like zombies. You beat them, but they still go and go. As the rule of twos. It happened that they also drove in our direction on motorcycles. Enemy attacks were about six times a day. At first, their artillery fired for an hour. And then there was an assault. They crawled out of all the holes. And we kept it all. -Sontsepok- even beat us. Then I got out, looked, thought -Well, thank God I'm not there.- It hit 600 meters from us. There was also a case when I hit an enemy soldier three times with a machine gun: two in the armor and one in the body. He frowned, but went on. It felt like he was under the influence of some substances. Next to him, the discharge broke, this soldier first fell, and then got up and went on. But he reached the wood and fell down, began to wave a white handkerchief, saying that he was giving up. Each of them had such a white handkerchief. &#8230;And here, where we are standing now, on one of the eastern directions, about seventy percent are trained enemy attack aircraft, they clearly know what to do. Able to storm and take a stand. And here they don't go in twos, here around four people go with them. And if they get to the landing, then they continue to do their business. And here they hit more KABs, and after them their attack planes come. And they go almost 24/7. I don't know where they get people for this. All we do is bring a new BC to our positions. As soon as someone is injured, no one evacuates him. And they are there on the field and -come- by themselves.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/09/propyska-na-pozycziyi-vyhody-po-siromu-ta-rosiyany-zombaky-pihotynecz-141-yi-brygady-rozpoviv-pro-vorozhi-shturmy/	2025-02-08T20:34:50-08:00

If their drones fly thousands of kilometers, what prevents them from flying 10,000 kilometers? Nothing. It's only time. A little time will pass - and they will have all this. And you must have protection: America needs protection, other countries, the Middle East — they need peace. Fact. Europe too. And where can you get this experience today? You can take it only from us. I think that we are here, if not strong partners, - we are the only partners for America in these modern technologies of anti-war, anti-attacks, anti-Iranians,- the President emphasized.

From the driver of Ukrzaliznytsia to the commander of IRIS-T: the story of a Ukrainian warrior who d...	The story of the fighter was made public on the page of the Air Force Command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. -We received information about the air situation and knew that Russian missiles would enter the zone of damage to our complex. On command, we brought the IRIS-T launcher into combat readiness and destroyed the enemy target in a timely manner,- says Roman. — -Already after the completion of the combat work, they were happy that the Russian deadly iron did not cause any harm.- Before the war, Roman worked as a machinist at Ukrzaliznytsia. On February 28, 2022, he voluntarily joined the TCC and joined the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. He was the commander of the reconnaissance battalion branch of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. As part of this unit, he fought in Kharkiv region and Donetsk region. -Our equipment intercepted hostile conversations on the radio. This information was essential for further planning of operations. It was useful and interesting combat work,- recalls Roman. Subsequently, he served in a separate battalion in the amphibious assault brigade as deputy commander of a platoon of anti-tank guided missiles. Took part in the liberation of Kharkiv region. -Our task was to destroy enemy armored vehicles. We went in groups to positions with anti-tank missile systems and destroyed Russian combat vehicles and tanks. Sometimes they sat in an ambush for hours to get a good shot,- says the junior sergeant. Once a cluster munition fell a meter away from Roman and did not explode. -I am a person of faith. I think the fact that I once served children in the temple saved me. My church service lasted ten years,- shares Roman. During the three years of the full-scale invasion, Roman destroyed the occupiers and enemy equipment both on the ground and in the air. The military man was awarded the award of the President of Ukraine -For the Defense of Ukraine-. Roman continues to defend his native land from enemy strikes from the air. -We have a modern and effective weapon in our hands. -I have enough strength to destroy the enemy and win,- the defender claims. As reported by ArmyInform, August 11 for paratroopers of the 82nd separate airborne assault brigade began with a task that was supposed to be another bold raid behind enemy lines. But a well-organized trap awaited them near the village of Safonivka, Kursk region. Enemy units, already ready for the Ukrainian offensive, deployed fire ambushes, threatening the complete destruction of two airborne assault companies. And it was at this moment that -Jack- - the commander of the 6th company - came to the front.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/08/vid-mashynista-ukrzaliznyczi-do-komandyra-iris-t-istoriya-ukrayinskogo-voyina-yakyj-nyshhyt-voroga-na-zemli-j-u-povitri/	2025-02-08T10:12:53-08:00

About this in the broadcast of the telethon -Edyny Novyny- the commander of the 429th separate regiment of unmanned systems -Achilles- Yury Fedorenko told. For him in other words, it is possible to restrain the -rolling- despite the enemy's efforts to keep the momentum. Enemy armored vehicles end, then two-wheeled motorcycles and buggies drive. They are running out — manpower is leaving. Then they all renew their abilities and again repeat a kind of -carousel-. They stop the Russians by all possible means. For example, by mining. -Mines do not appear by themselves on the enemy's advance routes. In order for this mine to appear, the command post must plan where specifically to place the mine barrier. Night crews should use heavy bombers to install mine barriers. As a result, a significant amount of the enemy's equipment does not reach specified boundaries precisely because of remote mine-mining,- - noted the commander of the 429th separate regiment of unmanned systems -Achilles- Yury Fedorenko. How reported ArmyInform, in Chasovo Yaru, the enemy is actively using combined assault tactics. However, it advances into the city only when it completely wipes out the Defense Forces' fortifications from the land.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/08/atrakczion-vgamuvaly-minamy-prosuvannya-voroga-na-kupyanskomu-napryamku-suttyevo-pryzupynyly/	2025-02-08T09:53:34-08:00
-Melman- is a combat medic who saves lives in Donetsk region	The story of the fighter was made public on the page of the National Guard of Ukraine. Together with his brothers, Danylo performed combat missions in the hottest points of the front, in particular, in Donetsk region, providing assistance and saving the lives of guardsmen. More often he succeeds, but there are situations in which doctors are powerless. The most difficult thing, as Danylo says, is when wounded and dead people appear on your shift. -The most difficult period during my entire time in the military was when we moved from the Serebryansky Forest to the village of Nelipivka, where I stayed with my brothers from Azov for a week. I stepped into the ambulance at about 10:00 p.m., and in about an hour and a half I left for the first wounded man. We took him and handed him over to the doctors from Azov, after which we returned and went to rest. But in two hours I was woken up and told that I had to go for two more wounded. Fortunately, everything ended well this time. The most terrible thing happened on the second day of my duty, when we were informed about the death of the platoon chief sergeant named Petrovych. When I dragged Petrovych into the car, I could not believe that he was no longer alive. I realized this only when we brought him and handed him to the medical girls in the evacuation vehicle. -Unfortunately, every day I only heard the callsigns of my brothers: one is 200, the other is 300. It's very difficult,- Melman recalls. This story is just one episode of the difficult and dangerous work of a combat medic on the front lines. Every day, Danylo and his brothers risk their lives to save others. Their courage and dedication to their work deserve respect and gratitude. As reported by ArmyInform, the war has become a part of life for many, but for one man it has become a multi-year ordeal that stretches across different conflicts and continents. His call sign is -The Enemy-. This is not just a name on the front, but the result of many years of struggle, which began in Ichkeria, then continued in Afghanistan, and now he is defending Ukraine from invaders.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/08/melman-bojovyj-medyk-yakyj-ryatuye-zhyttya-na-donechchyni/	2025-02-08T09:38:40-08:00

- Putin is not preparing for negotiations at all - — The President met with the new head of the NATO...	The President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, announced this on Saturday, February 8. According to him, one of the main topics during the meeting was the preparation for -Ramstein- and -the needs of our defense - our common defense.- -Now we know - our intelligence reports to us - that the Russians are creating new divisions, developing new military industries. Obviously, their cooperation with North Korea will continue to expand. -Unfortunately, Moscow is spreading modern war technologies to that region, in particular drone technologies,- the head of state noted. In his opinion, this can mean only one thing: -Putin is not preparing for negotiations, not for the coming of peace, but for the continuation of the war,- and not only against Ukraine. -They are now increasing their army by more than 100,000 soldiers. All partners must know about it and must see it. We are ready to pass on relevant information, and relevant communication is already taking place along the line of intelligence. We must see together what the threats are and what our countermeasures are. A clear understanding is needed: here, in Europe, every country will have to strengthen its defense, and the goal of 5% of GDP for defense will not disappear from the agenda,- emphasized Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Oleksandr Syrsky summed up the results of the year of work as the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Fo...	On this occasion, he decided to sum up his work during this time. -The composition of the military leadership of the Armed Forces was updated, new commanders were appointed. During the year, my deputies, the General Staff team, commanders and our soldiers and sailors, sergeants and foremen, officers and generals are in the ranks with me. Together, we stopped the enemy's offensive in Kharkiv Oblast, prevented the offensive in Sumy Oblast, and transferred the war to the enemy's territory. Together we restrain the ongoing offensive of the aggressor in the east. Together, during the year, we destroyed more enemy manpower, military equipment and military facilities than in the previous years of the war combined. Thank you to each and every one who loyally and courageously fights for our Motherland,- he wrote on Facebook. The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces also recalled that a year ago, the heavy defense of Avdiivka continued. -Our units were semi-surrounded. One of my first decisions as the Central Committee was to order an organized withdrawal from the city destroyed by artillery and anti-aircraft guns. This is our key priority: saving people's lives. Therefore, the Armed Forces have developed and implemented a comprehensive program -Saving the lives of servicemen-. The key directions of the program are: technologicalization of the army, improvement of training of Ukrainian defenders, improvement of medical assistance at all stages,- the general explained. Another priority for him was the principle of -fight from afar-. -During 2024, the state has deployed more than 1.3 million drones to the front. We were the first in the world to create the Forces of Unmanned Systems, scaled the already existing legendary units -Birds of Magyar-, -Achilles-, -K-2- and others. We are developing directions of robotic platforms, land and sea drones. Over the course of a year, the number of targets hit by UAVs of various types exceeded 461,000,- Oleksandr Syrsky states. In addition, a year ago the advantage of Russian troops in artillery ammunition was about 1:10, while today this ratio has decreased to almost 1:2. According to the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Ukraine owes this to its Western partners, domestic gunsmiths and counter-battery warfare (13,050 enemy artillery systems in 2024 compared to 8,400 in the two previous years. However, the achievements of the Armed Forces of Ukraine over the past year do not end there: Priority 3: to win, prepare. Despite the continuous pressure of the aggressor on the battlefield, we maximum effort to improve the training of Ukrainian military personnel. This made it possible to increase the training program, in particular, to extend the basic training to 2 months. In addition, I insist on providing 14-day adaptation course in military units after BZVP even before combat work.The more prepared and psychologically stable a soldier is, the stronger our positions will be at the front. This year, for the first time, training on foreign models of weapons and military equipment is carried out not abroad, but in Ukraine, which significantly optimizes costs and time. This became possible due to an increase in the number of instructors trained abroad. The share of sergeants and key specialists — snipers, sappers, combat medics — trained in Ukraine has also increased relative to foreign countries. Priority 4: Russia on fire. The escalation of strikes against military facilities on enemy territory continues. Military units, arsenals, storage warehouses, workshops of military-industrial complex enterprises, oil refineries that provide fuel for the Russian army, and other objects will be attacked as long as Moscow's aggression against our country continues. The DeepStrike strike distance deep into the territory of the Russian Federation has already reached 1.7 thousand. km We are preparing new long-range means, and they will be used. During this year, 377 military objects were the targets of successful complex fire damage on the territory of the Russian Federation. During the year, the Air Force and other components of the defense forces destroyed 9,200 air targets of various types, which is 2.4 times more than in 2023 (3,798). Priority 5: non-standard actions. Not only defense. Ukraine is capable of counterattacking, beating and chasing the enemy. This was proven by the defense of Kyiv, the Kharkiv offensive operation, and the liberation of the right-bank Kherson region. This was also demonstrated by the Kursk operation. We created a buffer zone in Kurshchyna, destroying the enemy's plan to launch a new offensive on Sumy and Kharkiv. This operation also eased the pressure on some areas of the front. During 6 months of active hostilities on the territory of the Russian Federation, the total losses of Russian troops in manpower amounted to more than 47 thousand people, of which more than 19 thousand were killed. Moreover, these are the most prepared Russian troops. A group of North Korean mercenaries was also defeated. During the operation, 924 soldiers of the Russian army were captured. Replenishment of the exchange fund made it possible to liberate some of our servicemen, in particular those who had been in captivity since the spring of 2022. The creation of new mechanized brigades helped to attract fresh units to the Kursk offensive. Thanks to this, we were able to withdraw three brigades of Airborne Assault Troops from Donetsk region to restore combat capability, re-equip and re-arm them, which gave the result: we have been holding hundreds of square kilometers of the territory of the aggressor country for more than 6 months. Priority 6: change to win. A year ago, we started auditing military units and military administration bodies, including the General Staff. According to the results of the audit, a number of military structures and institutions were disbanded or reduced, which made it possible to eliminate duplication of functions, remove extraneous functions and reduce unnecessarily bloated staff. The General Staff became an effective body of military management. At the expense of the released personnel, we completed the management of operational and tactical levels and combat military units. About 70,000 servicemen have been deployed to the combat zone as a result of the reduction (decrease) in the number of security, maintenance and support units. We introduced a system of promotion and appointment of officers for service in the military administration bodies, subject to the participation (experience) of servicemen in combat operations in the course of repelling the large-scale invasion of the Russian Federation. Intermediate management links were shortened and new military management bodies were formed. The personnel of the General Staff and the staff of the Commander-in-Chief were strengthened with experienced combat generals and officers. Significantly updated the command composition of compounds and units. The main criterion for appointment to positions is the ability to effectively perform combat tasks while preserving the life and health of subordinates. This year, the Armed Forces completely switched to NATO standards and principles in the training and management of troops. Priority 7: capacity building. During the year, the Armed Forces increased their combat potential, which allowed us to prevent the enemy's breakthrough and deter his offensive, despite the increase in the number of enemy troops by another 140,000. persons We created assault units (companies, battalions), which showed their effectiveness during active military operations (offensive), including in the Kursk region. Today, we are forming assault regiments on their basis. We also managed to significantly increase the capabilities of the Armed Forces to fight in the electromagnetic spectrum. In addition, a radio-electronic warfare battalion, more than a hundred EW companies in brigades and EW units in line battalions of brigades were formed. The formation of a separate educational Center for the training of radio electronic warfare specialists has begun. The -Aisberg- EW equipment management system has been developed and implemented in the troops. The codification of 83 latest EW devices was carried out and tens of thousands of devices were delivered to the troops. Capacity building of the -Pokrova- REB subsystem was carried out. We have increased our fighter air cover capabilities through the deployment of F-16s. We are also strengthening our air defense with Mirage 2000 multi-role fighters, which have already been provided by our French partners. Countermeasures and destruction of UAVs have been improved due to the involvement of combined aircraft and helicopter detachments, crews of UAV interceptors. Countermeasures against guided aerial bombs and the destruction of air defense systems were strengthened by additional deployment of modern hardware and software complexes and EW means. Direct coverage of priority objects of critical infrastructure of the fuel and energy sector and industry was carried out. We ensured a ban on the actions of the enemy's surface forces in the western part of the Black Sea, thus creating the conditions for launching a sea corridor and exports from/to the ports of Ukraine. The Russian Black Sea Fleet was forced to withdraw virtually all warships, including the Caliber carriers, from Sevastopol and Feodosia to Novorossiysk. The experience of three years of combat operations against the overwhelming forces of the enemy dictates the need for changes in the formation of groups and the structure of the troops to a more stable and manageable one. We see it and understand it. Therefore, these changes will take place soon. In particular, I initiated the transition to the corpus system. We conducted a thorough analysis of the effectiveness of the existing management system of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Based on its results, the NSDC decision put into effect the Concept of the reorganization of the Armed Forces in war conditions, developed by us with the aim of maximally realizing the combat potential of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. We have practically already begun the formation of army corps, as the first step on the way to improving our army. Despite the fact that the reform has to be implemented simply on the march, we are consistently and confidently moving along this path. In the future, we will build a clear body structure. At the end of the third year of a full-scale war, we continue to fight, however difficult it is. We are streamlining mobilization, strengthening recruiting. At the same time, in the current conditions, we cannot do without the transfer and secondment of servicemen from non-combat military units to combat units. This process is currently ongoing. After all, if the front, as they say, -falls apart-, then all our plans will not be worth a broken egg. Priority 8: unity is the key to our stability. I spent this year with our soldiers. I regularly meet with them on the front lines, hear their suggestions and wishes, work together with them at control points on new solutions for the front. I know they are tired. For many, this war has been going on for almost 11 years. The last three years — without rest, in constant struggle. Are there any problems? Yes, there is. But we are aware of these challenges and are doing our best to overcome them. History proves that Ukraine will exist as long as its Armed Forces exist. And the Armed Forces will fight as long as the Ukrainian people stand side by side with them. Let us remember that unity is what got us through 2022 and what should lead us to victory now. I see this as my mission and fulfill it. And finally, but most importantly. When you see a tired Ukrainian soldier who has come from the front for a few days to see his family, approach him and say thank you. Because we are all family. Because this soldier is the only one standing between you and the ruthless Russian invader.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/08/oleksandr-syrskyj-pidbyv-pidsumky-svoyeyi-roboty-za-rik-na-posadi-golovnokomanduvacha-zsu/	2025-02-08T05:51:14-08:00

The infantry disembarked from the vehicles unscheduled and were finished off with skirmishes and artillery. The epic assault of the Russians ended with the destruction of the BREM, which was driven to evacuate the -sunkers-, the report says. As a result, Ukrainian defenders destroyed 10 units of enemy tanks, BMPs and other vehicles. In addition, 10 occupiers were eliminated, and about 30 more were injured. -We are watching how the First Tank Army of the Russian Federation is confidently turning into the First Cavalry Army. And we expect new rides on horses and donkeys,- jokes the commander of the 3rd OSHB Andriy Biletskyi on this occasion. As ArmiyaInform reported, the fighters of the Defense Forces managed to stop the enemy assault on their positions before it started.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/08/ochikuyemo-nakaty-na-konyah-i-vislyukah-bijczi-3-oshb-rozgromyly-na-harkivshhyni-tankovu-elitu-zs-rf/	2025-02-08T05:37:39-08:00
-Youtube-, -Pastet- and -Zidan-: the story of three Ukrainian soldiers who destroyed the enemy in hi...	This is discussed in a post on the brigade page. They were tasked with occupying an observation post recently vacated by Ukrainian troops and replacing their comrades. Six kilometers on foot in full gear, trying to remain undetected, an extremely difficult task, but they made it. They equipped a -point- and spent a week there, watching everything fly over their heads that can only fly in such conditions. And then the assaults began. Armored vehicles of the occupiers moved forward. Our heroes remained in shelter, passing important information to the commander -Cat-. Meanwhile, Ukrainian artillery, together with drones, methodically destroyed the enemy. And what is interesting: the occupiers, despite the losses, repeated the same maneuvers again and again during the following days - and each time received a crushing blow. They did not even suspect that invisible -ghosts- were watching literally a few tens of meters from them. And our boys had a hard time. The enemy came upon them again and again, and they had to fight close quarters, repelling attacks. At one of these moments, YouTube, who went on a mission for the first time, fell into a trap: he believed that the occupiers wanted to surrender and was seriously wounded. And all the responsibility for the further battle fell on -Pate-. However, even after that, our scouts did not give up. They survived, fought, held on as best they could. They were constantly helped by drone pilots - they dropped water, food, BC, cigarettes and painkillers and antibiotics for the wounded. And when the first opportunity appeared, the command conducted an evacuation operation, and all three were able to get out. They killed at least ten occupiers, helped burn more enemy equipment and manpower, and, most importantly, returned alive. But there is one more important point. -Youtube- and -Pastet- are fighters who previously voluntarily left another unit (SZCH). But they returned. They understood: fighting is not just a duty, it is the only choice. Because someone has to defend Ukraine. Now they are serving in the 23rd separate mechanized brigade, treating their injuries and preparing for new tasks. As reported by ArmyInform, Yevgeny, known among his peers by the nickname -Instructor-, recently taught children at school in Kyiv Oblast. However, with the beginning of a full-scale invasion, he left his peaceful profession and took up the defense of Ukraine. Today he is the company commander of the rifle battalion of the 58th separate motorized infantry brigade of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/08/yutub-pashtet-i-zidan-istoriya-troh-ukrayinskyh-voyiniv-yaki-tyzhden-nyshhyly-voroga-v-jogo-tylu/	2025-02-08T05:14:15-08:00

However, as you know, for the spell to work, a falling star is necessary, and the -Predator- brigade has plenty of them for the Russian occupiers. To confirm this, the patrol officers shared a corresponding video on their social networks, in which the invaders have a unique opportunity to use the magic of Ukrainian defenders to make their last wish. -FPVs fall, we make a wish. Predators have their own magic: one click - and the enemy's body is on fire. One more click and the occupier misses the head. Sometimes there are -talented- actors - they fall even before the impact,- law enforcement officers comment on the released footage. Moreover, as ArmyInform reported, Ukrainian drones are able not only to fulfill wishes, but also even resurrect the dead occupiers, though, not for long.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/08/u-hyzhakiv-svoya-magiya-patrulni-skydayut-na-okupantiv-fpv-zirky-a-ti-zagaduyut-ostannye-bazhannya/	2025-02-08T04:57:25-08:00
-Athena- in the service of the Defense Forces: a four-legged helper of heavy bomber drones	About the four-legged assistant it was told on the brigade page. Its owner Igor, alias -Rama-, says that he got the dog when he was still serving in the infantry, he wanted to go on assaults with it, taught him to jump into enemy trenches. But later the boy transferred to the UAV unit, and these skills acquired during the training of -Athena- were never needed. Instead, others came to the rescue - by delivering the necessary items to the position of the unit. -It happens that we are at a point, we are working, and we suddenly need something - you don't want to call a car for this and -burn- your position. — Narrated by -Rama-. — I communicate by radio with the guys who are on the spot, they attach a first aid kit, or batteries, or something else to Athena, then raise the radio to her, I give the command, and my little one flies to us like an arrow. In general, the Malinois breed is ideal for use in the military, for example they serve in the Israeli army. These dogs are easy to learn, clearly follow commands, are not demanding in care. -Athena- in me is generally smart: she does what she has to do without being distracted by any stimuli - be it gunshots, explosions, or just other dogs or cats. A true fighter will always follow the orders of the commander. And she is the best friend, faithful and reliable.- As reported by ArmyInform, senior driver of the mortar battery of the 32nd OMBr Viktor, a 46-year-old father of three children from Cherkassy, ​​is one of those humble heroes whose exploits are not always visible. His job is to deliver ammunition under a hellish rain from the sky, where mines, shells and anti-aircraft guns are pouring down.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/08/afina-na-sluzhbi-syl-oborony-chotyrylapa-pomichnyczya-vazhkyh-bombarduvalnyh-droniv/	2025-02-08T04:32:05-08:00

President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated this in an interview with the Reuters agency. -This is one of the steps that was preventive: to prevent the Russians from capturing Sumy, the North, and capturing Kharkiv, the East. And it was there, in this region, that preventive actions of our military took place: they began the Kursk offensive. Their task was to disrupt the occupation of our cities. And our brigades took successful steps. They did everything beautifully. It was very dangerous,- the head of state explained. At the same time, he noted that it will be possible to fully assess the results of the Kursk operation only later. -Everything that the Kursk operation did, we will be able to properly evaluate only after analysis, probably after the end of the war, analyzing certain military, political, military-political steps,- Volodymyr Zelenskyi said. North Korean soldiers returned to Kurshchyna - Volodymyr Zelenskyi As reported by ArmyInform, special forces of the SSO told about the secrets of the Kursk operation.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/08/zrobyly-vse-krasyvo-kurska-operacziya-zirvala-okupacziyu-nashyh-mist-volodymyr-zelenskyj/	2025-02-08T04:16:04-08:00
-Even trepanation didn't help-: the Russian rocket-killer -killed himself-	This was reported by the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. The explosion that killed him did not go off in Ukraine, but in the rear of Shuya, Ivanovo region of the Russian Federation, where he was serving. On 3 January 2025, the captain sustained multiple injuries. Russian medicine tried to do the impossible, but even trepanation of the skull did not save him from his just fate. As the GUR of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine emphasizes, there will be inevitable retribution for every war crime against the Ukrainian people. As reported by ArmyInform, on October 5, 2023, the Russian military struck from the Iskander-M complex in the village of Groza in Kharkiv Oblast - a rocket hit a cafe where local residents were holding a memorial service for their fellow soldier.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/08/ne-dopomogla-navit-trepanacziya-rosijskyj-raketnyk-ubyvczya-zadvuhsotyvsya/	2025-02-08T03:53:31-08:00
From Ichkeria to Ukraine: The border guard's path to the pseudo-Enemy-	The story of the fighter was made public on the DPSU page. Since 2019, he has been serving in the ranks of the State Border Service of Ukraine, becoming a contractor, and has chosen for himself the difficult but critically important role of an explosives engineer. For him, war is a reality with which he lives not for the first time. From Ichkeria to the current front in Ukraine, his path was not easy, but he continues to stand in defense of his native land, because this is his mission. The video posted on the DPSU page reveals his thoughts and experiences. Dushman says that the destruction he saw in Ichkeria is now being repeated in Ukraine. According to him, the enemy has not changed: -They must be destroyed.- It was this that became his driving force when he learned of the death of his family during the war. -I don't care, I'm not afraid of anything,- he says. It became a moment when he had nothing to lose and decided to do what others could not. As an explosives engineer, he deals with high explosives, explosives and other explosive objects, creating means to destroy the enemy. He does not just perform the task, but also makes special means with the maximum effect himself. -We've already shown what we do ourselves, we crush ourselves,- he says. As he notes, the State Border Service of Ukraine is the -shield of the country-, and every soldier here is an important link in its protection. -We need you,- he tells the new recruits, to whom he imparts his knowledge and experience. For Dushman, the main goal is not only to neutralize the enemy, but also to return to his native Mariupol to be near those he loves. The war changed him, but it also imprinted in him an unshakable determination and belief in victory. As reported by ArmiyaInform, Viktor, a 46-year-old father of three from Cherkaschyna, a senior driver of a mortar battery platoon of the 32nd OMBr, is one of those humble heroes whose exploits are not always visible. His job is to deliver ammunition under hellish rain from the sky, where mines, shells and anti-aircraft missiles are falling.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/08/vid-ichkeriyi-do-ukrayiny-shlyah-prykordonnyka-na-psevdo-dushman/	2025-02-08T03:39:32-08:00

Within the scope of the project, the training of future social support officers for representatives of combat units took place at the base of the patronage service of the Third Separate Assault Brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. -The task of the project is to make the support of our military systematic and effective. From the moment of injury to full recovery and return to duty, a fighter should know that he will not be left alone with his problems. Help and support will also be provided to the families of the dead and the missing,- noted the Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine, Brigadier General of Justice Serhiy Melnyk. The event, which was held in a mixed format (online and offline), was attended by representatives of the military units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection of Ukraine. The speakers were the coordinators of the patronage service of the 3rd OShBr, BO of the -Angels- charity fund, frontline coordinators and civilian experts. The participants were told about the stages of medical evacuation and escorting of the wounded, interaction with medical institutions, features of communication with the families of the dead and missing. Particular attention was paid to the issue of registration of the status of UBD, as well as the payment of financial support during treatment and rehabilitation.

Ivan Petrychak, a representative of the press service of the 24th separate mechanized brigade named after King Danylo, told about this on the air of the Yedyni Novyny telethon. According to him, the enemy's tactics are now mixed. If earlier the enemy came in small groups of attack aircraft that literally walked kilometers to Ukrainian positions, now that has changed. Apparently, the enemy wants to save time, so they throw assault groups using large numbers of BMDs - amphibious assault vehicles. The -Royal Infantry- take turns burning these armored vehicles with infantry. -This infantry is hurrying, dispersing. Unfinished ones are then regrouped. And from the basements - we are fighting in the buildings - from the bushes and forests, they are trying to unite again. Renew your strength and attack,- Ivan Petrychak said. As ArmyInform reported, enemy attacks on the Seversky direction depend on the weather - during cold weather, equipment is actively involved, including tanks, BMPs, buggies, motorcycles and ATVs. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/08/bojova-mashyna-domovyna-v-chasovomu-yaru-rosijskyh-desantnykiv-aktyvno-palyat-razom-z-yihnoyu-broneyu/	2025-02-08T03:02:17-08:00
Fake from the enemy: Russia is preparing a provocation against the Coordination Staff on the Treatme...	They reported this on their page. The enemy plans to distribute forged documents with the emblems of the Coordination Headquarters, which will contain false information. These papers do not meet the standards of document circulation, contain fictitious names of officials and names of regional units. The purpose of such forgeries is to discredit the work of state institutions and to sow distrust among the population. The occupiers do not stop trying to manipulate the families of captured, missing and enslaved civilians. To do this, they use lies and substitution. In this regard, GUR urges citizens to be attentive and vigilant, not to spread misinformation on social networks and not to trust unverified persons and organizations that may offer assistance. Please report any attempt to demand money for -services- related to enslaved Ukrainians to the law enforcement authorities immediately. We emphasize that all the assistance of the Coordinating Headquarters specialists is free of charge. This incident is another example of how the Russian occupiers use dirty methods of information warfare to achieve their goals. It is important to remain calm and be critical of any information, especially if it concerns the sensitive topic of prisoners of war. As reported by ArmyInform, the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine addressed to the military personnel with an important appeal. Intelligencers ask to hand over samples of Russian scientific and technical products for detailed analysis.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/08/fejk-vid-voroga-rosiya-gotuye-provokacziyu-proty-koordynaczijnogo-shtabu-z-pytan-povodzhennya-z-vijskovopolonenymy/	2025-02-08T02:47:13-08:00
Soldiers of the Ukrainian Armed Forces stopped the predicted assault even before it began	This was reported by the 225th separate assault regiment of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, having published footage of the destruction of enemy forces with the help of drones on their social networks. -On the video, the enemy approached our positions, but the operative carousel of drones of the Pentagon unit changed the course of events. One drone leads, the second carries out the reset, and when it is recharging, the third is on the move,- the soldiers note. According to them, thermal imaging cameras helped them destroy the Russian invaders so effectively. -Thanks to the coordinated work of the crews on night cameras that tracked the targets' signatures, we accurately hit and eliminated the enemy's assault unit. The enemy was driven to the dugout, deprived of support and the ability to maneuver. After such a shock operation, the only thing left for the infantry was to clear the area,- Ukrainian defenders said. They stopped the assault before it started!

Serhiy Tsekhotskyi, an officer of the 59th separate mechanized brigade named after Yakov Handziuk, said this on the air of the -Edyni Novyni- telethon. According to him, now the enemy is throwing the maximum number of his troops there. The goal is to reach the Pokrovsk-Pavlograd route, gain a foothold there, and cut off the logistics of the Defense Forces. However, so far the enemy's achievements are such that hundreds of their fighters are dying in this direction. -Foot assaults mainly. They drive cars - Nivas, UAZs, buggies, motorcycles. 2-3 cars each. A goal is given - to one of our positions. They approach on these machines at maximum speed, land, and then they already have the goal of gaining a foothold somewhere in our already abandoned dugouts. And then we have to smoke them all night until the morning,- said Serhii Tsehotskyi. As reported by ArmyInform, in the Pokrovsky direction, in the zone of responsibility of the Kara-Dag brigade, the situation remains extremely tense and complicated. The enemy relentlessly continues to storm positions along the entire front line, using the tactics of small groups of infantry. There are fewer mechanized assaults due to the fog.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/08/pihota-yide-na-legkovyh-avtomobilyah-u-sylah-oborony-rozpovily-kudy-rvetsya-vorog-na-pokrovskomu-napryamku/	2025-02-08T02:26:26-08:00

-The main thing is to deliver BC-: how a driver with the call sign -Zhyvyy- risks his life every day...	The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. -It's hard, but it's stimulating joy that we have something to shoot, which is to destroy the occupiers,- Victor says, calmly speaking of the constant risk and danger that accompany his missions. However, his biggest fear is not getting ammunition to the positions or getting his comrades off the battlefield. Called up for service back in 2014, Viktor received the call sign -Live- and since then has become an integral part of the 32nd Brigade. For his courage and bravery, he was awarded the Order of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine - the Golden Cross. Despite this, he remained humble and noted that the real heroes are those on the front lines, and his role is only to help. To save life in conditions of constant danger, Viktor shares his advice for military drivers: before leaving, the car must be carefully prepared and refueled, it is important to have a charged EW to protect against drones. Helmet and bulletproof vest are a must. His secrets are maneuvering, being fast and always changing routes, as well as acting on intuition at night, when the effectiveness of aerial reconnaissance is reduced. The main talisman for Victor is the prayers of his mother and wife, and his motivation is the desire to return to his children. There is calmness in his words, but also the strength he draws from every road traveled and every shipment delivered. Victor is another one of the many who actually hold the front, risking their lives for the future of their country. As reported by ArmyInform, at this moment -Jack- - the commander of the 6th company - came to the front.

- The law is like a bridle: where you turn, that's where it turned out - - the occupiers continue to...	This was reported by the head of the Luhansk OVA, Artem Lysogor. The so-called -People's Council of the People's Republic of China- adopted changes to the regional law regulating the use of real estate. According to the new rules, up to 35% of residential premises, which the court recognizes as municipal property, can be transferred to the federal property of Russia. Another 30% will be owned by -LNR-. And in order for everything to go smoothly, among those who will receive these apartments in priority order will be&#8230; judges The same ones who will decide on nationalization. While the occupiers are legalizing apartment raids, about 60,000 public sector workers in the occupied Luhansk region are still without salaries for 2014-2015. The total debt already exceeds a billion rubles, and the collection of documents continues. It is obvious that no one will see the money, because the occupiers have other priorities - the razing of real estate. Thus, the residents of the temporarily occupied Luhansk region received another -gift- from the Russian authorities: their apartments are taken, and their debts are not returned. But -Russian peace- promised something completely different, didn't it? As reported by ArmyInform, the occupiers gave exactly three weeks to the residents of a high-rise building in the new districts of Severodonetsk, which is in the temporarily occupied territory. href=-https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/pakujte-valizy-ta-gotujte-gamanczi-okupanty-stavlyat-ultymatumy-zhytelyam-tot-luganshhyny/->for resettlement and removal of property.

When warming occurs, according to him, the enemy's tactics also change dramatically. They attack more in small infantry groups. The groups are heavily supported by artillery and aircraft. This situation is due to the ground not being sufficiently frozen due to the warm winter. -It is necessary to understand the specificity of the soils of Donbas. The weather is cold, but it seems like it. Therefore, infantry attacks are carried out, the equipment will not pass in such conditions. -The swamp is a key obstacle for equipment,- said Commander Barney of the 10th Separate Mountain Assault Brigade Edelweiss.

The Black Sea Marines showed how they hunt the invaders in the steppes of Donetsk region	The video of combat work was made public on the brigade's page. The released footage shows how drones cover enemy positions with jewel-like accuracy, leaving the occupiers with minimal chances for rescue. The tactics of using drones allow Ukrainian fighters to effectively track enemy movements, adjust artillery strikes, and inflict point damage. In the steppe area, where the enemy is trying to gain a foothold, drones become a key tool in the fight. They make it possible to detect invaders even in camouflaged positions, and then to eliminate them in a timely manner. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the 1st battalion of the 37th Marine Brigade conducted a successful operation to clear and destroy the enemy position.

Despite losses and capture. -Militarymen, both of our brigade and of neighboring units, periodically capture Russian servicemen who wish to surrender. Sometimes they do not perceive the information about surrender adequately, and make attempts to end their lives on their own,- Vitaly Milovidov said. As ArmyInform reported, Ukrainian sappers have once again proven that proper mining is not only defense but also the art of tactical surprise. This time, the enemy's armored vehicles decided to test the strength of the borders under our control. and came across an explosive argument.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/08/zdijsnyuyut-sproby-zavershyty-svoye-zhyttya-samostijno-na-pokrovskomu-napryamku-tryvayut-zapekli-boyi/	2025-02-08T00:08:34-08:00
-Opto-fiber vs. REB-: how the drones of the Defense Forces are using a new type of drones	For more details on the advantages and features of using this type of drones, see report of Lieutenant Serhiy Lipko on Army TV. The commander of the unmanned systems platoon of the 63rd separate mechanized brigade with the call sign -King- said that the main advantages of fiber-optic drones are an uninterrupted picture for the operator and immunity to the enemy's electronic warfare (EW) equipment. -A drone is not really that complicated,- says King. — That is, it could be produced even earlier. And it solves two very serious problems for us: the first is the REE, and the second is that our area has very rugged terrain. That is, you need to fly into hollows, you need to fly into the forest, you need to bypass several obstacles on the way to the dugout, and many of our drones were lost due to the fact that the analog video signal simply disappears due to a bad radio horizon. And here there is no radio horizon - everything is transmitted by optical fiber.- According to King, the signal is transmitted via optical fiber, which ensures a perfect picture even when flying directly over the enemy's trenches. He also noted that the drone can be used in the forest without fear of getting caught in tree branches. However, fiber-optic drones also have their drawbacks. They are larger and less maneuverable, making them easier targets for the enemy. The only way to deal with such drones is to physically destroy them with small arms or other ammunition. -If he slows down, starts to get on target, there's a very good chance he's going to get hit,- King says. As reported by ArmiyaInform, correspondents of ArmyInform visited the testing of drones flying on optical fiber and learned about the advantages they will have these UAVs on the battlefield.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/08/optovolokno-proty-rebu-yak-dronari-syl-oborony-vykorystovuyut-drony-novogo-typu/	2025-02-07T23:41:06-08:00

-Jack- Who Defied Death: How One Commander Saved Two Companies of Paratroopers and Changed the Battl...	The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. In a situation where the enemy had an advantage in numbers and fortified positions, -Jack- managed not only to knock the enemy out of an ambush, but also to occupy a strategically important line. At that moment, the fate of two Ukrainian companies literally hung in the balance. When the commander of the 7th company was wounded, -Jack- took command, uniting the two companies into a single fist. The enemy, not knowing their exact location, recklessly continued to move, which allowed the paratroopers to deliver a devastating blow. Two enemy attacks were repulsed, and as a result of well-organized fire, the enemy lost up to a company of personnel and a significant amount of equipment. After a series of successful battles, it became clear: the equipment is knocked out, the enemy knows the location of Ukrainian soldiers, and the transport and evacuation routes are blocked. But for -Jack-, there was no -surrender- option - only breakthrough. The only surviving armored personnel carrier, he organized the evacuation of the wounded commander of the 7th company and part of the soldiers, while the rest had to break through swamps, rivers and enemy barricades on foot. — -I indicated people only the end point, not the route itself. By that time, we already knew we were being tapped,- recalls -Jack.- Two days of hell. Two days without sleep or rest, with constant battles and pursuit of the enemy. But thanks to the clear coordination of actions and indomitable spirit, the Ukrainian soldiers came to their own. They came out alive. During this operation, Jack's unit destroyed about three platoons of the invaders, four units of armored vehicles and a dozen vehicles. But the main thing is that he saved more than a hundred Ukrainian soldiers who could have become victims of an enemy trap. For this feat, the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy awarded -Jack- with the highest state honor - the -Golden Star- Order of the Hero of Ukraine. As reported by ArmyInform, the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky awarded state awards to Ukrainian soldiers who are participating in the operation in the Kursk region.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/08/dzhek-yakyj-peregrav-smert-yak-odyn-komandyr-vryatuvav-dvi-roty-desantnykiv-i-zminyv-hid-boyu/	2025-02-07T22:44:22-08:00

They saved -Bogdan- under fire: -Sultan- spoke about the evacuation and repair of equipment at the f...	-Sultan- is a professional lawyer from Kyiv. Before the large-scale invasion of the Russian Federation, he worked as the deputy director of the legal department of the Tax Administration of Ukraine, the director of the legal department of the State Commission for the Regulation of Financial Services Markets and the head of the legal department at the Deposit Guarantee Fund of Individuals. He has two years of experience in military service. As part of the 53rd separate mechanized brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, he participated in the anti-terrorist operation in the Luhansk region near the settlements of Shchastya, Stanytsia Luhanska, and Krymske. Resigned from the service. From February 24, 2022, together with his eldest son, he took up the defense of the capital and Kyiv region. It was the 66th rifle battalion, formed on the basis of one of the TKC and SP Kyiv. After the liberation of Kyiv region, the unit was transferred to the Bakhmut direction. When the formation of the 48th artillery brigade began, he was offered to head the repair unit. -I have three platoons in my unit that are engaged in repair and technical recovery in their respective directions. The first platoon is engaged in the repair and maintenance of weapons. These are conventional small arms as well as artillery, except for the Bohdan self-propelled guns. Why don't we touch this art installation? Self-propelled guns are under the manufacturer's certification guarantee. Therefore, we do not have the right to do any repair and restoration work. All -repair manipulations- are carried out by the manufacturer's representatives in a safe and designated place. The -Bogdana- calculation only delivers or evacuates the car from the positions, if it is not technically sound and cannot reach the specified point on its own. In general, two enterprises of Ukraine are engaged in the repair and maintenance of the -Bohdan- self-propelled guns, while one restores the artillery part of the installation, the other - the undercarriage of the machine. Our specialists can do only minor repairs on -Bohdans-, without getting into the -guts and brains- of the machine, so to speak. What is it about? An easy repair is to get a fragment, for example, into the fuel tank of a self-propelled gun. By the way, we recently had such a case. The enemy wanted to destroy -Bogdana- with artillery strikes, fortunately, shrapnel from shells fell nearby. Then you need to quickly -fix- the problem. This is a fairly simple repair, but it must be carried out promptly so that the vehicle can leave the firing positions and leave the mission area before the arrival of a certified service, which will continue to service the vehicle in safe conditions. Thank God, this -Bohdana- is still -alive- and swarming with rasists. If the engine, gearbox, or something else in the undercarriage breaks down, or there are some deficiencies in the operation of the artillery on the -Bogdan-, you cannot climb there. There are guarantees from the factory workers, and if they -climb- there, there will be claims from the manufacturer and the repair will no longer be free. The second platoon is engaged in the repair and maintenance of automotive equipment, which is in the brigade's arsenal. There are different situations. Damaged equipment is located relatively close to the contact line or in more secure areas. It's not important. We are evacuating equipment from the dangerous zone. This is exactly the work of the third platoon, which performs the task of evacuation. If it is not possible to quickly evacuate the equipment or there is intense enemy shelling, in some places it is necessary to repair the equipment even in such difficult conditions. How our work is organized in general. The simplest example, a wheel shot out on the road or a pipe burst in the car. The repair team leaves. We have a specialized machine-workshop on wheels, with everything you need to carry out repairs in the field: tools, generator, jacks, spare parts for mechanisms that often break, welding machine and, most importantly, repair specialists, etc. That is, our task in such emergency cases is to provide quick assistance so that the car with the crew does not stay in the dangerous zone for a long time. Unfortunately, today we don't have special equipment that can pull out large and heavy cars, but we can evacuate small cars anywhere: whether it's a swamp or a reservoir, it's not important. The armed forces of the brigade have BM-27 -Hurricane- multiple rocket systems. We also repair them. Again, if it's some simple repair. More complex repairs, for example, overhauling the engine in the field, are simply impossible to do. The same applies to the armament of this installation. We send equipment to repair plants. But if, relatively speaking, candles or filters need to be replaced on the -Hurricanes-, then, of course, we restore them on the spot, in the area of ​​hostilities, in -waiting points- or areas where our artillery units are deployed. We can also solve the electronics issues of these RSZVs, we have a professional electrician who can do it. For example, some switch in a combat vehicle burned out. The repairmen of the unit risk their lives as much as the arthrocalculations of combat vehicles. The enemy conducts work within the limits of counter-battery combat, makes -marches-, calculates from where our -Bohdana- self-propelled guns will strike at the enemy. And sometimes he manages to detect the works of our gunners. the Rashists strike at the -Saushok- firing positions. We once had a case where the occupiers cut the installation with shrapnel, the machine caught fire. Our repair team needed to react quickly. After all, it was possible to save the valuable equipment, parts and mechanisms of the -Bohdana-. And the enemy continued to shell. The boys were working nearby that day and arrived quickly. Together with the crew, they saved everything that could be saved in this car. Then the specialist of the repair company was seriously injured. Combat work in our country continues around the clock and at risk to health and own life. &nbsp; The unit is made up of pros. Mechanics, auto fitters, electricians, welders, in short, people with experience in technology. There are people who, before the Great War, had never, so to speak, held tools in their hands. We have a guy in civilian life who worked in the regular department of -New Post-, now he is a good tire fitter, and the best at that. Another guy, who now mainly repairs car engines, before the invasion of the Russian Federation, worked as a loader in a private company in the Poltava region. Called up for mobilization about a year and a half ago. And now he is one of the best mechanics in my company. People do not sleep at night, repairing equipment so that it can return to the units in the combat zone as soon as possible. We try to -pump up- people who are drafted into the unit, except for the BZVP, with professional training. The other day, two boys were sent for professional training at the Armed Forces Educational Center. There they will master the repair of artillery weapons. Although in civilian life they were in no way tangential to repairs. Regarding recruiting issues. There are always not enough people. We are at war with Russia, not with some Shantrapa. We also urgently need repair specialists. The more professional specialists, the better the combat readiness of the units. This is an axiom. It is good that changes were made to the legislation of Ukraine in the fall. Now conscripts and volunteer reservists can choose a military unit for service without going to territorial recruitment and social support centers. A person can come to us directly, get the necessary information about vacancies. If everything is in order, the unit commander gives a referral to pass the VLK and that's it - the matter went further. Each conscript will be able to enter the service in the military unit to which he actually wanted to enter. This is the main thing. Our crew belongs to the priority equipment parts, so there should be no problems at all.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/08/ryatuvaly-bogdanu-pid-obstrilamy-sultan-rozpoviv-pro-evakuacziyu-ta-remont-tehniky-na-fronti-reportazh-armiyainform/	2025-02-07T20:55:02-08:00
Burnt Tambovshchyna: how an attempt to get rid of the Moscow occupation led to three famines and dep...	Today, the Kremlin in Russia's Kursk region is destroying villages with the help of aviation and artillery, purposefully dropping guided aerial bombs on civilian shelters. ArmyInform wants to remind you how back in the spring of 1921, the Red Army under the command of Tukhachevsky destroyed villages and towns in its own Tambov province using artillery, armored vehicles and chemical weapons with no less brutality. Seizing power in Russia at the end of 1917, the Bolsheviks began to carry out the so-called -military-communist- policy of pro-distribution in the villages, that is, by force, with the help of armed -pro-departments-, they took away from the peasants bread and other food necessary for the existence of the Red Army and the urban population. This policy was accompanied by the mobilization of peasants for military service, various types of duties (labor, labor, etc.). Rich in chernozem, the Tambov province was the first to feel the full burden of food distribution. Already by October 1918 there were 50 sub-units from Petrograd, Moscow and other cities with a population of up to 5,000. persons No other province of the former empire had known such plunder. After the Bolshevik marauders raked the clean grain from the peasants, it often rotted at the nearest railway stations, the advance teams drank the grain, distilled it into moonshine. To this can be added the looting and closing of churches and other atrocities committed by the Moscow horde to this day. The first form of resistance to prodrazverstka was the -quiet protest- typical of the Russian population - the reduction of the peasant's own farm. If in 1918 in the black-earth Tambov province, one peasant farm cultivated an average of 4.3 tens of acres of land, then in 1920 - 2.8 tens of acres. Fields were sown in sizes needed only for personal consumption. But soon the peasants were forced to choose between starvation and armed resistance to the new government. The situation of the peasants worsened especially sharply in 1920, when Tambov Oblast was hit by a drought, and the level of poverty remained extremely high. In a number of counties of the Tambov province, residents were forced to eat quinoa, tree bark, and nettles. The uprising broke out spontaneously in mid-August 1920. in the villages of Khitrovo and Kamianka of the Tambov district, where the villagers refused to hand over bread and disarmed the prodzach. Within a month, popular indignation spread to several districts of the province, the number of insurgents reached 4,000 armed men and about 10,000 with pitchforks and scythes. A kind of -peasant republic- was formed on the territory of Kirsanovsky, Borysoglib and Tambov counties, with its center in the village of Kamyanka. At the head of the uprising was a burgher of the city of Kirsanova, a former parish clerk and a public teacher, the Left Socialist-Revolutionary Oleksandr Antonov (1889–1922). His biography included a combative SR past, imprisonment during the tsarist years, command of the Kirsanovsky District militia after the February Revolution. He left the post of the head of the district police voluntarily due to his rejection of the Bolshevik dictatorship and the policy pursued by the new government towards the peasants. Since the autumn of 1918. Antonov formed a -combat wife- and began an armed struggle against the Bolsheviks. His unit became the organizational core of the partisan army. Under the command of Antonov, the forces of the rebels grew rapidly. This was facilitated by the clarity of the goals of the uprising (slogans -death to communists- and -for a free peasant republic-), successful military operations in favorable geographical conditions (a large number of forests and other natural shelters), flexible partisan tactics of sudden attacks and rapid retreats. In February 1921, when the insurgent movement reached its peak, the number of fighters reached 40 thousand people, the army was divided into 21 regiments and a separate brigade. Rebels ransacked state farms and communes, damaged railways. The uprising began to go beyond the local borders, finding a response in the border districts of the neighboring Voronezh and Saratov provinces. Moscow's reaction did not take long. At the end of February and the beginning of March 1921, an -authoritative commission- headed by V.A. was formed. Antonov-Ovsienko. This is the same red leader who previously commanded the so-called -Ukrainian Soviet Army- that carried out the Bolshevik occupation of Ukraine. It was this -authoritative commission- that concentrated all the power in the Tambov province in its hands. Large military contingents, equipment, including artillery, armored units and aircraft, were removed from the fronts that ended hostilities (in particular, from Ukraine). The entire province was divided into six military districts with field headquarters and emergency authorities - -political commissions-. The number of Red Army soldiers increased to 100,000 within a few months. But before that, on February 2, 1921, the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine (b) instructed M. Bukharin, E. Preobrazhensky and L. Kamenev to -develop and approve the text of the appeal&#8230; to the peasants of the Tambov province in order to distribute it only in this province, without printing it in newspapers.- It was a fake message, which announced the withdrawal of the product distribution and the permission of the local trade exchange of agricultural products. It began to be distributed already on February 9, which brought some confusion to the ranks of the rebels. 27 April 1921 at the suggestion of Lenin, the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party (b) adopted a resolution -On the liquidation of Antonov's gangs in the Tambov province-, according to which M. was appointed as the commander of the operation. Tukhachevsky. Along with him in Tambov region, the famous red punishers I. Uborevich, G. Kotovskyi, G. Yagoda, V. Ulrich, A. Levin (L. Bielskyi), Ukrainian collaborator M. Kakurin et al. A brutal military occupation of the areas controlled by the rebels began. The Red Army completely destroyed their farms and destroyed their houses, took hostages, including children, created concentration camps where the necessary information was extracted under torture, shot for disobedience, for hiding -bandits- and weapons, etc. It is estimated that during the so-called -repression of the rebellion- about 100,000 people were imprisoned and about 15,000 were shot, several dozen rural settlements were completely destroyed. In the summer of 1921, the main forces of Antonov were defeated. At the end of June and at the beginning of July, a final order was issued to them, according to which the fighting units were asked to split into groups and flee into the forests. The rebellion broke up into isolated foci, which continued to put up a desperate resistance until the end of the year. Antonov and his group were destroyed in June 1922. After that, Black Earth Tambovshchyna turned into a depopulated desert. As of 1922, 37% of the inhabitants did not have a roof over their heads, 54% did not have anything to cultivate the land, and in those farms that still held, compared to 1916, the number of working cattle decreased by 40%, sheep - by 63%, pigs - by 76%. As a result, at the beginning of 1925, Tambov region experienced a severe famine, as a result of which several thousand residents died. And then - even stronger, in 1932-1933. Despite the scale of famine and repression, the insurgent movement in Tambov region did not stop. In July 1942, during the Second World War, a partisan unit named after Antonov was formed. In Tambov, leaflets were scattered with a call to fight against the Stalinist government, and on July 26, investigator NKV Gershun was killed and a train with aviation fuel was blown up. After the Soviet government forcibly deported entire peoples from the lands where they had lived for centuries after the war, it settled in the vacated areas, just as forcibly, the so-called -legal population.- A significant number of them were -problem- residents of Tambov Oblast. In particular, about 2,000 farms were resettled from Tambov region to Crimea, in the Crimean Tatar settlement, another 2,000 to the Volga region, where Germans used to live, and 400 to Kaliningrad region. This deportation, which almost no one talks about, became the final punitive action for the population of the long-suffering region.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/08/vypalena-tambovshhyna-yak-sproba-pozbavytys-moskovskoyi-okupacziyi-pryzvela-do-troh-golodomoriv-ta-deportacziyi/	2025-02-07T20:42:22-08:00
- By subletting - in 2025: how much will military personnel be compensated for renting housing	According to the decision of the Minister of Defense, from January 1, 2025, the amount of compensation is: For servicemen who have three or more family members, the amount of compensation increases by one and a half times. This is, in fact, compensation for housing rent at the place of service. It is paid if the serviceman does not have his own housing in this territory. We note right away that the procedure for issuing compensation is not very simple and fast. And it may also require certain expenses, in particular for obtaining certificates. The basis for payment is a serviceman's report, as well as list of documents, determined by Cabinet Resolution No. 450. But if you go this way and arrange everything, you can get quite a good compensation. Currently, this applies to servicemen serving under a contract or under the draft of officers. Mobilized servicemen do not have this opportunity.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/08/pidnajom-u-2025-roczi-skilky-kompensuyut-vijskovym-za-orendu-zhytla/	2025-02-07T20:34:34-08:00
Modularity and adaptability: how the Swedish CV90 armored vehicle platform, known on the battlefield...	The topic of conversation about this tank, which is not too -hyped- in NATO countries, was the news that the defense department of Slovakia, as part of the modernization of its tank fleet, may choose a vehicle from BAE Systems when replacing the old Soviet T-72 tanks as an alternative to the more expensive American Abrams. At least this was recently reported by the Minister of Defense of Slovakia, Robert Kalinak, who was quoted by the Bratislava publication Denník N. This model is based on the CV90 platform, known for its modularity and adaptability, which allows the integration of various combat and technological systems, ArmiyaInform reports. As noted the experts of the Dutch defense technology research portal Army Recognition (AR), the aspect of budget savings may play not the last role in Slovakia's decision to purchase Swedish tanks. The CV90120-T has undergone several upgrades and the latest version is priced at €11.5 million per unit, roughly half the price of the Leopard 2A8. -While its competitive price and capabilities make it an attractive choice, the CV90120-T has yet to receive significant orders, but its affordability makes it an attractive choice for Slovakia's military modernization efforts,- AR said. Aside from the financial aspect, the CV90120-T offers additional benefits. Its integration into Slovakia's armored fleet could lead to increased industrial cooperation and standardization of the CV9035 infantry fighting vehicles already ordered by Bratislava. These potential synergies will not only improve operational efficiency, but also strengthen Slovakia's domestic defense industry by promoting increased local production. 120 mm gun CTG120/L50 (Compact Tank Gun — a compact tank gun) with a barrel length of 50 calibers was developed by the Swiss company RUAG specially for installation on light armored vehicles. To reduce recoil, the weapon is equipped with a muzzle brake. There is an ejector to blow the barrel after firing. The barrel of the weapon has a heat-insulating casing to increase the accuracy of shooting. The weapon is stabilized in two planes. The main reason for installing a 120-mm gun was the desire to combine the firepower of a tank with the mobility characteristics of a lighter vehicle. The combat weight of the CV90120-T is about 35 tons, while the vast majority of main battle tanks in the arsenal of NATO countries weigh almost twice as much. A 12-shot semi-automatic loader is mounted in the aft part of the tower. When using it, the rate of fire can reach 12-14 shots per minute. The rest of the ammunition (33 rounds) is mixed in the aft part of the hull and can be quickly loaded through the aft door. With this armament, the CV90120-T light tank has firepower similar to the Leopard 2 main battle tank, however, with a combat weight of 35 tons, the vehicle has better strategic and tactical mobility. Full ammunition is designed for 45 shots. The weapon's ammunition includes feathered armor-piercing subcaliber shells with a detachable tray (APFSDS). In addition, they may include high-explosive rounds developed by Bofors and Israel Military Industries for the Leopard-2 main battle tank. Due to the use of a digital fire control system, a high probability of hitting both moving and stationary targets with the first shot is achieved. The gunner is in control of UTAAS (Universal Tank Fire Control System, which provides for the possibility of firing at aerial targets) - a system that includes a stabilized day-night sight and a laser range finder. UTAAS is manufactured by SAAB. This system was also used in other platforms of the CV90 family. A Hagglunds company representative said that with UTAAS, the CV90 series vehicles -have higher fire accuracy than Leopard 2 tanks.- The commander's fire control system DNGS has about the same capabilities as the gunner, but his sight has the ability to change the magnification between 1.5x, 6x and 24x. In addition, there is another targeting system PLSS. It can be used by both the gunner and the commander. Moreover, the commander can search for targets and transfer them to the gunner for destruction. All crew members have monitors connected by a common data network, which increases the operational control of the CV90120-T in battle. The gunner has at his disposal a universal tank/anti-aircraft sight -Celsiustec- with day and night channels and a laser rangefinder, which is also produced for equipping other combat vehicles. The light tank CV90120-T has a layout with a forward engine compartment. This is because its chassis is a variant of the CV9040 infantry fighting vehicle chassis. This chassis was modified to fit aft of the triple turret. In addition, it has received increased booking in the front. CV90120-T frontal arc armor for the hull and turret provides protection against 30 mm armor-piercing shells and all-round protection against 12.7 mm ammunition. In addition to the main armor and the aerosol curtain deployment system, the CV90120-T was tested for the active protection system (active armor concept — AAC), which was developed for the Swedish army by the German company IBD Diesenroth Engineering together with the Swedish company Akers Krutbruk. Outside of Sweden, Diesenroth offers this system as part of its Advanced Modular Protection (AMAP-ADS or simply ADS). In Great Britain, it received the designation Hard-Kill DAS. Active protection of the tank protects against anti-tank guided projectiles. In addition, an improved on-board shield is installed to reduce the machine's signature in the infrared range. The machine has camouflage paint for operations in urban conditions. Active armor, as the developers say, is an -improved active protection system- that -detects, identifies and repels an attack at a short distance.- The system was successfully tested on the CV90 chassis. It covers the car from all sides and increases its mass by 400 kg. Using the AMAP-ADS active protection system and replacing more than 2 tons of passive armor, while maintaining the internal volume, allows you to reduce the weight of the car by 1.6 tons. The crew of the CV90120-T consists of 3 people - a commander, a gunner operator and a driver mechanic. The undercarriage of the CV90120-T (on each side) consists of seven twin support rollers, a forward drive wheel and a guide wheel mounted aft of the hull. The guide wheel has a hydraulic tensioning mechanism controlled from the driver's seat. The track consists of steel tracks with rubber running tracks. Tracks are connected with the help of a rubber-metal joint. Individual torsion roller suspension. Double-action hydraulic shock absorbers are installed on the suspension nodes of the first, second and seventh rollers. The motor-transmission compartment of the tank is located in the front part of the hull near the starboard side. It is equipped with a four-stroke V-8 Scania DI16 liquid-cooled diesel engine with a capacity of 670 hp. It drives the tank through a Perkins Engines Company/Allison X-300 automatic transmission, which has four forward and two reverse gears. CV90120-T light tank.

-We defeated everyone, but nothing happened-: how the Russian Federation -repelled- the attack of Uk...	Granted, there is no concrete evidence again, but when did that ever stop the fake factory? What was invented this time? According to Russian sources, a -massive attack by Ukrainian drones- was allegedly recorded over the Krasnodar Territory at night. The enemy seemed to be trying to strike at important targets, but the Russian air defense system did a brilliant job: all the drones were -shot down- or they -crashed against the rocks out of fear.- However, in the videos shared by the locals, instead of the wreckage of the Ukrainian drones, there is only a dark sky and cries of -bang, but we don't know what it is.- There is no confirmation from independent sources either. The facts speak for themselves: Everything is simple here: propaganda cannot show the real picture of what is happening, so it invents heroic victories. it is important for Russians to hear that they are -protected- and that -the enemy is powerless.- And if suddenly after a few days it becomes known about the destroyed ammunition depot or oil base, it will be possible to say: -This is not our base at all!- or -It was a planned explosion.- So the next time the Russians say they've -repelled a Ukrainian drone attack,- check the news in a day or two. Because it is quite likely that the -downed drones- somehow strangely got into their regular supply of ammunition.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/08/my-vsih-peremogly-ale-nichogo-ne-stalosya-yak-rf-vidbyla-ataku-ukrayinskyh-droniv-u-krasnodarskomu-krayi/	2025-02-07T20:05:17-08:00
Drones and arms supply — the President talked about the results of the Stavka meeting	He told this during his evening video address. -Today there were reports on specific types of weapons and equipment.

Another important issue during the meeting of the Stavka was drones. -Drones are the technological basis of modern warfare. Ukrainians should be leaders in this field. And so much already exists. Today there was a meeting with the commanders of the units of unmanned systems. They are among the best. And the experience of all our best will scale. These are the people who are writing a new doctrine of technological protection for Ukraine,- the President noted. According to him, relevant decisions in this direction have already been adopted. -And the importance of drones should become such that they make Russian assaults more and more impossible. The Ukrainian state will spare no resources for this, because it is the preservation of the lives of our people,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy added. As reported by ArmyInform, earlier the President shared photos of the production of Ukrainian unmanned systems.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/07/drony-ta-postachannya-zbroyi-prezydent-rozpoviv-pro-pidsumky-zasidannya-stavky/	2025-02-07T11:52:59-08:00

The Defense Forces said when the waves of shelling decrease and when they increase	Vadim Mysnyk, the spokesman of OTU -Siversk-, told about this on the air of the telethon -Edyny Novyni-. According to him, -waves- of shelling occur according to a clear algorithm - they increase for three to four days, then decrease several times for the same period of time. This, Vadym Mysnyk is convinced, indicates the effectiveness of Ukrainian strikes deep into Russian territory. Long-range drones hit warehouses with ammunition, logistics and equipment. -But the enemy also accumulates, regroups, and then tries again. They practically use the existing arsenal of weapons. But, for example, unguided aircraft missiles from helicopters or multiple rocket launcher systems — we record individual cases. That is, they are very limited in such combat equipment,- said the spokesman of OTU -Siversk-. As reported ArmyInform, in the Lyman direction the enemy continues to use tactics of assaults in small groups, as well as enemy artillery and aviation are actively working against the Defense Forces.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/07/obstrily-vidbuvayutsya-hvylyamy-v-sylah-oborony-rozpovily-koly-vony-zmenshuyutsya-a-koly-zrostayut/	2025-02-07T09:12:08-08:00

Civil aviation of the Russian Federation is on the verge of collapse: technical problems with planes...	Such data are provided in the GUR of the Ministry of Education and Culture. Only at the beginning of December, three Superjet 100 aircraft experienced technical malfunctions during flights. The beginning of 2025 was no less -productive-: in two weeks of January, there were five emergency landings due to equipment failures. On January 4, two planes encountered technical problems at the same time: Airbus-A321neo of Ural Airlines flying from Sharm el-Sheikh to Yekaterinburg had to return to the airport of departure. And the Boeing-737 of the NordStar airline interrupted the flight on the flight Volgograd — Yekaterinburg. On January 7, a Boeing-737 of the UTair airline company, which was traveling from St. Petersburg to Samarkand, was forced to land at the Vnukovo airport due to a technical malfunction. On January 11, 2025, this airport gave the go-ahead for an emergency landing of a plane heading from Moscow to Dubai. The reason for the return was -change in hydraulic fluid level-. There were 240 passengers on board. For all of them, this flight could be the last. On January 17, the Superjet-100 of the Red Wings airline, which was on its way from the Ministry of Water to Yerevan, made an emergency landing at the airport of departure. There were 90 people on board. The reason for the emergency return was a malfunction of the air conditioning system. On November 23, 2023, military intelligence gained access to the internal documents of the Russian Federal Air Transport Agency, known as Rosaviatsia. Even then, intelligence officers established that due to the influence of sanctions, Russian civil aviation was confidently approaching collapse. According to the GUR of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, among the data obtained as a result of the hack was a complete list of daily reports of -Rosaviation- regarding non-statutory situations with Russian aircraft for more than a year and a half. -Moscow, exposing its population to mortal danger, is trying by all means to hide an endless pile of problems with civil aviation,- the intelligence said. Before the start of the large-scale invasion of Ukraine, the Russian aircraft fleet numbered 1,031 aircraft. Aircraft produced by Boeing and Airbus accounted for about 67% of Russian aviation. US and EU sanctions banned the maintenance of these aircraft, as well as the supply of new liners.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/07/czyvilna-aviacziya-rf-na-mezhi-krahu-tehnichni-problemy-z-litakamy-pryzvodyat-do-ekstrenyh-posadok/	2025-02-07T07:01:09-08:00

The Ministry of Defense said who should be responsible for mobilization	first deputy defense minister of Ukraine Lieutenant General Ivan Gavriluk told about this in an interview for Ukrinform. -The issue of mobilization is based on the realities in which Ukrainian society as a whole lives. Our information space is focused on the negative, narratives about -Busification- and bad -TCKashniks- are imposed on society. We see more negatives than positives about the need to protect the country and the state,- he said. As he noted, a significant number of Ukrainians are sure that the territorial recruitment and social support centers are solely responsible for mobilization, but this is not the case. -The Law of Ukraine -On Mobilization Training and Mobilization- clearly defines all participants in the process, their tasks and area of ​​responsibility. Most of the tasks of mobilization measures are assigned to the authorities and the police,- Ivan Gavryliuk emphasized. According to him, if conscripted citizens of Ukraine during the legal regime of martial law do not appear at the TCC, then local authorities and the police must ensure their delivery. -It is also important to carry out appropriate information work in communities to convey to people the importance of protecting the country. You understand that without mobilization we will lose the country. -No matter how many robotic complexes, weapons, weapons and military equipment we have, all this is controlled by a person,- he summarized. As reported by ArmyInform, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine plans to reform territorial centers of recruitment and social support, in particular, to divide the functions and tasks assigned to them rely on	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/07/u-minoborony-rozpovily-hto-maye-vidpovidaty-za-mobilizacziyu/	2025-02-07T04:58:16-08:00
Reforming TCC and JV: the MOU explained how their functions will be divided	first deputy defense minister of Ukraine Lieutenant General Ivan Gavriluk told about this in an interview for Ukrinform. -For example, the first component – ​​social issues – should be separated. The second component is TCC itself. They will continue to keep track of reservists and all conscripts, call them to retraining courses, send them to the relevant meetings,- he said. According to him, the third component is the issue of preparing the population for service in the Armed Forces or units of the Security and Defense Forces. This feature is also planned to be spun off. As reported by ArmyInform, conscripts will be able to receive electronic direction for passing VLK through the Rezerv+ application without the need to visit territorial recruiting centers. The Ministry of Defense plans to have the corresponding mechanism up and running by the end of February 2025. In order to undergo an examination to determine fitness for military service, it will no longer be necessary to go to the TCC and SP for a paper referral.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/07/reformuvannya-tczk-ta-sp-u-mou-poyasnyly-yak-rozdilyat-yihni-funkcziyi/	2025-02-07T04:34:11-08:00

Maksym Bilousov, head of the communications department of the 60th separate mechanized brigade, told about this on the air of -Suspilne Novosti-. According to him, infantry attacks continue around the clock. The enemy in the conveyor mode launches groups of 2-3 people, the purpose of which is to get closer to the positions of the Defense Forces. Stormtroopers are of two types - well trained and poorly trained. -Poorly educated people are usually ex-convicts or from disadvantaged families. And they -open up- our firing positions, after which well-trained personnel join in, seeing where the attack began to repel. The attack on our positions begins. Live fishing. That's how they catch our guys on their baits,- said the head of the communications department of the 60th separate mechanized brigade. As he noted, there have been fewer mechanized assaults because they constantly fail. Recently there was an example of one of these rare attacks. -A single tank that left to strike our positions. It was neutralized with the help of FPV drones. It cannot be called a mechanized assault. Semi-mechanized assault. Who choked,- said Maksym Bilousov.

Already 100 units are reporting through Army+ about enemy damage — how it works	As reported by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, confirmation of damage or destruction of targets takes place in the DELTA combat system. At the same time, it is noted that the first 100 units began to report in this way. Commanders or their subordinates submit the damage report for the past day to Army+ once a day, after which the data is checked by analysts of the Situation Center of the Ministry of Defense. -The digitized analytical report will be available to the military high command. Paper reporting still remains. However, on the basis of the digital report on the damage, it is planned to implement in Army+ the submission of a report for receiving a reward for destroyed equipment quickly and conveniently,- the message reads. Units record destroyed or damaged objects on their own secure layers in the DELTA system, which has been put into operation in the Defense Forces and has successfully passed the information security check according to NATO standards. With DELTA, damage objects are added to Army+ automatically. -Information about the type of equipment and other parameters are pulled automatically using a QR code generated in DELTA. You can add a single object or a group at once. This speeds up the process and makes it more convenient. At the same time, Army+ does not store data about objects, and the generated report is deleted after signing and sent in encrypted form to the Situation Center of the Ministry of Defense,- the Ministry of Defense explains. They also added that the units that were not included in the list of the first to report to Armiya+, but wish to join, can contact the support service in the DELTA system or Army+. -This is a big step in creating relevant and transparent analytics of military operations. The launch of digital damage reports allows units of the Armed Forces and the National Guard to transmit objective information about enemy losses without delay. Thanks to the interaction of Armiya+ and DELTA, we ensure accurate accounting and reliability of information. The transparency of data will allow decisions to be made based on facts, not assumptions,- emphasized Kateryna Chernogorenko, deputy minister for digitalization. As reported by ArmyInform, The ground forces have become the best in implementing electronic reports in the Army+ application.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/07/vzhe-100-pidrozdiliv-zvituyut-cherez-armiya-pro-urazhennya-voroga-yak-cze-praczyuye/	2025-02-07T03:34:20-08:00

The corresponding entry was published on Friday, February 7, by the 63rd Separate Mechanized Brigade. Judging by its content, another meat assault of the occupiers failed, which led to panic among the personnel. In turn, the Russian commanders, realizing that the offensive was stalled, and their subordinates had also lost their equipment, began to get mad, threatening them with punishment if they -mowed down- even more. -The occupiers can retreat when it gets hot (run out or something?), but when they -move down-, they will stay in position for a while for 20 days. The spectacular work of our artillery and our drones adds to the local flavor,- the 63rd OMbr noted, commenting on the radio interception released to the public. As reported by ArmiyaInform, Russians complain about the commanders of the USSR, who ignore all their attempts to find out the fate of their missing relatives missing in the war against Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/07/okupanty-panikuyut-yihni-komandyry-skazheniyut-radioperehoplennya-na-lymanskomu-napryamku/	2025-02-07T03:13:37-08:00
Ukraine surpasses Russia in the production of FPV drones — Ivan Gavrylyuk	first deputy defense minister of Ukraine Lieutenant General Ivan Gavriluk told about this in an interview for Ukrinform. -If we talk about the production of FPV drones, Ukraine is currently ahead of the Russian Federation. The field of drones in Ukraine is developing at a breakneck pace. Both development and production,- he said. Since February 24, 2022, more than 1,300 new samples of weapons and military equipment produced by Ukrainian enterprises have been codified for the needs of the Defense Forces. Among them, the largest group is BpAK and ammunition for them. Only last year, more than 250 new models of UAVs of various types and purposes were approved for use in units of the Defense Forces. -But one must understand that the determining factor is not only the number of developed and manufactured drones. The most important thing is the efficiency of their application and the speed with which developers can react to changes,- noted Ivan Gavrilyuk. According to him, you can have hundreds of thousands of drones, but they will be powerless against enemy countermeasures. -In a cluster of drones - a month or three, and the effectiveness of one or another sample decreases. It is necessary to look for new ways to maintain efficiency. The technological -duel- between manufacturers of drones and EW tools clearly illustrates this. And here the advantage is on the side of the one whose engineers will sooner offer a technological solution to which the adversary will not have a ready answer,- he explained. The First Deputy Minister of Defense added that Ukraine currently needs help from partners, especially in supplying those types of weapons that it does not produce itself or produces in insufficient quantities. For example, air defense systems, heavy armored vehicles, NATO caliber ammunition, etc. -But at the same time, our domestic manufacturers of anti-aircraft guns are also increasing production volumes, mastering the production of new types of weapons and equipment. The government order is increasingly oriented towards the domestic manufacturer,- he noted. For example, last year almost 2/3 of the contracts for the purchase of anti-aircraft guns for the Armed Forces were signed with Ukrainian gunsmiths. -We managed to reduce dependence on imports, in particular special armored vehicles, and Ukraine is approaching self-sufficiency in the production of drones. I really want to note the production of long-range drones. Long-range strike drones today are a substitute for long-range missiles,- he summarized. As ArmiyaInform reported, the Ministry of Defense codified and allowed for operation in the Armed Forces of Ukraine a new modification of the domestically produced mobile washing-bath complex.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/07/ukrayina-perevazhaye-rosiyu-u-vygotovlenni-fpv-droniv-ivan-gavrylyuk/	2025-02-07T03:09:41-08:00

He was looking for places to install explosives near the units of the Defense Forces: a resident of ...	This is reported by the SBU on February 7. -He received the corresponding task remotely from his curator from the Russian Federation at the beginning of this year. Among the priority targets of the enemy were spare command posts and places of permanent deployment of units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the National Guard of Ukraine,- the report says. In order to find a place for the hidden installation of explosives, the man went around the area and fixed geolocations with the highest concentration of Ukrainian military. As stated in the SBU, in the case of detection of such objects, the suspect studied its perimeter for the presence of -convenient- places for planting an improvised explosive device (IED). -Subsequently, the agent gave the appropriate coordinates to the curator from the Russian Federation for -approval- in order to then receive instructions on how to make a SVP with a remote activation mechanism via phone,- the SBU reported. The Security Service of Ukraine acted in advance and detained the agent when he was conducting reconnaissance near a military facility where the occupiers were planning a terrorist attack.

Major Viktor Tregubov, the spokesman of the Khortytsia operational-strategic group of troops, told about this on the broadcast of the Yedyni Novyni telethon. He assumed it was such a show of force. According to him, attempts to create a bridgehead have been going on for months. A group of two to eight people crosses Oskil on a rubber boat. The invaders hide in the local forests, and when a certain number of them accumulates, they try to storm. Often — in the direction of a nearby settlement. -What are the actions from the Ukrainian side? First, destroy their watercraft with FPV drones. Secondly, when they are unloaded, throw -discounts- at them. But if they have already accumulated in some proportion there, some small branch there, then they should be kicked out of there,- said the spokesman of the Khortytsia operational-strategic group of troops. As ArmyInform reported, more Russians died near Pokrovsk in one month than during the Second Chechen War.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/07/forsuvannya-dlya-forsu-rosiyany-postijno-stvoryuyut-placzdarmy-na-berezi-oskolu-ale-zhyvut-vony-nedovgo/	2025-02-07T01:03:17-08:00
-Higher competition — lower cost-: DOT is improving the procurement of fuel for the military	This is reported by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine on February 7. The next step in the development of the regional model was its deepening by increasing the number of lots. This decision is aimed at attracting more participants and improving the efficiency of fuel procurement for the military. -The state directs significant funds to supply the Armed Forces with fuel and lubricants. In particular, for 2024, the DOT purchased PMM for UAH 28.2 billion. The deepening of the regional model makes it possible to ensure the uninterrupted supply of fuel to the troops,- said Hleb Kanevskyi, director of the procurement policy department of the Ministry of Defense. In the MOU, it was noted that last year DOT introduced a fuel procurement model based on a regional principle, expecting greater interest from market participants, taking into account the specifics of logistics chains depending on the region. This model provided for the division of supply into four regions: Eastern, Southern, Central and Western. Each region is divided into the following areas: -The number of bidders and the level of savings at auctions (reductions) confirmed the effectiveness of this procurement model. That is why, in order to increase competition and optimize the logistics processes of potential suppliers, the State operator of the rear is deepening the regional model,- the MOU said. Previously, the region covered 4 to 6 supply points. From now on, the number of lots will be doubled: instead of four large regional lots, there will be eight smaller ones with fewer supply points (from 1 to 2). Director of the fuel and lubricants program of the DOT, Maryna Yeremeyeva, noted that the fuel market in Ukraine is marked by significant security risks due to the constant threat from the Russian Federation. Therefore, suppliers do not store large volumes on the territory of Ukraine. -The deepening of the regional model makes it possible to reduce security risks for business, reducing the amount of fuel required to participate in the auction. This opens up opportunities for new market players and increases the level of competition, which, in turn, has a positive effect on the cost of defense products,- she explained. As a result of auctions for the purchase of Arctic diesel, on lots where there was only one bidder, the savings from the expected cost was on average 2.7%, while on lots where there were more than 2 bidders, the savings were on average 7.5%. In monetary terms, this made it possible to save 15.8 million hryvnias. The total savings on Arctic diesel auctions is more than UAH 82 million. -Arctic diesel fuel differs from winter diesel fuel in its higher resistance to low temperatures and is less present on the country's market,- said the MOU. At the same time, from April, DOT will start providing summer fuel, which, according to the Ministry of Defense, should increase the presence of other market participants in the auctions. It is noted that the introduction of an in-depth regional fuel procurement model will contribute to fair competition, better prices for the state and new business opportunities. For the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine and the DOT, it is fundamental to ensure the uninterrupted supply of fuel to the Armed Forces of Ukraine. As reported by ArmyInform, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine in 2024 implemented a large-scale plan to provide servicemen with the necessary footwear by purchasing and supplying various models of footwear for a total amount of over UAH 3.1 billion.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/07/vyshhe-konkurencziya-nyzhche-vartist-dot-udoskonalyuye-zakupivli-palnogo-dlya-vijskovyh/	2025-02-07T00:55:42-08:00

According to him, it is only at first glance that the activity of the Russians has decreased. The occupiers simply concentrated on several directions. They consolidated their forces, creating several assault -fists-. -If you start just counting by heads, it's the same, if not more. If you look at the losses, for example, per month, there is generally an industrial scale. Therefore, to say that the intensity has decreased a little is like the temperature has dropped from 500 to 450 degrees.

A large mobilization in the Russian Federation, an unsuccessful North Korean debut and minus 46,000 ...	How does this relate to a possible peace negotiation process? But how does the current weather affect the enemy's ability to conduct assaults? This was told by military expert Petro Chernyk. -Interesting events are taking place now in the Pokrovsky direction in the part related to enemy losses. If at the beginning of January they were losing 300-360 people per day, now these numbers have decreased. A natural and profound question arises: why so? A few serious points. The first is the really big geopolitics. The enemy is regrouping forces. An active phase has begun - behind the scenes so far - negotiations on how to exit this phase of the war. We have no doubt that the Russians will become active when they understand that they need more serious arguments in the negotiation process. A big negotiation process has been declared: literally from today until the middle of April, when Trump should finally meet with Putin, with President Zelensky in Saudi Arabia. So at least it is declared. The second is purely technical. It's really cold, really damp, even though the Russians never expected it. But from a review of the first position: they still have to be counted, because you need to save strength. And there is one more cut. We have shown fantastic results in the extermination of their personnel in December of last year and in January of this year. This is more than 46-48 thousand per month. This is very serious. And the Russians enlist no more than 42-44 thousand. That is, they really haven't announced a big mobilization yet. I think that it will not be announced until Putin understands in the negotiation process what, how and to what end. Let's not forget the shameful defeat of the North Korean troops in Kurshchyna: more than 4,000 casualties. That's an incredible amount. And the enemy is forced to take all these moments into account. Plus, despite the fact that this infantry is not spared, the weather does not allow the use of heavy armored vehicles, because it gets stuck in the ground. This explains the decrease in enemy losses as such.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/07/velyka-mobilizacziya-v-rf-nevdalyj-pivnichnokorejskyj-debyut-ta-minus-46-000-rosiyan-ekspert-pro-boyi-na-pokrovskomu-napryamku/	2025-02-06T21:41:55-08:00

Why -Mercedes- is better than -Zhiguli-, or How German -Leopards- crush the invaders near Pokrovsk	German -Leopards- are hidden in one of the numerous forest plantations of the Donetsk region. Locations are carefully camouflaged between trees, cars in hoods. Nearby we see the tank crew: the commander, the mechanic-driver, the gunner and the loader. The boys only performed combat missions at night. Currently under recovery. Let's meet: the commander of tank platoon 155 of the separate mechanized brigade of the -Anna Kyivska- ZSU, Dmytro, with the call sign -Green-. From Lviv. In the army since last August. He studied at the National University -Lviv Polytechnic-, majoring in -Automotive Transport-. -At one time, he graduated from the military department of the Lviv Polytechnic and became a reserve officer. When I enlisted, the formation of the 155th -Anna of Kyiv- brigade was just in progress. Therefore, I was immediately appointed to the position of tank platoon commander,- Dmytro says. Special training began at one of the training grounds in Ukraine, then the units of the brigade were sent for 1.5-month training abroad. Crews were formed there, Leopards were mastered and trained there. If the German Leopard tanks are compared with the Soviet T-64, T-72 and the British Challenger and the American Abrams, they are medium in size. Because the Challenger and Abrams are large and massive tanks that are much wider, taller and, accordingly, heavier. The T-64, T-72 are made with a lower landing, but the Leopards are slightly larger than these tanks. But in general, these combat vehicles are distinguished by their high mobility, speed, maneuverability and, most importantly, the accuracy of destroying targets. These advantages are especially felt over Soviet tanks. It's like comparing a German Mercedes with a Soviet Zhiguli. The tank has a fairly powerful diesel engine, so it is easier to maintain and repair, unlike, say, the Abrams. -Leopard- can accelerate up to 80 kilometers per hour, but only on the road. The guys squeezed more out of him. Off-road, of course, the speed will be lower. It can make a full turn on the spot in 10 seconds. Can go up to 30 km/h in reverse when coasting. This is very important when working with direct aim at the enemy, when you need to quickly strike and roll away. For example, in the same T-72, the reverse speed does not exceed 5 km/h. The machine is easy to maintain, the engine runs very quietly. This helps with combat deployments. A hundred meters away, no one will understand that this tank is moving. The roar of the engine, for example, T-64, is not to be confused with anything. In the winter, you can turn on the stove, and in the summer, the air conditioner, in short, everything is made for the crew in the tank, with comfort. Another advantage of this tank is its accuracy of hitting targets, unlike Soviet vehicles. Tanks have powerful weapons - a 120 mm gun manufactured by Rheinmetall, like the Abrams tank. Her ammunition is 27 shells. The effective firing range is up to 4 kilometers. The tanks are equipped with an electronic fire control system. This allows the crew to adjust shots, set ballistic corrections, projectile corrections, select the desired projectile, distance to the target, weather conditions, and the like. This is why the Leopards have such a high hit rate against moving targets. To aim, you simply place the marker on the target. The system also has a thermal sensor that helps detect hidden targets. A thermal imager is installed for shooting at night. In general, -Leopards-, for example, from a distance of 2 km, can easily deliver targeted strikes on enemy infantry, structures, fortifications, shelters, and military equipment. Shooting is conducted both by direct fire and from closed firing positions. Even a helicopter can be shot down from the tank's armament. If the rotorcraft flies at a certain speed and, relatively speaking, hovers, the fire control system selects a target and focuses. The computer calculates the possible distance that the projectile must travel to hit the point where the helicopter is expected to reach after a certain period of time. There is no such possibility in Soviet tanks. The Rashist helicopters have not yet been shot down near Pokrovsk, as the enemy does not use them. But we are always ready. Tankers call this leopard's technical ability dynamic advance. This system allows you to shoot tanks or any other moving armored vehicles with perfect accuracy, no matter at what speed. It all depends on the gunner, if he does everything right, then from the first shot he immediately hits the enemy equipment. Somehow, the command gave us the coordinates of the Russian targets. A column of enemy equipment was moving, the speed was approximately 40-50 km/h. The crew from the -sink- left for the area of ​​combat missions. So, with the first shot, we stopped the BMP. They took the target -point-blank-, a shot, the equipment is on fire. What is interesting, the cannon can aim at individual parts of the target. For example, to stop the movement of an enemy car, you can hit the undercarriage, and to -blow up- the tower - aim at it, hit and all. The accuracy of the gun is simply amazing. In addition to the thermal imager, the gunner uses a laser rangefinder to calculate the range to enemy targets. All this is done automatically and much faster than, again, in Soviet tanks. With its help, you can accurately aim and hit the target at a distance of 3-4 km. A very cool thing is the technical possibility for the tank commander to switch from his own sight to the gunner's sight, that is, to use his fire. There are different situations in battle. If I see a higher priority target or a target that threatens the life of the crew, then I can calmly take control and fire a shot myself. Likewise, I can easily hand control over to the gunner. The charging mode in this tank is manual. That is, how it happens: the gunner measured the target, the loader loaded the projectile and pressed the button - which projectile will be used. Then the on-board computer of the tank works, the -technical moments- of the shot are calculated and -voila- - you shoot and hit. The shells are separated from the crew by an armored partition and are located behind the tank, while in the Soviet ones, on the contrary, they are located in special compartments in the hull and turret of the tank. This increases the chances of survival of the -Leopard- crew in the event of a projectile hitting the tower, unlike the T-72. Tanks have good armor that provides a high level of protection for the crew. For example, a turret armor plate 650 mm thick. In addition, dynamic protection is installed, which covers the frontal part of the machine and the tower, as well as most of the side of the hull. The junction of the tower and the hull is additionally covered. Withstands hits from cluster bombs, grenade launchers and drone drops. The tank is equipped with anti-drone protection and a EW device. In a combat situation, the -barbecue- installed above the car saved the crew from FPV drones. The cumulative burst when it collided with the welded structure, but the tank continued to move. In general, the survivability of the crew in the tank is about 99.9%. Without exaggeration, it feels like you are sitting in an -armored capsule-. Can it withstand the impact of anti-tank guided missiles? I do not know and I hope that I will not find out! Here in the Pokrovsky direction, we work against the enemy mostly with -direct fire-. Just the other day, we received the coordinates of the location of the occupiers from the command. It was a forest plantation, more than 500 meters wide, which had to be cleared urgently. The Rashists had shelters there, preparing for an assault on the positions of our infantry. We quickly left, the target was more than 1 km away, set up and opened fire. They worked very intensively, to put it bluntly, they practically destroyed this forest plantation together with the Russians. There was no living space left there. Almost 70 percent of the perimeter of the hundred was destroyed. They could have done more, but it was necessary to quickly roll back, as enemy FPV drones were flying into the area. We don't get too close to the contact line, but it's not necessary. The combat capabilities of the tank allow you to effectively destroy the enemy at a distance of up to 2 km. We regularly destroy small assault groups, some enemy shelters. We do everything so that the enemy does not advance, grind him in places of concentration. This is our daily combat work, technically we fight much less often.- A few words about the combat situation on the front line important for the Ukrainian Armed Forces. As Yuriy, the head of the communications department of the 155th separate mechanized brigade of the -Anna Kyivska- Armed Forces of Ukraine, told ArmiyaInform, the Pokrovsky direction accounts for almost half of all combats on the front. -The Russians are now not going to the city in the front, but are attacking on the flanks. They are trying to cut the main highways that lead to Pokrovsk from Kostyantynivka and Pavlograd. Recently, particularly heavy fighting has been going on in the direction of the administrative borders with the Dnipropetrovsk region. Katsaps advance in infantry groups supported by drones, tactical aircraft, tanks and artillery fire. Units of the 155th -Anna Kyivska- brigade are fighting hard battles with the enemy in their area of ​​responsibility, -unwinding- the enemy, inflicting huge losses in manpower and equipment. Combat work does not stop either day or night,- the officer said.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/07/chomu-mersedes-krashhyj-za-zhyguli-abo-yak-nimeczki-leopardy-troshhat-okupantiv-pid-pokrovskom/	2025-02-06T21:07:02-08:00
Protect your own and attack a stranger: CROWS combat modules have been relevant for more than a deca...	For the first time, according to the authors of the military-historical portal ABN Newswire, the creation of a prototype of a remote-controlled weapons system that would protect the gunners of combat vehicles while moving in a convoy or directly on the battlefield was thought about in the USA back in 1988, ArmyInform notes. Then they began to design a remote control system for small arms fire (JSSAMP) for the Pentagon. The project received acceptable solutions in 1996, when it was possible to achieve the introduction of motorization and stabilization of weapon aiming, after which it was possible to -hide- the gunner directly in the hull of the armored vehicle. And finally, these works were completed before the start of the campaign of the US and coalition forces -Operation Iraqi Freedom- in 2004. In general, CROWS (English - Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station) is the general name for combat modules with remote fire control. As the authors of the defense portal BuildingTECH remind, CROWS is an integrated system consisting of a stabilized weapon mount, a set of advanced sensors, control modules and software for accurate shooting. Stabilization allows you to fire even while the vehicle is moving, which is especially important in dynamic combat conditions. The sensor kit includes a daytime video camera, a thermal imager for night operations and a laser range finder. At the same time, these devices provide the operator with the ability to detect, identify and accurately engage targets at any time, regardless of weather or lighting conditions. The CROWS system was developed to install medium and small-caliber weapons and additional equipment on it. Intended for installation of any existing platforms. The line of sight in use (DLOS) allows the operator to maintain his sight on the selected target regardless of the ballistic characteristics of the weapon in use or its ammunition. The system is fully stabilized, which ensures the possibility of interaction of various weapons and accuracy of targeting. The versatility of the CROWS system is achieved due to its compatibility with a wide range of weapons. She can operate machine guns such as the M2 .50 Cal, M240B, MK19 and M134 Minigun, as well as light machine guns including the M249 SAW. To combat an armored target, integration with the Javelin missile system is provided. Additionally, the CROWS supports grenade launchers such as the M320 and M307, making it an effective tool for close combat and anti-vehicle combat. The CROWS system has an intuitive control interface, which facilitates its operation even for operators with minimal experience. The crew can easily aim weapons on the target, fire accurately and quickly change weapons depending on the mission. This makes the module an essential component of the modern war machine, providing a strategic advantage on the battlefield. One of the legislators of a kind of military fashion for remote modules is the Norwegian company Kongsberg Defense &amp; Aerospace. For more than two decades, KONGSBERG has been the world's leading supplier of remote-controlled combat modules. Their experience is millions of hours of operational use in various conditions on the basis of more than 20,000 delivered systems for almost three dozen countries. In particular, its PROTECTOR module is constantly being improved to meet higher requirements, using technological advances to meet today's threats. With its ability to increase crew situational awareness, minimize risk and reduce reaction time, CROWS is becoming an indispensable tool for armies. The remotely controlled combat module is used not only for defensive tasks, but also for active support of ground operations, patrolling and base protection. In conditions where soldiers' lives depend on precision, speed and safety, technologies such as CROWS are becoming critical elements of military strategy.

Propaganda again -defeated- mercenaries in an empty hotel	Now for some reality. The hotel in question has been empty for years. It had not been used for a long time, everything was falling apart inside, and the windows had been broken during previous shelling of the city. And this abandoned house suddenly became a -military base-! Truly an invisible army that only the best minds of the Kremlin could calculate. If Russian propagandists are to be believed, every building in Ukraine is a headquarters, every apartment is an ammunition depot, and every resident is either a -Nazi- or a -mercenary.- Well, if the evidence does not match, it can simply not be provided. Well, another -grand victory- in the treasury of fakes. the Russians are again at war with their own imaginations, bombing ruins and capturing cities that cannot even be found on the map.

The film tells about the evacuation of wounded comrades, fire suppression of the enemy and support of assault groups. Viewers will be able to see how the devastating circumstances make adjustments to the planning of operations, but are unable to stop the Marines' will to victory. -Yariy- is a testimony to the indomitable spirit, courage and heroism of Ukrainian soldiers who risk their lives every day for the sake of the freedom and independence of Ukraine. As reported by ArmyInform, aerial reconnaissance of the 36th Marine Infantry Brigade named after Rear Admiral Mykhailo Bilinsky's drops and FPV drones hit the Russians who tried to attack.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/yaryj-morpihy-prezentuvaly-dokumentalnyj-film-pro-zapekli-boyi-na-kurskomu-napryamku/	2025-02-06T11:59:00-08:00
Up to 10 years behind bars: a collaborator who worked in the occupation administration will be tried...	The Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office informs about this. According to the investigation, at the beginning of August 2022, a resident of the village of Rublene assumed the position of -v. at. assistant head of the administration (rural) of the Veliko Burlutsky Territorial Administration- in the pseudo-administration created by the occupiers. While in a -managerial- position, the collaborator followed the instructions of the top leadership of the occupation administration, participated in meetings and collected passport data of local residents, and also held receptions for citizens. Currently, the accused is hiding from Ukrainian law enforcement officers and is wanted. She will be tried in absentia in the Chuguyiv city court of the Kharkiv region. For the crime, the woman faces up to ten years in prison with deprivation of the right to hold certain positions or engage in certain activities for a period of up to fifteen years and confiscation of property. The pre-trial investigation was carried out by department No. 2 of the SV Kupyan RVP of the GUNP in the Kharkiv region under the operational support of the National Police, the Office of the SBU in the Kharkiv region and the main operational and investigative department of the 4th border detachment (Kharkiv) of the State Security Service.

About the fighter told on February 6 Air Command -Center- of the Air Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Denis joined the Air Force in December 2022, inspired by the feat of our defenders. Before his service, he had a civilian job, 2 higher educations in -Political Science- and -Jurisprudence-. All this only strengthened his ability to master both the old Soviet S-300 system and the modern NASAMS anti-aircraft missile complex. Even with the S-300, Denys knows that there is nothing better than seeing the control sign -Miss is normal- on the indicator (the height and speed of the target are falling) and realizing that another enemy threat has been neutralized. The combat work of his team on the S-300 is about 20 destroyed enemy targets, including cruise missiles and drones. Sometimes one shot was enough to shoot down two missiles at the same time - this is the result of the coordination and skill of the combat service. Denis calls to join the Air Force and become a guardian of our sky.

-Doctors recognized the 200th-: Junior Sergeant -Bandera- returned to the front after being mortally...	The story of one of these soldiers was shared on Thursday, February 6, by the Ground Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Meet junior sergeant -Bandera- - senior gunner of the 63rd separate mechanized brigade. -At war from the first days. In the summer of 2022, while defending the village of Blagodatne in the Mykolaiv region, he was fatally wounded in the head by an enemy sniper. The doctors recognized him as -two hundred-, but in a few minutes he regained consciousness and managed to get to the evacuation point with the help of his comrades,- the military said. At the same time, despite such a complex injury, after the recovery of -Bander- he again joined the ranks of the Armed Forces. However, this is far from the only adventure that he remembered during his service. The Ukrainian defender recalls how he and his comrades captured the Russian BMP-2, which the occupiers left in the middle of a reservoir near Torsky in Donetsk region. The armored vehicle was completely under water, but after an enemy shell hit the dam, the water level fell and there was an opportunity to seize it. -As far as I know, they were leaving somewhere in 2022&#8230; They completely left -beha- with BC. Fully charged. We had about six exits. Our role was to swim up and see what condition she was in,- Bandera shared his memories of that operation. But see how it went in the plot. As reported by ArmyInform, Ukrainian sniper under the nickname -Laughter- proved that there is no safe distance for the enemy.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/likari-vyznaly-200-m-molodshyj-serzhant-bandera-povernuvsya-na-front-pislya-smertelnogo-poranennya/	2025-02-06T10:56:49-08:00

Major Anton Zakharchuk, deputy commander of the air mobile battalion of the 95th Separate Airborne Assault Brigade, gave this assessment of the situation in this area on Army TV. -The situation in the brigade lane is difficult, but under control. The enemy is not currently conducting mass and active assaults, but local assaults by small tactical groups are present,- the Ukrainian officer said. Commenting on the information about the withdrawal of the North Korean troops in this direction, he explained that the absence of large-scale assault actions just shows that -some forces and means of the enemy have been withdrawn.- -Now this allows us to better organize our defense system, especially in terms of engineering, conduct retraining and further prepare for future assault operations,- said a representative of the 95th ODSHBr. He also noted that conducting hostilities on -their own land- does not affect the motivation of Russian troops in general, so there is little difference from their approaches on Ukrainian territory. -They act as, for example, in Donbas. The same is true in the Kursk region,- Anton Zakharchuk stated. As ArmyInform reported, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky honored Ukrainian soldiers participating in the operation in the Kursk region with state awards.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/aktyvnosti-rf-zagalom-znyzylas-bijczi-zsu-pidtverdzhuyut-znyknennya-soldativ-kndr-na-kurshhyni/	2025-02-06T10:48:35-08:00
The evaders got stuck in the mud, trying to escape to Moldova	On Thursday, February 6, reported in the DPSU press service. -In order to implement the idea, the men turned to the Telegram channel administrator for help, who for a fee provided advice on crossing the border without hindrance. Without any guarantees of successful remittance, the violators transferred a total of $10,000 to the -advisor's- crypto wallet, the report says. However, their journey turned out to be far from as cloudless as they had hoped. During an attempt to illegally cross the border, the car with dodgers got stuck in the mud, so they -reclassified from passengers to pedestrians.- Meanwhile, the driver himself, having freed himself from his fellow passengers, sped towards the border, but he was also detained in the end. -For an attempt to illegally cross the state border, administrative offenses were filed against five men Article 204-1 of the Code of Administrative Offenses (illegal crossing or attempted illegal crossing of the state border of Ukraine), the case has been sent to court,- the border guards added.

The cultural code of Slobozhanshchyna: how the native land shapes the worldview of fighters -Azov-	This is discussed in posts on the brigade page. The heroine of the second episode was the medical supply officer and head of the escort service of the 12th Azov brigade - -Rina-. She talks about her hometown - Kharkiv, about Slobozhanshchyna and its significant cultural contribution to the formation of the Ukrainian nation. -Rina- was born in Kharkiv, a city that has always been a center of education, culture and intellectual development. It was here in the 19th century that one of the first universities in Ukraine appeared, which became a center of scientific and cultural thought. Kharkiv gave the world unique artistic phenomena. The Kharkiv school of photography, which gained international recognition in the 20th century, deserves special attention. The traditions of this school continue to inspire modern Ukrainian photographers. Theater art also found its way in Kharkiv. The legendary theater -Berezil- under the leadership of Les Kurbas opened new horizons for the Ukrainian stage. Modern Kharkiv directors, in particular Andrii Zholdak, continue to develop this trend at the European level. A separate layer of Kharkiv's cultural life is music. Ukrainian black metal was born in the Northern Saltivka region, and underground clubs became the center of the musical movement. One of the most famous was the Zhivot club, where young people listened to alternative music and experienced their first concert emotions. Today, rock and metal are giving way to the electronic scene. The local cultural platform -Kulturizvuk- has become a hub for fans of modern electronic music and vinyl. While studying in Kyiv, Rina discovered the rich world of ethnic and neofolk music. Ukrainian bands of the late 20th century, in particular -Sugar, White Death-, became part of her cultural self-identification. This process of deeper immersion in one's own roots is a reflection of the common path of Ukrainians — learning about one's history, reviving traditions and realizing the national cultural code. The Genesis project does not just tell stories - it demonstrates how culture becomes a weapon and a source of strength for those who defend Ukraine. After all, we are born, live and die with the cultural code of our native land. As reported by ArmyInform, to the Day of the National Assembly of Ukraine, the 12th special purpose brigade -Azov- in cooperation with the public organization AZOV.ONE and a musical band -DahaBrakha- presented a unique cultural project called -Genesis-.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/kulturnyj-kod-slobozhanshhyny-yak-ridna-zemlya-formuye-svitoglyad-bijcziv-azovu/	2025-02-06T10:31:32-08:00
Once in the Luhansk region, our pilots bombed another enemy city	The video of the defeat was released on February 6 on the regiment channel. The occupiers were moving at high speed, but this did not save them from a precise reset. According to the drone operators, it is not an easy task to hunt down MLRS, because the enemy usually uses the -strike-withdrawal- tactic: the firing positions are located in one place, and the hiding place is in another, at a distance of tens of kilometers. However, high-quality intelligence and careful planning allow our operators to carry out such operations with high efficiency. As reported by ArmyInform, operators of the 412 Nemesis Regiment detected and delivered a precise strike on the Russian Tor anti-aircraft missile system.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/odnogo-razu-na-luganshhyni-nashi-piloty-rozbombyly-chergovyj-vorozhyj-grad/	2025-02-06T10:20:38-08:00
-Soldiers are disposable material- — in Kurshchyna, Russian generals storm - with walkers -	This was told by Stanislav Krasnov, platoon commander of the 95th separate amphibious assault brigade, on the broadcast of the -Edyny Novyni- telethon. According to him, the enemy is constantly changing tactics. This is due to heavy losses in armor and manpower. Some units are completely destroyed by our forces, new ones come. -They recently stormed in large groups of infantry. As it is known from open sources, these were North Korean soldiers. Suffered huge losses. At this moment, the Russians returned to their classic assaults in smaller groups,- Stanislav Krasnov said. Periodically, the Russians still use armored vehicles. The task is simply to get the landing party to our positions. As a rule, in most cases this armored vehicle is burned, and few people are lucky enough to return from an enemy landing. -The losses are really huge. I have not observed such large losses in other directions. They don't spare their life force here at all. Soldiers are used as disposable material, as &#8220;expendables&#8221;. Our team published statistics not so long ago. In the area, 5,000 servicemen were destroyed by our brigade during the Kursk operation,- said the platoon commander of the 95th separate amphibious assault brigade. As reported ArmyInform, in the Lyman direction, the enemy uses a large number of various UAVs, including fiber-optic drones. Attempts to block the logistics routes of the Defense Forces.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/soldaty-cze-odnorazovyj-material-na-kurshhyni-rosijski-generaly-shturmuyut-rozhidnykamy/	2025-02-06T10:12:47-08:00

He told about this on Thursday, February 6, on his page in Facebook. -Sweden has advanced technologies, Ukraine has production capabilities and combat experience. Our joint task is to combine these opportunities,- the minister said. Moreover, the head of the Ministry of Defense noted that there are already -concrete proposals- that will allow launching production projects in the field of defense industry already this year. Among other defense needs, according to Rustem Umerov: As reported by ArmyInform, the Commander of the Naval Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Vice Admiral Oleksiy Neizhpapa discussed with General Mikael Klesson the security situation in the Black Sea.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/vzhe-ye-konkretni-propozycziyi-rustem-umyerov-obgovoryv-z-golovnokomanduvachem-zs-shvecziyi-promyslovu-kooperacziyu/	2025-02-06T10:02:06-08:00
Flight with combustion - a buggy filled with Russian attack aircraft ran into a mine	The video was released on February 6. Two buggies mounted by Russian attack aircraft set out to attack our positions in the Kharkiv region. While moving, the first buggy hit a mine. The explosion was so powerful that the Russians flew dozens of meters up the mountain. They burned at the same time. -This is what the Russian version of -Pavarot ne tuda- looks like. The result: transport to pieces, infantry to pieces. We make sure that the enemy is on fire in the literal sense. Fighters of the 2nd Assault Battalion worked on the final route of the occupiers!-, the brigade commented on the video. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the unmanned systems battalion of the 3rd assault brigade destroyed a lone occupier who teleported to our positions.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/rozlit-zi-zgorannyam-nabytyj-rosijskymy-shturmovykamy-baggi-nayihav-na-minu/	2025-02-06T09:49:59-08:00
A Russian agent who blew up the house of an Armed Forces veteran was detained in Kharkiv	This is reported by the Security Service of Ukraine. For the conspiracy, the agent used wigs, and after committing the crime, she tried to destroy her clothes. However, it did not help her. SBU counter-intelligence quickly identified and detained the perpetrator in her apartment. The investigation established that the unemployed woman from Kharkiv was recruited remotely because of her anti-Ukrainian comments in Telegram channels. The Russian curator gave her instructions: to take an improvised explosive device from a hiding place and plant it in a car tire near a military man's house. The agent also planted a disguised mobile phone across from the victim's yard, through which the enemy monitored the veteran's movements and remotely activated the explosives. During the searches, a mobile phone containing correspondence with a Russian curator in an anonymous messenger chat was seized from the detainee. The investigators of the SBU informed the perpetrator about the suspicion for h. 2 Art. 258 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (terrorist act that led to serious consequences). She faces up to 12 years in prison with confiscation of property. She is currently being held without bail. The operation to expose and detain the Russian agent was carried out by SBU officers in the Kharkiv region together with the National Police under the procedural guidance of the regional prosecutor's office. As reported by ArmyInform, The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) warns of new tactics of Russian special services. They are recruiting citizens of Ukraine to carry out sabotage, in particular, to blow up territorial assembly centers (TCC) and then destroy the performers to cover their tracks.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/u-harkovi-zatrymaly-rosijsku-agentku-yaka-pidirvala-budynok-veterana-zsu/	2025-02-06T09:43:20-08:00
-Here fate brings unexpected people together-: the story of a marine -Kuma-	The story of the fighter was made public on the page of the Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. In the army, -Kum- met people with whom fate would hardly have brought him together in civilian life. -Captains of long-distance sailing, teachers, athletes, entrepreneurs, builders,- lists a serviceman of the 126th separate brigade of the 30th Marine Corps. — Such an interesting circle of communication. And everyone is like one big family. Complex characters, different life experiences, social status&#8230; They can be harsh and do not always express themselves culturally. But these are just, honest people who you can rely on and who will cover your back in a critical situation.- Before the large-scale invasion, the Odessa man -Kum- worked as a private security guard. On March 25, 2022, he went to the TCC and mobilized. He says that he was prompted by the atrocities committed by the Russians in Mariupol, Buchi, Irpen, and other cities and villages of Ukraine. -It really shocked me. I love my family, my daughter, my country. -I love people, that's why I joined the army to protect them from the arbitrariness and cruelty of the occupiers,- says -Kum-. He held the defense of the right bank of the Kherson region, carried out combat missions on the Dnieper islands. This is a very specific area - a swampy area where it is difficult to dig in. The enemy actively uses all possible weapons here, especially unmanned systems and artillery. -There are an extremely large number of drones - they are scouts, FPV, and -maviks- with resets,- says Kum. - They work around the clock, so first of all we have to arrange a shelter so that the enemy cannot see us from above. This is a very difficult task. However, we must carry it out in order to hold our positions, prevent the Russians from occupying them and cross over to the right bank of the Dnieper.- The most emotional moment is, of course, returning from a combat exit. -I haven't been in touch for three weeks. My youngest daughter was the first person I called. Her words -I love you, daddy- are probably the most expensive gift,- says the soldier. According to -The Godfather-, no matter how strict, unmovable and iron-clad the warriors may be on the outside, they remain ordinary people. -We get tired, it hurts, it's uncomfortable, it's physically and emotionally unbearable. And it's scary. Even if we don't admit it. But I don't think it's a bad thing. Everyone has their own fears that need to be overcome. You don't always do what you want. Sometimes you have to do what you have to do. In the case of the military, it is the execution of an order. This is our job, we joined the army for this,- he is convinced. Recently, -Kum- was seriously injured and is currently in the hospital. However, his comrades wish him a speedy recovery and remind him that he can always count on the support and help of his large military family. As reported by ArmyInform, -Viking- is a fighter of the International Legion of the Ground Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, who has been fighting for Ukraine against the Russians for three years occupiers. He went through a difficult battle path, destroying many enemies, and became a true professional in his field.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/tut-dolya-zvodyt-z-nespodivanymy-lyudmy-istoriya-morskogo-pihotynczya-kuma/	2025-02-06T09:32:14-08:00
We brought the war home to Russia — the President on the Kursk operation	This was announced by the President on February 6 in his evening address. -Today, I awarded the participants of the Kursk operation: two boys - Heroes of Ukraine, I also presented -Crosses of Combat Merit-, orders of Ukraine. I want to thank every Ukrainian soldier, all our units, which are involved in the Kursk region and which have shown the whole world that we can act actively, unexpectedly and effectively, even in conditions of limited resources. We detect a Russian bluff as a bluff. We protect our cities — Sumy and Kharkiv. We have significantly replenished the exchange fund — these are hundreds and hundreds of Russian soldiers, whom we are exchanging in order to return Ukrainians from captivity. We also have North Korean soldiers in captivity - now they are undergoing treatment, they were wounded in battles. Serious injuries. But they are proof that Putin has drawn another state into this war — North Korea — and is teaching that state to wage modern warfare. This is a threat to everyone, to every country in East Asia. And I am grateful to all partners who understand how important it is to stop Russia now — now, so that we don't have to fight years from now,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. He noted the brigades of the Armed Forces of Ukraine that are involved in Kurshchyna: soldiers of the 80th, 82nd, 95th, 22nd, 61st brigades, 36th marine brigades, 17th tank, 47th mechanized, 129th infantry brigade, soldiers of the Special Operations Forces, soldiers of the Security Service of Ukraine, all the involved forces of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine. -I also want to thank Chief of Staff General Sirsky for planning the Kursk operation. The significance of the Kursk operation will be reflected both in the diplomacy that will take place and in the history that will be written by Ukrainians — our people, not the occupiers.- Volodymyr Zelensky also thanked France, personally President Emmanuel Macron, for fulfilling the agreements. -Our Air Force is now supplemented with Mirages, French aircraft, and this is another stage in the development of Ukrainian military aviation. We will be able to perform more tasks. I also thank the Netherlands - there is a new supply of F-16, and this is significant,- the President assured. He also talked about the meeting with the president of the EBRD, who is currently visiting Ukraine. -I am grateful for Ukraine's support - the programs of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development are aimed at many important directions. And today, we talked with the EBRD, in particular, about the need to support Ukrainian migrants - our internal migrants, all those who were forced to leave their homes because of the war, who lost their homes. It is necessary to help these people in a new place to get normal apartments or houses: this is the most important issue for millions of Ukrainian migrants - their own home. And our partners definitely have a resource to help with that. Today, he also assigned relevant tasks to Finance Minister Marchenko and Deputy Prime Minister for Reconstruction Kulebi. Within two weeks, there should be a clear program — a program to support internally displaced people that is effective and understandable to people. I thank everyone who is with Ukraine!- Volodymyr Zelenskyi concluded his speech. As reported by ArmyInform, the President awarded the participants of the Kursk operation with state awards.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/my-povernuly-vijnu-dodomu-u-rosiyu-prezydent-pro-kursku-operacziyu/	2025-02-06T09:23:07-08:00
Divers of the TSP -Omega-: how elite fighters are trained for special operations on water	This is is discussed in a post on the unit page. -Divers of the Omega CSP can become a determining factor in the success of combat operations. They are not just ready to work on the water - they change the course of events thanks to their unique skills,- Major General Pavlo Yatsyuk emphasized. Diving groups have been operating as part of -Omega- since the creation of the division in 2003. In 2015, taking into account the needs of combat operations and geographical features, an additional group was created in Odesa, which made it possible to work more effectively in maritime conditions. -We constantly analyze the possibilities of expanding diving groups, optimize their structure and prepare for new challenges. The war forces us to adapt and improve in order to be one step ahead,- noted the head of the Central Security Service. Divers of the TSP -Omega- work in the most difficult areas of the front, performing a wide range of tasks: Personnel operate along the entire front line. Their work is critical, especially given that much of the battle line runs along bodies of water. -Only specialists trained in water warfare are able to effectively perform such tasks. Our divers understand the responsibility assigned to them, and make a significant contribution to the defense of Ukraine,- emphasized Pavlo Yatsyuk. Special forces divers are trained taking into account real combat conditions. Instructors carefully practice all possible scenarios to prepare personnel for the most difficult challenges. -Our fighters train as they will work on the battlefield. Their professionalism and level of training is extremely respectable. I am grateful to everyone for their dedication and willingness to act where it is most dangerous,- added the head of the Omega Central Security Service. As reported by ArmyInform, the special-purpose divers of the Omega Special Operations Center continue to improve their skills even in winter conditions the cold For five days, the fighters practiced difficult tasks in reservoirs adapted for diving and working on water.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/vodolazy-czsp-omega-yak-gotuyut-elitnyh-bijcziv-dlya-speczoperaczij-na-vodi/	2025-02-06T09:17:44-08:00

Fighters of the -Hydra- unit from the 2nd mechanized company of the 2nd mechanized battalion of the Third Assault Brigade conducted a successful operation to clear the enemy dugout where the Russian occupiers were holed up.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/geroyizm-ne-propyesh-na-harkivshhyni-rosijskyj-shturmovyk-zagynuv-pry-forsuvanni-kalyuzhi/	2025-02-06T09:03:49-08:00
Shark -ate- -Hyacinth- - a long-range Russian cannon was hit	The video of the defeat was published on the unit's channel. The Russian self-propelled gun can fire effectively at a distance of more than 33 kilometers, so it is usually placed quite far from the front line. This time, the Russians hid their long-range -flower- in the landing, but this did not prevent our aerial scouts, who, with the help of the Shark reconnaissance UAV, spotted the enemy artillery system and transmitted its coordinates. Not long after, Hyacinth-S flew by. Judging by the power of the explosion, the ammunition package also detonated. We hope that the crew also did not leave their combat vehicle in trouble. As reported by ArmyInform, thanks to M777 hit the enemy minus two -Hyacintas- in the Zaporizhzhya direction.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/shark-zyiv-giaczynt-urazheno-dalekobijnu-rosijsku-garmatu/	2025-02-06T08:47:42-08:00
Soledar - his pain, Ukraine - his struggle: the story of a soldier on the call sign -Donbas-	At the age of 18, Vladyslav signed a three-year contract with the ZSU. He knew he wanted to become an artilleryman and chose to serve in the 23rd Separate Mechanized Brigade, which received NATO equipment. First, he was a service number of a self-propelled howitzer, then a — driver-mechanic. He is now a senior gunner in the self-propelled artillery division, working on the M109L. Despite the difficult conditions and constant battles, Vladyslav, who is called -Donbas- by his brothers, knows that the most important thing is the people around him. A real brotherhood prevails in the brigade, which unites them in the struggle for every piece of native land. -Together we are stronger. Everyone has to protect their land and family. Warriors are not born — they become warriors,- — says the fighter. Soledar, Donbas, Ukraine — his pain, his struggle. And he fights for those who remained under occupation and for those who no longer have a home. As ArmiyaInform reported, the role of a psychologist in the war for survival is difficult to overestimate. Not only the body, but also the soul of warriors are wounded. Lieutenant Sergey Rostikov heads the combat stress control group in 21 separate mechanized brigades.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/soledar-jogo-bil-ukrayina-jogo-borotba-istoriya-voyina-donbasa/	2025-02-06T08:32:42-08:00
-Pack your suitcases and prepare your wallets-: the occupiers give ultimatums to the residents of TO...	This was reported by the head of the Luhansk OVA, Artem Lysogor. Residents have to solve the issue of transporting things and finding a new home on their own. Russian contractors are not responsible for the possible disappearance of personal items that may be -found- during the so-called demonstrative repair. While some are forced to look for new housing, others are outraged by new -improvements- from the occupation authorities. In the so-called LNR, since February 1, the cost of travel in city and intercity transport has been significantly increased - the fares have doubled. This also applies to communal transport in Luhansk, where there has been a shortage of drivers for a long time. By raising prices, the occupation administration is trying to make transport companies more attractive for work. However, according to local residents, the quality of transportation remains far from satisfactory. Promises to improve living conditions in the temporarily occupied territories once again turn out to be empty words. People are forced to leave their homes and pay more for the same or even worse services. As reported by ArmyInform, collaborators who went to serve the occupiers found themselves in a difficult situation in the temporarily occupied Luhansk Region. Employees of the so-called state cultural institutions have not received salaries for almost two years.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/pakujte-valizy-ta-gotujte-gamanczi-okupanty-stavlyat-ultymatumy-zhytelyam-tot-luganshhyny/	2025-02-06T08:12:17-08:00

Marines from the 37th brigade cleared and destroyed one of the enemy positions in the Novopavlovsk direction. Under the cover of an Oshkosh M-ATV armored car, our fighters forced the Russians to take cover. Then part of the marines took up positions while other fighters planted explosives and blew up the Russians in their hiding place. A group of four Russians decided to go for a walk to storm our positions. Drone operators from the -Charter- brigade decided to disperse the hostile tourists. It took them only 13 minutes to destroy the entire group of Russians. Another Russian decided to go for a walk without his friends. So our drone went for a walk with him. The occupier did not try to drive away his new friend, or even shoot back, he just calmly accepted his death. These and other topics are discussed by our presenters - Lieutenant Serhii Lipko and Junior Lieutenant Volodymyr Kravchuk.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/okupant-vtratyv-golovu-vid-drona-ukrayina-otrymala-novi-vynyshhuvachi-strim-iz-pryfrontovogo-mista/	2025-02-06T07:54:28-08:00
They crossed the border at the beginning of summer — the special forces told about the secrets of th...	This was reported by the Special Operations Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on February 6. This application led to multi-layered pressure on the Russian troops and created conditions for the rapid advance of the main forces in Kurshchyna. When in June 2024, Russia continued to carry out loud airstrikes in the Sumy region, small CCO groups entered the enemy rear in the Kursk region of the Russian Federation. Two months remained before the start of a large-scale operation in Kurshchyna. SSO operators advanced early through the territory of the Russian Federation as part of preparations for the Kursk operation long before the world learned about the main offensive of the Defense Forces of Ukraine. Through careful reconnaissance and strikes against the enemy's rear structures, they destroyed the key elements of the Russian defense in the border region. Thanks to planning, the destruction of Russian air defense systems and ammunition depots did not leave the enemy the opportunity to react quickly. Point strikes on enemy strategic objects and logistics made it impossible to quickly transfer reinforcements. This performance allowed the SSO to bring the main contingent of Ukrainian troops along the prepared routes. The August offensive in Kurshchyna began with minimal resistance from the Russian army. This is the only time since the Second World War when foreign troops crossed the borders of Russia. And its military-political leadership proved unable to respond promptly to the changing situation and the asymmetry of the war. As the main units of the Ukrainian army advanced deep into Kurshchyna, special purpose groups and the SSO Resistance Movement carried out raid operations, ambushes and sabotage, blew up bridges and crossings in the enemy's rear. Combat work was coordinated with friendly units of the Defense Forces. Swarms of drones also did their thing in a sky clear of enemy air defense and EW. BpAK SSO pilots destroyed Russian logistics convoys, heavy equipment and military personnel. Not only kinetic actions were used. At the same time, units of Psychological Operations of the SSO wreaked havoc among civilians, and the Russian military was disorganized through the operation codenamed -Seneca-. However, the Russians tried to reverse the course of events by involving North Korean troops in the hostilities at the end of autumn. However, the special forces quickly adapted and inflicted some of the biggest losses on North Korean troops since the end of the active phase of the Korean War more than 70 years ago. Repelling another North Korean assault, the SSO unit was the first to capture the documents and weapons of the North Korean troops. The trophies revealed details about the level of their combat, physical and ideological training. Despite good equipment and high morale, North Korean troops were unprepared for modern warfare. FPV drone strikes only confirmed this. The North Korean special agent, who was the first to be captured by SSO operators, is already testifying in the SBU and providing valuable intelligence information. Ultimately, the deep autonomy and high training of the SSO units during the months of work during the Kursk operation allowed the Special Operations Forces to operate without the need for constant support from other units of the Defense Forces of Ukraine. And smart application, mobility, coordination of actions and high-tech equipment of the SSO prove that the defense of the prevailing enemy can be effectively undermined and achieved success. -The Kursk operation continues. We continue to work!-, said the message of the SSO of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. As reported by ArmyInform, half a year after the start of the Kursk operation, President honored its participants with state awards.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/peretnuly-kordon-shhe-na-pochatku-lita-speczpryznachenczi-rozpovily-pro-tayemnyczi-kurskoyi-operacziyi/	2025-02-06T07:46:19-08:00

As noted, the main technical characteristics of the drone are that it easily overcomes a variety of landscape obstacles, so it will pass without much effort even to the most difficult-to-reach places. -Technical characteristics of the Terminator: it will easily overcome various landscape obstacles and pass through difficult terrain without much effort. Invisibly for the enemy, it replaces the terrain and can transport up to 8 anti-tank mines on itself,- the message reads. And a machine gun can be installed on this drone so that it fires from an ambush or during offensive operations destroys enemy infantry and suppresses firing points. In addition, this platform is able to deliver ammunition, provisions, medicines and even carry the wounded. -What is the meaning of his work? After all, such combat tasks can be performed by ordinary infantrymen. Of course they can. But the combat work of one such minefield robot can replace up to four servicemen — and in this case there is an opportunity to perform a combat mission without risking the lives of fellow combatants, whose preservation is a priority,- the military emphasized. As reported by ArmyInform, the 33rd OMBR shared a selection where Ukrainian FPV drones organized a real hunt for the invaders.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/znajomtes-terminator-zsu-rozpovily-pro-nazemnogo-drona-yakyj-mozhe-minuvaty-misczevist-ta-nyshhyty-okupantiv-z-kulemeta/	2025-02-06T07:36:44-08:00

The head of state noted that thanks to the Kursk operation, which began exactly six months ago, it was possible to prevent a new Russian attack on Sumy and Kharkiv, returning the war to the territory of the aggressor country itself. -Aggressors and criminals can and should be beaten at home. The occupier can and should be surrendered on his territory. And it is not only fair, it is also effective — for the protection of life in our country and in Europe in general. The Kursk operation clearly explains the meaning of the principle -peace through strength,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy emphasized. According to him, the Kursk operation gave Ukraine a significant replenishment of the exchange fund and drew strong Russian units to the territory of the Russian Federation. In addition, the President thanked the soldiers and commanders who ensure the effectiveness of the operation in Kurshchyna, namely: the 80th separate amphibious assault Halytsia brigade, the 82nd separate amphibious assault Bukovina brigade, the 95th separate amphibious assault Polish brigade, the 22nd separate mechanized brigade, the 61st separate mechanized Steppe brigade, the 36th separate marine infantry brigade named after Rear Admiral Mykhailo Bilinskyi, the 17th separate Kryvyi Rih tank brigade named after Kostyantyn Pestushka, the 47th separate mechanized brigade and the 129th separate brigade of the Territorial Defense Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, as well as the SSO, SBU and the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Volodymyr Zelenskyy awarded Hero of Ukraine Lt. Col. Oleksandr Bohonchyk (SBU) and Captain Pavlo Yazlovetskyi with the -Golden Star- orders. Olexandr Bohonchyk participated in the development of an aircraft-type drone, which has already proven its effectiveness in destroying Russian UAVs and contributed to the development of a new direction of countering drones. On the night of August 6, Oleksandr Bohonchyk's group eliminated all six enemy anti-aircraft missiles in the area of ​​responsibility. Thanks to this, units of the Defense Forces entered the territory of the Russian Federation virtually unnoticed. In total, 169 drones were destroyed in the Kursk area under the leadership of Oleksandr Bohonchyk. In addition, he trained seven groups that are now independently participating in combat operations and eliminating Russian drones. Pavlo Yazlovetskyi is the commander of the airborne assault company of the 82nd ODSHBr. Last year in August, he conducted raids in the Kursk region, during which his unit was caught in three fire ambushes, but was able to occupy the designated border. Pavlo Yazlovetskyi organized the occupation of the circular defense and set up an ambush for the Russian invaders. 102 soldiers under his command traveled dozens of kilometers through enemy-controlled territories for two days and were able to get out of the encirclement. The unit destroyed about three platoons, four units of combat armored vehicles and about ten units of motor vehicles. The President also awarded four defenders with the -Cross of Combat Merit-. It was received by: Major Ivan Bakrev. As the commander of the artillery division of the 82nd ODSHBr during the offensive and search-and-strike operations last year in August on the territory of Kurshchyna, he prevented shelling by Russian aircraft and artillery, saved the lives of Ukrainian soldiers and inflicted losses on the enemy. During this operation, 17 Russian occupiers were destroyed, MT-LB, automobile equipment, a tank and a mortar were damaged. Colonel Viktor Bilozyorov (SBU). As part of combined groups of the Security Service of Ukraine in Kurshchyna, he carried out a series of measures to destroy enemy fortifications and strongholds and destroy the occupiers' columns.

Volodymyr Zelenskyi also handed passports of citizens of Ukraine to foreigners who are fighting for the independence of our state on an equal footing with Ukrainians, to soldiers from Belarus and Russia.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/pivroku-vid-pochatku-kurskoyi-operacziyi-prezydent-vidznachyv-yiyi-uchasnykiv-derzhavnymy-nagorodamy/	2025-02-06T07:05:33-08:00
-Mirages- fly - what will they do: about the Mirage 2000 mission in Ukraine	ArmyInform in October of last year published material on the capabilities of the French multi-purpose jet fighter of the 4th generation. We offer to recall it today. F-16 Fighting Falcon is currently the most famous Western fighter in Ukraine. However, it is not the only one, the transfer of which is discussed during the dialogue with partner countries. The list of aerial fighters also includes the Dassault Mirage 2000, a fourth-generation multi-purpose jet fighter. Developed in the 1970s by Dassault Aviation, it became the main combat aircraft of the French Air Force in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. As the French like to remind, it was their Mirage that became the only plane in the world that was confirmed to have shot down the invincible F-16 in air combat. ArmyInform already wrote about this unique historical battle. Back in June 2024, the transfer of Dassault Mirage 2000 fighters to Ukraine was announced by French President Emmanuel Macron. Later, this was also announced by the French Minister of Defense Sebastien Lecornu, informing about the time of the handover of the fighters — already in the first quarter of 2025. The head of the French defense ministry did not specify the number and modification of the aircraft, but noted that the transferred fighters will be equipped with new technical means for air-to-ground combat and electronic warfare protection. However, in the short post of the Minister of Defense of France, there is still information that allows us to reasonably assume what tasks the French Mirage 2000 will perform when repelling the aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine. The phrase -combat air-sol- used by the head of the French defense department suggests that the main task of the Mirage 2000 multi-purpose fighters will be striking ground targets. In view of the noted mention of new technical equipment specifically for delivering strikes from the air on the earth's surface, it can also be assumed which modification of the fighter-bomber will be transferred to Ukraine. Previously, the media, based on the statement of French President Emmanuel Macron, talked about the Mirage 2000-5 — a modernized export version of the aircraft. It is also possible that, in addition to it, Ukraine will receive an attack fighter-bomber of the Mirage 2000D modification, for which striking ground targets is the main purpose. Taking into account these assumptions, it is worth taking a closer look at what kind of ammunition and how the -Frenchman- in the Ukrainian sky will be able to beat the Russian invaders on Ukrainian and Russian land. The use of the Mirage 2000 as a close air support aircraft, that is, as an attack aircraft directly above the battlefield, should be immediately rejected due to the high saturation of the theater of operations with enemy air defense (APD), in particular, man-portable anti-aircraft missile systems (MANPADS). For the same reasons, the possibility of using the Mirage 2000 to drop aerial bombs in free fall should be ruled out. After all, in the event of an aircraft appearing directly above the line of battle or, even more so, in the enemy's rear at any depth, it will be a priority target for damage, which will be very difficult to avoid. Therefore, air-to-surface missiles and guided (adjusted) gliding aerial bombs remain suitable for active use. The same goes for the F-16 Fighting Falcon, so all the considerations made for the Fighting Falcons are quite valid for the Mirages as well. However, with an important amendment on what kind of ammunition the Mirage 2000 will be able to use to strike ground targets. For the F-16, as of today, it may be primarily about the AGM-154 JSOW high-precision, medium-range glider guided bombs. In the case of the Mirage 2000, it is not known for sure what -standard- ammunition Ukraine will be able to get for it, or what air-to-ground missiles or aviation bombs the aircraft can be equipped with. Most likely, the plane can be -armed- with SCALP-EG cruise missiles and Hammer cruise bombs, which are already used by the Ukrainian military aviation. However, given the high compatibility of weapons, military equipment and ammunition of NATO member states, there may be other interesting options.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/mirazhi-letyat-shho-budut-robyt-pro-zavdannya-mirage-2000-v-ukrayini/	2025-02-06T06:42:15-08:00

-They take boards, lie down and swim - how the Russians try to force Oskil and what comes of it	Mykola Volokhov, the commander of the Terra division of the Third Separate Assault Brigade, told about this in the broadcast of the -Edyny Novyni- telethon. According to him, the Oskil River is a very serious obstacle for the Russians. It is incredibly difficult to force it. In addition, after forcing, you need to gain a foothold and accumulate strength in order to then make a dash forward. But during nine months of combat work in the area of ​​responsibility of the Third Assault Division, the enemy did not manage to do this. -For 9 months, the enemy has not advanced a single meter in the area of ​​our responsibility. Do they try in small groups? Yes, they are trying. Small groups take such small boards and lie down on them. They think that they are an insignificant target and float away.

For almost half a century, three railway arsonists were convicted in Bukovina	This was reported on February 6 by the Security Service of Ukraine. Law enforcement officers arrested the perpetrators in September 2024 -on hot pursuit-, when they set fire to a relay box on the railway line of the western region. According to the case file, the perpetrators are two brothers and their acquaintance from the regional center, who were looking for -quick- earnings on Telegram channels. There, they were recruited remotely by a representative of the Russian special services and initially given a -test- task - to paint provocative graffiti on the walls of city buildings. The agents then received hostile instructions to set fire to energy facilities that ensure the uninterrupted movement of trains, including military echelons of the Defense Forces. In this way, the enemy hoped to disrupt the transport logistics of supplying weapons and ammunition to the Ukrainian troops at the front. During the searches of the residences of the persons involved, mobile phones with evidence of subversive activities in favor of the Russian Federation were seized. On the basis of the evidence collected by the SBU investigators, the court found the agents guilty of ch. 2 Art. 28, ch. 2 Art. 113 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (sabotage committed by a group of persons under martial law according to a prior conspiracy).

-Three weeks in the siege of drones-: how -Student- and four of his comrades survived in the hell of...	The story of the fighters was published on the brigade's page. 28-year-old Oleg from Ternopil Oblast worked as a craftsman in furniture production before the war. In 2023, he entered the army, where after a short training he was sent to the 58th brigade as a machine gunner. One of the first combat tasks for Oleg and his comrades turned out to be a real test of strength. -We thought that it would be a normal exit to the position,- says -Student-. -But everything went wrong from the very beginning.- Approaching the position, the fighters came under fire from enemy drones. Two siblings were injured, but refused hospitalization. As it turned out later, this decision saved their lives, because the evacuation site was soon fired upon by the enemy. Having taken a position, the fighters found themselves in a difficult situation. The dugout was empty, without sleeping bags and a small bag. It was the middle of November. In addition, enemy drones mined the escape route with -petal- mines. -We got stuck in the forest,- Oleg recalls. -The enemy was no more than 500 meters away, we even heard their voices.- The situation was complicated by the fact that four of the five fighters had no combat experience. However, they were lucky with a combat medic who took command. -Our doctor organized everything,- says -Student-. -He appointed those responsible, showed what to do during an assault or a drone attack.- Under the leadership of the medic, the fighters repelled several enemy assaults. However, the main enemy for them became drones, which dropped explosives every 15-20 minutes. -They terrorized us constantly,- says Oleg. -Only at night we could rest a little.- In addition to enemy attacks, the fighters struggled with hunger, cold and thirst. -The dugout was bare,- recalls -Student-. -We took turns sleeping on boards, eating crumbs from galettes, and drinking water from puddles.- For three weeks, the fighters held the position, waiting for an opportunity to withdraw safely. And finally, after waiting for the fog, they were able to get out of the environment. -No one wanted to take risks,- says Oleg. — We knew that all the groups that came out of the neighboring positions were defeated. So we decided to wait. And finally the route was laid out, we waited for the fog and left. Fortunately, everyone came out. Thanks to our doctor.- According to the -Student-, this difficult experience made him stronger and taught him to appreciate the fighting brotherhood. -I realized that I can fully count on my brothers,- says Oleg. -Now I know that martial brotherhood is not just words.- As reported by ArmyInform, to survive in the besieged Mariupol, to walk 300 kilometers through enemy lines, to endure 14 days of exhausting journey and saving your fellows is a task that seems almost impossible. But for senior sergeant Vladyslav, call sign -Fanya-, it became a reality.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/try-tyzhni-v-oblozi-droniv-yak-student-razom-iz-chotyrma-pobratymamy-vyzhyly-v-pekli-vijny/	2025-02-06T03:01:16-08:00
Frightened by explosive branders: how the Russians are trying to counter Ukrainian naval drones	Dmytro Pletenchuk, the spokesman of the Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, told about this in the broadcast of the -Yedini Novyni- telethon. According to him, mostly such patrols fly over the eastern part of the Black Sea. Thanks to helicopters, tasks can be performed more conveniently, because their speed is comparable to the speed of a sea drone. The AN-26 propeller and the Be-12 and Be-200 amphibious aircraft are also suitable for this tactic. -The old park. They have a low speed, a low flight height. And it allows you to observe and search directly from the plane. Remember when the helicopters were shot down last time? How many crew members were there? In addition to the pilots with the navigator, there were also additional shooters and observers. They use all available models of aviation equipment,- noted Dmytro Pletenchuk. As ArmiyaInform reported, the traffic regime through the so-called Crimean Bridge is stricter than when crossing the border.

One of my comrades was wounded, but did not leave the group, - recalls -Fanya-. This path required not only physical endurance, but also an indomitable will. Without food, under the constant threat of being discovered, Ukrainian soldiers broke through enemy lines. They left the environment - wounded, exhausted, but alive. After leaving Mariupol, -Fanya- continued the struggle. In May 2022, together with 1 separate battalion of marines, he participated in counteroffensive actions in the Kherson direction.

According to him, now in Chasovoy Yar, the Siverskyi Donets - Donbas channel, around which fierce battles continued some time ago, has lost its significance. The enemy then tried to attack using the concrete pipes of the canal. Now the enemy is concentrating troops in the Northern region. -Now we can say that moving through canal pipes is no longer relevant. The enemy made three passes in the Siverskyi Donetsk channel in order to distract our attention. We must attract an additional resource to control these passages with the help of drones, as well as remote mining,- said Dmytro Zaporozhets. According to him, during the past month, the Russians actively threw armored vehicles into battle. It was on it that the landing party was sent to the southern part of the city, to the area of ​​the -Avangard- stadium. -In January, at least 10 units of armored vehicles were destroyed.

€597 million of investments: how - the Danish model - strengthens Ukraine's defense industry and wha...	This is reported by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. It is noted that the so-called -Danish model- became one of these tools. This mechanism allows the funds of partner states to be channeled into the production of Ukrainian weapons to ensure the priority needs of the Ukrainian army. The Ministry of Defense talked about the specifics of this format of cooperation, its participants and other similar mechanisms of support for the Ukrainian army. In 2024, Ukraine and Denmark introduced a new mechanism for financing arms purchases for the Armed Forces through reimbursement of contracts with Ukrainian manufacturers. According to this scheme, the Ukrainian side forms a detailed list of projects that need financing, and Danish experts conduct a detailed assessment of the capabilities of the recommended companies and analyze their previous experience in executing contracts. Back in 2023, the Ukrainian defense industry significantly increased its production capacity. However, the country faced two significant challenges: limited government spending on arms procurement and a gradual decline in international military aid. By that time, the partner countries had already transferred a significant part of the existing reserves, but their production capacities did not have time to adapt to the new needs. In this context, the -Danish model- offered an effective solution: channeling financial resources of the allies directly into the Ukrainian defense industry, which quickly proved its effectiveness. As stated in the MoU, the uniqueness of this approach lies in the fact that it not only ensures the prompt supply of the necessary weapons to the Ukrainian military, but also creates a powerful incentive for the development of the domestic defense-industrial complex. This, in turn, significantly strengthens the economic stability of Ukraine in the conditions of martial law and forms a solid base for the further development of the defense industry. The name of this mechanism is directly related to Denmark's decisive role in its development and implementation. It was this country that became a pioneer in introducing a system of direct financing of Ukrainian defense enterprises, establishing a fundamentally new format of cooperation between partners and Ukraine in the field of defense. The decision to launch such a mechanism was made after the Danish stockpile of weapons available for transfer to the Ukrainian military was exhausted. At the first stage, Denmark allocated a tranche in the amount of 50 million euros, which was aimed at the production of 18 self-propelled -Bohdan- artillery installations. The result was not long in coming: two months after the conclusion of the implementation agreement, the equipment arrived at the combat units of the Defense Forces. Subsequently, the funding was expanded to establish the production of other strategically important types of weapons: long-range drones, anti-tank and anti-ship missile systems. In general, thanks to the coordinated work of all participants of the initiative, the Armed Forces of Ukraine have already received weapons for a total amount of almost 597 million euros. Of these, 175 million euros came directly from Denmark. The MOU said that the successful implementation of the -Danish model- contributed to the expansion of financing of the Ukrainian defense industry by other countries. In 2024, Sweden and Iceland joined the mechanism. The parties provided financial support to the initiative in the amount of 20 million euros and 2.7 million euros, respectively — directly through Denmark. An additional result was the decision to finance the production of Ukrainian weapons at the expense of interest from frozen Russian assets. In 2024, 390 million euros were allocated to these needs. This was made possible thanks to the active diplomatic support and assistance of the Danish government, which once again underlines the strategic importance of this partnership. For 2025, the EU allocated 1 billion euros from the revenues from frozen Russian assets, and Canada - about 67 million euros. Denmark has also reserved 130 million euros for further investments in the Ukrainian defense industry. In addition, Norway is expected to provide about 43 million euros for the implementation of projects within the initiative, and Sweden announced the allocation of $178 million. Within the framework of the -Danish model-, it is planned to focus on expanding the range of manufactured weapons. Special attention will be paid to the production of high-tech long-range UAVs, modern missile systems and artillery installations. The MOU noted that the -Danish model- will benefit not only individual manufacturers, but the market as a whole. After all, the financing of one enterprise allows the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine to direct the released funds to the purchase of other weapons. At the same time, the Ministry of Defense is working on scaling the -Danish model- for the production of rear-end products. The implementation of this initiative can significantly accelerate the provision of the necessary assets to the Defense Forces. Along with the -Danish model-, other mechanisms of support for the Armed Forces are also actively functioning. Traditionally, partner countries provide weapons directly from their arsenals, and also participate in joint military equipment maintenance programs and conduct comprehensive training for Ukrainian servicemen. As noted in the MOU, an equally important form of cooperation is the creation of joint defense enterprises on the territory of Ukraine, the number of which is about 40. Among the partners are world leaders such as the German Rheinmetall AG, the Franco-German KNDS and the American Boeing. Such enterprises not only provide production and maintenance of advanced equipment and ammunition directly in Ukraine, but also contribute to the attraction of significant investments in the state's economy.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/e597-mln-investyczij-yak-danska-model-zmicznyuye-opk-ukrayiny-j-chogo-ochikuvaty/	2025-02-06T00:31:41-08:00

The Armed Forces are switching to a corps system: the expert named the pros and cons of such a step	How will such a step be useful for our Armed Forces, ArmyInform asked a lawyer, a serviceman of the Armed Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Oleksandr Musienko. The interlocutor reminded that the Ukrainian army is going through the path of reforms not only taking into account NATO standards, but also based on how the combat situation is formed, what experience is gained and, accordingly, what conclusions are drawn. -Based on this, assessing the state of the troop management system during a large-scale invasion, an in-depth analysis of the system that exists and how it can be improved to make it even more efficient, better and more effective. Accordingly, a decision was made and a system was developed by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine under the command of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, General Oleksandr Syrskyi, which provides for the transition to corps in the Armed Forces of Ukraine. It was proposed to the Supreme Commander-in-Chief to the President of Ukraine with explanations and justifications,- says Oleksandr Musienko. Yes, the transition to a corpus system is dictated, in fact, by the experience of the Defense Forces. -First, it is necessary to improve the efficiency, manageability and organization of processes. Accordingly, in order to take into account the experience that was in both OTU and OSUV, it is the army corps that can improve their work, where there will be an appropriate number of brigades that will be combined into corps; there will be a command, a clear hierarchy, there will be a corps area of ​​responsibility, and the corps will serve and repel Russian aggression,- the expert says. And he continues: -Secondly, it can solve the issue of so-called seconded units: when in fact we have units from different brigades and they can work in different directions of the front. Accordingly, this will improve the situation. In addition, the corps system will allow commanders on the ground to understand and calculate the number of forces and assets and a clear area of ​​responsibility that they will cover.- In addition, according to Oleksandr Musienko, it will improve the efficiency of management and organization. -Another point to consider: the size of the Defense Forces increased under a full-scale Russian invasion. Therefore, the corps system was chosen for the Armed Forces as a system that exists in many partner countries of Ukraine in NATO. Such systems exist in the USA, Great Britain, France, Australia, and New Zealand. Even China has such a system. She justified herself, proved herself well. And it must respond to the challenges facing the Armed Forces of Ukraine today,- Oleksandr Musienko summarized.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/zsu-perehodyat-na-korpusnu-systemu-ekspert-nazvav-plyusy-i-perevagy-takogo-kroku/	2025-02-05T21:03:58-08:00
Creeping -Cockroach- with striking -Saber-: what ground robotic complexes are capable of at the fron...	Andriy with the call sign -Dais- told ArmiyaInform about how ground drones work instead of people and help people at the front. Cockroach ground drones are Andrii's favorites. Like the insects that give them their name, these drones are hardy, durable, highly maneuverable, and can become virtually omnipresent when needed. And they are also versatile and perform a wide variety of functions. - These are our most favorite universal ground robotic complexes. Passability, price, a very simple design that can be modified, a very versatile base, emphasizes the military. The easiest way to use -Targan- is to deliver cargo to the front line. Where it is dangerous to use other equipment or, even more so, to go to the fighters, the -Targan- can become irreplaceable. — They can carry up to 200 kilograms. We use precisely such -Cockroaches- to perform logistical tasks. And there is also -Targan 3K- - it is much larger and can cover a greater distance, work in worse conditions. For example, it can even evacuate some ground units or aerial drones that have fallen, Dice says. In general, Andrii emphasizes, the use of a ground drone is limited only by the imagination of developers and operators. For example, in the near future, it is planned to use -Cockroaches- as a platform for the delivery of FPV drones, which will be able to launch as close as possible to enemy positions without any risk to the pilot. On the -Targan- you can also install a remote-controlled Saber combat module, with the help of which fire suppression of the enemy is carried out. — Here you can see drones with different modifications, including turrets installed on them, called Saber. They can be used in different ways right on the battle line, says Dice. To control such a complex, which is called -Thermite-, two operators are needed. One of them controls the movement of the drone, the other fires. — One controls the Saber itself from the steam deck of the controller, i.e. fire and guidance, and the other operator controls the drone itself, Andrii explains. These systems have already managed to be tested in combat conditions, but it is not yet possible to tell about all the details of their application. In addition, a confident military man, the most daring operations of the -Cockroaches- with the -Sabres- are still ahead. Another possible way of using the ground robotic complex is to blow up enemy fortifications with the help of an explosive charge mounted on a drone. — We also used drones as kamikaze. If we needed to completely demolish some enemy fortifications, then we used one of the drones, which was called -Ratel,- says Andriy. Now drones of this modification are no longer being made. Although they performed quite well, those ground robotic platforms needed improvement. — Each model is created for its own separate task. For example, if it is a kamikaze drone, you need to reduce the weight of the drone itself and increase the mass of explosives it can carry. That is why we, as military personnel who already have experience in this field, need to constantly complete, rework, and modify ground robotic complexes, - explains Andriy. On the basis of the -Targan- base, it is also possible to create a robotic complex designed to evacuate wounded fighters. Such drones can also take out their damaged mechanical -brothers- - both ground and air - from the -gray zone-. - We try to save our drones from damage. For this, we use a modified platform that has the ability to pull the drone to itself or somehow grab it, says Dice. In this way, -Targan- was able to save the heavy Vampire hexacopter, which the Russian occupiers call -Baba Yaga- out of fear. The video with the rescue of a heavy night air bomber has gone viral on the Internet. Such an evacuation, the military emphasizes, is a real special operation that requires accurate calculations and the work of experienced engineers and drone operators. After all, only qualified specialists are able to take into account all the nuances and make accurate calculations, and then do what no one anywhere has ever done before them. A special mining system is installed on one of the -Targans-, which allows the transportation and installation of anti-tank mines. - Mines are installed from it, after which the drone leaves the place of the task - -Dice- explains the principle of operation of the -Targan- miner. In this way, the drone sapper allows not to expose military personnel to danger, taking upon itself not only the delivery, but also the installation of mines. - The developers of -Targan- assure that it can drive 20 kilometers, but we drove much more. It all depends on the modification of the drone, the weight it carries and the quality of the batteries. We can install better batteries on it, and it will -live- longer, go further and perform more combat missions, -Dice- explains. For the further development of ground-based robotic complexes, there is currently a shortage of qualified specialists. -If you really have skills, just come to us, we will find you a place where you can realize all your technical fantasies and do things that are very unpleasant for Russians,- jokes -Andriy-. He assures that, with the desire and ability to learn, anyone who makes the necessary efforts can master the profession of a ground drone operator. He himself transferred to the engineering and sapper division, which had ground robotic complexes, from the infantry. Having learned how to fly the -Cockroaches- and gained experience using ground-based drones on the front line, he now imparts his knowledge, skills and expertise to other fighters.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/povzuchyj-targan-z-razyuchoyu-shableyu-na-shho-zdatni-nazemni-robotyzovani-kompleksy-na-fronti/	2025-02-05T20:41:24-08:00
700,000 hours of testing: the US Army received the latest unmanned aerial reconnaissance system	As noted in a release posted on the official portal of the US Army, the MK 4.8 HQ airborne sounding system from its developer, Textron Systems, is an important milestone in the rapid prototyping program, ArmyInform reports. -This achievement was the result of a complex two-year development and testing process, which included extensive technical research, acceptance tests on the ground and in flight, as well as the joint efforts of the supplier and the United States government,- the US Army emphasizes. In turn, Textron Systems, known worldwide for its powerful brands such as Bell, Cessna, Beechcraft, Pipistrel and a number of others, revealed that the MK 4.8 Hybrid Quad (HQ) drone is now part of the US Army's Future Tactical Unmanned Aircraft Systems (FTUAS) program. -The Aerosonde® family of unmanned aerial vehicles from Textron Systems has been developed for complex missions both on land and at sea, and has been proven by more than 700,000 hours of test flights in the harshest environmental conditions, including desert heat and arctic cold,- the UAV manufacturers emphasized. The two-beam Aerosonde Mk 4.8 UAV is designed according to a hybrid scheme with a straight wing, four lifting screws with an electric drive and one screw with a drive from an internal combustion engine of the company -Lycoming-. Maximum take-off weight 93 kg, payload weight 14 kg, flight duration up to 14 hours. This drone is equipped with Hybrid Quadrotor technology that provides vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL), making it independent of traditional runways. Designed specifically to operate in challenging environments and austere areas, Aerosonde HQ offers increased flexibility for military missions with its ability to rapidly deploy and be operated by just two operators, making it easy to transport by UH-60 helicopters or tactical vehicles. The system has a flight endurance of 14 hours and can reach altitudes of more than 15,000 feet (4,572 meters) above sea level. The use of a heavy fuel engine (JP-8) which is widely used in the army for both land and air vehicles in all NATO countries. This simplifies logistics on the ground and reduces the need for additional support equipment. Aerosonde Mk. 4.8 HQ is also designed on the basis of a modular open system approach (MOSA), which allows easy integration of new technologies and innovations, while optimizing needs and avoiding unnecessary costs. This combination of features makes Aerosonde HQ a reliable and adaptable solution for the reconnaissance and surveillance missions required by modern military operations. Specialists of the development company claim that the drone can be deployed and launched in less than 30 minutes of preparatory work. It is capable of carrying electro-optical and infrared (EO/IR) cameras, radar systems and signals intelligence (SIGINT) assets, providing operators with real-time intelligence both day and night. The FTUAS project team will now continue to train Army personnel on the new equipment so they can qualify as instructors and operators at Redstone Test Center on the MK 4.8 HQ Aerosonde system. This training is expected to be completed by early February 2025. The U.S. Army said the FTUAS program will provide brigade combat teams with organic capabilities for intelligence and surveillance operations that will allow them to gather, develop and communicate operational intelligence. This will allow BCT commanders to maintain dominance during multi-domain operations. In the draft budget for 2025 The Pentagon has requested funding in the form of $129 million for the construction of seven FTUAS devices. The start of re-equipment of combat units of the US Army with FTUAS devices is expected in 2026. It is difficult to call FTUAS massive, since one ground forces brigade will have only 20 such devices.

the Russian Federation is dispelling the fake that the Armed Forces of Ukraine en masse catch and ea...	Propaganda resources launched this -information release- in the spirit of Russian fiction: they say that there is a lack of food at the front, so the Armed Forces decided to switch to a four-legged diet. It is clear that for people who believe in a -crucified boy-, -NATO combat mosquitoes- and -biolaboratories in Ukrainian pigeon houses-, such a story sounds quite plausible. However, there is a small problem: there is no shortage of food in Ukraine, the military is provided with rations, and volunteers regularly deliver everything from stew to fresh baked goods to the front. Ukrainian military personnel often rescue animals themselves during the war. The front line is not the best place for defenseless dogs and cats, so they are taken to the rear, given to volunteers or simply taken into care. Each unit has its own -mascot- - a cat, a dog, and sometimes even a crow or a raccoon. Unlike the Russian army, which even steals toilets in the occupied territories, the Ukrainian military is not looking for -alternative sources of protein.- This is a classic scheme of Russian propaganda: to dehumanize the Ukrainian military, to show them as subhuman in order to justify aggression. If Ukrainians -eat dogs- in their imagination, then perhaps they deserve to be -denazified-? This is how the Russian machine of lies works. The next time you hear about -bloody Ukro carnivores-, remember that this is the same propaganda that once talked about the -crucified boy- and -baby organs in jars-. Russian media turned into a cheap circus a long time ago. So don't be surprised if their next -sensational report- is about the fact that Ukrainians feed exclusively on unicorns and ghosts.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/06/rf-rozganyaye-fejk-shho-zsu-masovo-vidlovlyuyut-i-yidyat-bezprytulnyh-sobak/	2025-02-05T20:03:54-08:00
Rustem Umyerov discussed with John Gilly the preparation for the meeting of the Ukraine-NATO Council	About this he told on his Facebook page. -We discussed the current situation at the front and the top defense priorities of Ukraine. Particular attention was paid to the preparation for the meeting of the Ukraine-NATO Council, which will take place in the near future. This is a key format for strengthening our cooperation with allies and coordinating further steps in the field of security,- said the head of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. He also expressed his gratitude to Great Britain for its steadfast support of our country and effective dialogue. -Together we are working to strengthen Ukraine's defense capabilities and security,- added Rustem Umyerov. As reported by ArmyInform, earlier the Minister of Defense of Ukraine spoke about the strengthening of defense cooperation with the Czech Republic in several directions at once.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/05/rustem-umyerov-obgovoryv-z-dzhonom-gili-pidgotovku-do-zasidannya-rady-ukrayina-nato/	2025-02-05T12:08:32-08:00
Military psychologist Serhii Rostikov: -Next to some stories, cinema seems uninteresting-	The story of the fighter was made public on the page of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. In civilian life, he ran a small business and was a public activist. He has economic and technical education, and now he is studying psychology. Completed training courses in Great Britain. He has experience of fixed-term and contract service, in particular in the Ukrainian peacekeeping contingent in Iraq. In the first days of the full-scale invasion, Rostikov, then still a sergeant, returned to the army. -I was a deputy platoon commander, I commanded people, I saw how differently they react to circumstances, and how some need support. At the end of 2022, I was offered to take an officer's course in military psychology, and I immediately agreed. Even in civilian life, I was always interested in psychology, and already during the war I saw from my own experience how its understanding is important for the effective management of a unit,- says Serhiy. The officer considers communication with people to be the most interesting aspect of his work. He says that there are such human stories next to which cinema seems uninteresting. -The strength of spirit of some people is impressive, despite the enormous fatigue and sometimes inhuman workload on the battlefield, they still maintain peace of mind and a sense of humor,- Serhii says. Arriving at positions, a training ground or a medical facility, a psychologist helps soldiers find peace of mind, accept the circumstances of war, and teaches soldiers how to provide psychological first aid to each other. In the Main Department of Psychological Support of the Armed Forces personnel, they carefully study the work of psychologists in the field, generalize best practices and disseminate them among colleagues. But they also see problems and look for ways to solve them. Today, there is a need for qualified military psychologists in the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Civilian psychologists who are called up for military service do not always have experience with combat psychotrauma, which causes them confusion and uncertainty when providing psychological help to military personnel. At the same time, civilian experience and a fresh perspective sometimes become a significant factor in the development of effective changes in the training and work of military psychologists. The main administration introduced advanced training courses on the funds of the Military Institute of Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv, where psychological officers of personnel psychological support structures acquire the necessary knowledge, exchange experience and develop creative ideas in the field of military psychology. In the conditions of the shortage of psychologists in the units, the workload of the psychologist himself and an adequate understanding of his work in the war acquire special meaning. In a subdivision, you can't say, -I'll listen to six, and the others next time.- Sometimes you have to work as much as the circumstances require. Of course, such a load is difficult to compare with constant stay in positions during shelling, however, the work of psychologists in war is quite difficult and exhausting. Stress, like general fatigue, has the ability to accumulate, and many people simply do not know what to do with it all. Stereotypes also add pressure: they say that men should not complain, men should not ask for help, crying is a sign of weakness, and much more. The task of a military psychologist is not only to stabilize the psycho-emotional state of a serviceman, but also to help him find internal and external resources necessary for quality recovery, to find his own purpose of being in the war, to understand the basics of communication with relatives, with the family, etc. Each new day brings new challenges for the military psychologist, and he must be ready for them. For some people, a psychologist is a hidden hope that they will be heard, that they are not alone with their problems, that there is always a way out, even in the most difficult life situations. This is how Serhiy Rostikov sees his work. And people trust him. As reported by ArmyInform, -Viking- is a fighter of the International Legion of the Ground Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, who has been fighting for Ukraine against the Russians for three years occupiers. He went through a difficult battle path, destroying many enemies, and became a true professional in his field.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/05/vijskovyj-psyholog-sergij-rostikov-poruch-z-deyakymy-istoriyamy-kino-zdayetsya-neczikavym/	2025-02-05T11:58:36-08:00
Mountain race: border guards caught a group of people at the border	The State Border Service of Ukraine informs about this on February 5. -However, on the approach to the state border, the group was discovered by the border guard. The UAV operator monitored the movement of violators and coordinated the actions of the border guards,- the statement said. Seeing the border guards, the violators tried to escape, but they failed. The conductor found his way faster than the others and even managed to break away, but not for long. During further work, the officers of the operative and investigative unit learned that residents of the Chernivtsi and Kyiv regions, independently of each other, attacked the organizer of the illegal scheme and paid him 9,000 USD each for transportation to Romania bypassing the checkpoints. -Regarding illegal tourists, protocols have been drawn up according to 2 Art. 204-1 and Art. 185-10 of the Code of Administrative Offenses. Regarding the conductor, a notification was sent to the law enforcement agencies under Article 332 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine. Measures to establish the location of the main organizer of illegal equipment are underway,- the State Security Service of Ukraine said. ArmyInform reminds that it is better not to break the law or risk your life, but to use the aggregator of vacancies in the Armed Forces and recruiting centers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/05/girski-peregony-na-kordoni-prykordonnyky-spijmaly-grupu-osib/	2025-02-05T11:44:21-08:00
Instead of a ball - a machine gun: how -Footballist- changed the football field to the battlefield	The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. On February 9, 2023, Andrii voluntarily joined -Staleva Sotka-. At that time, he already had the experience of military service, so he quickly mastered military affairs. -I had the title of senior soldier since I was drafted. He became a junior sergeant quite quickly, but by no means under pleasant circumstances. When the commander of our department died, I had to take his place and, accordingly, receive the rank of junior sergeant. And in a year, another rank of sergeant,- says Andriy. Despite the offer to become an officer, -Footballist- decided to stay in the post of sergeant. He believes that this gives him more opportunities to communicate with the personnel, transfer his knowledge and combat experience to his comrades. -You need to constantly communicate with the boys, take an interest in their problems and look for ways to solve these problems together,- Andrii shares his method of work. -After all, you can go to the range together in your free time from combat missions and just shoot at targets to your heart's content - in many cases, by the way, this helps to relieve internal tension.- The -Footballist- considers trust in fellow players to be the main factor of success in battle. -If you are sure that there is a person standing next to you shoulder to shoulder who will always help, always cover, and if necessary, even take you off the battlefield, your confidence increases many times,- he says. His wife and five-year-old son are waiting for Andrii at home. -With my wife and son, we really like to go on vacation, especially to the Carpathians. But to such places, where there are not many people, - says -Footballist-. — Currently, my family is more than a thousand kilometers away from me. Of course, we miss each other terribly and dream of the time when we will be together again and have the opportunity to go to our beloved Carpathians at any moment!- As reported by ArmyInform, -Viking- is a fighter of the International Legion of the Ground Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, who has been fighting for Ukraine against the Russians for three years occupiers.

10 years behind bars: the court sentenced a collaborator from Kozachai Lopan	The Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office informs about this. The court found him guilty of collaborative activity (Part 5 of Article 111-1 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine) for maintaining a public accusation by the prosecutors of the Dergachy District Prosecutor's Office of the Kharkiv Region. He was sentenced to 10 years of imprisonment with deprivation of the right to hold certain positions in state authorities and/or local self-government bodies or bodies that provide public services, including positions related to the performance of organizational-managerial and administrative-economic functions, for a period of 15 years with confiscation of property. A man who was born in the Smolensk region of the Russian Federation, but long ago moved to the village of Kozacha Lopan, where he was engaged in entrepreneurial activities, during the capture of the settlement by the armed forces of the Russian Federation, deliberately chose for himself the path of cooperation with the enemy. Having assumed the position of -deputy head of the Kharkiv Oblast Central Committee-, he, on the instructions of representatives of the Russian Federation, dealt with -issues of economy and finance-, and also carried out -supervision- of the movement of people in the temporarily occupied territory, issuing -passes for movement-. By abusing his authority, the collaborator did not issue exit permits to persons who did not support the actions of the Russian Federation and those who planned to leave for the territory of Ukraine. The suspect walked around the village in a Russian military uniform and with a weapon. Before the deoccupation of the settlement by the Armed Forces of Ukraine, he fled to the Russian Federation. Court proceedings in criminal proceedings were conducted in the absence of the accused (in absentia). Since the convicted person is hiding from Ukrainian justice on the territory of the Russian Federation, the term of his sentence will begin to be calculated from the moment of actual detention. As long as he avoids serving the sentence imposed by the court, the statute of limitations is suspended. The convict is wanted. The indictment was handed down by the Dergachy District Court of the Kharkiv Region. The period for an appeal continues. As reported by ArmyInform, when the full-scale invasion began, Georgiy, a retired, reservist, did not hesitate. not a minute. He immediately applied for service in the Steel Border border brigade and returned to the fight for Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/05/10-rokiv-za-gratamy-sud-vynis-vyrok-kolaborantu-z-kozachoyi-lopani/	2025-02-05T10:24:50-08:00
Harmful idiots - almost half a thousand arsonists and terrorists of the Russian special services hav...	reported this on February 5 First Deputy Head of the SBU Serhiy Andrushchenko during a joint briefing with the Chief of the National Police Ivan Vyhivskyi. The Security Service of Ukraine, together with the National Police, identified 497 people who set fire to the cars of military personnel, the facilities of Ukrzaliznytsia, and also planted homemade explosives, arranging terrorist attacks with encroachment on the lives of military personnel and policemen. -The arrest of criminals by the Security Service and the National Police is literally -on hot pursuit- 24/7. And currently there is not a single case when we did not find an executor. In particular, starting from 2024 and as of today, the Security Service together with the National Police has already identified 497 people who committed such crimes,- said Serhiy Andrushchenko. The Security Service of Ukraine reports that it is doing everything to work ahead of time and counter the intelligence and subversive activities of the special services of the Russian Federation, which have recently intensified attempts to arrange sabotage and terrorist attacks near and in the buildings of the TCC. -We understand that the enemy does not choose these objects by chance. After all, the war continues not only at the front. The SBU destroys the enemy not only on the front lines, but also in the rear - we expose enemy agents and traitors inside our country,- noted Serhiy Andrushchenko. According to him, the Russian special services are trying to destabilize the situation with terrorist acts against the military, in particular, to discredit the activities of the TCC, disrupt mobilization, sow citizens' distrust of the Defense Forces, etc. As ArmiyaInform reported, the Russian special services began airdropping their terrorists.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/05/shkidlyvi-idioty-zatrymano-majzhe-piv-tysyachi-pidpalyuvachiv-ta-terorystiv-rosijskyh-speczsluzhb/	2025-02-05T10:06:45-08:00
Ground forces became the best in implementing electronic reports in the Army+ application	They reported about this on Wednesday, February 5. As you note, according to the results of the month, 100 units of this type of troops submitted and processed at least one report through the application for the first time. At the same time, 100% of military units process reports in Army+ in the -West- Operational Command. -Ground forces began to use electronic reports more often and more actively. Every day their number only increases. This is certainly pleasing and is proof that Army+ was the right and necessary step that moves away from paper and inconvenient and closer to digital and understandable,- said Kateryna Chernogorenko, Deputy Minister of Defense for Digitalization.

According to the investigation, the man, on the instructions of the Russian special services, set fire to the relay cabinets of the signaling, centralization and blocking systems of Ukrzaliznytsia in Kharkiv.

It is known that he is already being prosecuted in Odesa for selling narcotics and was serving a sentence for attempted murder and robbery. Russian special services recruited him through an ad on a job search website. For one arson, a man received about 9 thousand hryvnias.

Recruited and killed — the Russian special services began airdropping their terrorists	reported this on February 5 First Deputy Head of the SBU Serhii Andrushchenko during a joint briefing with the Chief of the National Police Ivan Vyhivskyi. In this way, the Russians actually liquidate the perpetrator of -darkness- in order to remove the witness of the crime and not pay him the promised money. -Russian special services simply use these people for their purposes as consumables. The FSB officer doesn't care what happens to them after the task is completed,- Serhiy Andrushchenko remarked. He said that the executors of the special services of the Russian Federation are recruited through instant messengers and online communities for making quick money. Young people or the unemployed often agree to cooperate, to whom curators will later inform the location for committing a terrorist attack and the storage location of an improvised explosive device prepared by another group of agents. -We establish the entire chain: from recruitment to preparation of the crime. As a rule, we work on prejudice — we detain criminals when they take explosives out of a cache,- Serhiy Andrushchenko said. He emphasized that blowing up buildings of the TCC and other objects are serious crimes, which the Criminal Code of Ukraine classifies as a terrorist act. They are subject to strict criminal liability — 15 years in prison or life imprisonment.

Vacation, benefits, legal aid: what the state guarantees to those who have been released from captiv...	ArmyInform tells what rights and opportunities those who have gone through captivity have. Servicemen released from captivity may resign from service. This is provided by Art. 26 of the Law of Ukraine -On Military Duty and Military Service-, amendments to which entered into force on May 18 of this year. At the same time, it does not matter when exactly the serviceman was released from captivity. If a serviceman decides to use the right to discharge, he can also count on upon dismissal. It is 50 percent of the monthly allowance for each full calendar year of service. If a serviceman who has returned from captivity wishes to continue his service, he has the right to 90 days holidays. Such leave is not divided into parts, and during it the allowance continues to be accrued. Such leave can be revoked only with the consent of the serviceman. Those released from captivity are entitled to one-time assistance of 100,000 hryvnias. This applies to both civilians and military personnel. It also provides for the payment of anannualfinancial aid for those who were in captivity. This is 100,000 hryvnias for each year of detention. How to get? In order to calculate such payments, it is necessary to establish the fact of deprivation of liberty as a result of armed aggression against Ukraine. The establishment of this fact is handled by a special commission under the Ministry of Reintegration of Temporarily Occupied Territories. One of the mandatory documents that must be provided to the commission is a certificate of being in captivity. It can be obtained from the National Information Bureau. The request should be sent to the e-mail of the bureau: info@nib.gov.ua Citizens released from captivity have the right to legal assistance. And given all the bureaucratic factors that exist in our country, such help will definitely not be superfluous.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/05/vidpustka-vyplaty-pravova-dopomoga-shho-derzhava-garantuye-tym-hto-zvilnyvsya-z-polonu/	2025-02-05T06:48:22-08:00
Putin is gathering an army of children: the youth army was subordinated to the Ministry of Attack of...	The Minister of Culture and Strategic Communications of Ukraine Mykola Tochytskyi said about this. -Children will be trained to organize aid to the Russian army, and in the future, to participate in hostilities against Ukraine. On February 3, the Russian president signed a decree strengthening the activities of the Soviet totalitarian remnant called Dosaaf, fully subordinating the organization to his -Ministry of Attack of the Russian Federation-. This is not an ordinary document, but part of the global Russian plan to carry out assimilative genocide of Ukraine and the Ukrainian nation,- the Minister states. Our colleagues from the Center for Journalistic Investigation have drawn attention to the report of the occupying -Ministry of Youth Policy- on the TOT of the Zaporizhia region, in which they boast that they have attracted about 1,000 children to the so-called -youth army-. -The founder of the -junarmy- is the already mentioned -dosaaf-, which was administratively strengthened by Putin's decree. Thus, the program of indoctrinating children into the beliefs of the -Pobedobesiya- sect is a consistently planned Russian policy,- Mykola Tochytskyi emphasizes. ArmyInform reported that due to the Russian propaganda processing in the occupied territories, at least 1.5 million Ukrainian children. -By indoctrinating Ukrainian children in the occupied territories, instilling in them hatred of Ukraine and its people, Putin and his clique are carrying out an assimilative genocide of the Ukrainian nation. We demand that the Russian authorities immediately stop this criminal practice and appeal to the Ukrainian media, public organizations and our foreign partners to pay attention to Russia's war crimes and to take measures to document these activities so that the perpetrators will sooner or later suffer the deserved punishment,- wrote the Minister of Culture and Strategic Communications of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/05/putin-zbyraye-armiyu-ditej-yunarmiyu-pidporyadkuvaly-ministerstvu-napadu-rf/	2025-02-05T06:33:38-08:00

We are dealing with a Russian agency and a targeted destabilizing campaign: an expert on explosions ...	This was told to ArmiyaInform by an expert of the non-governmental analytical center -Ukrainian Studies of Strategic Studies-, a candidate of political sciences and a military serviceman of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Yury Oliynyk. -We are dealing with a clear action of Russian agents and a targeted campaign aimed at discrediting the mobilization in Ukraine and inciting a civil conflict between civilians and the military,- says Yurii Oliynyk. According to him, the explosions are part of a long-term plan that has been in place for several years. -At first, there was informational incitement - the spread of manipulations, fakes about the brutality of TCC employees, their demonization, then - the inciting of enmity between the -evaders- and the military. And now the moment was prepared to demonstrate the supposed civil confrontation. All these explosions in Rivne, Pavlohrad, and Kamianets-Podilskyi had been prepared for a long time. Agents were waiting for the right time to implement them, so that they entered a single information wave. The trigger for this was the events in Poltava - the tragedy when a serviceman died,- the expert noted. Yurii Oliynyk believes that these explosions have one signature and are aimed at inciting hysteria, further demonstrating that the population of Ukraine is allegedly opposing the army, and creating informational chaos. As ArmyInform reported, Russian special services use Ukrainian teenagers and ill-informed youth who crave easy money to carry out sabotage, ultimately eliminating them as extra witnesses. -Recruited saboteurs are simply used and thrown away by the Russians. The Security Service of the Russian Federation and the FSB of the Russian Federation promise money to saboteurs against the military in Ukraine, but they fool the perpetrators of the crimes, do not pay them, and also do not inform the perpetrators that they often plan to activate the explosives they carry, even while the terrorists are performing the task Russian curators,- explains the head of the Center for countering disinformation of the NSDC, Lieutenant Andriy Kovalenko.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/05/mayemo-spravu-z-rosagenturoyu-ta-czilespryamovanoyu-destabilizuyuchoyu-kampaniyeyu-ekspert-pro-vybuhy-v-tczk/	2025-02-05T06:23:51-08:00

He overpaid UAH 12 million for fuel tanks: the commander of the military unit will be tried	This is reported by the State Bureau of Investigation. It is noted that three participants applied for the tender announced by the military for the purchase of fuel tanks.

Charter drones: how the eyes of the Ukrainian army work	The video of the combat operation of the calculation of Ukrainian drones was made public on the channel of the 13th Brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine -Charter-. The drones of the -Charter- brigade perform a mission that the military themselves call -the eyes of the unit.- They transmit real-time images from places where an ordinary soldier cannot reach. This allows receiving critical information about the movement of enemy equipment and manpower. -We convey the picture, show what is not visible from the ground,- the fighters say. They fly around the clock - 24/7, regardless of weather conditions, although even fog can be a serious obstacle to sightings. Operators not only find targets, but also coordinate their destruction. If the drone detects the movement of enemy infantry or equipment, the decision to strike is made literally in a few minutes. If stationary shelters are found, such as dugouts or basements, they can be destroyed by artillery. Russian troops are actively trying to fight Ukrainian UAVs. They use anti-drone guns and electronic warfare devices, try to shoot down or intercept FPV drones. However, Ukrainian operators are also improving their tactics and skills, reducing the risk of equipment losses. -This is a kind of drone-on-drone, bash-on-bash battle,- says the military, explaining that their advantage lies in the speed of response and the accuracy of strikes. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the 13th operational brigade of NSU -Charter- destroyed 15 Russian invaders as well as an ammunition depot, a cannon, and an enemy shelter.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/05/dronari-hartiyi-yak-praczyuyut-ochi-ukrayinskoyi-armiyi/	2025-02-05T04:51:56-08:00

Explosions in the TCC: the Russian special services fool the performers and blow them up themselves ...	This is against the background of undermining of TCC in Rivne, Pavlograd and Kamianets-Podilskyi told the head of the Center for countering disinformation of the NSDC, lieutenant Andrii Kovalenko. According to him, Russian curators promise recruited performers -easy money-, assuring them that they will only be couriers, and then -they just use and throw away-. -GRU of the Russian Federation and the FSB of the Russian Federation promise money to saboteurs against the military in Ukraine, but they fool the perpetrators of crimes, do not pay them, and also do not inform the perpetrators that they often plan to activate the explosives they carry, even while the terrorists are performing the tasks of Russian curators,- he explained Andriy Kovalenko. As ArmiyaInform reported, on Wednesday, February 5, an explosion rang out in the premises of the TCC in Kamyanc-Podilskyi, as a result in which one person died and several others were injured.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/05/vybuhy-u-tczk-speczsluzhby-rf-duryat-vykonavcziv-i-sami-zh-yih-pidryvayut-czpd-rnbo/	2025-02-05T04:36:50-08:00
-Family circumstances- - candid stories of border guards who voluntarily returned from the North-Wes...	Their candid stories were published on Wednesday, February 5, by the State Border Guard Service. So, a fighter of the -Revenge- brigade Maksym under the pseudonym -Suyeta- voluntarily returned to the service after 9 months of military service. -Last year in March, he took part in battles in the Swativ direction, was an anti-drone gun operator. Within a month, his mother fell ill, constant relocations and seven years of service also affected him - Maksym voluntarily left the military unit. However, after solving family problems, he returned — he took advantage of the law, which gives the opportunity to resume his service,- said the DPSU. According to Maksym, in his case, the cause of SZH was a moral and psychological condition. Alexander has a similar story, who volunteered for service with two minor children and a disabled wife, and then left the military unit to help his family. -I asked myself. I went to the Military Commissariat and asked to volunteer. It was in 2023&#8230; I have family circumstances. A disabled woman of the second group, two minor children&#8230; The garden is very big there, someone had to cultivate it,- the man explains. For his part, the head of the legal support department of the -Revenge- brigade, Justice Major Andriy Bakrev, reminds that, according to the law of Ukraine, for military personnel who went to the SZH, there is an opportunity to resume service until March 1, 2025 and avoid criminal liability. -This opportunity is available to those servicemen who voluntarily left the military unit before November 29, 2024. Those who do not take advantage of the law face imprisonment for 5 to 10 years. Returning to the military unit voluntarily is the best way out of the situation. You will be able to return to the service and avoid criminal liability,- the DPSU notes. As reported by ArmyInform, the Main Directorate of Communications of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said, how to quickly return to service after voluntarily leaving the unit without criminal responsibility.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/05/simejni-obstavyny-vidverti-istoriyi-prykordonnykiv-yaki-dobrovilno-povernulysya-z-szch/	2025-02-05T04:22:18-08:00
Street fights and -bandzai-attacks-: how the battle for Chasiv Yar and Toretsk continues	Dmytro Zaporozhets, the spokesman of OTU -Luhansk-, told about this on the air -Suspilne Novosti-. According to him, most of the fighting in Toretsk currently has the character of street fights. -The fighting is taking place mainly in the central part of the city, as well as in the mining areas,- the spokesman said. He emphasized that the Ukrainian defenders were able to hold their positions thanks to the prepared fortifications, but the number of enemy attacks increased significantly. -Relative to December 2024, the number of assaults in the Toretsk direction increased by 30%, and in the Chasovoy Yar direction - by 97%,- Dmytro Zaporozhets reported. At a time when Ukrainian society expected changes in the international arena, Russian troops, on the contrary, increased the pressure. The situation is similar in the city of Chasiv Yar. The enemy became more active in the north of the city, trying to break into the central part, in particular in the area of ​​the -Avangard- stadium. -The adversary is actively deploying smoke screens and using drones to guide units into relatively unscathed buildings to continue the assault,- the spokesman explained. According to him, it is becoming more and more difficult for the defenders of Ukraine to find suitable positions for effective defense. -Unfortunately, both in Toretsk and in Chasovoy Yar, there are few options for building a stable line of defense. At the same time, the enemy is constantly moving from shelter to shelter, which makes it difficult to destroy him,- the spokesman added. Zaporozhets also drew attention to the change in tactics of the occupiers. If earlier they tried to break through the flanks, now they are forced to carry out frontal attacks. -Both in Toretsk and Chasovoy Yar, the fighting is mainly in the central part of the cities,- he said. In the Seversky direction, the enemy somewhat reduced the activity of assault operations, probably due to the need to regroup. -The enemy is most likely preparing for a new wave of attacks. According to intelligence data, the movement of the command staff of the 3rd Army was recorded in this direction,- Dmytro Zaporozhets reported. Despite the difficult weather conditions, the enemy continues to use maneuvering equipment. -Mud does not stop the enemy. They rarely use armored vehicles, instead they actively use ATVs and motorcycles,- the spokesman said. He also said that the Russian military is carrying out desperate -banzai attacks- using civilian vehicles converted to transport infantry. -We watched how the enemy used cars to break into our positions at high speed. However, thanks to the effective actions of the defenders, one of these vehicles blew up on a mine, and the enemy infantry was forced to hurry, after which part of this infantry was destroyed by FPV drones, and one occupant decided to commit suicide, probably because of the fear of being hit by a UAV,- the spokesman said. As reported by ArmyInform, fierce fighting continues on the front line Chasovo Yar. The Russian occupiers changed the assault tactics in Chasovoy Yar, trying to deliver their stormtroopers to Ukrainian positions as quickly as possible. Now, instead of foot attacks, they mass attack infantry on armored vehicles to reduce movement time.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/05/vulychni-boyi-ta-bandzaj-ataky-yak-tryvaye-bytva-za-chasiv-yar-i-toreczk/	2025-02-05T04:11:25-08:00

A Swedish soldier on Ukrainian soil: the story of a fighter of the International Legion	The story of the soldier was made public on the page of the Land Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. This serviceman is from Sweden. Before the full-scale invasion, he had no military experience, working as a cashier and security guard in a store. However, when the great war began, -Viking- decided that his place was next to the Ukrainian people in the fight against the aggressor. -It was natural for me, since two branches of my family equally dislike Russia because of the war in Spain during the Franco period and because of the war in Finland. I understood the actions of the Russians in Ukraine through my own history,- explains the legionnaire. -Viking- began his combat career as a machine gunner, and later moved to reconnaissance units, where he further honed his skills. He took part in fierce battles in the Kharkiv region and Luhansk region, in particular in the Kupyansk region, in Klishchiivka and Petropavlivka. According to him, he had to meet with various units of the enemy - from the -Wagnerians- to paratroopers and special forces. One of Viking's most vivid memories is the mission during which he was wounded. Then he and two other fighters cleared a difficult landing, being under active fire from FPV drones. The clearing was carried out successfully, but during the advance to the enemy trench they were covered by tank fire. -Viking- received a wound in the left hand, but, fortunately, everything went well. Currently, -Viking- is a specialist in the use of FPV drones. He uses his skills and experience to deliver precise strikes on the enemy and help his comrades on the battlefield. -russia is still here. And as long as she's here, until we win the war or I die, I will fight!- - declares the Swedish warrior. -Viking- is an example of courage, dedication and true patriotism. He is one of those who did not stand aside when war came to Ukrainian land. As ArmiyaInform reported, a machine gunner with the call sign -Yankee- is fighting in the 33rd separate mechanized brigade in the Zaporizhzhia direction. He went through a difficult path from a recruit to an experienced commander who skillfully leads his platoon and destroys the enemy.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/05/shvedskyj-voyin-na-ukrayinskij-zemli-istoriya-bijczya-internaczionalnogo-legionu/	2025-02-05T02:51:54-08:00

The Underrated Helper: Why a Weapon Light is a Vital Item in a Special Ops Gear	This is stated in the publication on page 73 of the special-purpose maritime center named after Kosh chieftain Antin Holovaty. According to the fighter with the call sign -Festival-, their unit uses two types of lights: full-fledged lights and built into sighting units. The latter usually have an infrared (IR) spectrum and are intended for use with night vision devices (NVR). -IR lights are used exclusively with PNB. In conditions of complete darkness, these lights provide active illumination of targets,- notes -Festival-. Important characteristics of the flashlight are its compactness, lightness, compatibility with weapons, resistance to shocks and drops, as well as convenient controls that prevent accidental activation. 73 Center fighters receive weapons with standard Inforce lights that have both visible and IR modes of operation, as well as SureFire sighting units with a laser pointer and a plain white light. -I install the light on the right side because I'm right-handed. A flashlight on the left side would interfere with the grip and worsen weapon control. And when carrying a weapon on a belt, the flashlight does not create discomfort and does not cling to the equipment. I use a remote control button placed on top of the fishing rod, which allows you to conveniently control the light with both the right and left hand,- shares -Festival-. Lanterns are especially useful during urban combat. In Bahmut, they helped assess the state of buildings, look for temporary shelters and positions. -During the evacuation of the groups, the IR flashlight marked positions for the vehicles, which significantly reduced the contact time and made it possible to get to the evacuation point without making a mistake,- says the soldier. Weapon lights are mandatory for special forces, because in a complex with PNB, they give a technological advantage and increase the efficiency of operators. Stormtroopers fighting at close range also need lights to quickly assess the terrain, spot the enemy, and save time. At the same time, for infantry, lanterns are not a primary necessity. Their weapons often do not include a lantern, and fighting takes place in open terrain where a lantern can only unmask a position. As reported by ArmiyaInform, the soldiers of the 73rd Naval Special Purpose Center, who perform extremely difficult tasks, need reliable and effective weapons. The senior operator of the center with the call sign -Den- talked about his choice of an assault rifle and shared the secrets of its care.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/05/nedooczinenyj-pomichnyk-chomu-lihtar-na-zbroyi-zhyttyevo-vazhlyvyj-element-sporyadzhennya-speczpryznachenczya/	2025-02-05T02:28:25-08:00

A new enemy tactic in the Temporal Ravine: armored stormtroopers go for the kill	Ivan Petrychak, a representative of the 24th separate mechanized brigade named after King Danylo, told about this on the telethon -Yedini Novyny-. According to him, the enemy has somewhat changed its tactics. If earlier the occupiers advanced in small groups, now the Russian command tries to save time and sends assault units directly on armored vehicles. -The enemy wants to save time and throws enemy groups with a large amount of BMD, that is, on armor,- explains Ivan Petrychak. In one of the battles, a Ukrainian tank destroyed a Russian BMD-4 from a distance of only 30 meters. This once again confirms that tanks play a key role in deterring enemy attacks. The enemy also uses mixed tactics: after disembarking from armored vehicles, the Russian infantry disperses, tries to gain a foothold in the basements of buildings and among the ruins, and then regroups for new attacks. In this direction, the presence of the -Akhmat- unit, which is fighting side by side with the 98th airborne division of the Russian Federation, was recorded. However, there are reasons to believe that some of the Kadirov soldiers still perform the functions of blocking units, controlling defectors among the Russian military. -According to our data, they are fighting, but the question is different - how do they motivate the Russian infantry? Captured occupiers say that for refusing to go into battle they can be thrown into a pit, beaten or simply not paid,- Ivan Petrychak notes. Financial payments and the possibility of avoiding criminal punishment remain the main factors that force Russians to fight. Despite heavy losses, the occupiers do not stop their assaults. They operate according to the principle of scorched earth: if they cannot advance with infantry, they destroy everything in front of them with aircraft, artillery and drones. -The enemy destroys possible areas where our soldiers can hold their defense, and then again throws waves of infantry into the attack,- explains the representative of the brigade's press service. The Ukrainian military continues to heroically defend itself, despite the colossal number of attacks. Chasiv Yar is not only a strategic point on the map, but also a symbol of the resilience of our soldiers, who prove every day that the enemy will not be able to win an easy victory. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the 24th separate mechanized brigade named after King Danylo are heroically defending Chasiv Yar, repelling constant attacks of Russian invaders, in particular detachments -Ahmat-. Soldiers hold their positions daily and inflict heavy casualties on the enemy.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/05/nova-taktyka-voroga-v-chasovomu-yaru-shturmovyky-na-broni-jdut-na-zabij/	2025-02-05T01:34:18-08:00
The law enforcement officers detained the suspects in carrying out the terrorist act in Pavlograd	The Prosecutor General's Office informs about this. According to the investigation, a resident of Pavlograd, fulfilling the tasks and instructions of a representative of the special services of the Russian Federation, made an improvised explosive device and left it in a designated place. After some time, two Odessans who were also recruited by the special services of the Russian Federation arrived in the city. They took this explosive device and moved it to the building of the Pavlograd RTCC and SP. There, the suspects set off the explosives. During the terrorist attack, they recorded everything on video in order to report to their supervisors. In addition, it was established that the suspects were preparing to commit a terrorist act in another location. The suspects cooperated with the aggressor in order to make quick money. The police detained the suspects. Currently, the question of choosing preventive measures for them is being decided. As reported by ArmyInform, a former fitness trainer from Poltava was found guilty of obstructing the legitimate activities of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and others military formations, intentional infliction of physical injuries on a law enforcement officer, production and distribution of materials containing insults to the honor and dignity of military personnel, denial of armed aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/05/pravoohoronczi-zatrymaly-pidozryuvanyh-u-zdijsnenni-terorystychnogo-aktu-v-pavlogradi/	2025-02-05T01:16:30-08:00

Zaporizhia rock and roll: how -Yankee- and his Browning make the occupiers dance	The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. -Yankee- did not immediately get to the front. At first, he applied to the TCC, passed the VLK, but due to the large number of people willing to fight, he had to wait a little. When it was his turn, he joined the 33rd brigade, the machine gun platoon. Prior to that, -Yankee- served under the draft in the State Special Service of Transport, where he had no weapons, but only a shovel and a crowbar. So I was pleasantly surprised by the number of Western weapons in the brigade. He worked his way up from a service number to a unit commander, and after the battles near Robotyny, he became the chief sergeant of a machine gun platoon, acting as a commander. Now he is training recruits for his platoon. The Yankee's signature weapon is the Browning machine gun. He met him while studying at -Desna-. -I liked that he was really knocking. They shot at 900 m and pierced the BMP beautifully. The thing is good, the thing is accurate. The whole platoon fell in love with her,- says -Yankee-. In the Zaporizhzhia direction, when the enemy infantry entered the forest strip, the -Yankee- simply deployed a Browning, put two boxes there - and the enemy retreated with a screech. Five soldiers of his unit were awarded Golden Crosses. -My platoon commander even worked on a dance floor. It was beautiful, it was effective! And no one even wanted to get out of that dance. One occupier's hand was torn off by a bullet. That's all, there was no further movement!- - recalls -Yankee-. Browning pierces the armor of a -one- or -two- with their -grills- at 900-1000 m with an ordinary armor-piercing incendiary bullet. -Nothing compares to a large-caliber machine gun. And the sound, and the speed, and the shooting itself is just a thrill!- - says -Yankee-. Once -Yankee- evacuated his platoon leader with two broken legs from a difficult place by ATV. -Now we communicate every day. The most pleasant thing is when the people you pulled out of positions, brought out, brought out, say hello, -says -Yankee-. As reported by ArmyInform, Sergeant of the Air Force Yevhen Pogozhih knows what a real risk is. In the Kharkiv direction, under heavy fire from the enemy, he carried out a wounded comrade from being hit by an enemy FPV drone, despite mortar fire and a fatal danger	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/05/zaporizkyj-rok-n-rol-yak-yanki-ta-jogo-browning-zmushuyut-okupantiv-tanczyuvaty/	2025-02-05T01:02:18-08:00
-Claster4Defence-: Ukraine joins forces to develop military innovations	The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine informs about this. This event was aimed at establishing cooperation between the Ukrainian military and manufacturers of dual-purpose goods. It was attended by representatives of the Ukrainian army, government, business, international organizations from the EU and NATO, as well as directly by manufacturers of dual-purpose goods in the field of robotics, automation, IT and other key areas. The -Cluster4Defence- initiative is a Ukrainian cluster alliance that includes 40 clusters, among which more than 10 are directly related to the production of dual-purpose technologies. It brings together both large and small enterprises that can freely exchange experience and provide support in building production capacity, substituting the import of complex components from third countries and providing access to new markets. Program coordinator of the Office of Defense Innovation of the European Union in Ukraine, Martin Joesaar, expressed support and readiness for cooperation with the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The office is focused on identifying the necessary directions for helping the Ukrainian military in the field of innovation. The Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Colonel Andriy Lebedenko, thanked Western partners and domestic manufacturers for effective cooperation in the development and production of the latest weapons and emphasized the need to increase joint capabilities in this direction. He shared the successful experience of using already effectively working projects within the Ukrainian army, such as -Army+-, -Iron Range-, -MedEvac- and -On Contact-. These programs help reduce the number of bureaucratic processes within the army and provide Ukrainian servicemen and partners with modern, convenient and transparent access to the necessary services. This event was an important step on the way to developing military innovations in Ukraine and strengthening the country's defense capabilities. As reported by ArmyInform, an international conference -Act in Cryse- was held in Jurmala, Latvia, dedicated to strategic and crisis communications.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/05/claster4defence-ukrayina-obyednuye-zusyllya-dlya-rozvytku-vijskovyh-innovaczij/	2025-02-05T00:54:06-08:00

Defense forces on the Siverskyi direction: every meter is a struggle	Stepan Barna, the commander of the Barni unit of the 10th separate mountain assault brigade -Edelweiss-, told about this on the air of -Suspilne Novosti-. According to him, the Russian troops are striving -from trench to trench- to break through the defense line and gain a foothold in new positions. This is accompanied by almost continuous artillery fire. -Artillery works almost 24 hours a day,- the soldier said. Unlike other areas of the front, where the occupiers try to avoid night attacks, in the Northern Region they fight both during the day and at night. -The enemy is trying to storm around the clock - morning, afternoon, dusk, evening,- Stepan Barna stressed. The Russians focused special attention on the positions of Ukrainian drone operators, trying to suppress their activity with the help of artillery and airdrops. Voiskovy noted that the situation forces our defenders to act flexibly and constantly change positions: -There should be many positions. It is a vital necessity.- Stepan Barna emphasized that the most important task for Ukrainian soldiers now is to -dig, dig, dig-, because well-prepared trenches and dugouts save lives and help withstand the onslaught of the enemy. As for weather conditions, precipitation can make it difficult to use unmanned systems, but currently the situation is favorable: -Now there is minimal precipitation, so the weather helps the operation of our drones.- The military also confirmed that the occupiers have significant reserves and can quickly pull them up: -There were cases when the enemy concentrated a large number of personnel and equipment in a matter of hours, after which the assault immediately began.- Despite the difficult situation, the Ukrainian defenders continue to hold the defense and inflict losses on the enemy. The Seversky direction remains one of the hot spots of the front, where the struggle continues continuously. As reported by ArmyInform, in general during the past day 85 combat encounters.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/05/syly-oborony-na-siverskomu-napryamku-kozhen-metr-cze-borotba/	2025-02-05T00:31:51-08:00
The coalition of states defined the legal basis for the creation of a special tribunal regarding Rus...	This is reported by the President's Office. They also identified the most important elements of the draft Schuman statute, the main legal document that will regulate the tribunal's activities. The Ukrainian delegation at the meeting was headed by the deputy head of the Office of the President Iryna Mudra. -This applies not only to Ukraine. It's about global justice and the message we're sending to the world. That's why we want the special tribunal to be successful, and that's why we ask those who are interested in saving the world order to join us in the cause of justice,- said Iryna Mudra. According to her, the launch of the tribunal will prove that Ukrainians are serious about ensuring peace and international law, that the perpetrators of the crime of aggression will be punished, and justice will be restored. Once operational, the tribunal will have the power to prosecute Russian political and military leaders who bear the ultimate responsibility for the crime of aggression. -When Russia decided to violate the borders of Ukraine, disregarding the UN Charter, it committed one of the most serious international crimes - the crime of aggression. Now justice is coming. Justice for Ukraine. We have laid the legal foundations for the creation of a special tribunal,- said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. The Secretary General of the Council of Europe, Alain Berse, called the results of today's meeting progress, which will also be felt by the next generations of Ukrainians. -Creating a special tribunal on the crime of aggression against Ukraine within the Council of Europe will enable our international partners, in particular Ukraine and the European Union, to fully use our experience and knowledge in the protection of human rights and the rule of law around the world,- Alain Berse added. As reported by ArmyInform, the European Union and member states have provided support to Ukraine in the amount of 134 billion euros since the beginning of the large-scale invasion of the Russian Federation	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/05/koalicziya-derzhav-vyznachyla-pravovi-osnovy-dlya-stvorennya-specztrybunalu-shhodo-rosijskoyi-agresiyi/	2025-02-05T00:12:17-08:00

Ministry of Defense: robotic units are being deployed in combat brigades of the Armed Forces	reported this by the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Rustem Umyerov. Ukraine is increasing the production of these systems and deploying full-fledged robotic units as part of the combat brigades of the Armed Forces on the front line. This project is based on the experience of tests that have taken place since the summer of 2024 in cooperation with military personnel. Unmanned ground systems have proven their ability to perform a number of combat tasks: -For the creation of robotic units, the experience of brigades that use such systems on the battlefield is taken into account,- Rustem Umyerov noted. It is extremely important that the main suppliers of ground robotic complexes are leading domestic companies. Ukrainian manufacturers have adapted their products to the conditions of modern warfare and the recommendations of combat units of the Defense Forces. -We continue to transform the Armed Forces of Ukraine into a modern army that has a technological advantage over the enemy. Our goal is to create an army where innovative technologies help perform the most dangerous tasks, saving the lives of our defenders,- the Minister of Defense of Ukraine emphasized. As reported by ArmyInform, the Ministry of Defense codified and approved for use in units of the Defense Forces a line of Gimli ground robotic systems.

One dead to two wounded: Volodymyr Zelenskyi named the losses of the Russian army in Ukraine	President Volodymyr Zelenskyi said this in an interview with journalist Piers Morgan. -These are approximate numbers. The casualty ratio is one dead to two wounded because their field medicine is weaker. They often leave their wounded soldiers on the battlefield,- Volodymyr Zelenskyi said. The head of state added that despite these losses, Russia is not ready to end this war. -They don't want peace. Next time, they will say that they are ready for direct negotiations with President Trump. They will say that Ukraine is not needed, that it is a global war between Russia and NATO, and that they will negotiate only with the USA. But this is just another reason to continue the war. Putin's only goal is for Ukraine to cease to exist,- Volodymyr Zelenskyi said. As reported by ArmiyaInform, in January 2024 the -I want to find- project, created by the Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War, recorded a record number of appeals from families of Russian servicemen who went missing in Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/05/odyn-zagyblyj-do-dvoh-poranenyh-volodymyr-zelenskyj-nazvav-vtraty-rosijskoyi-armiyi-v-ukrayini/	2025-02-04T23:34:21-08:00
Novopavlovsk direction: the Russians storm - on buggies - but finish in black bags	Lieutenant Colonel Vitaly Milovidov, head of the information and communication service of the 15th brigade of the Kara-Dag NSU, told about this on the Suspilny broadcast. — In the area of ​​responsibility of the units, the night passed relatively stably, as the enemy makes fewer assault attempts in the dark, he noted. - However, the attacks have continued since the morning, accompanied by intense artillery fire. According to him, the enemy's tactics remain unchanged: he continues to use small assault groups, trying to compensate for losses with a large number of personnel. -On the main lines of attack, the enemy has pulled up additional reserves that ensure the advance of these groups,- the military officer explained. — Despite the loss, the occupiers continue their offensive, because the constant replenishment of manpower allows them to maintain the pace of attacks. The situation in the area of ​​Dachny remains extremely tense. According to the representative of the National Guard, in addition to infantry attacks, the enemy is actively using airstrikes, guided bombs and artillery. -The enemy uses the entire range of reconnaissance drones, trying to inflict maximum losses on our positions and equipment,- Milovidov emphasized. An increase in enemy activity near the Zaporozhye-Kurakhove highway is also recorded. According to the Ukrainian military, Russian forces are making maximum efforts to cut off key logistical supply routes. -The enemy wants to make it impossible to provide quality support to our units defending in this area,- Milovidov explained. Ukrainian defenders inflict significant losses on the enemy's manpower every day. -On average, the enemy loses up to a platoon of personnel every day, and sometimes more,- said a representative of the National Guard. As for armored vehicles, their use in the direction is limited. -The enemy rarely uses heavy equipment, but periodically uses buggies and motorcycles to quickly transfer infantry groups to forward positions,- Milovidov noted. Despite the constant replenishment of reserves, the logistics of the occupiers are not perfect. Ukrainian forces are actively working behind enemy lines, striking with long-range weapons and aviation. -The counter-battery fight is being conducted at a high level, and our forces are doing everything to slow down the enemy's replenishment and logistical support,- the military officer emphasized. The so-called drone war is also actively underway. — The enemy uses all possible drones: from the Orlan and Zala reconnaissance complexes to strike drones and fiber-optic drones, which are difficult to disable by means of radio-electronic warfare, Milovidov noted. Worsening weather conditions also affect the course of hostilities. — Bad weather does not exist for the enemy. Even in difficult conditions, they continue assault operations, especially using infantry groups, the military said. At the same time, the decrease in temperature may make it difficult to use heavy armored vehicles, which will additionally affect the tactics of the Russian troops. The Defense Forces of Ukraine continue to hold the defense and inflict significant losses on the enemy, preventing him from achieving his goals. As reported by ArmyInform, the Defense Forces repelled two enemy attacks in the Novopavlovsk direction. The occupiers tried to advance near Rozlyv and Zelenivka.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/05/novopavlivskyj-napryamok-rosiyany-shturmuyut-na-bagi-ale-finishuyut-u-chornyh-paketah/	2025-02-04T23:27:07-08:00

-Hydra- against -orks-: a frantic assault on a dugout in the Kharkiv region from the Third Assault	The video of combat work was made public on the brigade's channel. The published video shows the entire dynamics of the battle. A few occupiers who advanced forward entrenched themselves in a small trench with a dugout, becoming a serious threat to Ukrainian positions. The task of the attack aircraft was to eliminate the enemy. The battle started fast and tense. -Troika- fighters opened a furious fire on the positions of the occupiers, using not only machine guns, but also grenades. Air reconnaissance came to the aid of the infantry, which helped to adjust fire and detect hidden enemy positions. -Man, we are not animals! Surrender, you will live,- Ukrainian soldiers shouted. However, the Russian soldiers refused to surrender and continued to resist. Even after the fire from the occupiers subsided, the attack aircraft did not lose their vigilance. They acted cautiously and professionally, realizing that the enemy might lie in wait. In order to guarantee the destruction of the enemy, the fighters came close to the dugout and threw a grenade inside. -This is my third contact in life,- one of the stormtroopers shared emotionally. After clearing the first part of the site, the fighters faced a new fire contact. The occupying sniper opened fire on the attack aircraft from a distance of 50 meters. -On us *the tower from the 12th, 50 meters!- - sounded on the walkie-talkie. The fighters once again turned to the air reconnaissance with a request to monitor the area from where the fire is being fired. Covering each other, the stormtroopers continued to advance, methodically destroying the enemy in their sectors. -We are no longer observing anyone,- the drone operator confirmed. The task was completed - the area was completely cleaned. However, the fighters understand that the war continues, and it is too early to relax. New challenges and new battles await them. The video recording of this operation, made by the -Troika- fighters themselves, allows you to see with your own eyes the heroism and professionalism of Ukrainian soldiers.

KABs overhead, queues at the pharmacy and four hours to live: ArmiyaInform report from front-line Ko...	What kind of destruction the city suffered, how its inhabitants live in the conditions of approaching the contact line, and why Kostyantynivka is so important for the enemy, further in the material. Every day, the Russian aviation attacks the city with aerial bombs, with artillery strikes, the Rashists destroy high-rise buildings, private houses, social institutions, educational institutions, industrial enterprises and objects of critical infrastructure. Enemy reconnaissance UAVs are in the air and are adjusting fire. The contact line came closer to the city by less than 10 km, and to the ridges about 6-7 kilometers. This is if you take the distance from the Temporal Ravine, in which heavy battles are going on. Some villages and settlements of the Kostyantyniv community, which are located along the front line in the direction of Toretsk, have been completely destroyed, others are subject to unprecedented shelling and destruction. About 17,000 people remain in Kostyantynivka, and more than 1,000 residents live in the villages of the community. By the way, almost 80 thousand people lived in the city before the invasion. The closer we get to Kostyantynivka, the fewer civilian cars there are, mostly military pickups on the road. The central road, which runs alongside the railway, actually divides the city into two parts. The industrial part is on the plain, to the left, if you are moving from Druzhkivka, on the heights are private sector houses and multi-apartment buildings, to the right - behind the industrial facilities, on the hill is another part of the residential sector of the city. So, this part of the city, which is closer to Chasovoy Yar, suffered the most destruction. All around destroyed houses, shops, gutted educational institutions and kindergartens, glass from broken windows everywhere, destroyed production facilities and workshops of industrial facilities. Once upon a time, before the Great War, many enterprises worked successfully in Kostyantynivka, among them, for example, a bakery, a milk factory, and a glass factory. Now they lie in ruins. We approach the former building of the Kostyantynivska City Council. In front of it, you can see the explosions from the Russian anti-tank missiles, the building is ransacked, like everything around in this area. Nearby is a shattered school. The least number of people live in this part of the city, but single silhouettes of residents can still be seen on the city streets. Lyudmila Mykolaivna lived in Kostyantynivka all her life, a pensioner. -It's very scary, especially when the weather is sunny, then the Russians hit the city much more. I still have water, gas and electricity in my house. There are problems with the light, power grids are destroyed, they are fixed, of course. Interruptions with heating. My friends are already living without electricity, water and gas. But it is good that relatives are moving to Dnipropetrovsk region. -Many people still have stoves in their homes, so they heat and cook with them,- the woman says. Almost a year ago, the Russians hit the S-300 on Kostyantynivka and destroyed the railway station. In addition, a temple, private and apartment buildings, shops, market pavilions, three educational institutions, administrative buildings and a post office were also destroyed in this area. Now there are some shops and even open pavilions with products, there are vegetables, fruits, meat, eggs, fish and dairy products. Agricultural goods are sold. In other areas of the city, there are also small shops where you can buy products. All the big supermarkets have already been destroyed by roaches. There are several points of dispensing free drinking water in the city. People come on bicycles, with wheelbarrows and -pushchairs- to conveniently carry bottles of water. Bread is brought, as in other settlements of the community. Pharmacies work, most of the necessary medical drugs are there, so people, for example, with cardiovascular diseases, are provided with pills. Ukrposhta branches, polyclinics, even queues at ATMs for cash are open. There is a minibus that runs around the city once an hour and takes residents to different districts of Kostyantynivka. The Kostyantynivska community has a strict curfew: it lasts 20 hours a day — from 3:00 p.m. to 11:00 a.m. the next day. That is, only at this time residents can be on the street and actually have four hours for everything: to buy groceries, collect drinking water, go to the pharmacy, and so on. But just to breathe fresh air. When the electricity goes out in the city after shelling the occupiers, generators are turned on in shops and pharmacies. Even if the city is shelled, residents still go shopping, they say they are used to it. -Of course it's scary. But we have nowhere to go, there are many single people, they need to at least buy bread. For example, my relatives moved to Odeshchyna, I am here alone, I have to take care of myself. They call to me, I will finish my business here and go,- says Anastasia, a resident of the city. There are -points of unbreakability- in Kostyantynivka, volunteers bring hot food, distribute -humanitarian food-, plus you can get warm clothes here. -Everything you need for life in the city is there. We pray to God and ask him to give strength to the Ukrainian army to stop the Russian occupiers, - adds a grandfather and grandmother walking along the sidewalk, - we have lived here all our lives, where should we go, we have a home here, two pensions are still enough and we don't need much. There is food and water, the TV is working. And it will be spring soon, and it will be warm there, the smell of flowers and the trees will turn green. Let's go further. There is a queue at the pharmacy, people complain that there is not enough time to live. -Four hours to solve all current issues is very little. It's good that the hospital is still open, so help is available. There are qualified doctors, but we don't know what will happen tomorrow or the day after tomorrow,- residents say. In the conditions of war, city utility workers do everything possible to improve the lives of residents. Sometimes they even work under enemy fire. Utility workers are trying to eliminate the consequences of shelling and destruction as soon as possible. Serhiy Gorbunov, the head of the Kostyantyniv city military administration, said that the city still has gas, electricity and partially water supply. -There is no water supply in some areas of the city, because the enemy destroyed one of the water mains, we are delivering water. After each shelling, the entire infrastructure is destroyed, we try to restore everything immediately. We provide people after shelling with construction materials for the preservation of residential premises and civil infrastructure. Volunteers help a lot,- said Serhiy Gorbunov. The center for providing administrative services of the Kostyantynivska hromada works in the mode of recording people's statements regarding destruction, surveys and entries in the registers of information about damaged and destroyed property. It is good that all the children were taken out of the city to a safe place. Schools, of course, are not functioning, schoolchildren study remotely. Entrepreneurs and owners of small shops are reluctant to communicate, do not want to be photographed. For the most part, their business is on the verge of closing, there is no revenue, so they work on their own enthusiasm. They say that while people are still in the city, they will be open to residents. The city remains one of the potential targets for the aggressor, in particular because of its railway hub. Rail logistics make it much easier for the occupiers to deliver troops and ammunition. Moreover, the probable occupation of Kostyantynivka will open the way for a further attack on the large Kramatorsk-Druzhkiv agglomeration. Kremlin seeks to achieve its goal of full occupation of Donetsk region. But the Defense Forces of Ukraine destroy the occupiers on the contact line and prevent them from advancing. The enemy is suffering losses, almost every piece of Ukrainian land on the front line is littered with corpses of Russian invaders. &#8230;When ArmiyaInform journalists were working in Kostyantynivka, the enemy attacked the city with barrel artillery and anti-aircraft guns. As a result of the strikes, private houses, a gas pipeline line, the electricity network and cars of residents were damaged. Recently, the enemy has been striking the city with the use of attack UAVs. Every day, the local city military administration calls for the need to evacuate the civilian population to safer regions of Ukraine! Take care, evacuate in time! For questions about evacuation, please call: 050 567 88 87, 093 420 18 83.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/05/kaby-nad-golovoyu-chergy-v-apteku-ta-chotyry-godyny-dlya-zhyttya-reportazh-armiyainform-z-pryfrontovoyi-kostyantynivky/	2025-02-04T20:51:01-08:00
500 bullets at the enemy with one -shot-: a mine-explosive master class from -Bach-	- The call sign appeared very simply - they came up with the guys when they started in the sapper company. How do callsigns appear? If you don't come up with something yourself, then something will be stuck on you and that something may not be the best. That's why they came up with something related to the sabotage business, detonations, - explains the soldier with a smile. -Bach- comes from the town of Hlyboka in the Chernivtsi region. The future sapper volunteered for the army in the first days of the large-scale invasion. Together with their cousin, they rushed into battle, although they did not have any military experience or long-term service in the Armed Forces. -I came with my cousin. Before the war, we went to the same job and were abroad for almost four years together. On the third day, it was my brother's birthday and I came to his room in the morning and said: -Well, -Boy- - he had a call sign even before the war - I kind of thought I'd go.- And he says that he also made up his mind, and we are a military commissar together,- recalls Nikita. Training at the Yavoriv training ground in Starychy, in contrast to the modern one-and-a-half-month BZVP, was less long, but every extra day in the -textbook- was perceived by the fighters as little more than a punishment, because they wanted to get to the front as soon as possible. -We imagined that the training would be like in the American movies - an obstacle course in the swamp, survival in the forest, urban battles&#8230; In fact, it was not so little, but we were very afraid that we would not make it to the war, we were very excited. We were preparing for VOS 100 as infantry and we hoped that we would be like Rambo in the trenches putting out fuckers - just like in the best blockbusters,- says -Bach-. During the formation of the brigade in Zolotonosh, Nikita and his brother were enrolled in the sapper company, but -Bach- began to fully master the mine and explosive business under the guidance of more experienced colleagues already during the hostilities in the Donetsk region. The fighter got there at the beginning of April 2022. He fought in the Severodonetsk region near Voivodeship. -Our first combat sorties were tough. It's hard for a person from a -citizen- when you don't distinguish between -exits- and -arrivals- - it seems that everything is flying around you. At first, we marched like a company of sappers, because we had to kill the whole -squad-, but in fact we were infantry. Only in the time free from fighting, sappers and contractors came to us, told us, showed us what to do, gave us some kind of basic course,- says the fighter. He gratefully remembers his comrades hardened in combat operations during the ATO/OOS, because they could give useful advice, prompt and show what and how to do. After all, a confident military man, every infantryman must master the elementary things of working with an explosive device. -Each infantryman should at least be able to set an anti-personnel mine. Of course, anyone is afraid to touch a mine, but in fact it is as safe as possible if you handle it competently and carefully,- says -Bach-. What's more, the sapper emphasizes, competently installed mine barriers not only do not pose a danger to their own infantry, but also save their lives. -The modern tasks of sappers are to install mine-explosive barriers. For example, infantry is entrenched and sits on observation posts, that is, it holds some area of ​​responsibility. We are moving forward, setting mines of the MON type in a controlled manner. This is how we -sewing up- our own infantry, so that the enemy cannot approach our positions without losses,- explains the sapper. Even the smallest of the MON-50 anti-personnel mines can stop the advance of a large group of the enemy, because its explosion provides a directed explosion and the impact of half a thousand pieces of debris in a certain sector. -You just press one button and 500 bullets will fly in one sector. We are laying mines along the front to occupy the entire area. Then instead of shooting 20 stores, you can press one button. You see, there's a group coming. Click and the group lay down. The first two of the group fall automatically, because you have already sifted through them. And others will not crawl further, because some of them are -300-, and others are frightened and must evacuate the wounded. Although they met in the Kupyansk direction of -storm-zet-, they simply have no choice to go back there - only forward, because behind them are -blockades-, explains -Bach-. -I personally did not participate in the offensives, but we cleared paths, worked with SSO groups, with the DRG, with intelligence colleagues who were preparing for offensive actions,- the military man says about the role of sappers in preparing for offensive actions. The so-called -gray zone- between the positions is very densely mined both by us and by the enemy, so before the fighters can start an assault, sappers must both remove their own mine barriers and clear the way to the enemy's positions from enemy mines as much as possible. -In order for the group to pass covertly without losses, we climb out first and clear all the mines. If there is an opportunity, we use mine detectors. If there is none, then simply by crawling, with feelers. First, we made a corridor in our barricades, crawled, made as much as possible to the enemy's positions - and then the group can enter through a safe corridor,- says the sapper. A path for armored vehicles is also cleared in a similar way, but mechanized means such as demining units can be used there. They make it possible to lay passages about 4 meters wide in enemy minefields, which is enough for the movement of a tank. The sapper emphasizes that an infantryman must be able not only to detect, but also to set mines. The damage that can be inflicted on the enemy by laying mines of directed action can in many cases be fatal for him. This is how you can destroy and stop entire groups of Russian infantrymen: -As practice shows, people are taught how to handle weapons, shooting, tactics, and tactical equipment at the BZVP. For engineering training in general, there may be only 1‒2 hours for the entire course. But in today's realities, the infantry must be able to lay mines. Now there are many mines of the American model of the M18A1 Claymore type. In our military, it is considered engineer ammunition, and in the US army, it is infantry ammunition. It goes just like a one-shot RPG, just like grenades. The same goes for -Claymore- - a small handbag, an anti-personnel mine and a net with a ready-made detonator. You may not have a sapper with you in the trench every second who can supply you. But there may be several claymore mines. Then he climbed out carefully, put it down. I have acquaintances from the assault brigades, and they tell me that there were cases when our guys held the defense with the help of such mines and repelled several assaults. The assault group simply goes, they put a mine behind the parapet, click - and the group lay down. Stopped smoking, recharged. You see the group again - the mine was placed, click. And whoever remained alive was shot. That is, in skillful hands, you can do serious things.- Since August 2024, -Bach- has served in the 115th separate mechanized brigade as an instructor in mine and explosive training. He teaches newly arrived infantrymen not to be afraid of mines, demining explosive objects and setting mines in combat conditions. -We let you feel every live mine, every detonator, every -fly-, every detonator. We explain and show how to blow up, what are the blasting machines and so on. Everyone felt everything, made several attempts to install it. Of course, without detonation, but the fighters get basic experience and will be able to use it in combat conditions,- says the sapper. During his service as a mine and explosives instructor, he and his brother with the call sign -Monk- have already trained several hundred fighters. -Bach- is sure that thorough comprehensive training of Ukrainian soldiers is one of the key keys to victory. After all, it is not enough to be motivated and have the necessary weapons - you should be able to use them skillfully. Therefore, the service of the instructor is an important contribution to the victory over the enemy.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/05/500-kul-u-voroga-odnym-postrilom-minno-vybuhovyj-majster-klas-vid-baha/	2025-02-04T20:38:52-08:00
Term service in Chechnya, or rape by Buryats: how they force Ukrainians on the TOT to sign a contrac...	Mobilization processes in the occupied Ukrainian territories are already ongoing. For example, conscription is already being held there. As the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine reported at the beginning of January, from October 1 to December 31, 2024, in the temporarily occupied territories of the Zaporizhia and Kherson regions, the aggressor state Russia mobilized about three hundred people. -The occupation administrations intensified pressure with the aim of increasing the volume of conscription in the enslaved communities of the Kherson region and the Zaporizhia region - they require all men under the age of 60 to register for the so-called -military registration-. Those who try to avoid participating in the war against Ukraine are threatened, in particular, with the deprivation of earnings and means of livelihood,- said the message of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications. Also, in the occupied territories, they are actively working with the population to sign a contract for service. According to the data published by the Center of National Resistance, for almost 10 months in 2024, about 10,000 of Ukrainians living in the temporarily occupied territories became servicemen of the Russian army. And in general, according to the Russian plan, at least 150,000 recruits should be added to the ranks of the occupation forces. Among them, a significant share falls on temporarily occupied Donetsk region, Luhansk region, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson region and annexed Crimea. Intensification of mobilization in the occupied territories began in 2024. In particular, in the fourth quarter, for the first time with the start of the conscription campaign, military commissars in the occupied territories received strict mobilization tasks, says Petro Andryushchenko, head of the Center for the Study of the Occupation. These tasks were transferred to the occupation authorities, so that they would send the workers of communal enterprises to the military commissariats. And then they tried to force these people to sign a contract for service in the Russian army. For example, such cases were first recorded in the Mariupol district, and later spread to the Melitopol and Berdyan districts. -The conscription campaign began in October. Military commissars went around the villages, collecting boys under the age of 23. They were brought to the Military Commissariat and the blackmail began. They threatened that they would now be conscripted and sent to Chechnya or to the Buryats. And there they will be raped and the like. And such threats worked. Some guys signed a contract. We know about 15 such facts in the Mariupol district alone,- says Petro Andryushchenko. Also, the occupiers constantly -process- those who were called up for long-term service. They try to -motivate- to sign the contract in different ways. -They were also locked up in military commissariats and forced to sign a contract. They said that they would not be sent to the front. They will be cooks, drivers. They offered 800,000 rubles for signing a contract and from 200,000 rubles a month. These are smaller amounts than offered in the regions of Russia. But this is a lot of money for the occupied territories. They are also -pressing- even in the military units themselves. For them to sign contracts. And it worked too. Because we have data on prisoners from the same Mariupol district. That is, as soon as someone signed a contract, he almost immediately found himself at the front. And if they were lucky, they were captured,- says Petro Andryushchenko. By the way, the treatment of conscripts from the temporarily occupied territories in the Russian army is a separate story, which we have already discussed they wrote. According to Petro Andryushchenko, the situation will only worsen in the near future. The spring draft is approaching, which will have even more aggressive plans for mobilization. In addition, the occupiers have a need to increase the number of mobilized. -Why do I come to this conclusion? On average, the occupiers gather 30-35 thousand people for the army. And they lose from 40 to 45 thousand every month. There is also a clear drop in the number of people willing to sign a contract on the territory of Russia. Therefore, it is unlikely that they will be able to significantly increase this mobilization under such conditions. And this means that coercive measures must be included. And where to do it? In past years, they did it at the expense of their marginals, convicts and migrants. Society approved it. Now this can be done at the expense of occupied territories. -Busification- in conditional Berdyansk or Mariupol will be perceived normally by the same Muscovites. Like, you wanted to join Russia, so go now and fight,- says Petro Andryushchenko. Meanwhile, everything is ready for this in the occupied territories. Military registration is available, the data has been updated. Locking people in the occupied territories is easy. -Block exits to Crimea and the territory of the Donetsk region, and that's it - mobilize as much as you want. And it will happen sooner or later. The Russians have everything ready there. And they are able to collect the necessary number of people by coercive measures,- believes Petro Andryushchenko. In 2022, several tens of thousands of Ukrainians joined the ranks of the Russian-controlled LNR and DNR groups. Forced mobilization there began about a week before the full-scale invasion began. Usually it happened like this - orders came from the military commissariat to the enterprises that the men should appear at a certain time, like for -retraining-. And there they immediately issued weapons, uniforms and sent to the units. And then these very people went to storm Ukrainian positions in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions, they were transferred for the so-called -consolidation- and maintenance of territories captured by the Russians in the Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhya, and Kherson regions. It was the residents of Luhansk region and Donetsk region that were captured by Ukrainians in large numbers. For example, near Mayorsk, the Ukrainian military managed to capture 10 mobilized men from the occupied Horlivka. All of them worked in educational institutions. And all of them were forcibly mobilized and thrown into battle without preparation. Interviews with some of them was once published by journalist Volodymyr Zolkin. Aggressive forced mobilization in the occupied territories continued throughout 2022. People were taken away not only from enterprises, but also raids were arranged through the streets of occupied settlements. Many people got into the occupation army simply by going out into the street for some need. The SBU wrote about one of these stories. Here are literally two quotes from the interrogation of this prisoner, which demonstrate how mobilization in the occupied territories took place at that time: -I went to the store to buy food, they packed me right on the street and brought me to some building. Then they loaded it into a dump truck and took it with the others further.- -They told us to fight. But when the shelling began, I climbed into the tank with the others and hid. They don't shoot because they don't even know how to shoot.- And there were a lot of such stories in 2022. It is not worth counting that nothing like this will happen again. The only guaranteed possibility of not getting into the ranks of the occupying army is to defend ourselves and not allow the enemy to occupy our country. By the way, the mobilization of the adult population in the occupied Ukrainian territories is only part of Russia's plan to replenish its mobilization resources. Another component is militarization of Ukrainian children who are supposed to be there mobilization reserve of the aggressor state.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/05/strokova-sluzhba-u-chechni-abo-gvaltuvannya-buryatamy-yak-prymushuyut-ukrayincziv-na-tot-ukladaty-kontrakt-z-armiyeyu-rf/	2025-02-04T20:32:58-08:00
Aiming at nuclear deterrence: France develops new hypersonic missile to reach Mach 7	As informs the specialized defense portal Zone Militaire, this project, implemented by MBDA France with the support of the ONERA aerospace research center, is aimed at creating a weapons system that will provide the country with the ability to withstand challenges from Russia and China, ArmyInform reports. The special feature of the ASN4G is its combination of hypersonic speed, stealth and long range, making it an unrivaled deterrent tool. In turn, the experts of the Army Recognition site detailed the plans of the French gunsmiths. This product should replace the existing medium-range missile ASMPA and will be compatible with Rafale F5 fighters. The claimed range of ASN4G is 1K. km, and the speed will reach 8.6 thousand km. km/h ASN4G is expected to reach speeds of Mach 6 to Mach 7, far exceeding ASMPA's capabilities. This speed, combined with improved maneuverability, will allow the missile to avoid radar detection and interception by modern air defense systems. The range of the ASN4G is claimed to be twice that of the ASMPA and will provide greater operational flexibility. The missile will also have stealth characteristics achieved through the use of specialized materials that reduce radar visibility and withstand extreme aerodynamic and thermal conditions during flight. The ASN4G engine is based on a supersonic jet engine developed under the PROMETHEE program. This propulsion system uses mixed combustion technology to transition between subsonic, supersonic, and hypersonic speeds, ensuring the rocket's ability to maintain high speeds over long distances. The inclined X-shaped tail (aerodynamic rudders) with -camber- angles of about 120 degrees, as well as the -zigzag- edge of the tail part of the ASN4G airframe should maximally reduce the EOP of the missile when irradiated by the enemy's ground and air-based radar from the rear hemisphere. At the same time, the area of ​​aerodynamic rudders is very significant, which indicates the possibility of performing anti-aircraft maneuvers of medium intensity even in the upper layers of the stratosphere (35-38 km). The architecture of the ASN4G on-board radio electronic equipment, including the guidance system, attracted considerable interest from experts. Based on the sketch, there is (in addition to the inertial navigation system and radio altimeters) a wide range of radio reconnaissance sensors for the detection of radiation sources and their identification, with further comparison with templates from a preloaded database. This is evidenced by the presence of large radio-transparent panels on the sides of the fuselage that form the nose. Passive antennas of the radiation warning station can also be placed behind them to alert the BCOM (Board Digital Computing Machine, - ed) of the missile about -capture- by illumination and guidance radars of the air defense system, or active search engines of anti-aircraft missiles and missiles of the -air-to-air- class. The development and use of the ASN4G sketch variant for France will mean the appearance in its armed forces of not a conventional 4th-generation multi-purpose hypersonic missile with nuclear -equipment-, but a multifunctional strike-reconnaissance hypersonic platform. The missile's compact design ensures compatibility with existing platforms, including the Rafale F5 fighter and future systems such as the Future Combat Air System's Next Generation Fighter (NGF) (FCAS). Development of ASN4G began in the 1990s at the same time as the modernization of ASMPA. In 2014, the French Ministry of the Armed Forces approved the program, with initial research focusing on two key approaches: stealth and hyperspeed. The choice in favor of hypersonic speed was based on its effectiveness in overcoming increasingly sophisticated restriction and denial of access and maneuvering systems (A2/AD). ASN4G is part of France's broader strategy to modernize its nuclear deterrent capabilities. It will be integrated with the Rafale F5 fighter and compatible with future platforms. Its deployment will strengthen the airborne component of France's nuclear deterrent, which is operated by the Strategic Air Force (FAS) and the Naval Nuclear Air Force (FANu). The missile's ability to perform complex maneuvers at hypersonic speeds ensures its effectiveness against modern missile defense systems. In parallel, related efforts include ArianeGroup's development of the V-MAX hypersonic glider, which complements the ASN4G program objectives. ASN4G is expected to be operational by 2035, and its service life will last beyond 2050. Its development is a continuation of France's commitment to maintaining an independent and reliable nuclear deterrent. With the integration of a hypersonic engine, improved stealth and increased range, the missile is designed to ensure the effectiveness of France's deterrent position in an increasingly contested security environment.

Russia made up -a discharged veteran of the Armed Forces of Ukraine- from -Cirque du Soleil-: analys...	The fake spread quickly through pro-Russian Telegram channels and, as it usually happens, crumbled at the first verified fact. According to the version of Russian agitators, the unknown -Ukrainian fighter- decided to become a circus performer after serving in the Armed Forces. His talent impressed everyone, but then the administration allegedly found out that he was -ex-military- and immediately got rid of him, citing some -political reasons-. Some versions of this fake even contained unique -details- - it was said that circus artists were afraid to work next to him because -he was too good with a knife- and -reacted too quickly to sudden movements.- It sounds like a script for an unsuccessful drama on a second-rate propaganda channel, but in fact it is another clichéd product of a factory of fakes aimed at discrediting Ukrainians in the world. Russian fakers are constantly working to create the impression that Ukrainians are becoming -dangerous to the world- because of the war. Their goal is to sow fear and mistrust, portray the Ukrainian military as aggressive, unbalanced, or even unadapted to normal life. This is part of their information war, which has little to do with reality. -Cirque du Soleil- does exist, but -discharged veteran- does not. The only thing that can be confirmed for sure is that real clowns are sitting in the Kremlin. And if someone really lost their job, it is the Russian propagandists, who can no longer make even their fakes convincing.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/05/rosiya-vygadala-zvilnenogo-veterana-zsu-z-czyrk-dyu-solej-rozbir-novogo-fejku/	2025-02-04T20:04:38-08:00

Russian agents were preparing a terrorist attack against the police in Bukovina	The Security Service of Ukraine reported this on Tuesday, February 4. According to the investigation, two attackers were preparing to blow up a police team in the Vyzhnytskyi district, which was supposed to arrive after a fake call to 102. -To commit a terrorist attack, the perpetrators planted an improvised explosive device (IED) in an abandoned farm building, equipped with self-tapping screws for maximum damage. The explosive device was hidden in a garbage bag, and nearby in a juice box was a mobile phone that filmed the entrance to the building. Using remote access to the gadget, the occupiers planned to activate the SVP when the police entered the building. By this time, the agents should have gone into hiding,- the message reads. They received all relevant instructions from their Russian curator through social networks. The operatives of the special service detained the suspects, who turned out to be local drug dealers aged 17 and 18, after they planted explosives and returned to their apartments. Both defendants were notified of suspicion under the articles of the Criminal Code of Ukraine: Detainees face up to 12 years in prison with confiscation of property. As reported by ArmyInform, the SBU detained a saboteur in Rivne , who was preparing a terrorist attack on the railway.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/04/agenty-rf-gotuvaly-terakt-proty-policziyi-na-bukovyni/	2025-02-04T11:15:31-08:00
Skirmishes in the Pokrovsky direction have decreased, the enemy is looking for detours and maneuveri...	This was reported by the deputy commander for psychological support of the 155th of the separate mechanized brigade named after Anna of Kyiv, major Ivan Surov. -The intensity has indeed decreased a bit, but the general tactics have remained the same. That is, they try to advance in small infantry groups under the cover of artillery. And yes, indeed, the last day or two, the intensity of hostilities has decreased a little,- confirmed the soldier. He also added that currently the enemy is trying to move mainly during the day. -The Russian troops currently have a shortage of night optics, and our drones, known as -Baba Yaga- or -Vampire- — are active at night — heavy bombers. Since they are easy to see during the day because of their large size, they work mainly at night,- explained the representative of the 155th OMBr. In turn, the commander of the 59th separate assault brigade named after Yakov Handziuk of the Forces of Unmanned Systems with the call sign -Bird- notes that, despite the huge losses, the Russian invaders do not stop, but try not to enter into a head-on collision with Ukrainian units, but to bypass them. -The enemy uses different tactics, tries to carry out assault actions in different ways. On armored vehicles, on lightly armored vehicles or, in general, with ordinary vehicles that they have available, such as buggies. Tries to use different tactics. Tries from one side - the brigade fights back decently - tries from the other. Maneuvering,'' said the combatant of the 59th OShBr. As reported by ArmyInform, The defense forces defeated a convoy of Russian Federation in the Pokrovsky direction.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/04/manevruye-boyezitknen-na-pokrovskomu-napryamku-stalo-menshe-vorog-shukaye-obhidni-shlyahy/	2025-02-04T11:07:18-08:00

According to Borodin, the entire system of commanding the enemy's troops is built on -unlimited- manpower. Everyone is thrown into the attacks - some debtors, some convicts, some mobilized go into the attack. They cook for one or two weeks. -Their system is built on losses. They perfectly understand the shortcomings of this system, it is adapted to these shortcomings. The latest trend is that they don't even say to storm a target. They say we must go and take positions, that is, their positions. Near the pine tree. And these are our positions,- Oleksandr Borodin said.

-Training is the key to success-: Marine -Mickey- on preparing for battle	The story of the fighter was made public on the page of the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. -Mickey- together with his family had to stay in occupation for several months. When they were lucky and were able to go to the territory controlled by the Ukrainian troops, the boy immediately went to the territorial center of recruitment and social support to join the ranks of the Defense Forces of Ukraine. -There was absolutely no thought that I could do it differently. I swore an oath to the Ukrainian people, served a term of service. Besides, I have seen plenty of how the occupiers behave on our land,- the young scout shares his thoughts. At TCC -Mickey- he was immediately offered to join the then 124th separate territorial defense brigade. First, he got into the car company, and then continued to serve in other logistics units. However, from the first days, the fighter dreamed of serving in intelligence. -Intelligence is a very interesting place of service, here a lot depends on ingenuity, ingenuity, non-standard approaches to tasks. You are constantly on the move and forced to improve,- the warrior notes. A junior sergeant's unit and really special. Marine scouts perform complex and very important tasks. They often operate independently, without the support of adjacent units, on the front lines and behind enemy lines. Reconnaissance is not simply about observing the positions of the occupiers. Scouts pave a safe way for infantry to positions, scout for mine-explosive barriers of the enemy, analyze changes in the general situation in the area of ​​their responsibility, and, of course, are directly engaged in the destruction of manpower and equipment of the Rashists. -During combat missions, mostly everything depends on you. How did you prepare, how was the task plan drawn up, what factors were taken into account, what equipment was selected based on the specifics of the task. We pay a lot of attention to personnel training, especially to young recruits. I train them myself, constantly, every day, unless we are on a combat mission. If a fighter successfully completes a training task, well, well done. If not, let's train further,- the young commander smiles broadly. There is a place for both dreams and hopes in war. And it should be so because it gives strength to continue our struggle for our country, the liberation of its territories and our people, who are waiting for us in the Ukrainian lands occupied by the Russian invaders. Despite the difficult years spent in the war, -Mickey- does not lose optimism. He dreams of returning with his mother to his native village and planting a vegetable garden again. And he definitely wants to visit Henichesk and ride the water slides there. The man is convinced that this will definitely happen.

In the Pokrovsky direction, the Russians on BMPs landed in the area of ​​responsibility of the 5th Assault Brigade. Unfortunately, the enemy BMP managed to escape, but all 11 Russians who rushed were eliminated by the brigade fighters. Again, in the Pokrovsky direction, the injured Russian tried to escape from the FPV drone of the Skala attack aircraft. The regiment's aerial scouts followed his movements. Towards the end, the occupier decided to lie down next to his previously liquidated colleagues and pretend to be dead. Our FPV eliminated him in this position.

The corresponding footage was made public by the 155th separate mechanized brigade named after Anna of Kyiv. On them, you can see how the Russian moves from one shelter to another, but at some point he loses his vigilance and relaxes too much, as a result of which he catches the eyes of the Ukrainian defenders. In turn, the soldiers of the Armed Forces immediately met the invader with heavy fire, literally peppering him with lead.

When the second drone arrived for control, it saw the quad bike on fire and the driver lying on the side of the road and looking dead. But our pilots decided to look into the face of the enemy. And his nerves couldn't stand it, he got up and tried to grab our drone, after which the video disappeared. The third drone recorded the traumatic separation of the enemy's head. That is, the second drone worked. In addition to this trick, the UA_REG Team fighters also attacked enemy vehicles and armored vehicles. As reported by ArmyInform, the operator of the UA_REG Team unit of the Special Operations Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine made a selection of destroyed Russian vehicles.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/04/majzhe-poviryly-na-kurshhyni-rosiyanyn-tak-dobre-udavav-z-sebe-mertvogo-shho-zdyvuvav-pilotiv/	2025-02-04T08:07:17-08:00
The government has expanded the list of free medical services for veterans	About this on Tuesday, February 4, reported in the Ukrainian government, noting that the Cabinet of Ministers has already adopted the relevant resolution. -This project is another important step towards high-quality medical support for veterans, which takes into account the consequences of war and provides personalized assistance to everyone who defended Ukraine,- the message reads. What will change? Now, veterans who signed declarations with their family doctor will be able to receive: Who can benefit? How will it be possible to receive free medical services?

The project will start already at the beginning of March, and when all mechanisms are set up, veterans will be informed about it separately. -The health of veterans is our duty. War is exhausting both physically and psychologically, so it is important not only to treat, but to prevent diseases.

Hugging trees, burying themselves in the grass — the Russians took amazing dying poses	The video was released on February 4 on the brigade's channel. Some Russians hugged the trees, pressed themselves with all their might to blend in with them and make themselves invisible. Others hid in the bushes. Some buried themselves in the grass, some tried to pretend to be dead. But our drones did not allow themselves to be deceived and made life easier for our infantry by destroying the stormtroopers. As ArmiyaInform reported, the enemy is intensifying its efforts in the Pokrovsky direction.

There is ammunition, there are wounded - the Defense Forces will receive a new ground drone	About this reported on February 4 the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine with reference to the Main Directorate for Life Cycle Support of Weapons and Military Equipment. NRK Gimli is a universal unmanned platform designed to perform a wide range of tasks in the complex conditions of high-intensity combat operations. Depending on the configuration and attached equipment, the workers perform the tasks of evacuating and moving personnel, transporting ammunition, property, and performing other important support and maintenance tasks. In addition, the Gimli NRC can be equipped with weapons and perform the functions of a mobile combat module, carrying out fire damage to enemy targets. Gimli's robots are small in size, making them easy to transport. Equipped with a silent electric motor. A full battery charge is enough for several hours of continuous operation. Robots are able to perform tasks both during the day and at night. The Ministry of Defense reminds the producers of OVT that useful information on the codification procedure of new samples of weapons and military equipment can be found at here. The robot is named after a character from the Lord of the Rings book, a mighty dwarf. As reported by ArmyInform, the Ministry of Defense approved 10 samples of combat helmets. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/04/tudy-boyeprypasy-zvidty-poranenyh-syly-oborony-otrymayut-novyj-nazemnyj-dron/	2025-02-04T07:13:03-08:00
For a middle finger in the direction of the Armed Forces - 6 years in prison: the Poltava TCC hopes ...	This is the same man from Poltava who the year before last spat at a veteran, provoked a conflict with military personnel of the Poltava TCC and SP, and later posted a video on his Instagram showing the middle finger to the Ukrainian military. Someone will say that almost two years have passed, everyone has already forgotten about this character, and the Ukrainian court has only now made a decision. Yes, the millstones of the legal process grind slowly, but relentlessly. Especially since such cases are not frequent in our country. And, one way or another, the culprit will be imprisoned for the next 6 years and half of his property will be confiscated. -The sentence for Roman Zavoloka is quite expected and fair. We hope that the sentence for the murderer of our serviceman will be just as fair. It is only a pity that the guilty verdicts are not able to change the attitude towards the military servicemen of the TCC and SP, who faithfully and faithfully perform their duties,- the Poltava Regional TCC and SP commented on the event. It may seem that the sentences really will not change the attitude towards the military from TCC and SP. But this is only at first glance. It is only necessary to create a precedent. If the society sees that the state awards 6 years of imprisonment for a middle finger to the military forces of Ukraine, then whoever wants to repeat Zavoloka's -feat- is unlikely to raise a hand to do so in the literal sense. And with this, believe me, comes a change in attitude towards military personnel serving in the TCC and SP. Those whom the state does not allow to be insulted, sooner or later, the part of the country that, according to the Law, is considered conscripts, begins to respect. And it is not for nothing that in the comments of the Poltava TCC and SP expressed the hope that the sentence for the killer of their colleague from the regional Poltava territorial recruitment center would be just as fair. We are talking about the crime committed by the suspect Vadym Kuzub on February 1 of this year, shooting at a military man who was accompanying the mobilized to the educational center. -It is unacceptable that people of various levels of influence and media influence - from Russian bots and agents to people's deputies - are trying to justify the very fact of the murder of a soldier by a civilian in 2025. It is unacceptable the phenomenon when, instead of working on solving problematic issues, instead of planned and immediate work with the goal of eradicating systematic contempt for military personnel of the TCC and SP, there is a detailed examination of the identity of the killed soldier and a discussion of whether he was sufficiently -military,- Poltava emphasized. TCC and joint venture. Yes, Russian bots in social networks did a lot to blacken the image of the deceased. But, you must agree, after today's sentence to Roman Zavolotsa, confidence increases significantly that any citizen who dares to attack a soldier of the TCC and SP will certainly be punished. ArmyInform earlier reported that the commander of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Major General Mykhailo Drapaty, expressed his position regarding the latest cases of attack on the military in the rear. According to him, the killings of servicemen are a red line that cannot be crossed, and society should not silently watch the disrespect for the defenders of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/04/za-serednij-palecz-u-bik-zsu-6-rokiv-tyurmy-u-poltavskomu-tczk-spodivayutsya-shho-i-dlya-vbyvczi-vyrok-bude-spravedlyvym/	2025-02-04T07:02:27-08:00
A traitorous mother is grief in the family: a woman involved her minor son in arson	This was reported on February 4 by the Security Service of Ukraine. The main -targets- of the enemy were administrative buildings of state institutions, SUVs of the Defense Forces and relay cabinets of Ukrzaliznytsia. To commit crimes, Russian special services remotely recruited local residents who were looking for -easy- earnings on Telegram channels. For example, a 40-year-old local woman was detained in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, who organized the arson of a military pick-up truck of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and 3 relay cabinets on railway lines.

After -agreeing- on a potential target, the young men arrived together at its location and set it on fire with a flammable mixture. A 17-year-old student of a local college was arrested in Rivne -on hot pursuit-, who burned down an official car of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. This transport was driven to the western region for maintenance after completing combat missions at the front. In order to commit the crime, the suspect made an incendiary mixture with his own hands in his room in the dormitory. A 34-year-old resident of Shepetivka, who set fire to the premises of the city council, was arrested in Khmelnytskyi region. First, the woman broke a window on the first floor of the administration building, and then threw a bottle with an incendiary mixture into the middle. As a result of the fire, the windowsill and the floor in one of the offices of the state institution were damaged. Currently, all detainees have been notified of their suspicion of crimes committed under several articles of the Criminal Code of Ukraine: The perpetrators face various terms of imprisonment, including life imprisonment with confiscation of property.

-Instructor- back in battle: the story of a school teacher who became a company commander on the fro...	Fierce battles on the front line Since 2023, Yevhen has been serving in the 58th brigade, where he joined from the reserve unit. During this time, he passed the hottest points of the front — the Avdiiv and Vugledar areas. Among the most tense battles, he mentions Krasnohorivka, Stepove and Ugledar. The assaults here continued from morning to evening, and the task of the Ukrainian soldiers was to restrain the enemy. Yevhen notes that the enemy's tactics remain the same - the enemy's troops are acting head-on, trying to take quantity, not quality. A feature of the battles in the Vugledar region was the active use of motorcycle groups by the Russians: fighters on high-speed motorcycles broke through to the positions of the Ukrainian troops, throwing grenades into the trenches. Despite the difficult conditions, the motivation of the fighters remains high. -We have been fighting for independence for more than a thousand days. Who but us?- Yevhen emphasizes. He is convinced that Ukrainians are a nation capable of adapting to any conditions and fighting for victory. According to him, representatives of various professions are currently fighting in the ranks of the Armed Forces - teachers, doctors, mechanics, agronomists. -Man is a creature that knows how to survive. And if there is motivation, we will win,- he adds. The commander emphasizes the importance of rest and moral support of the military. Exhausted battles require regular rotations and attention to the psychological state of the fighters. At the same time, he believes in victory: -We want to return to the borders of 1991, and we will work on it. But the main thing is to prevent this war from happening again in a few years.- Addressing civilians, Yevgeny urges them not to be afraid of mobilization and to join the ranks of the Armed Forces. -War is not good, but one must protect one's land, one's children, one's women. We will stand, because the truth is with us,- concludes the officer. As reported by ArmyInform, the Russian special services and the military are increasingly trying to influence the families of Ukrainian prisoners of war. Numerous cases have been recorded when the occupiers contact relatives immediately after taking the defender into captivity.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/04/instruktor-znovu-v-boyu-istoriya-shkilnogo-vchytelya-yakyj-stav-komandyrom-roty-na-peredovij/	2025-02-04T06:04:10-08:00

Russia uses explosive drones to terrorize civilians	informs the State Emergency Service of Ukraine about this. If you see a suspicious object that looks like an explosive drone, under no circumstances approach it or try to touch it. Instead, report the find immediately to 101 or 102.

Transfer through Army+: the MOU explained the difference between orders and orders	In the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine explained what are the differences between these documents and how their implementation is controlled. For officers, the Personnel Center of the Armed Forces prepares a transfer order. At the same time, there are orders for private, senior and non-commissioned officers. Both documents are mandatory. Orders and transfer orders can currently take up to two weeks to form and finalize. However, it is important to distinguish between these documents. When contacting the military unit, the soldier or sergeant should ask for the transfer order itself. In Army+, cases are recorded when the order is already ready, but the soldiers are still not transferred, waiting for the order. When changing the place of service, the order does not indicate the position of a military person. Only name, title, part number and taxpayer card number are provided. Thus, if a position has changed within one military unit, this is not an obstacle to transfer. This is a violation of the right of a serviceman, because orders and orders are mandatory. The Central Office for the Protection of Servicemen's Rights together with the military administration bodies respond to possible cases of commanders ignoring the execution of orders and monitor their execution. If the military unit received an order or order, but ignores their implementation, it is necessary to report this to Army+. The MOU noted that the Central Department for the Protection of Servicemen's Rights will receive the appeal and will monitor the implementation of the order or transfer order. Previously, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine published an explanation of the transfer mechanism in the Army+ application, as well as the reasons why delays may occur.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/04/perevedennya-cherez-armiya-u-mou-poyasnyly-chym-vidriznyayutsya-nakazy-j-rozporyadzhennya/	2025-02-04T05:06:13-08:00

A record number of Russians are looking for their missing people in Ukraine: the -I want to find- pr...	This is reported by Coordinating Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War. During the month, 8,548 requests for information on missing soldiers of the army of the aggressor country were received. This is 22% more compared to the previous month, which is the highest figure for the entire duration of the project. -I want to find- is a separate project of the Coordination Headquarters, which was launched in January 2024 with the goal of facilitating the exchange of prisoners of war. During the project's operation, it received more than 60,000 inquiries about missing Russian servicemen. It is important to note that this figure does not include the dead and is only part of the real number of missing Russians. According to experts, the total number of missing Russian soldiers may be 2-3 times higher, since not all families turn to the Ukrainian project. However, even this statistic is impressive. Of the 60,000 applications received, the project confirmed the captivity of 1,790 soldiers of the aggressor country, 408 of whom have already been exchanged for Ukrainian defenders. These figures are also lower than the actual number of POW invaders, as they are based solely on applications received. The increase in the number of -I want to find- requests from Russians is an eloquent testimony to the huge losses suffered by the enemy in Ukraine. This is not surprising, because Russian commanders are increasingly resorting to the tactics of -meat assaults-, sending untrained soldiers to the front, -zeroing- them and leaving the wounded on the battlefield. As reported by ArmyInform, the Russian special services and the military are increasingly trying to influence the families of Ukrainian prisoners of war. Numerous cases were recorded when the occupiers contacted relatives immediately after taking the Defender into captivity.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/04/rekordna-kilkist-rosiyan-shukaye-svoyih-znyklyh-bezvisty-v-ukrayini-proyekt-hochu-najty-otrymav-hvylyu-zapytiv/	2025-02-04T04:07:00-08:00

-Too risky-: the story of a fighter who brought his comrades out from under enemy fire	The story of the fighter's heroic deed was made public on the page of the air command -East-. The village of Liptsi, which was liberated from the invaders by the Ukrainian military for the second time, is of strategic importance. From here, the enemy could direct artillery fire on Kharkiv, so holding positions is critical. Daily artillery duels, drone attacks and small assault groups of Russians make the situation extremely tense. Logistics and unit rotation are complicated — enemy FPV drone operators control the roads. It was in such conditions that Sergeant of the Air Force Yevhen Pogozhih, together with his comrades, found himself under heavy fire when entering the position. When 50 meters to the destination, the enemy FPV drone dropped a grenade. One of the soldiers, an Air Force fighter with the call sign -Doc-, was seriously wounded. He had to be evacuated urgently. -The brothers shouted that it was too risky,- says Yevgeny. — But there was no other way out. Together with his friend, he began to carry the wounded, hiding behind the trees. However, a Russian drone spotted them and corrected the mortar fire. — The real mortar horror began. The mine fell a few meters away from me. He was wounded in the knee and face. If it weren't for the means of protection, I wouldn't have survived, Yevhen recalls. Despite the danger, the brothers managed to be carried to the evacuation vehicle. Ukrainian soldiers continue to put pressure on the occupiers, causing them significant losses. According to Yevhen, the motivation of Ukrainian defenders is extremely high, and each of them knows what they are fighting for. Sergeant Pogozhih has been in the Air Force since 2006. After his release in 2019, he briefly returned to civilian life, but with the start of a full-scale invasion, he again joined the ranks of the defenders. His wife also serves in the radio engineering troops, so she understands well what it means to be in the military at this time. Yevhen is currently undergoing treatment. The medical commission and doctors' decisions are ahead. But his fighting spirit remained indomitable: - There is something to fight for. So go for Victory! As reported by ArmyInform, when the full-scale invasion began, George - bijczya-shho-ne-znaye-slova-vidpochynok/->pensioner, military reserve- did not hesitate for a minute. He immediately applied for service in the Steel Border border brigade and returned to the fight for Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/04/zanadto-ryzykovano-istoriya-bijczya-yakyj-vynis-pobratyma-z-pid-vorozhogo-vognyu/	2025-02-04T01:06:09-08:00
National resistance: how Ukraine is building a comprehensive defense system	This is about in the notification of the Ministry of Defense. From the experience of repelling the armed aggression of the Russian Federation, Ukraine has rethought its approaches to protecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the state. One of the powerful tools for countering the Russian aggressor was the concept of national resistance, a system that unites the efforts of the military, civil authorities and citizens in the fight for the independence of Ukraine. -For the third year already, our military has been restraining the enemy Russian army, which has carried out a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. All citizens of Ukraine should help the Defense Forces,- emphasized First Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Lieutenant General Ivan Havryliuk. According to him, this is both the maintenance of law and order and countering saboteurs in the government-controlled territories, and assistance to the Special Operations Forces in the temporarily occupied Ukrainian lands. -In order for Victory to come closer, every Ukrainian must realize his role in the defense of the state during hostilities and in emergency situations. We must strengthen military-patriotic education, which forms a stable motivation to protect the Motherland,- he assured. National resistance is a set of measures aimed at protecting Ukraine by maximally involving its citizens. National resistance gives every Ukrainian an opportunity to contribute to the defense of the state. The main goal is to increase the state's defense capability, provide Ukraine's defense with an all-encompassing character, and help ensure the readiness of Ukrainian citizens for national resistance. The system of leadership of the national resistance is built in such a way as to ensure clear coordination of all components of the resistance. At the head is the President of Ukraine as the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, who exercises leadership through the Minister of Defense of Ukraine. National resistance has three components, each of which performs its specific tasks. The first is territorial defense, which protects important facilities, maintains law and order, and counters subversive groups in controlled territory. The second component is the resistance movement that operates in the territories where Ukrainian sovereignty needs to be restored. This may include both information operations and physical opposition to the occupiers. The third component is the preparation of citizens for national resistance. This component of the system provides people with the necessary knowledge and skills to protect their land. It includes both military training and emergency training. Territorial defense units perform a wide range of tasks: from guarding important facilities to countering subversive groups. In emergency situations, they help rescuers and ensure the safety of the civilian population. An important task of territorial defense is also participation in strengthening the protection of the state border and creating conditions for the safe functioning of authorities. In wartime, ground defense units often become the first line of defense for their communities against various threats. Territorial defense also takes an active part in information confrontation, carrying out measures to counter enemy information operations. In addition, it helps in the provision of assistance to the population, which is especially important in the conditions of martial law. Territorial defense has three interrelated components: The military component includes military management bodies, military units of the Territorial Defense Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, other forces and means of the Security Forces and Defense Forces involved in the performance of territorial defense tasks. The civil component includes bodies of state power and local self-government. They provide administrative support, coordination of the population and resolution of territorial defense measures. The military-civilian component is the headquarters of territorial defense zones (districts) and voluntary formations of territorial communities. They are a connecting link between military and civilian structures. The territorial defense management system is built on a clear hierarchical principle. At the national level, leadership is exercised by the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces through the Commander of the Territorial Defense Forces. Within the borders of the land military zone, leadership is exercised by the heads of regional military administration bodies through the relevant headquarters. Each zone and district of territorial defense has its own leaders and headquarters, which coordinate actions at the local level. The resistance movement is a component of the national resistance, which operates where it is necessary to restore the sovereignty of Ukraine over the temporarily occupied territory. Its main tasks include forming a resistance network, conducting special operations and creating obstacles to the actions of the occupiers. An important function of the resistance movement is to carry out informational and psychological operations and to carry out intelligence activities. Specific work methods are protected by state secrets. The leadership of the resistance movement is carried out by the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces through the Commander of the Special Operations Forces. The preparation of citizens for national resistance is aimed at forming citizens' patriotic consciousness, mastering practical skills and skills to protect their state. The main tasks include the formation of citizens' understanding of their role in the defense of Ukraine, training in actions in the conditions of hostilities and emergency situations. Special attention is paid to military-patriotic education, which forms a stable motivation to protect the Motherland. The leadership of the preparation of Ukrainian citizens for national resistance is carried out by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine through the relevant central bodies of the executive power.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/04/naczionalnyj-sprotyv-yak-ukrayina-rozbudovuye-vseohoplyuyuchu-systemu-oborony/	2025-02-04T00:51:11-08:00
-TCKashniks- do not exist: language betrays the enemy	Many of these terms betray the enemy immediately, because their meaning and purpose are obvious. If someone uses the terms -Ukrainian Nazis-, -Ukrainian militants-, -hokhlopiteks-, -banderlogs- and the like in their speech or in posts or comments on social networks, it is clear to everyone that this is done by the Russian occupiers or their henchmen. However, there are apparently neutral terms that are aimed at distorting reality and filling it with meanings beneficial to Russian propagandists. For example, at the beginning of the large-scale invasion, the mass propaganda media of the Russian occupiers tried to use the term -ZSUShniks- to designate the servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Used exclusively in a negative context, this term did not take root in Ukrainian social networks, because despite its pretended neutrality, it tried to replace and stand in for other objective and positive definitions in the speech: -Ukrainian military-, -servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine-, -defenders- and others. Having failed in the task of discrediting the entire Ukrainian army and its servicemen, enemy propagandists and numerous bots have focused their efforts on undermining its foundation — the territorial centers of recruitment and social support. The main goal of the enemy was the disruption of mobilization, and the means used by Russian propagandists were provocations against servicemen of the TCC and SP and artificially exaggerating in the information space those cases when the servicemen of the Armed Forces were unable to resist them. From just a few isolated cases to hundreds of thousands of calmly and correctly mobilized conscript citizens of Ukraine, Russian propagandists have created a fictitious image of demonized -manhunters- who seem to only do what they do by twisting and beating civilians in the rear. At the level of language, this image of the enemy was fixed with the help of the term -TCKashniki- to denote servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine who are serving in the territorial centers of recruitment and social support. Russian propagandists began to artificially contrast -TCKashniks- with defenders from the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Instead, in fact, the opposition of military personnel who serve in the TCC and SP and all other structures, parts, units and units within the Armed Forces of Ukraine is artificial and harmful in nature. There are no -TCC cashiers- — there are servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine who are currently serving in the TCC and SP. And before that, many of them served in combat units and were injured during combat missions. It is impossible at the same time to support the Armed Forces and throw mud at the servicemen of the TCC and SP, applying the derogatory term -TCKashniki- to them. Anyone who denigrates servicemen from the territorial recruitment and social support centers is actually directly opposing the Armed Forces of Ukraine. This means that Ukraine is a direct enemy of the Ukrainian people and the state.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/04/tczkashnykiv-ne-isnuye-voroga-vydaye-mova/	2025-02-04T00:32:10-08:00

He didn't ask if he could - he just stood up: the story of a fighter who doesn't know the word -rest...	The story of the fighter was made public on the DPSU page. Giorgii says that his decision to return to the army was completely conscious: -When I heard that the Steel Border was being created, I immediately applied. I was waiting for orders and was ready to engage in combat work.- The combat routine of his unit is a daily confrontation with the enemy, who uses the latest technology, intelligence, drones and advanced weapons. However, Ukrainian defenders constantly adapt and find effective methods of struggle. The enemy tries to test his weapons on Ukrainian soldiers, but our soldiers quickly analyze his tactics and give a worthy response. -Ukraine is a place where the aggressor tests the maximum of its innovations. But we don't just keep hitting, we learn and improve our tactics.- According to George, high-quality fire support is of great importance. Drones, artillery, mortars and strike drones help destroy the enemy and protect our soldiers. -The calculations of the attack drones -Vampire- showed themselves very well in battle. They allow not only to inflict fire damage, but also to remotely mine the territory where it is impossible for sappers to reach.- When enemy equipment moves to Ukrainian positions, fighters can remotely install up to a hundred mines, which greatly complicates the enemy's offensive. Despite the high combat training and coherence of the unit, George admits that the hardest thing is losing comrades. -When you send people on a mission, and you don't know if they will return. This is the hardest part. It's incredibly difficult.- The Russian army fights en masse, not counting its losses, but for the Ukrainian military, every fighter is not just a soldier, but a person behind whom family, friends, and a whole life stand. When asked what his greatest desire is, George gives a short answer: -To hear the word 'Victory'.- That's the most important thing for all of us.- He believes that the Ukrainian army will be able to stand and win back every meter of native land. As reported by ArmyInform, Vadim with the call sign -Popil- never planned to become a soldier. Before the Great War, he lived a quiet life in Khmelnytskyi, worked in a private firm, traded in dairy products.

Rescuing the wounded in the dark and under enemy fire: ArmiyaInform report from takmed exercises	It is almost impossible to see something in the dense darkness - it is early in Donetsk region. Actually, that's why the fighter came out right now, because it was too dangerous to do so. -I'm here, I'm the -three hundredth-!-, we hear a few meters from the exit from the shelter. Archer is injured and needs help. Fortunately, all this is just an imitation of a possible situation during real hostilities - a final check during tactical medicine exercises in the 2nd International Defense Legion of Ukraine. ArmiyaInform visited the final class and talked with the fighters and instructors. An intensive two-day training in tactical medicine for the soldiers of the Defense Forces is an initiative and one of the main areas of activity of the All-Ukrainian Association -Patriot- Public Organization. Classes are conducted by highly qualified specialists, the purpose of which is to provide primary or significantly improve the already existing skills and abilities of combatants. -Our manager and founder of the foundation, Hanna Maiboroda, has been involved in this community since 2014, since the time of the ATO. The main direction of the NGO -Patriot- is medical, training for both military and civilians. Now we go to different destinations and work with everyone who comes to meet us, because the demand and need for such trainings is extremely high,- says Nils, a representative of the organization. He is a former fighter of the 4th brigade of operational assignment -Rubizh- of the National Guard of Ukraine, was a combat medic in the -Force of Freedom- battalion, so he not only perfectly knows the theory, but also has considerable practical combat experience. Nils emphasizes that such trainings with soldiers, who are taken on rest during rotations, are extremely important, because they allow to constantly update their knowledge of tactical medicine. Important features of the trainings are work exclusively with small groups of 4-6 people, good supply of consumables and training dummies, as well as maximum approximation to real combat conditions. During the final exercise, fighters must render aid to a wounded comrade while simulating intense shelling of the position, in the dark and under conditions of heavy smoke. -Why is it important to implement this kind of approach? Because it is absolutely incorrect to train military personnel only in hothouse conditions for the reason that, unfortunately, there will not be ideal conditions in war. Soldiers need to be mentally and physically prepared for those moments that will arise during their real work,- explains former serviceman of the Defense Forces of Ukraine, tactical medicine instructor Andrian. That is why the fighters spend the second day of training -in the field-, helping the wounded in full combat gear and with weapons in their hands. The training is so close to reality that they need not to remove, but to cut off the uniform from the wounded - training clothes, as well as all other consumables, are provided by the NGO -Patriot-. -We use individual first-aid kits of fighters and various mannequins - for tamponade with simulated bleeding, for needle decompression, fully equipped in accordance with all requirements and standards. In the final session, we dress the wounded in second-hand clothes that can be cut, and also add simulation of explosions and smoke using airsoft and smoke grenades,- says Nils. The instructors are very satisfied with the work of the fighters during training. This is not surprising, because even an outside observer immediately notices how the students do not just perform a number, but take the initiative and ask the instructors to further explain some aspect or practice an educational exercise. -The guys are very well involved in the work. I really like that they always have questions, they talk about some situations from their own experience, they ask to comment on unclear points. Often at first they believe that they already know everything and we will not teach them anything new. But then during classes, we see how their eyes light up, how they want to work,- says Andrian. The final session must be held late in the evening, because, as experience shows, the front freezes during the day and all the events take place at night. Therefore, it is very important that fighters know how to provide first aid in the dark. Also, in the evening, after intensive training, they are already tired, and they will have to rescue a wounded comrade when they are tired. -Today we worked all day in the field in full ammunition, worked out the full MARCH algorithm and individual elements of assistance. And now (during the final class — ed.) we gathered all our knowledge together and fully practiced rescuing the wounded, giving him first aid and preparing him for evacuation,- says one of the fighters of the 2nd International Legion, who just completed training. He is satisfied with his studies, but he hopes that he will not need to use the acquired knowledge in real life: -Thank God, all these are now stickers, shams, dummies. In reality, it would be terrible. However, it is better to know and be able to never need it, than not to know what to do when the need arises.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/04/poryatunok-poranenyh-u-temryavi-ta-pid-vorozhym-vognem-reportazh-armiyainform-z-navchan-po-takmedu/	2025-02-03T20:46:52-08:00
A fighter on miniatures: the appearance of a UAV interceptor drone, similar to a fifth-generation ai...	As noted, not without a certain amount of boasting, on the official portal of the developer firm from the American city of Brighton , in Colorado, this next-generation jet-powered interceptor shares common features with the Lockheed F-35B stealth fighter and F-22 of the 5th generation, ArmyInform reports. The device has a length of 1.8 m, a wingspan of 1.5 m and flies at speeds of up to 320 km/h. A jet engine simulator is installed on it - an electric motor rotates turbines, which creates thrust. According to the plan, the machine will receive its own vertical takeoff system (eVTOL, Electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing). It is designed to detect, track, identify and neutralize enemy drones. According to the plan of the developers, the CobraJet will have the possibility of vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) and a nozzle with a thrust vector, which provides increased maneuverability. The interceptor is equipped with VIPER air-to-air missiles, each of which has a PYTHON warhead to neutralize kamikaze drones. The authors of the UAS Vision profile site about unmanned aerial vehicles stated that the CobraJet is powered by solid-state batteries with a high energy density and equipped with flight controller/autopilot with artificial intelligence, day/night camera and inertial sensors for autonomous flight in 24/7 mode. In addition, it is powered by an -electric jet engine-, a system consisting of in-duct turbines driven by an electric motor to create thrust. VTOL capability allows the CobraJet to launch from mobile platforms such as trucks, ships or other aircraft such as C-130. The SkyDefense Command and Control (C2) control system integrates VRAM (Visual Real-Time Terrain Monitoring). VRAM uses an artificial intelligence-based operating system to quickly analyze data from CobraJets and involve operators in decision-making. In addition, CobraJet drones are designed to maintain operational efficiency even in challenging electromagnetic environments, thanks to advanced anti-jamming radios and GPS receivers that provide reliable communication and navigation in jammed conditions. To further enhance their capabilities, satellite communications systems such as Starlink are being explored, offering the potential for uninterrupted communications and increased effectiveness in electronic warfare scenarios, even in remote or highly competitive areas. -Our CobraJet neutralizes enemy UAVs with airborne munitions and returns to base to rearm. This approach significantly reduces the cost of counter-drone operations, while maintaining stealth and effectiveness against new threats, including unmanned ground vehicles,- SkyDefense President Nick Verini was quoted as saying by American news resource on unmanned aerial systems UASweekly. The product also offers a mobile configuration suitable for law enforcement, Department of Homeland Security and Defense and military applications, according to SkyDefense. In this configuration, the C2 and VRAM systems are housed in tactical or militarized cyber trucks designed to operate in extreme environments with low acoustic and thermal signatures to avoid enemy detection. If you believe the promises of SkyDefense, its new device should be presented to potential customers already in the second quarter of 2025. In this case, it will become a revolution in the military, since this device is a universal hunter for drones and ground robots. Intrigue is fueled by the fact that, apart from low-quality renderings, the manufacturer has not shown anything yet. In the future, according to the assurances of the SkyDefense management, it is expected that the technologies used in the CobraJet will develop in the direction of increasing its flight range, expanding the capabilities of autonomous control and integration with more complex combat control systems. In addition, SkyDefense plans to adapt its platform for civilian tasks, such as territory monitoring or emergency response. Graphic presentation of the CobraJet unmanned drone interceptor.

-Operation -Phantom subpoena-: how Ukrainians in Europe are deported by invisible special agents-	It would seem that what could be a more reliable source of information than Telegram channels with names like -Pravda UA- or -Lawyer for all-? Well, or the same -anonymous sources in the State Border Service- who work exclusively in the fantasies of panic lovers. According to the mythology of these experts, mobile groups are already operating somewhere in Poland or Germany that search for men, instantly hand them a summons and, if possible, deport them to Ukraine on the spot. Eyewitnesses (anonymous, of course) even saw men being dragged into buses similar to those taken to the resort, but without Wi-Fi. The problem is that no real case of such -extradition- has yet been confirmed. And from a legal point of view, this is just nonsense. There is no mechanism of -instant deportation- at the request of the Military Commissariat in international law. Ukrainian legislation also does not provide for the possibility of abducting its citizens on foreign territory. A separate -sensation- is the fact that Ukrainian embassies allegedly transfer the data of evaders to the local authorities, which gladly help to deport them. The reality is that embassies do not have access to lists of conscripts (otherwise they would not ask to bring documents for consular registration by hand). Also, European countries are not very happy to run around with summonses from Ukrainian cafes, because they have more important things to do. Although, perhaps, the latest Ukrainian technology actually works: summonses are transmitted via Wi-Fi at the level of a biometric passport, and they are automatically signed in the phone through Diya. That is why it is so important to go only to McDonald's, and not to suspicious Wi-Fi zones! Some even say that Ukrainian men are no longer being released from Europe without the permission of the Military Commissariat. In particular, there were several stories about the refusal to board flights due to the fact that the -passport is in the database-. And here it is interesting: if someone is already in Europe, why should he be -not released-? Does it work like this: -Sorry, you can't fly to Egypt, but we will help you - Warsaw-Kyiv flight-? The answer is simple - everyone who benefits from creating chaos. Russian bot farms that are happy to fan panic. Dodgers who are looking for an excuse. Telegram channels that need more subscribers. If these horror stories are to be believed, soon subpoenas will be sent through Privat24, and Ukrainian men will be hunted down in European supermarkets, where they are hiding among cheese discounts. But for now, the reality is this: no one issues summonses at the border, no one is deported on the lists, and Ukrainians in Europe can sleep peacefully (unless it's not very peaceful if you have to pay for an apartment in Berlin).	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/04/operacziya-prymarna-povistka-yak-ukrayincziv-u-yevropi-deportuyut-nevydymi-speczagenty/	2025-02-03T20:04:19-08:00
In Kyiv, they said goodbye to the Belarusian sniper: the story of Maria Zaitsava, who died for Ukrai...	Maria asked not to cry and not to bring flowers to her as a farewell if she dies, said reserve colonel Ruslan -Santa- Myroshnychenko, ex-commander of the Second International Legion: -Maria was a strong girl, a soldier, a volunteer. She commanded us to be courageous, strong, to fight the enemy. So, please don't cry. These are not my words, these are what she said. Let's not cry, gather together and fight. And we kill! Glory to Ukraine! Long live Belarus!- Maria joined the International Legion in November 2022. She was a combat medic for a long time. -I noticed that such a fragile girl appeared, a child in fact. I immediately paid attention, because then I thought, what is a high school student doing in my combat unit? But this high school student, relatively speaking, has a very well-formed personality, mature thoughts, and a well-formed determination to fight. She repeatedly repeated that she is not an object of pity, she wants to be a specific subject of struggle and she proved it every day,- said Ruslan Myroshnychenko. At first, she worked in the medical evacuation crew, and then as a combat medic directly at the positions. She was always very goal-oriented and constantly studied, recalls Maria, her fellow health instructor at the medical center, Sergeant Ruslan Boychuk. -She and I came to the Legion almost at the same time. They were in the same crew together, they took positions together. So we have a situation where some women become stronger than men. Men hide, but women even come from abroad. Maria could live peacefully in the Czech Republic, she lived there, she had a residence permit, but she came here,- recalls Ruslan Boychuk. According to Ruslan Myroshnichenko, he did not want to let her go directly to the position. But she convinced him that she could do it. And she saved the lives of several servicemen thanks to her coolness and composure. During one of the trips to the position, Maria was wounded. A fragment of a mine fell into her hand. But after treatment, she immediately returned to the unit. And she said she wanted to become a sniper. -So she firmly told me that that's enough, -Santa- is enough, I'm ready to kill. She had a desire to take revenge for her brothers,- recalls Ruslan Myroshnychenko. And Maria began to train as a sniper. At first, it was an improvised training ground in the East of Ukraine, and then she was sent to sniper courses. After returning from training, she performed combat missions in the Chasovoy Yar region, and then in the Pokrovsk region. She was an effective sniper. -This girl has struggled her whole life. And she died during a combat mission. She was in position until the last,- said the commander of the Second International Legion, Major Oleksandr Yakymovych. According to him, the unit presented Maria Zaitsava with the award -For Courage- (posthumously).

The enemy does not change its task to destroy the Ukrainian energy industry — the President	About this President said on February 3 in his evening address. -the Russians do not change their task to destroy the Ukrainian energy industry, they constantly strike and do so in order to adjust their strikes to the capabilities of our defense - to make it more difficult to repel. I thank all our soldiers, each and every one working to defeat this threat - our air shield, all air defense forces, mobile fire teams, all EW forces and EW developers. This is a constant rapid evolution of means of radio-electronic warfare. We have to be much faster in it,- said Volodymyr Zelenskyi. According to him, there were relevant reports at Stavka regarding the protection system, covering energy facilities, and reconstruction after the strikes. Air defense capabilities and the need for anti-missile defenses were discussed separately. -There are new tasks for our diplomacy, for the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine — to work with partners. Supply for the air defense of Ukraine is critical and must not stop. It is necessary to constantly search in the world how to strengthen protection, how to make more production of necessary things in Ukraine, how to add localization of production, how to obtain licenses from our partners. This is a big job, on which the future of Ukraine largely depends,- the President noted. As reported by ArmyInform, Volodymyr Zelensky listened to the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces and noted the soldiers of the 2 assault regiments.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/03/vorog-ne-zminyuye-svogo-zavdannya-znyshhyty-ukrayinsku-energetyku-prezydent/	2025-02-03T11:35:02-08:00

International partners have provided military ecologists with advanced equipment for chemical analys...	About this informs on February 3 the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. The equipment was transferred as part of international aid with the support of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the Swedish government. The official ceremony took place in Kyiv with the participation of the First Secretary of the Embassy of the Kingdom of Sweden in Ukraine, Nils Dahlquis, who handed over the equipment to the head of the Center of Excellence for Mine Action and Environmental Safety, Colonel Oleg Ryabchuk. Now in the arsenal of Ukrainian military ecologists there is an MX908 mass spectrometer and a Raman Serstech Arx substance identification analyzer.

If someone does not want to serve in his army, he will be -meat- in the Russian army: an expert on f...	Now the experience of wild -safari-mobilization-, tested since February 2022 in ORDLO, is being repeated there. The other day GUR released a video abuse of forcibly mobilized Ukrainians in the Russian armed forces. About why illegal conscription in the occupied territories is another war crime of Russia, says an expert of the non-governmental analytical center -Ukrainian Studies of Strategic Studies-, a candidate of political sciences and a military serviceman of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Yury Oliynyk. ― First of all, it is a flagrant violation of the Geneva Conventions and other international documents that prohibit the mobilization of the population in the occupied territory of a state with which there is a war (in particular, Article 51 of the Fourth Geneva Convention and Article 8 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court - AI). In this way, Russia cynically violates internationally accepted norms. The population that remained in the occupation is brutally used as meat, obviously targeted by people from Russia for control. This is usual for the occupier to instill fear, which is intensified by inter-ethnic confrontation - a practice that has been used for decades and even centuries according to the principle of -divide and conquer-, - believes Yuriy Oliynyk. He says that a typical example of this situation is one of the peoples of the Caucasus, the Chechens. ― In the 1990s, they fought for their freedom, in the 2000s, Moscow was able to overcome them, and many people succumbed to Russian propaganda that soon there will be peace and tranquility, there is no need to fight. Now, instead of fighting for their own freedom, they shed blood for the interests of the invader. In addition, Chechens are specifically demonized in the eyes of other enslaved peoples of the empire in order to instill fear and so that there is no trust in them, the expert explains. It is also a clear example of what can await the population in the occupied territories if the occupied territories continue to expand. ― Against the background of the Russian propaganda campaign that is currently being conducted against the mobilization in Ukraine, against the TCC and SP, we see how they will actually act if they occupy a larger territory of Ukraine. They will not take into account the opinion of the population, but will carry out forced mobilization of everyone they catch. Therefore, if someone does not want to serve in his army, then in the event of the capture of Ukraine by the enemy, he will be used as meat for the needs of the invader.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/03/yakshho-htos-ne-hoche-sluzhyty-u-svoyij-armiyi-to-bude-myasom-u-vijsku-rf-ekspert-pro-prymusovu-mobilizacziyu-na-tot/	2025-02-03T04:44:00-08:00

-Begins to hang on his opponent-: why Pokrovsky's defense resembles the 10th round of a boxing match	The spokesman of the operational and strategic Major Viktor Tregubov of the -Khortytsia- troop group. According to Viktor Tregubov, the enemy's ambitions remain unchanged — to capture the city, cut the routes to it and leave the defenders of the city without supplies. However, now the Russians do not have such a great advantage that would allow them to effectively introduce offensive actions. -If they suddenly have some new powerful reserve. If they suddenly become an absolutely unlimited number. If they have an unlimited number of vehicles, an advantage over drones, then of course this could somehow change the situation,- said the spokesman of the Khortytsia operational-strategic group of troops. But, Viktor Tregubov is sure, the situation looks like there is no such great advantage now. And an offensive for the Russians is a guaranteed four-digit number of losses in just one day. -It's a bit like a boxing match that goes to the 10th round. When both boxers are tired. But the one who attacked more actively, attacked more actively at the beginning, he was already a little more tired. He just doesn't have enough energy. And he is already starting to hang on his opponent. This is what is happening here with the Russians,- Viktor Tregubov noted. As reported by /a> ArmyInform, fighters of the 13th operational brigade of NSU -Chartiya- destroyed 15 Russian invaders, as well as an ammunition depot, a cannon, and an enemy shelter.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/03/pochynaye-vysity-na-svoyemu-supernyku-chomu-oborona-pokrovska-nagaduye-10-j-raund-bokserskogo-poyedynku/	2025-02-03T04:24:24-08:00

FPV drones on fiber optics: the SBS commander talked about ways to counter them and similar developm...	The Commander of the Unmanned Systems Forces Colonel Vadym Suharevsky told about itin an interview with Radio Liberty's -Donbas Realities- project. -If I'm not mistaken, we recorded the first use of such drones by the enemy at the beginning of summer. Then there was a certain decline and now an active phase again. This is exactly the stage of the Cold War, when the arms race is based on the fact that something effective is invented, and the other side will come up with a way to counter it,- he noted. According to him, it is now a step behind the Ukrainian side. -We must use this technology to our advantage and find an effective means of combating it. I will announce in advance that certain ideas and results are already planned. After a journey of testing and scaling, I think we'll get there. Yes, this is a really dangerous weapon,- said the SBS commander. Vadym Sukharevskii noted that this is, on the one hand, a revolutionary approach, since all EW systems, on which billions of money have been spent, are ineffective against FPV drones on fiber optics. On the other hand, this tool constrains the occupiers in a maneuver, so the way to fight it can be effective when building a normal countermeasure system. -Our guys are already learning, they're already adapting to these drones.

-Stolen heritage-: GUR presented a database of cultural values ​​stolen by Russia	This is reported by the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. The event was attended by representatives of the European Commission, UNESCO and 28 partner countries, 19 of which were represented at the level of ministers and deputy ministers of culture. The public database -Stolen Heritage- was created by the joint efforts of the Ministry of Education and Culture of Ukraine, the Ministry of Culture and Information Policy of Ukraine, and the expert community. It became operational at the beginning of October 2024 and is available on the War &amp; Sanctions. Currently, the database contains information on 828 objects of cultural heritage stolen by the Russian occupiers and almost 300 individuals and organizations involved. The information is constantly updated and supplemented. -The destruction and appropriation of the cultural heritage of Ukraine is an element of the Russian Federation's large-scale aggression. Russia's goal is to deprive the Ukrainian people of their right to exist by destroying their national memory and identity, appropriating history,- said a representative of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine during the presentation. The publication of information about cultural values ​​and works of art stolen by Russia is an important tool in the fight against their illegal circulation and the policy of cultural genocide on the part of the aggressor state.

The Commander of the Unmanned Systems Forces Colonel Vadym Suharevsky told about itin an interview with Radio Liberty's -Donbas Realities- project. -As for planning and intelligence - yes, it is there, it is being conducted.

It's effective, and we really know, can and know how to detect different types of systems and hit them accordingly,- he said. According to him, the -Baba Yaga- drone-bomber, infamous for the enemy, hit the Russian -Buk-M3- at a distance of 57 kilometers from the front line. -What's more, he was found literally 40 minutes before his injury. Our -bombers-, the units that use them, show an example of extraordinary efficiency,- added Vadym Sukharevskyi. He noted that in the last two months alone, the Nemesis unit hit more than 15 units of the precious BUK-M3, Thor and other enemy targets. -Just yesterday, our unit effectively hit an enemy tank at a depth of more than 34 kilometers. It's an FPV,- the SBS commander said. He said that the confirmed and possible depth of operation of the Unmanned Systems Forces today is more than 2,000 kilometers. -Accordingly, depending on the tasks, we will develop technologies in the future. My task is to make the state and the army strong, ready for any future war,- Vadym Sukharevskyi emphasized.

-The guys at the gun are counting on me-: the story of the wounding and return to the front of a sol...	The story of the fighter published on the page of the 148th separate artillery brigade of the Airborne Assault troops of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. On February 23, 2022, he was at the -No Limits- concert, feeling an uneasy feeling. The next morning the war began. The first thing Vadim did was to evacuate his family. Friends and acquaintances who passed the ATO advised not to rush to the military commissariat - -your turn will come.- And it came in the spring of 2023. Vadym was designated as a driver in the artillery brigade of the Airborne Assault Troops at the Military Commissariat. -I've been driving all my life, so this position didn't come as a surprise,- he recalls. But the war quickly taught that the ability to drive is only a small part of the tasks that have to be performed. Every week, Popil and his brothers drive more than a thousand kilometers with ammunition on broken roads and sticky fields. He not only delivers the shells, but also helps move the guns after the battle. Rollover is always a danger, because the enemy has already calculated the position and can strike at any moment. -Sometimes we invest in 15-20 minutes, and sometimes we get stuck for an hour,- he says. Another feature of the job is constant waiting. -We can sit in the landing at midnight with a full body of shells, waiting for the moment when the enemy will give us a window for safe unloading. Sometimes you have to hide and wait for shelling, because you can't retreat - the infantry is counting on us.- Also, a lot in the lives of gunners is weather dependent. -We are constantly monitoring the weather. If, for example, there will be a full moon at 11:00 p.m., we need to do everything before the enemy gets better visibility.- But this is a two-sided game - the Russians work according to the same principle. War does not allow relaxation. -It was even calmer in Zaporozhye. But not now. FPV drones have become our daily threat. Air defense and electronic warfare do not see everything. On the day when an FPV flew into our car, we were already far away from the firing range, we were driving without headlights with a night lamp, and even the command said that there was no threat. But an enemy drone found us and hit the roof.- The impact came between him and the driver. -My left side was injured, his right side. Shrapnel wounds, lacerations, contusions. They helped each other, our pick-up truck picked us up and quickly took us to the headquarters.- Despite the injuries, Vadim returned to his work. -It was difficult. When I was driving on a fire road after treatment, I even had a panic attack. But the fear passes. When it's hard, I think about my relatives and about the guys at the gun - they count on me, and the infantry counts on the artillery. Here, everything is interconnected.- Work without days off. In addition to shells, they carry food and parcels. Constantly optimizing routes to make them faster and safer. And every night before going to sleep, Vadim remembers the day he experienced. -When CABs fly nearby, you are covered with earth and debris, and even the windows of the cars are intact - you understand that God protects us.- For his service, Vadym was awarded the Iron Cross medal. -What does she mean to me? It's more for my baby. Dad's pride.- As reported by ArmyInform, 28-year-old Oleksandr with the call sign -German- is drona-bomber operator 128 separate of the Transcarpathian Mountain Assault Brigade. Before Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, he worked at a mining and beneficiation plant in Kryvyi Rih.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/03/hlopczi-bilya-garmaty-rozrahovuyut-na-mene-istoriya-poranennya-ta-povernennya-na-front-bijczya-z-pozyvnym-popil/	2025-02-03T02:43:45-08:00

Instead of the ring, the front: how the kickboxer -Aras- stood up for Ukraine	The story of the fighter was made public on the DPSU page. Denys recalls that the military theme fascinated him since childhood: -In kindergarten, when there were performances, they asked what you want to be when you grow up.

This was reported by the commander of the 429th separate regiment on the -Suspilne.Novyny- broadcast. of unmanned systems -Achilles- Yury Fedorenko. According to Yuriy Fedorenko, having a huge number of personnel, the enemy uses -quite interesting- tactics. People are the cheapest expenditure material for them, so it is constantly thrown forward. -The enemy is constantly trying to conduct combat reconnaissance in order to find us on the front line. And in the case of detection, fire damage begins to be actively carried out in the place where the fire came from. Due to its drones, artillery and many other things. The Defense Forces are used to such tactics,- he said. In addition, in order to accelerate the offensive, from time to time the Russians continue to use armored vehicles.

A saboteur who was preparing a terrorist attack on the railway was detained in the Rivne region	This is reported by the Security Service of Ukraine. However, the attacker did not even have time to install the SVP, because the SBU detained him near the track -in the act of red-handed-. According to the case materials, the agent turned out to be an unemployed 23-year-old resident of Lviv Oblast, who had already been prosecuted for vandalism at the burial sites of Ukrainian soldiers. He came to the attention of the FSB as an ideological supporter of racism and because of his desire to leave for Russia, which he repeatedly wrote on social networks. As the investigation established, the suspect received step-by-step instructions from his Russian curators: to arrive in Rivne region, take the explosives from the cache and install them according to the specified coordinates on the tracks. During the investigation, evidence was obtained of the suspect's performance of another task — he collected information about the locations of the bases of units of the Defense Forces in Lviv Oblast.

How to choose a weapon that will not let you down: tips from a special agent -Den-	This is discussed in the post on the brigade page. According to -Dan-, his favorite assault rifle is the Colt M4. He calls it a -simple, time-tested classic- and notes its reliability, ease of use and -survival-. -More than 50% of its reliability, survivability, etc. depends on the operator himself,- says the fighter. He emphasizes that weapons must be carefully cared for and protected from external influences, especially in an aquatic environment. -Dan- said that working in the water requires the use of sealed bags or summaries that contain quality lubricant, cleaning agents and a special nozzle to prevent dirt from entering the barrel. Regarding the choice of weapons for various tasks, the fighter noted that he takes the M4 both for land and underwater operations. Although, he said, he might occasionally use the 5.56mm M249 SAW light machine gun. -I find the AR-15-based carbine with a barrel up to 12 inches, with a gas tube instead of a piston, to be the most versatile for a wide range of tasks. -In my case, it's an M4 carbine with an 11.7- barrel,- -Dan- said. He also shared his experience with various weapons including the Canadian C8, SCAR, Haenel and Daniel Defense. -My main principle for choosing a weapon is that it should be tested by time and harsh operating conditions, and it should be based on accumulated practical experience of use by other shooters in different situations. I don't want to learn about the -nuances- of the weapon sample already during the task. A banal delay when shooting at one operator can frame the whole group,- the fighter emphasized. According to him, operators can have different rifles in one group, but the whole group can also be equipped with the same rifles in the same configuration. The choice of weapon depends on the task, the time of day, the area of ​​operation, as well as the attachments on the rifle, such as the LCV, optical/collimator sights, thermal imaging attachments/thermal sights, and flip-up magnifiers. As the Army reported, fighters of the 73rd SSO center in Kurshchyna /->hit the enemy's personnel and equipment with all available means.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/03/yak-obraty-zbroyu-yaka-ne-pidvede-porady-vid-speczpryznachenczya-dena/	2025-02-03T00:29:29-08:00

The old is liquidated, the new is not created: what kind of military justice does Ukraine need. Expe...	After all, can civilian investigators and prosecutors professionally investigate case materials related to the military and military cases, and civilian judges - deliver a fair verdict? Yes, the Verkhovna Rada is currently working on draft laws on the military police and military specialization of judges, which are intended to bring the creation of the military justice system closer. ArmyInform asked a lawyer, a military officer of the Armed Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Oleksandr Musienko, about the need to create a system of military justice. He states: the issue of the creation and functioning of the military justice system is long overdue. -Unfortunately, judicial and law enforcement reforms that were taking place did not take into account the growth of challenges and those related to Russian aggression, starting from 2014. What's more: the existing system of military justice - the courts and the prosecutor's office - were effectively liquidated, and no fully functioning institutions were created in their place. During this time, the defense and security sector was only growing. Accordingly, a lot of issues arose that required legal settlement, as well as correct interpretation and assessment of the actions of military commanders and military personnel. There were also signs of the problem of considering criminal proceedings related to military service and repelling Russian aggression. It even caused indignation in society and questions in the military sphere,- says Oleksandr Musienko. According to him, the questions that most often arose and still arise in this context: can law enforcement agencies or courts that do not have specialized knowledge in the military field properly evaluate the actions of a military commander, taking into account all the specifics of conducting hostilities. -The other side of the issue is that the military could be indignant over the fact that they can be evaluated by people who have not received appropriate training or have professional experience related to the military,- says Oleksandr Musienko. He emphasizes that he studied the experience of the existing systems of NATO countries, partners of Ukraine. -Full-fledged military justice systems exist in the USA, Canada, Great Britain (with their own peculiarities). France even has a separate code for the military, the Code of Military Justice. These countries introduced a system of military justice also because their armies had the experience of participating in hostilities. This made it possible to make sure that this is the best way to settle legal issues that arise in the course of hostilities, as well as bringing servicemen to justice,- the interlocutor comments. The system of military justice (with its own peculiarities - ed.) also exists in Israel. -For example, in addition to the relevant legislation and the regulation of the activities of the military, there is also an institute of military legal advisers, who help the command to make decisions, observing the norms of international humanitarian law, the need to act in accordance with the internal legislation of Israel,- says Oleksandr Musienko. According to different estimates, he says, more than a million people are involved in the defense and security sector in Ukraine today. -Active hostilities continue, many questions arise regarding the interpretation of the norms of military legislation and their correct application. The law enforcement function can also be singled out as a separate item. Military specifics require specialists to have professional experience and knowledge in this particular field. In order to fully assess the actions of a fighter during hostilities, knowledge and experience are necessary. This is definitely capable of improving the application of legislation, maintaining law and order in the Defense and Security Forces, reducing the burden on the law enforcement system and the court, which have to conduct investigations and consider many other categories of cases,- the interlocutor emphasizes. He emphasizes again: -The creation of a full-fledged system of military justice is more than justified. Moreover, it is necessary to have a closed cycle in this area. That is: the military police, the prosecutor's office and the courts. If not the creation of military courts, then at least the introduction of specializations for judges who consider the relevant categories of cases. These specializations should include training courses, training and consideration of exclusively categories of cases in the military sphere. Therefore, passing the necessary laws is very important.- Oleksandr Musienko adds that the creation of a military justice system will solve the issue of better enforcement of the relevant norms of current legislation, as well as military law. -In addition, the question of the fairness of consideration of certain high-profile cases will be removed, or at least minimized. The best experience of our partners will also be taken into account,- the lawyer and military officer summarized. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/03/stare-likvidovane-nove-ne-stvorene-yaka-vijskova-yustycziya-potribna-ukrayini-ekspert-pro-svitovyj-dosvid/	2025-02-02T20:57:18-08:00
An island with hypersonic ambitions: Taiwan has developed a rocket that travels more than 2,000 kilo...	As reported by reporters of the local publication Liberty Times, the ammunition -Qingtian- is a development of engineers of the Academy of Sciences of this partially recognized island state, ArmyInform reports. In turn, experts from the Dutch defense portal Army Recognition, who studied this project, noted that the newest missile is based on programs Yunfeng and Yungeng II, originally designed for a range of 1,200 to 2,000 kilometers. The hypersonic complex was named Qingtian (-Qingtian-) - literally -Blue Field- in translation. It is interesting that one of the counties of the Chinese province of Zhejiang, located on the coast of the East China Sea, has the same name. Perhaps the creators of the project wanted to hint at the combat capabilities of the missile and its range. -Qingtian represents advances in propulsion, navigation and guidance technologies, increasing range, speed and operational flexibility. Mass production of the Qingtian began in late 2024, with initial units already delivered to the Taiwan Air Force's missile brigades,- Army Recognition said. The National Chung Shan Institute of Science and Technology (NCSIST) led the development of Qingtian. Thanks to the use of composite ceramic materials, the rocket can withstand extreme conditions associated with speeds in excess of Mach 6. These characteristics allow it to avoid air defense systems and expand its operational application. According to published data, the Qingtian missile complex is the result of further development of the existing systems of the Yunfeng series. Already developed solutions and ideas were used within the framework of the new project, and new components and technologies were also introduced. Thanks to this, it was possible to maintain continuity, as well as to obtain a significant increase in the main tactical and technical characteristics. The main element of the -Qingtian- complex is the missile of the same name. Its exact appearance and parameters, for obvious reasons, still remain unknown. However, some data are available that allow us to make estimates and assumptions. The Qingtian is a land-based missile designed for use on a variety of launchers. In flight, the product develops a speed of at least 6 M, which allows it to be classified as hypersonic. The flight range reaches 2000 km. For comparison, missiles of the Yunfen series have a speed of no more than 4-5 M and a range of about 1-1.2 thousand. km According to the available data, the Taiwanese missile is similar to some foreign developments in its technical appearance. She received a fuselage of a characteristic shape with a pointed nose and a special air intake. There are probably planes to create lift in horizontal flight. The glider of the product is manufactured using alloys and other materials resistant to high mechanical and thermal loads. -Liberty Times- reports that, for this purpose, CSIST and related organizations have conducted several additional research works. The dimensions and mass of the rocket remain unknown. At the same time, some features of the compatible launcher are reported. Based on these data, it can be assumed that the length of the missile reaches 10-12 m. The mass is not less than several tons. Qingtian will be deployed on both fixed launch systems and mobile platforms, increasing survivability against potential pre-emptive strikes. The Czech-made Tatra Force 12X12 trucks were chosen for their off-road ability, adaptability to mountainous terrain and maneuverability. If Czech purchases face difficulties, the American Oshkosh M983 is an alternative platform. The adoption of mobile launchers marks a departure from previous trailer-mounted systems in line with modern military trends favoring autonomous launchers. The Qingtian program builds on decades of work on Taiwan's long-range strike capabilities, originating from the Yunfeng program. Despite challenges such as technical issues with guidance systems and international restrictions under the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), the program has made significant progress since key restrictions were eased in 2023. This mitigation, facilitated by agreements with the United States, gave Taiwan access to critical precision targeting and movement components, increasing the Qingtian's accuracy and range. Taiwan's defense initiatives also include the domestic production of submarines and research into advanced propulsion technologies such as the Hypersonic Jet Propulsion Engine for future hypersonic applications. These efforts diversify Taiwan's missile inventory and meet a variety of tactical and strategic requirements. Taiwan's missile advances have come in response to China's increasing military pressure. According to the US Department of Defense, the People's Liberation Army Missile Force (PLARF) currently has more than 3,000 ballistic missiles, including 400 intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), such as the DF-5, DF-31, and DF-41, which have a range exceeds 12,000 kilometers. The PLARF also operates 900 short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs), 1,300 medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBMs), 500 intermediate-range ballistic missiles (IRBMs) and 400 ground-launched cruise missiles (GLCMs). These systems include dual-purpose missiles such as the DF-26, DF-17 equipped with a hypersonic cruise warhead, and the CJ-100 with a range of 3,000 to 4,000 kilometers. The Qingtian missile, with a range of about 2,000 kilometers, can target strategic targets in mainland China. Expert reports show that its reach extends to areas north of Beijing, including Hohhot in Inner Mongolia. This range covers important political and military centers, including Beijing and other urban and industrial centers. The Qingtian deployment gives Taiwan the ability to deal with critical areas in northern China, strengthening its overall defense strategy. Hypersonic missiles, including the Qingtian, challenge existing defense systems due to their speed, maneuverability and low-altitude flight path. When able to be in flight at a speed of more than Mach 5, they reduce the reaction time to interception. Unlike ballistic missiles, which follow predictable trajectories, hypersonic systems perform evasive maneuvers, making detection and tracking more difficult. Their low-altitude profiles further evade radar detection, requiring advanced interception technologies to counter their threat. It should be recalled that Ukraine will continue to adhere to the principle of one China in the issue of Taiwan. This was once again emphasized by the Ukrainian side during personal meetings. > the leadership of the foreign policy departments of our state and the People's Republic of China in July 2024. Taiwan strengthens defenses with hypersonic missiles.

Training of paratroopers at the BZVP: the instructor of the DSHV talked about the peculiarities of t...	Six o'clock in the morning. Getting up, charging, after breakfast, the mobilized go to training sessions. Lunch break, classes again. And until the very evening. This is how basic military training goes 24/7, 45 days. -Smoke, fire, shots, sounds from shell explosions. So that it does not happen all around, the paratrooper must be focused and steadfast. Keep the combat mission in your head that needs to be accomplished,- the tactics lesson goes. Platoon commander Rostislav talks about the peculiarities of the combat situation on the front line. — Enemy drones are a threat from the air. You need to constantly watch the sky. The adversary is now massively using FPV drones with drops, he continues. Cadets are divided into small groups of 15-20 people. While some are learning tactics, others are mastering mine and explosive business. Another group moves to the trenches for practical actions - repelling the enemy's offensive. Rostislav is 25 years old. He is from the Dnipropetrovsk region, graduated from the National University of Civil Defense of Ukraine in Kharkiv. Worked in a mine. From 2021 in the Armed Forces of Ukraine. His story is unique. With training at a military department and an officer's rank behind him, he enlisted as an ordinary soldier. Didn't say anything about his -military- experience. He says: he wanted to experience on his own skin what it was like to go from a simple soldier to an officer. Joined the ranks of the 25th separate Sicheslav Airborne Brigade. He was trained at the same Training Center. I went to Avdiivka, to the area of ​​combat missions, as a simple marksman-sniper of the reconnaissance company. This was exactly half a year before the large-scale invasion. Then he carried out combat missions in Verkhnyotoretsk and Soledar. They offered to become an instructor to train future paratroopers. Already here in Zhytomyr, they were given the rank of officer. -Everything is real. First of all, it depends on the desire of the mobilized servicemen themselves. From their motivation to defend Ukraine and readiness to destroy enemies. Here at the Training Center, the instructors will go out of their way to train the cadets to perform extremely difficult combat missions and kill the Rashists. Moreover, the duration of BZVP should be increased now. 45 days is of course much better than one month. We start the preparation with certain basics. First of all, this is fire training: the boys master the Kalashnikov assault rifle, AGS, RPG, as well as RPK, DShK and Browning M2 machine guns. We put a lot of emphasis on classes in tactical medicine, engineering training and tactics. These are the four aspects that are most important in education today. We use tactics every day. Cadets master the tactics of actions in the composition of departments in defense and offense. This is movement, deployment in battle order, rush from equipment and passes in all the main ways. Analyzing the experience of combat operations with the enemy, especially in the context of the use on the front of small assault groups, recruits learn actions during a confrontation with the enemy. They fire at short distances, practice trench clearing. They are opposed by other groups of military personnel, as they imitate the Rashists. Then we change the scenario, those who were defending are already advancing. The deeper a soldier digs into the ground and properly arranges the dugout, the more likely he is to survive during shelling. We have been teaching this simple truth of engineering training to cadets since the first days of BZVP. In battle, situations sometimes occur that our guys are saved not by a machine gun, but by a shovel. Anti-aircraft missiles, drops from drones, fire from tanks, mortars and other artillery: this is what the enemy uses to attack our positions. And it is logical that shelters should be properly arranged and deep holes should be dug. This will save the lives of paratroopers. We teach the mobilized to set up firing points, trenches and strongholds. Plus topography and communication. The ability to communicate correctly and in a timely manner at the front line. Using our own examples, we tell the boys that they should prepare for the most difficult. The men who come to us for the BZVP often do not understand what is being asked of them here, they do not have the motivation to defend the country. Many say something like: -We are simple people, we worked in -peaceful- professions and were not born for war at all.- What we do right away: sit down and talk to every recruit. We determine his psychotype, whether he volunteered himself or was served with a summons. We convey to them the importance of protecting Ukraine from the aggressor, we say that it is necessary to change those guys who have been at the front since the first days of the invasion. That the state needs them. I, as well as other instructors of the center, were not born for war, we did not have automatic weapons in our hands when we appeared in this world. I prove the information using my own example. At the age of 25, for some reason I am here in the army, protecting the Ukrainian people from the enemy. So are other military personnel fighting at the front. They protect your homes so that your children go to school and do not feel the effects of war. So, many people have to explain on their fingers. The situation on the battlefield is dynamically changing. Now any movement on the front line, approaches to it, as well as in the depth of battle formations is almost impossible to hide. The enemy's massive use of reconnaissance UAVs and FPV drones is a frontline problem. And the meeting of our fighters on the battlefield with enemy drones is inevitable. We teach cadets to counter enemy drones, how to camouflage positions so that they cannot be detected from the air. Always watch the sky. Everyone should be able to identify the operation of a drone by ear and distinguish its type, constantly move and be able to hide from it. Because if the enemy has visually noticed you, he will not let you rest. If the drone has already -burned- you and you hear the sounds of the propeller, you should not just stand still and fall into a -stupor-. It is necessary to inform fellow citizens about the danger by voice and to run to shelter. The enemy pilot does not hear you, but only sees the picture in front of him, that is, the target. Therefore, it is important to react in time. You can try to knock down the -fpvishka- with automatic turns, but from a safe distance from it. It is more realistic to hit a drone-bomber with a machine gun. It is larger than FPV and not as fast. Of course, we are learning to use electronic devices. It is necessary to be able to suppress the work of FPV drones and other UAVs of the enemy. The psychological obstacle course for paratroopers is always exhausting and difficult, but extremely effective. All recruits go through this lane, it is, so to speak, the culmination of the BZVP at the Training Center. Here the emphasis is on cohesion and brotherhood. Cadets must understand that they are one mechanism and each of them is a certain part in it. If one drops out, it becomes more difficult for the others to work. It is very difficult to cross the psychological barrier physically. The length of the obstacle course is 350 meters, on it there are ten elements that the cadets must overcome. But when the boys pass it, they already feel like -rexes-. And it becomes easier for them both morally and physically. I do not understand at all why everyone thinks that somehow this war will not affect them or will simply bypass them. We are at war with the Russians, there are a lot of them. Russia presses and advances every day. The enemy simply will not stop on its own, it must be stopped and destroyed by the Defense Forces of Ukraine. We also suffer losses, our defenders need to be changed, units need to be strengthened. I do not understand why many people, relatively speaking, at breakfast, over a cup of coffee, open YouTube and watch some, sorry, -nonsense-, some pacifist bloggers and so on. On the contrary, it is necessary to prepare oneself for the defense of the Motherland. There are many video courses on tactical medicine, see how to apply a tourniquet. There are a lot of videos on the basics of handling weapons: how to disassemble a machine gun, its characteristics. Go to the shooting range, learn to shoot there. You don't need to sit at the computer, -play dances-. Study, it will be much easier for you and us when you are drafted into the army. In almost three years of the great war, thanks to YouTube alone, it was already possible to become at least a soldier of the first year of service. Having learned all that is needed to survive the war. What can I say to men sitting at home on sofas. Such men should eventually understand that they are not just -egg carriers-, but defenders of their homes and families, their country. Don't whine about life, finally be real men. Come here and show what the Airborne Assault Forces are capable of. We will prepare you qualitatively and then we will beat Russia. Currently, there are many recruiting centers in Ukraine, you can choose a profession yourself. There is even an opportunity, without the participation of the TCC, to mobilize in the military unit you want.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/03/prokachka-desantnykiv-na-bzvp-instruktor-dshv-rozpoviv-pro-osoblyvosti-pidgotovky/	2025-02-02T20:23:39-08:00
A fake on a chain: the Russians - tie up - the Ukrainian military before the battle	Well, judging by the level of creativity, Russian propagandists have obviously overheated under Skabeeva's lamps. Because even for traditional Russian lies it is too much. The information dump appeared in a format typical for Russians: low-quality photos or videos of dubious origin, signed in the style -that's how Ukrainian commanders lead soldiers to the slaughter.- To enhance the effect, anonymous -eyewitnesses- or -prisoners- are also added, who say that no one in the Armed Forces wants to fight, and therefore the soldiers are literally -convoyed- to the front in handcuffs. In the best traditions of Russian propaganda, the -evidence base- of this fake looks like a set of pixels on the screen of a push-button phone. The video is blurred, the voices are distorted, and the face is unknown. But, of course, this is quite enough for the Russian consumer, who has not checked any information for a long time. Now let's open a curtain of reality. In the Ukrainian army, in contrast to the army of the aggressor country, people fight not because they are -driven-, but because they are defending their country. Yes, war is difficult, it is pain and loss. But Ukrainians go to battle because they are fighting for their land, not for the imperial ambitions of the Kremlin elder. In addition, if we talk about handcuffs and the fear of our own soldiers, it is in the Russian army that there have long been stories about zagradzagons and -Kadyrov overseers- who do not allow their own soldiers to retreat. There, -mobs- are thrown into a meat grinder without preparation, and those who refuse can simply be shot. But it is, of course, not for Russian news. This fake is another attempt to demoralize Ukrainians and fuel the myth of the -collapse of the Armed Forces.- They need anything to show that the Ukrainian military allegedly does not want to fight. But the problem is that the desired does not become a reality just from propagandists' fantasies. What's next? Maybe next time they will tell that Ukrainian pilots are tied to the cockpits of fighter jets, and gunners are chained to the guns so they don't escape? The Russians lie - it's not news. But every time their fictions become more and more pathetic. And this only confirms that in reality they have nothing to brag about. So while they are sculpting new horror stories, the Ukrainian military continues to do its job - smashing the occupiers. Without handcuffs, but with great motivation. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/03/fejk-na-lanczyugu-rosiyany-povyazuyut-ukrayinskyh-vijskovyh-pered-boyem/	2025-02-02T20:03:08-08:00

He said this in his evening address. -Anti-aircraft defense and a sufficient number of anti-missiles are a necessary condition for bringing peace. I am grateful to all partners who help us with this and who have a complete vision of what we need,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. The head of state recalled that this week Ukraine received new support packages from na-12-mlrd/->Sweden, Finland and Croatia. -Thank you! We are working to ensure that next week there will be such necessary decisions for Ukraine - decisions regarding the support of our state, our people, and our army. -Patriots-, -Iris-T-, all types of necessary air defense, the development of drones and investments in the production of weapons here in Ukraine - this is the protection of the lives of our people, this is the protection of the very idea that peace is possible,- said the President. As reported by ArmyInform, during January 2025, the air defense of Ukraine shot down more than 2,300 means of the enemy's air attack. During January 2025, the defense forces of Ukraine carried out two dozen strikes on military and industrial facilities on the territory of the Russian Federation, which are involved in a large-scale war against Ukraine.

The heating system and entrance doors in the apartments were dismantled first. Residents of this building began to ask about the deadlines for the completion of repairs. According to promises, the work is scheduled to be completed only in the second half of 2026, which is causing outrage among local residents due to the excessive delay. As ArmiyaInform reported, the so-called -LNR government- recognized the catastrophic state of housing and communal infrastructure in the temporarily occupied part of Luhansk region. According to their estimates, the average level of wear and tear of critical objects reaches 80%.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/02/dokumenty-v-obmin-na-dopomogu-u-lnr-z-bagatoditnyh-simej-vymagayut-rosijski-pasporty/	2025-02-02T10:42:03-08:00

A pro-Russian spy who was studying the movement of Ukrainian ships was detained in Odessa	According to information of the SBU, the agent collected intelligence on the bases and routes of warships of the Armed Forces of Ukraine near Odesa seaport According to the investigation, the collected information was to be used by the Russians to prepare combat operations in the maritime zone, including the launch of cruise missiles and kamikaze drones. In addition, the agent was tasked with identifying the fire positions of the Ukrainian air defense in order to bypass the defense of the Ukrainian military.

Beating and blowing up beds: the occupiers mock forcibly mobilized Ukrainians	About this informs GUR Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. According to the information of the -I want to live- project, last fall, thirty people illegally mobilized by Russia from the occupied districts of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions got into one of the military units on the territory of the occupied Crimea. The Russians appointed as sergeants for them natives from the Caucasus, who incite inter-ethnic enmity, systematically arrange beatings of illegally mobilized people from the occupied Ukrainian territories, detonate training grenades in the barracks, create unbearable living conditions, and force them to observe the performance of prayers. In addition to systematic humiliation from the Caucasian -commanders-, the illegally mobilized also complain of terrible and insufficient food. As a reminder, in the period from October 31 until December 31, 2024, the aggressor state of Russia forcibly mobilized about three hundred people in the occupied territories of the Kherson and Zaporizhia regions. Illegal conscription in the occupied territories is another Russian war crime. -Everyone who has become a victim of forced mobilization has a chance to leave the occupying army and not participate in Russia's criminal war against Ukraine thanks to the I Want to Live project,- the department emphasizes. As reported by ArmiyaInform, Russian commanders en masse ->transfer their mobilized military, who refuse to voluntarily sign a contract with the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, to the so-called -meat- units.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/02/pobyttya-ta-pidryv-lizhok-okupanty-znushhayutsya-z-prymusovo-mobilizovanyh-ukrayincziv/	2025-02-02T06:12:46-08:00
Air Force of the Ukrainian Armed Forces: -Orlan- did not fly over Odesa, did not correct the -Iskand...	This is stated in messages of the Southern Air Command. As you know, between 19:15 and 20:05 on January 31, 2025, the Russians hit with three ballistic missiles -Iskander-M- according to predetermined coordinates. The strike was aimed at the historic center of Odessa. Information immediately appeared in the public space, as if the Russian Orlan-10 drone was correcting a -ballistic- strike directly over the city, and this strike could have been avoided by destroying the UAV. -We officially deny it! However, in order to prevent the further spread of unverified information, the -Southern- air command appeals to bloggers, volunteers, opinion leaders and media persons to comment more carefully on this topic. We thank you in advance for your understanding and are ready to communicate on similar issues,- the statement reads. Regarding the Russian reconnaissance UAV and countermeasures, PvK -Pivden- reported the following: on January 31, 2025, Odesa and the entire south of Ukraine was in the zone of continuous low cloudiness. The lower limit of clouds is 90 m, the upper limit is 3600 m. The reconnaissance UAV -Orlan-10- was indeed fixed, but not over Odesa, but in the waters of the Black Sea at a distance of 25-30 km from the coastline. Today, no correction by a drone is required for launching missile strikes against fixed enemy targets. -Orlan-10- at this time is usually used for the purpose of video recording the results of Russian terrorist actions, as well as for determining the areas of the -exits- of our air defense missiles. -On January 31, the enemy UAV was detected early! It was seen by radar operators during the entire flight (see the diagram), up to the place of destruction - when it became possible (due to the small radius of use of anti-aircraft FPV drones). -Orlan- was struck by the calculation of FPV drone interceptors in the Koblevo area,- the statement said. It is reported that in 2024 units of the Southern Air Command detected and destroyed 106 Orlan-10 reconnaissance UAVs, 75 of them within the Odesa region.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/02/povitryani-syly-zsu-orlan-nad-odesoyu-ne-litav-udar-iskanderiv-ne-koreguvav/	2025-02-02T06:02:34-08:00
How to generate an electronic referral to the VLK in Reserve+: explanation of the Ministry of Defens...	The Ministry of Defense answered key questions about the new feature. What has changed for a conscript? Previously, a conscript could only receive a referral to the VLK in paper form. For this, he had to visit his TCC and JV. Now a person who wants to undergo an examination for fitness for military service can get a referral to the VLK online. To do this, it is enough to log in to the Reserve+ application and submit a request in a few clicks. So the referral to Reserve+ will be immediately to the medical facility? That's right. After submitting a request to Rezerv+, a person receives a notification within a day, which contains all the necessary details: the number and date of registration of the referral, the address of the health care institution for undergoing VLC, the head of which TCC signed the referral. This notification is sufficient to schedule an inspection. Who can receive an electronic referral to the VLK? The Reserv+ service can now be used by conscripts who themselves want to undergo an examination for fitness for military service. That is, they have not yet received a summons to pass the VLK. Received a summons to the VLK. Is it necessary to come to the TCC? Currently, yes. Soon we will also add the possibility of electronic referral, if a person has already received a paper summons to pass the VLC. Is it necessary to go to the TCC after the VLK to update the military registration document? There is no need for this. The Military Medical Commission itself will send the data to the TCC. An employee of the TCC will enter the information into the Reserve register — and the user will receive an updated military registration document in Reserve+. What will happen if you generate an electronic referral and do not come to the VLK? If the conscript himself wants to undergo a fitness test and does not appear, the notification in Reserve+ remains valid for 30 days. After that, the request must be submitted again - and the application will receive a notification with the same or updated information. Will the summonses for passing the VLK also be electronic? No, the summonses will remain paper. They will still be delivered by physical mail. In Reserve+, the TCC cannot independently initiate requests for the passing of the VLK, as well as any other subpoenas. Such a concept as an electronic subpoena does not exist in the legislation. The service of electronic referral to VLK is voluntary. It can only be initiated by the Reserve+ user. Will all referrals be digital now? No, the paper alternative remains. If desired - for example, if it is not possible to use a smartphone - a conscript can continue to receive a paper referral to the TCC, as before. How often do you need to undergo a medical examination? The decision of the Medical Examination on the suitability of a conscript for military service is valid for one year from the date of the end of the medical examination. Therefore, conscripts must update their medical information every year. Should I go through VLC if there is a reservation? If a person has a reservation or deferment, they should not be referred to VLC. The exception is people with the status of -limited suitability- - all of them must undergo a re-examination of the VLC within the terms specified by law. So, a person with the status of -limited suitability- can receive a summons to pass the VLK - and in this case must appear at the TCC, even if he has a reservation or a postponement.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/02/yak-v-rezerv-zgeneruvaty-elektronne-napravlennya-na-vlk-roz%ca%bcyasnennya-minoborony/	2025-02-02T05:44:17-08:00

According to the investigation, at the beginning of the large-scale invasion, the woman moved to the Vinnytsia region, where she obtained resettled status. While there, she began to cooperate with the FSB. To obtain intelligence, the woman used her nephew, who previously served under a contract in the Armed Forces, but deserted and hid in Toretsk. During telephone conversations, she asked him for information about the positions of the Ukrainian military and the consequences of Russian shelling. She transmitted the received data to the Russian curators via messenger, and after each communication session she deleted the correspondence.

Therefore, now the enemy does not do this, sometimes uses light automobile equipment,- Nadiya Zamryga recounted. The servicewoman also said that the Russians use ATVs or cars for assaults in order to be less visible - but our soldiers still destroy them. A change in the tactics of the Russians in the Kupyan direction has not yet been observed. -These are also small groups of infantry that try to move towards the positions of the Armed Forces during the day and at night,- says Nadiya Zamryga. At the same time, the enemy is pulling up reserves in manpower, but this is due to significant losses in manpower and the enemy. As ArmyInform wrote, the other day the Defense Forces of Ukraine in the Kupyan direction managed to stop promotion enemy in the area of ​​Kolesnikivka and to significantly stop the advance in the direction of Zagryzovo.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/02/yidut-na-vsomu-shho-ruhayetsya-u-zsu-rozpovily-pro-speczyfiku-rosijskyh-atak-na-kupyanskomu-napryamku/	2025-02-02T04:12:18-08:00

He told about this on the broadcast of the national telethon -Edyny Novyni- on February 2. . -There is no place to strengthen for quite a long time. A few weeks ago, there was a rumor that the Russians had tightened the pass regime; that the so-called -Rosguard- is raging. They have a separate unit related to marine infrastructure that conducts appropriate inspections. It has happened before. And repeatedly. And even last summer, illegal tourists complained that it was harder to cross bridges than the state border. Of course, they take extreme measures to preserve this object. The reasons are well known to all of us, and the main one has a purely political symbolic component,- said Dmytro Pletenchuk. He also emphasized that the Crimean bridge is an important component (so far) of the logistics chain of the Russian army. As ArmiyaInform wrote, at the beginning of January 2025 it became known that, as a result of a recent storm, the protective barriers that the Russian occupiers placed around the illegally built Kerch bridge scattered across the strait.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/02/dmytro-pletenchuk-prokomentuvav-zakydy-rosijskyh-media-pro-posylennya-ohorony-kerchenskogo-mostu/	2025-02-02T03:51:10-08:00
Sent to storm on crutches: the occupiers demonstrate the latest development on the battlefield	A military serviceman told about this in air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyni- on February 2 Viktor Petrovych of the 77th separate aeromobile brigade of the DSH. -They must forcefully stimulate the personnel to go into battle, because, as the scouts wrote to me, the enemy used the newest development against us - an infantryman on crutches. It is obvious that an infantryman on crutches would not have gone on the attack if he had not been shot in the back with a barrel. They physically affect their personnel,- Viktor Petrovych said. The host asked whether our military actually had the chance to see with their own eyes the Russians who, relatively speaking, stormed with casts or other traumas and injuries, to which the paratrooper replied: -Yes, they have already seen it in battle. It is quite difficult to believe that such a thing can happen until you see it with your own eyes from a drone. Yes, this is information from our scouts: enemy servicemen on crutches were going to attack,- explained the speaker. As it became known, units of the 77th separate aeromobile brigade of the Russian Air Force are currently performing tasks in the Borova region of the Kharkiv region. As ArmyInform wrote, a few days ago, according to the observations of our military, to the mass grave of Russians in the pipe near Chasovoy Yar, delivered -attack crutches-.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/02/vidpravyly-shturmuvaty-na-mylyczyah-okupanty-demonstruyut-novitnyu-rozrobku-na-poli-boyu/	2025-02-02T03:35:58-08:00

He said this in an interview with the German publication Bild. -The front is moving in the wrong direction. But at what cost? lose 1,000 to 1,500 people a day who are killed or seriously injured. And yet the Russians do not achieve their goals. And our task is to make sure that they never achieve their goals. Therefore, no: Ukraine will not lose. And we have to support her in becoming stronger,- Mark Rutte said. He added that against the background of talks about possible negotiations, it is necessary to make sure that Ukraine is in the best position. -We must continue to support them with weapons and train their soldiers. And if they want to one day have peace talks, they have to put Putin at the negotiating table. But I cannot describe to you exactly how these negotiations will take place. I already have an idea of ​​how this composition might look. But we don't want to make Putin smarter than he is now. We keep it a little secret. Only the end is certain: after this, Putin will never try again,- Mark Rutte is convinced. At the same time, he warned against naive beliefs that Putin will easily go to negotiations and fulfill all agreements. -Just look at what happened in Bucha. Therefore, if a peace agreement is reached, it must be sustainable. We must ensure that he can never, ever again conquer even one square kilometer of Ukraine,- Mark Rutte said. As ArmiyaInform reported, on January 29, a meeting of the Ukraine-NATO Council at the level of ambassadors was held at the NATO headquarters with the participation of the Deputy Prime Minister for European and Euro-Atlantic Integration, the Minister of Justice of Ukraine Olga Stefanyshyn. Key topics of the meeting were the security situation in Ukraine, the implementation of the decisions of the Washington NATO Summit and the progress of Ukraine in the implementation of reforms, in particular within the framework of the adapted Annual National Program.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/02/gensek-nato-rosijska-armiya-vtrachaye-1000-1500-lyudej-na-den-i-ne-dosyagaye-czilej/	2025-02-02T03:18:03-08:00
The Navy of the Ukrainian Armed Forces explained why the Russians did not use Caliber during the las...	During the last missile attack, the Russians did not use the Kalibr cruise missile launchers, there may be several options for such actions by the Russians. This opinion was expressed by a spokesperson on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- on February 2 Dmytro Pletenchuk of the Naval Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. -During the last missile attack, the Russians did not use cruise missile launchers. And it's actually surprising, because they usually involve them too,- Dmytro Pletenchuk said. When asked by the presenter why the Russians do this, Pletenchuk replied that there is no verified information. -The reasons can be different, we can assume several different options. But none of them are confirmed&#8230; It may be their own problems or non-applicability decisions. They understand very well that the effectiveness of these missiles comes down to the fact that they are a distraction: rather harsh, expensive, dangerous, but still a distraction. And given the poor performance, they decided to save them for some other situation. There can be many options. Maybe this time they decided that the attack would not be so massive. It is difficult to say now, it will probably become clear later,- the speaker noted. As ArmiyaInform wrote, in January this year the Navy of the Armed Forces -mi-8/->recorded a decrease in the use of Russian military aircraft over the Black Sea after the loss of two Mi-8 helicopters.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/02/u-vms-zsu-poyasnyly-chomu-rosiyany-pid-chas-ostannoyi-raketnoyi-ataky-ne-zastosovuvaly-kalibry/	2025-02-02T03:07:05-08:00
The murder of a TCC employee: propaganda uses crime to disrupt mobilization and divide society	A man in a balaclava and pixel pants, armed with a hunting rifle, approached one of the TCC servicemen and demanded to give him the weapon. After receiving a refusal, the attacker fired from a distance of 2-3 meters. The intruder took the military weapon from the wounded man and disappeared in an unknown direction together with one of the newly recruited servicemen who was on his way to the training center as part of the team. The deceased serviceman of the territorial procurement center is survived by his wife, children, and parents.- Such a text could be seen yesterday on the official pages in the social networks of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the Poltava Regional Territorial Center for Manpower and Social Support, in the mass media, social networks, various Teltgram channels. The committed serious crime is murder. Moreover, the killing of a serviceman while performing his official task of escorting mobilized citizens of Ukraine to the training center. Killing in a crowded place with the threat of civilian casualties. During the investigation of this crime, different versions may be considered. The investigation will establish all motives and reasons. However, today this crime can already be considered as a continuation of the Russian information campaign aimed at disrupting measures to equip the Defense Forces of Ukraine and, even more, to transfer, for Ukrainian society, the emphasis on the need to strengthen measures to repel Russian armed aggression (the number of victims of which, in particular in relation to the civilian population, increases daily) to the confrontation of conscripted citizens of Ukraine with representatives of the territorial centers of recruitment and social support, the National Police of Ukraine, by other persons designated for carrying out mobilization activities. Numerous -bloggers-, lawyers, -indifferent citizens- are heating up the topic of this confrontation every day. It is significant that the most odious of them, the topic of the armed aggression unleashed by the Russian Federation against Ukraine, the war crimes of the occupiers against the civilian population, the victims of this aggression, are simply absent from their posts. There are only -TCC- in the role of thieves and -fighters against the system- who deliberately evade their duty to protect their country from the enemy. They correspond to the narratives used in Russian propaganda and Russian information operations against Ukraine. The result of such information operations for the enemy should be a forceful confrontation between -evaders- and -tskshniks-, which can easily be turned into a civil war of the civilian population, which -does not want to fight for Zelenskyi, for the deputies, for ... (you can put anything in place of the three dots)- and the military, each of whom can easily be called a -tskshnish- in such a confrontation. -I saw a car with military license plates - they were sleeping or detonated with explosives-, -there is no war-, -children of deputies do not fight-, -TCCs are illegal-, -let someone go to fight first, and then we-... All these theses were written by the enemy. Because of them, the prerequisites for civil confrontation are created, which is a necessary condition for the enemy to occupy all of Ukraine. The practical implementation of such activities of the enemy is quite simple to understand, although it requires regular measures to demonize mobilization and the structures that directly carry it out, to intimidate our conscripted citizens, to discredit state power and military leadership. Even in relation to yesterday's crime: a military serviceman killed by a criminal is survived by his wife, children, parents, and in the comments under the official messages you can see the following: Among such commentators there are obvious bots (no posts, history, characteristic attributes and activity on their own pages at all), so are real citizens of Ukraine (perhaps those who pretend to be real): The quite large number of reactions to their comments is indicative (this can also be artificial reception), which is designed to demonstrate public support for their messages. Simultaneously with the appearance of such comments under official posts, corresponding posts appeared in Russian propaganda telegram channels and, even, a report about this crime in the Russian international media Russia Today, which, unfortunately, is still presented in various countries of the world: Characteristically , that the enemy identifies the criminal who killed our serviceman as -Robin Hood-. The same -Robin Hoods- merged the positions of our troops, aimed (and continue to aim) Russian missiles at our cities and villages, in the temporarily occupied territories, together with the Russian occupiers, torture and kill our civilians. For the enemy, they are really very useful. What do we all need to do? First, to clearly form a relationship to the committed crime. This is not a confrontation with the TCC. This is the killing of a serviceman of the Armed Forces while performing his official duties and, even more, a combat mission. That is, the responsibility of the criminal should lie in the area of ​​crimes against the national security of Ukraine and terrorism. With the maximum possible punishment. Secondly, in no case should we forget who our enemy is and who kills Ukrainians every day. If employees of the TCC exceed their official authority, notify the hotline of the Ministry of Defense, the Ground Forces Command, report it to law enforcement agencies, use all possible tools to protect your rights. Together with the warning of the representatives of the warning groups themselves about the need to observe the law and the fact that the enemy is provoking a confrontation and it is not necessary to help him in this. Third, determine the attitude towards -useful idiots- and -enemy agents-, both overt and covert. If there is no Russian armed aggression for them, it is evil, no defenders and no friends. They do not intend to help you in anything, just as the aggressor does not intend to make your life easier. Evil must be punished, if only informationally - by ignoring their materials, or, if it is impossible to refrain, expressing one's attitude towards the enemy. When Kyiv did not surrender in -three days-, and all of Ukraine - in -several weeks-, at that time, our only strength was unity and a common position. One can have different attitudes towards certain politicians, statesmen, military leaders, but a united, common, independent and sovereign Ukraine is a reality and a future for us and our children. And no Russian IPSO with all their manuals and -Kremlin-tinged Robin Hoods- should divide us.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/02/vbyvstvo-praczivnyka-tczk-rospropaganda-vykorystovuye-zlochyn-dlya-zryvu-mobilizacziyi-ta-rozkolu-suspilstva/	2025-02-02T02:49:24-08:00

These observations were shared by -Societal News- on Sunday, 2 February, the spokesman of the Khortytsia operational-strategic group of troops, Viktor Tregubov. -Armored vehicles are used by the Russians in a limited way&#8230; She became, in fact, vulnerable.

The department emphasized that bombing the civilian population is a trademark of Russian criminals. Even when the civilians are local Russians. -Already traditionally, numerous Russian publics blame Ukraine for the attack. It will not work! There is indisputable evidence and the results of objective control that the strike was carried out by Russian tactical aircraft,- the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine emphasized. In particular, the department released screenshots from the Viraj-tablet system with the flight path of the Russian guided aerial bomb. As reported by ArmyInform, Ukrainian soldiers disassemble collapse of boarding school in Suja: 84 people were saved.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/02/povitryani-syly-zsu-oprylyudnyly-dani-shho-sprostovuyut-rosijsku-dezinformacziyu-pro-udar-po-sudzhi/	2025-02-01T21:32:05-08:00

The total combat losses of the enemy from 24.02.22 to 02.02.25 are approximately: As reported by ArmyInform, fierce battles at the front: Pokrovsky direction remains the epicenter of the confrontation.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/02/visim-desyatkiv-odynycz-avtotehniky-ta-1320-pihotyncziv-genshtab-zsu-oprylyudnyv-vtraty-rf/	2025-02-01T21:19:31-08:00
Fierce battles at the front: the Pokrovsky direction remains the epicenter of the confrontation	This is reported by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The enemy carried out two missile and 34 air strikes, using 40 missiles and 39 guided bombs, 739 kamikaze drone strikes, and almost 4,500 attacks on the positions of our troops. The enemy attacked our fortifications on the Kupyansk direction 17 times in the areas of Topoli, Dvorichna, Petropavlivka, Stepova Novosilka, Hlushkivka, Zagryzovo and Lozova settlements. In the Lyman direction, Russian troops stormed the positions of Ukrainian defenders 15 times near Novoyehorivka, Terny, Yampolivka, Kolodyaz, Torsky and in the direction of Novomykhailivka. In the Seversky direction units of the Defense Forces repelled four attacks by enemy troops near Verkhnokamyanskyi and Bilogorivka. In the Kramatorsk direction our troops repelled seven enemy attacks in the areas of Chasiv Yar, Stupochka and Bila Hora settlements. In the Toretsk direction the occupiers stormed the positions of our defenders seven times in the Toretsk and Crimea regions. In the Pokrovsky direction the enemy carried out 39 assault and offensive operations. The greatest activity of the Russian occupiers is in the districts of Zeleny Poly, Elizavetivka, Promeny, Zvirovoy, Udachny, Uspenivka, Novooleksandrivka, Srybny, and Dachny. according to calculations, our soldiers eliminated 151 and wounded 126 occupiers in this direction; destroyed the -Msta-B- howitzer, the BM-21 -Grad- self-propelled howitzer, a mortar, three cars, three motorcycles and two UAVs of operational-tactical level, also caused damage to two units of automotive equipment, two -Msta-S- self-propelled howitzers and an enemy tank. In the Novopavlovsk direction the invaders carried out two attacks on the positions of Ukrainian troops, the enemy tried to advance in the direction of Constantinople and Rozhlyv. The enemy's attack aircraft struck in the Vremivka region. In the Gulyajpil direction, the aggressor made two attempts to dislodge our defenders from their positions in the Novosilka area. Novopil suffered from enemy airstrikes. In the Orykhiv direction two clashes took place in the Shcherbakiv and Nesteryanka areas. In the Dnieper direction the Russian invaders once tried to dislodge our units from their positions, they did not succeed, they suffered losses. The Defense Forces of Ukraine continue the operation in the Kursk direction. In total, Ukrainian soldiers repelled six attacks of the invading army in this direction, at present, one battle is still ongoing, in addition, the enemy's aircraft carried out 18 airstrikes on its own territory, dropping 23 anti-aircraft missiles, and the enemy also fired 230 attacks on populated areas and the positions of our troops. In the Kharkiv direction since the beginning of the day, the enemy has not carried out assault operations. There were no significant changes in the situation in other areas. The department honored the Ukrainian soldiers of the 3rd separate assault brigade, 43rd separate mechanized brigade, 60th separate mechanized Ingulets brigade, 79th separate amphibious assault brigade of Tavria and 128th separate mountain assault brigade of Zakarpattia, who steadfastly deter crowd overwhelming enemy forces. As ArmyInform reported, paratroopers -Jack- and -Oliver- told how in the very first battle, six occupiers were captured at once.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/02/zapekli-boyi-na-fronti-pokrovskyj-napryamok-zalyshayetsya-epiczentrom-protystoyannya/	2025-02-01T21:14:54-08:00
You don't want to fight for Ukraine, you will fight for Russia: 10 thousand Ukrainians from TOT call...	So the recent post on Facebook of the Ukrainian soldier only on his the page had almost half a thousand reposts. And on the page of another user who shared the post with her, the number of reposts reached two thousand. And continues to grow. So why are these messages suddenly responding? Sometimes too emotional, sometimes with the use of not quite censorious language - but why do people read them and pass them on? Probably because when we talk about the reluctance of a part of Ukrainians to serve, we always return to a simple formula: you don't want to fight for Ukraine, you will fight for Russia. And every time one of the Ukrainians talks about it, he hits a nerve. And other military men spoken out about it more than once. But a significant part of society still thinks that this fate will pass them by. It won't actually go away. Recently publicized by the Center of National Resistance (CNS) the figures indicate precisely it. Thus, in almost 10 months of 2024, about 10,000 Ukrainians living in the temporarily occupied territories became servicemen of the Russian army. We are talking about the temporarily occupied territories of Crimea, Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk and Luhansk regions. According to message CNS, conscription to the Russian army in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine began in October last year. -According to the plans of the Kremlin Fuhrer, the ranks of terrorists should be replenished by at least 150,000 new recruits. Among them, a significant share falls on temporarily annexed Donetsk region, Luhansk region, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson region and annexed Crimea,- the publication says. The Central Intelligence Agency clarifies that the first recruitment to the Kremlin's terrorist army took place in the fall of 2023: -Then, as now, recruits were promised that their service would not be connected with participation in the so-called svo. However, as practice has shown, most conscripts were forced to sign contracts with the Ministry of Attack of the Russian Federation and continue to fight against the Motherland. The head of Zaporizhzhia OVA Ivan Fedorov also in his Telegram notes that such conscripts are promised that they will serve in the military units of the occupied Crimea, Rostov Region and Krasnodar Territory. -There is no faith in promises - at the beginning of the occupation Gauleiter Balytsky already promised a 5-year moratorium on service in the Russian army for citizens of the TOT. As expected, he lied,- writes Ivan Fedorov. And he adds that residents of captured territories who were forced to join the enemy army can turn to the state project -I want to live- to voluntarily surrender to captivity and save his life. But even without these facts listed above, in Ukraine they remember very well who in February 2022 fought together with the Russians against our country. These were residents of the temporarily occupied Luhansk region and Donetsk region. And this is a clear example of what fate awaits every Ukrainian if his hometown is captured by the enemy. As joked one recently from bloggers on Facebook, -10 thousand mobilized Ukrainians in the occupied territories for 2024. Conflicts with the military commissars of the Russian Federation have not been recorded. Somehow it is.'' And indeed, in those territories, something is not observed in the social networks of a stream of angry posts against the bad employees of the Russian military commissars and their arbitrariness. And knowing the appetites of the Russian imperial machine, we can say with confidence that the fact about 10,000 conscripted Ukrainians last year can only be the beginning.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/02/ne-hochesh-voyuvaty-za-ukrayinu-voyuvatymesh-za-rosiyu-10-tysyach-ukrayincziv-z-tot-pryzvaly-na-sluzhbu-do-armiyi-rf/	2025-02-01T20:56:48-08:00
Under Pokrovsk, the enemy is hidden by -Gradams- in tandem with the Romanian APR-40 systems: a repor...	-My reactive artillery battery reports directly to the brigade commander, we execute commands through the brigade artillery chief and the combined fire support department. In the Pokrovsky direction, we carry out combat tasks in a non-stop mode, in fact continuously. We have domestic 122-mm BM-21 -Grad- rocket launchers and Romanian APR-40 in our arsenal. The Romanian rocket launcher is practically an analogue of the Grad, which also uses Soviet-style 122 mm shells. Firing from jet systems is always a demoralizing weapon for the enemy. We cover the specified area with volley fire and blow everything there -to fluff and dust.- We destroy control points, warehouses of heavy armored vehicles, weapons and warehouses with ammunition in the depth of the enemy's battle formations. Now it is very hot in the Pokrovsky direction, the occupiers are advancing in small assault groups. We destroy rashists in shelters, fortifications and in places of haste. No one survives there after our righteous fire. In this way, we stop the advance of the enemy's infantry in the zone of responsibility of our brigade. On the day when a large number of Russian attack aircraft are destroyed, the enemy no longer advances in that direction. After all, they need time to prepare new -kamikaze-. Depending on the projectiles, we can attack the enemy at a distance of up to 40 km, mostly we work at a distance of 20-30 km. The crews of the Grad and APR-40 jet systems are in constant combat readiness for use. So that you understand, for example, the time from taking an unprepared position to starting fire is only 3 minutes. Of course, it takes much more time to aim at the target, for example, on -Hrad- up to 15-20 minutes. Before that, air reconnaissance finds out what needs to be destroyed, the command determines the priority of the defeat and passes it on to us. One -pack- of rockets is 40 shots in 30 seconds. Any volley fire system has the possibility that projectiles fall with a certain dispersion, forming a so-called dispersion ellipse. So, we can cover an area of ​​4 hectares with fire. Of course, the largest concentration of projectiles will fall closer to the center of this ellipse and form a zone of stable damage. That is, everything that is in this area is actually destroyed. Under the conditions, if there is not, for example, some kind of powerful underground shelter. The other day we got the coordinates of the target: somewhere 20 km from the contact line, the Rashists had created a field ammunition depot, it was well camouflaged, but our aerial scouts still found it. We were hit by several shells, there was an explosion, oh how beautiful, they said that for several hours shrapnel from ammunition flew around. And once in Zaporozhye, when they were carrying out combat missions, they managed to destroy the command post of a regiment of the Russian Armed Forces. Russian officers worked there, there were many of them. They put a whole -package- of -Hrad- shells there. Another telling story for the enemy to get out of our land. One day the Rashists were advancing on motorcycles, their infantry had to quickly reach the plantation and establish themselves there. Our calculation worked effectively and covered the advance of the occupiers. It was 7 or 8 motorcycles that were blown to shreds. You yourself understand that the salvo fire of a jet system is not a single shell of 152 mm or 155 mm barrel artillery caliber. Maximum damage and destruction of everything around - this allows you to effectively inflict losses on the Russians. What we really need is more shells. The most popular are high-explosive fragments. We want to destroy the enemy much more and drive him out of our land forever. The enemy has the upper hand in the sky. Russian Zala, SuperCam and Lancets are constantly in the air. Therefore, we choose positions for striking with caution, and if we fire from closed firing positions, we try to mask them well, cars, of course, in caponiers. Strict compliance with safety measures. There is no way without it now. We install -anti-lance- protection, an anti-drone net, plus a EW works on the installation. What else is very important in our daily combat work. The ZU-23-2 anti-aircraft installation constantly leaves with us for cover. It works at a distance of 50-100 meters from our systems. -Zenitka- is capable of hitting air targets at heights of up to 2.5 km. If there is a need to shoot down FPV drones, then the artrocalculations are connected with automatic machines. EW tools do not always effectively suppress the work of Lancets. Plus, katsaps already use -fpvishki- on optical fiber. This is a problem and something needs to be done about it. In terms of technical characteristics and capabilities, the Romanian MLRS is almost indistinguishable from the work of our BM-21 -Grad-. Depending on the projectiles, the range of fire is the same, the capabilities of the machine are the same. The only difference is the aiming speed. On -Hrad- the calculation is done faster than on the Romanian installation. There are no questions at all about the accuracy and destruction of racist targets. What is the working principle of the Grad anti-aircraft missile system and the APR-40? Conventionally speaking, the enemy advances or makes a breakthrough to our positions on the front edge. Calculations of combat vehicles of the battery immediately leave for the firing positions. We set the compass, determine the main direction of fire based on these coordinates, which are provided by aerial scouts. We launch the -Nettle- system software. To work with -Kropyva-, you only need to know the coordinates of the targets and locations of your artillery battery, weather conditions. The data is entered into a tablet, then the boys automatically calculate the direction of fire and the distance to the target. All. We are waiting for the command to open fire. As soon as such a command arrives, we open fire, and after the -breakdown-, let's say so, we assemble and quickly leave the positions. So that the enemy does not catch us. Shoot and run tactics. Our work is similar to the work of the Hymers. Only the American systems are more powerful and hit at a much greater distance.- -Before the large-scale invasion of the Russian Federation, he lived with his family in Irpen, Kyiv region. He worked in a logistics company, the last position was the manager of warehouse logistics. In total, I had 12 warehouses under my command throughout the territory of Ukraine. On the fourth day after the start of the great war, he barely managed to get his wife and children out of the city, and he himself got out on the ninth day. Went out with the dog on foot through the woods. I watched all sorts of things. After the liberation of Kyiv region from the occupiers, he returned home. Housing had to be restored. When enemies came from Buchi, our residential complex on the outskirts of the city was the first of the houses to come under fire. Finished all my work matters, later received a summons and to the army. BZVP took place in -Desna-, before that he did not serve in the army. At the educational center, they looked at me, they saw that I am an adequate person, I have an education, I have a lot of experience working in large teams. They offered to join the artillery. The 117th brigade was being formed just at the training ground. Got into a jet artillery unit. Performed the duties of a scout-rangefinder. I am the kind of person who wants to know and be able to do everything, I learned a lot on my own in artillery work, studied the operation of the -Nettle- system, raised money on my own and bought myself a -Mavik-, flew other UAVs as well. In short, I took up anything useful in our work. The brigade artillery chief noticed me and dragged me to the joint fire support section, where artillery fire control is carried out. I took the position of staff sergeant. Managed unmanned systems in the department. Received the rank of officer. Then he was appointed commander of a reactive artillery battery. As soon as the position became vacant, they told me: -Your battery, your guys, you know everyone.- You will go as a combatant-. In principle, it doesn't matter to me in what position to beat the occupiers. The main thing is to do it efficiently and to the benefit of the state,- says Ilya with the nickname -Nazhdak-. -In our battery, all the guys are charged and extremely motivated to destroy the enemy. When you reset the targets and give them the command to hit, they jump for joy. It is a great pleasure to lead such personnel,- adds the battery commander.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/02/pid-pokrovskom-voroga-kryyut-gradamy-u-tandemi-z-rumunskymy-systemamy-apr-40-reportazh-armiyainform/	2025-02-01T20:40:13-08:00
The first is real: construction of a full-fledged aircraft carrier has begun in Turkey	As stated in the information of the Turkish portal SavunmaSanayiST with reference to the Ministry of National Defense of the Republic, the sheet metal cutting ceremony for the national aircraft carrier MÜGEM, the national submarine MİLDEN and the air defense combat destroyer TF-2000 took place in the command of Istanbul Shipyard, reports ArmyInform. -Thus, the necessary practical solution to the construction of 3 different warships, which will advance the Turkish Navy one more step forward, was implemented,- the publication emphasized. The hull design of the MÜGEM (translated as -National Aircraft Carrier-) was developed with the help of a multidimensional optimization tool to improve compatibility with sea conditions and maneuverability. These functions, tested with the help of simulations, will allow the ship to move through the sea in the most efficient way. The special design of the bow of the ship provides fuel savings of 1.5%, and also increases privacy and operational efficiency by reducing underwater noise. According to the Army Recognition website, Ankara independently developed the Milli Uçak Gemisi (MÜGEM) aircraft carrier project. It should become the largest ship in the entire history of Turkish shipbuilding. The declared length is 285 meters, width is 72 meters, draft is 10.1 meters. Water tonnage is 60,000 tons. It is assumed that the ship will have a crew of no less than 800 personnel. For comparison, ships of a similar class - the British Queen Elizabeth has a displacement of 70,000. tons, and the French Charles de Gaulle - 42 thousand. tons The aircraft carrier is expected to reach a speed of 25 knots and have a range of 10,000 nautical miles at 14 knots. This is ensured by four LM2500 gas turbines from General Electric and two variable-pitch propellers for efficient maneuverability. The aircraft carrier is designed in the STOBAR configuration (-short take-off from the springboard, landing on the air finisher-). Meanwhile, American aircraft carriers are being built in the CATOBAR configuration (catapult-assisted take-offs and aerial finisher landings). MÜGEM will have three launch sites. Two are for take-off and one is for landing aircraft. A launch catapult (a device for launching aircraft from a small platform, ship or vessel) has not yet been planned. Instead, the ship has a springboard (an inclined ramp curved upwards, which allows the aircraft to take off with a shortened run). However, this design is only part of the conceptual model of the new ship. Later, the springboard will be replaced by a flat deck and catapult when Turkey gets its own developed catapult system. As the name suggests, MÜGEM is to be built almost entirely without foreign components. The goal is to create an aircraft carrier that is 80 percent Turkish-made components and materials. It is possible that Turkey will want to design an electromagnetic catapult for MÜGEM. Such launch systems are successors to conventional steam catapults and are used by the US on the aircraft carrier Gerald Ford and by China on the Fujian. As indicate experts of the IKK Defense Express (DE) defense portal, MÜGEM will have an air wing with up to 50 aircraft devices But against the background of the lack of a full-fledged deck fighter, its composition will not be entirely traditional. The only manned aircraft will be the combat version of the Hürjet trainer, which has rather limited combat capabilities. But it will be compensated by drones: reconnaissance-strike TB3 and -Currently, the aircraft carrier will be equipped with a springboard, but in the future there are plans to equip it with a catapult. The latter can open the possibility to diversify the composition of the air group, in particular thanks to a special version of the national fighter KAAN. It is worth noting that the construction dates of MÜGEM remain unannounced, but are most likely planned somewhere in the 20s-30s,- DE noted. MÜGEM will not only have armed planes and drones, but will also be equipped with weapons. The corresponding systems should mainly be used to defend against air and sea attacks. It is planned to install the MiDLAS missile launch system with 32 launchers containing anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles. In addition, the project envisages 4 Gökdeniz systems. This is an analogue of the American Phalanx system, which is detailed in one of its materials told our publication. Each of the 35 mm Gökdeniz guns has its own radar, which allows autonomously hitting air targets at short distances if necessary. These include drones and cruise missiles and other incoming missiles. There are also 6 Aselsan STOP units. These are 25mm automatic guns. Combat modules can automatically track targets using optical image recognition. Turkey now has only one -conditional- aircraft carrier in its fleet: TCG Anadolu. And this is a landing ship in general. It is identical to the Spanish flagship -Juan Carlos I-, so it was not designed in Turkey. With a displacement of 27,000 tons, it is half the size of MÜGEM. In theory, it can still be used as an aircraft carrier if the hangar is reconfigured to accommodate aircraft. Initially, it was planned that up to 10 American F-35Bs would be placed on the ship. This is a version of a stealth fighter with a vertical takeoff. Given that, in addition to the Anadolu, Turkey plans to have another similar Trakya ship in its -line-up-, together with the MÜGEM, this will formally expand the aircraft carrier capabilities of the Turkish Navy to three ships. For comparison, Italy has only the 35,000-ton Cavour, France has the aforementioned Charles de Gaulle, and only Great Britain has two Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers. At the same time, the area of ​​responsibility of European states is much wider than in Turkey. In conditions where any attack by another state on Turkey, as a NATO country, is excluded with almost 99% probability, the appearance of a full-fledged aircraft carrier in its fleet indicates the growth of foreign policy ambitions and the further use of such a ship as a tool of -power projection- and foreign political influence Turkey.

Fantasy palmistry: Russian absurdity about lengthening life lines on the palms of conscripts	Seriously. It's not even a joke. They really wrote it. According to the version of Russian -experts- on telegrams, in a Kharkiv private clinic, for $3,000, you can perform an operation that -guarantees a long life.- Because, you see, Ukrainians are so superstitious that instead of normal medicine they decided to rely on surgical intervention in their own palms. After this procedure, as the Russians claim, -patients get a longer life line, which seems to increase their chances of returning from the front.- 1. -REN TV- level fiction This is not even a new fake - similar -stories- appear from time to time in East Asian countries, where palmistry still has some popularity. But in Ukraine, where medical science is developed at a level higher than that of the Russians (who still treat -DNA changes after vaccination-), such things look like a blatant absurdity. 2. Military conscription and -plastic surgery- Let's imagine: a man receives a summons, but instead of collecting documents or passing a medical examination, he carries $3,000 to a private clinic to have an additional incision made on his palm. Well, yes, this is obviously a more logical option than simply serving or going abroad, as the same Russians like to describe it. 3. Phantom clinic No specific name of the clinic, no address, no real feedback. Just -in Kharkiv-, -sources report-. Although the sources seem to be somewhere in the Kremlin between the seventh and eighth shot of vodka. 4. It doesn't work at all Any doctor, even a Russian one, will tell you that surgery on the palm of your hand does not change life expectancy in any way. Because this is not mysticism, but physiology. But in a country where people still believe in -magical biofields- and -energy cleansing- from Kadyrov, apparently, such theories are valid. Comic absurdity aside, this fake has a clear purpose: Russian propaganda is so desperate that it just makes up fakes -on the fly- without even making any effort to make them believable. Unfortunately, the next step will probably be even more absurd. Maybe soon they will say that in Ukraine conscripts are transplanted with a frog's heart for -greater endurance-, or that in Lviv Oblast they developed a ritual of -protection against the draft- with the help of lard and embroidery? Well, we are waiting for new -masterpieces- from Russian information dumps.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/02/fentezi-hiromantiya-rosijskyj-absurd-pro-podovzhennya-linij-zhyttya-na-dolonyah-vijskovozobovyazanyh/	2025-02-01T20:11:22-08:00

Volodymyr Zelenskyi: Every Russian drone or missile is made up of components from other countries	He expressed this opinion during his evening video address on Saturday, February 1. -We must always be completely honest about such Russian terror: they would not have managed to inflict such damage on their own, so intensively and literally every night. Every Russian -shakhed- and every Russian missile are components produced by other countries. One hundred and sixty-five strike units in one night strike of Russia - all these -Iskanders-, -calibers- and other means of killing - are hundreds and even thousands of components from other countries. European countries, China and even America,- the head of state said. According to him, without such critical components, the Kremlin regime -will not have any opportunity to disrupt the lives of other peoples.- -Therefore, it is critically important that the sanctions are really strong and that they cannot be circumvented under any circumstances. There should be no way to supply Russia with critical components for defense production. Violation of sanctions should be interpreted as complicity in the war, and whoever helps destroy life should be held accountable,- the President emphasized. He also added that Ukraine is currently working to attract even more resources from partners to strengthen its air shield. -Protection against shelling is an absolute priority. Much remains to be done, but every partner of ours in the world who helps it is a lifesaver. And this is exactly what everyone in the world should think about now: about life, about joint work, about pressure on the aggressor and about the approach of real peace. Peace that Russia will not give. A peace to which they can only be pressed. We will press on!-, Volodymyr Zelenskyi assured. &nbsp; As reported by ArmyInform, the number of victims of the Russian attack on a high-rise building in Poltava increased to eight people.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/01/volodymyr-zelenskyj-kozhen-rosijskyj-dron-chy-raketa-cze-komponenty-z-inshyh-krayin/	2025-02-01T10:55:57-08:00
Fraud with products for the army: a large-scale theft scheme in the military unit was exposed in Kyi...	The DBR informs about this. During June-November 2023, they stole at least 30% of products from the warehouse, reducing the daily food supply for servicemen accordingly. This -leftover- of products was also used in another money-making scheme. A representative of the military unit, in collusion with a private enterprise, issued -empty- invoices for the alleged supply of other products worth millions of hryvnias. The same products that were not issued to the soldiers and then went on sale were accounted for on paper. Such actions caused losses to the state in the amount of more than UAH 5.4 million. As reported by ArmyInform, law enforcement bodies exposed the accountant of one of the military units in the Odesa region, -vyplat-znyklyh-bezvisty-bijcziv-dbr/->which appropriated more than 2 million hryvnias of payments to missing soldiers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/01/shahrajstvo-z-produktamy-dlya-armiyi-na-kyyivshhyni-vykryto-masshtabnu-shemu-kradizhok-u-vijskovij-chastyni/	2025-02-01T10:49:42-08:00
Destroying their own cities - Russian troops attacked a boarding school in Suzhi, Kursk region	This was reported at the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, publishing footage with the consequences of the attack. At the same time, they emphasized that the strike on a civilian object was -targeted-. -At the time of the attack, there were dozens of local residents in the premises who were preparing to evacuate. The Russian side had information that only civilians — local residents, including women and children — are in the boarding school,- the report says.

The occupiers are forced to resort to using stolen motoblocks, but even this time they did not reach their final destination,- Ukrainian fighters note. As can be seen in the released footage, when one of the invaders noticed the approach of the FPV drones, he immediately jumped out of his vehicle, because it was moving so slowly that the only chance for him to survive was to flee on foot. However, his henchman was less lucky, because as a result of being hit by a drone, he was left lying next to a motoblock that had been stolen somewhere. -That's why it hurts, and that's why it's fun,- Ukrainian soldiers commented on their video.

In total, the radio engineering troops of the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine detected and escorted 165 enemy air targets: Anti-aircraft missile units, EW devices and mobile fire groups of the Air Force and the Defense Forces of Ukraine were involved in repelling the enemy air attack. According to preliminary data, 56 -Shahed- strike UAVs/simulator drones of various types were shot down, another 61 UAVs did not reach their targets (lost in location). Some of the enemy's cruise missiles were destroyed by anti-aircraft defense. A significant part of the missiles, due to the active opposition of the Defense Forces, did not reach their goals. However, there are also injuries, in particular, missiles that enter the target on a ballistic trajectory. Detailed information on enemy missiles has not yet been made public. As a result of the Russian strike, civilian objects and objects of critical infrastructure were hit by missiles and attack UAVs. Hitting a residential building in Poltava by an Kh-22 missile, shelling the historic center of Odessa with -ballistics- is yet another evidence of the barbarism and terrorism of the Russian leadership. Also, on the night of February 1, the enemy attacked Ukrainian enterprises and objects of the Ukrainian energy infrastructure in the Zaporizhia, Odesa, Sumy, Kharkiv, Khmelnytskyi, and Kyiv regions.

He served in the infantry for two years, and then, due to his health, he was transferred to another unit, where he began his new path - as an operator of unmanned aerial vehicles. After that, he did not stop, asked the command and went to study engineering, becoming an instructor in this specialization. -I served two years in the infantry, felt what it was like to be at ground zero.- And now that we fly drones, it helps the infantry. As soon as they do not reach the infantry positions, it becomes easier for them,- says -Sirko-.

But in addition to the important work that directly affects combat results, he talks about the team spirit in the Presidential Brigade. -There is an adequate command here, the guys and I understand each other half a word. You can turn to the commander, and he will listen to you, support you, help you if necessary. This is what allows us to work harmoniously and efficiently,- he adds. Sirko was now training new fighters, including those who had previously evaded service. He does not blame them, but gives them a chance to adapt to the war, improve their skills and help at the front. It is his duty not only to carry out combat tasks, but also to pass on knowledge to the younger generation, who will defend Ukraine in the near future. -We will show, teach. I have three children, a wife. I also want to see my children grow up. But nothing, we have no way back, we have to fight to victory. And the victory will be ours anyway, because there is no other way,- concludes Sirko, clearly aware of the importance of his mission.

I neutralized and wounded one of the opponents. Later, the wounded man died,- says -Jack-. At some point, the occupiers began to convince our fighters to stop resisting, claiming that all this was allegedly -just politics-, but when they realized that all this was useless, insults and intimidation started. However, no matter what threats the Russians expressed towards the Ukrainian military, it still did not help them in any way. -They started throwing away their weapons when they realized they had no chance&#8230; Then the last attack aircraft came down to us and we already started tying and packing them,- the guys said.

This is an important advantage on the battlefield,- he adds. The tank driver does not hide that he deliberately chose to serve in the army. -This is my choice, my profession. And when difficult times come, a man must be a man,- concludes Alexander, for whom military service is not only a duty, but also a vocation.

-A bullet stuck in a bulletproof vest-: an incredible story of a fighter with the call sign -Murchik...	The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. His first battles took place in a volunteer unit, although Maxim himself does not like to mention it. Already in the composition of the 58th brigade, he went through numerous fierce battles, including defensive and offensive battles. In one of the hottest places - the village of Urozhany in Donetsk region - he destroyed a Russian tank from the NLAW complex, and together with his brothers captured a group of invaders. Maxim says that during one of the battles, he and his brothers were waiting for an assault group that was supposed to attack the enemy's position in the hangar. However, everything did not go according to plan: during the landing of the attack aircraft, the Russians opened fire, as a result of which one fighter was killed and three others were injured. Despite the loss, the operation had to continue. So the only fighter left from the assault group turned to Maxim and his comrades with a request for help. -He said that there were no more than five Russians in the hangar. I replied that I couldn't storm, and he reassured me: -I can't either, but we'll manage.- And we left,- the fighter recalls. In fact, there were 15 enemies in the room. However, Maxim and his comrades gave them a fight: several were eliminated, seven were taken prisoner. Three more Russian commanders, armed with a machine gun, remained inside. Maxim decided to act by trickery - he took one of the prisoners and returned with him to the hangar to convince the rest of the enemies to surrender. But when they got close, the Russians opened fire. The prisoner was wounded, and Maxim himself hid behind a concrete column, waiting for the enemy to run out of ammunition. -When they shot the ammunition, they ran away. I looked at myself - a bullet from a Kalashnikov machine gun was sticking out of my bulletproof vest: it pierced the phone and got stuck in the plate,- says Maksym. Later, among the prisoners, it turned out that they were also from the 58th, but Russian brigade. The oldest of them is 62 years old, a former prisoner who spent 48 years behind bars. The youngest is 19 and was a conscript. They warned of a planned assault on Ukrainian military positions by 500 militants. And the fighters themselves had only two stores for each. So Maxim returned to the hangar again to collect the enemy's ammunition. In the end, the assault never took place, and the unit was changed. However, the trials for Maxim did not end there. In one of the battles, when he aimed a missile complex with a laser beam at an enemy tank, the occupiers managed to fire first. The shell exploded ten meters from him, covering it with earth. His brothers pulled him out from under the rubble. During another battle near Urozhany, he was wounded by an enemy drone attack. After a month in the hospital, he returned to service and continues to fight. As reported by ArmyInform, in the Separate Presidential Brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine there is a constant process of improving the skills of fighters. oleksandr-pazik-pro-pidgotovku-voyiniv-u-prezydentskij-brygadi/->.

She was preparing an explosion near the building of the special service: a detained Russian agent	The Security Service of Ukraine informs about this. This location is currently not being used by secret service personnel who have been redeployed to back-up work stations for the duration of a full-scale invasion. However, a potential terrorist attack could have resulted in large casualties among civilian passers-by in the central part of the city. At the scene of the incident, the detainee found a bag in which there was an improvised explosive device with a capacity of 7 kg in TNT equivalent. Such a charge is enough to seriously damage the building and cause fatal damage to people around the epicenter of the explosion. According to the case materials, the Rashists remotely recruited a 22-year-old drug addict from Lviv, who was looking for -quick- money on Telegram channels, to prepare a terrorist attack. On the instructions of the occupiers, the girl came to Kyiv, where her Russian curator rented an apartment for her in the city center in advance. After moving into temporary housing, she picked up a mini-surveillance camera via courier and installed it on the balcony. With the help of remote access, the enemy was able to monitor the central street of Kyiv in online mode and thus wanted to record the consequences of the terrorist attack. Employees of the SBU worked in advance and arrested the perpetrator -in the act- when she took a bag with an explosive device from a hiding place and headed to a rented apartment. During the search, a mobile phone was additionally seized from the detainee, which she used to communicate with the Russian special service. So far, the investigators of the Security Service have notified the suspect of suspicion under several articles of the Criminal Code of Ukraine: ch. 2 Art. 111 (treason committed under martial law); h 1 Art. 14, ch. 2 Art. 258 (preparation for the commission of a terrorist act committed by a group of persons with a prior conspiracy); h 1 Art. 263 (unlawful handling of arms, ammunition or explosives). The perpetrator is in custody. She faces up to life in prison with forfeiture of property. Urgent comprehensive measures are underway to bring to justice all persons involved in the planning and preparation of the terrorist attack. The special operation was conducted under the procedural guidance of the Prosecutor General's Office. As reported by ArmyInform, in Cherkaschyna, a suspect of working for the Russian Federation, who was preparing strikes, was detained in the places of deployment of the Defense Forces, but failed in its mission, falling into the hands of the Security Service of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/01/gotuvala-vybuh-bilya-budivli-speczsluzhby-zatrymana-agentka-rf/	2025-02-01T01:29:16-08:00

But there are cases when storming enemy groups are selected: that is, from units that are not directly against us, but those that specifically come in to carry out storming operations. They are quite well equipped and trained,- the serviceman noted. He added that the more enemy assaults there are, the more the enemy wants to surrender: -Because they don't have much motivation, especially local mobilized (drafted into the Russian army - ed.). Therefore, it is possible to capture them. They then tell us that their task is to go to a certain point and from there wave the drone, show that they have arrived, and wait for reinforcements when the next group has to go forward. But, as a rule, they are all destroyed and do not wait for the next group.- Earlier ArmyInform reported that in the Kupyan direction, the enemy begins assaults, releasing ill-prepared infantry at the positions of the Defense Forces, in order to detect our firing positions.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/01/bez-motyvacziyi-na-toreczkomu-napryamku-pozycziyi-zsu-shturmuyut-meshkanczi-donechchyny-ta-luganshhyny-yakyh-mobilizuvala-armiya-rf/	2025-02-01T01:01:19-08:00

He willingly shared the details of his -business trip- to the war, and his words were once again confirmed: the Russian command views its soldiers as cannon fodder. -I didn't know where I was being taken,- said the captive. According to the prisoner, he was in SIZO-2 in Kuibyshev (Novosibirsk region). No one informed him about a possible -business trip- to the front and did not allow him to sign any documents. -On November 14, 2024, I was sent by stage. I didn't know where I was going. On the way, other prisoners have already explained that we were heading to the Tolmachiv airport at the RDSU (Russian volunteer special service), -he said. He was never issued documents, a military ID, or a passport. From Rostov Zecs were loaded into military trucks and transported to the 74th Motorized Rifle Brigade. The command in the brigade consisted of former prisoners who mocked the new arrivals, beat them and took personal belongings. Already at the front line, it became clear that new recruits were being used as cannon fodder without the right to retreat. -We were told to take the stronghold, throw grenades at it and hold it. On the way, those who had already fought said that it was suicide. We are going in the same direction, and we are all crazy. We are all corpses,- admitted the captive.

-Communal apocalypse- in the Luhansk region: the infrastructure was on the verge of collapse due to ...	The head of the Luhansk Regional Military Administration, Artem Lysogor, reported this on his page. . At the same time, the occupiers do not take into account the destruction they caused during the storming of the cities of the region in 2022. Then the infrastructure of Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, Rubizhny, Kreminnaya, Girsky, Zoloty and Popasnaya was completely destroyed or badly damaged. In fact, this is a confirmation of many years of ignoring any major repairs. Instead of modernization, the occupation authorities only charged local residents for water, electricity, gas, and heat without investing in system maintenance. For almost 11 years of occupation, the occupation administration only exploited the infrastructure left by Ukraine, without thinking about its renewal. Now, when it is in a critical state, the residents of the temporarily occupied territories are threatened with a real communal collapse. What does this mean for local people? According to Artem Lysohor, the head of the Luhansk Regional Military Administration, this is evidence that the occupiers not only destroyed Ukrainian cities and villages, but were also unable to provide basic conditions for life. -That is, for a decade, starting in 2014, the occupiers did not attempt to make major repairs or install new equipment, while charging the population and businesses monthly for the use of water, electricity, gas, and heat,- — noted Lysohor.

Ryazan, Saratov, Engels: map of attacks by the Defense Forces of Ukraine on Russian military facilit...	Unlike the Russian army, which is shelling residential areas, educational institutions and hospitals, Ukrainian strikes are aimed exclusively at enemy logistics, defense facilities and weapons storage facilities. ArmyInform collected information on all strikes in January, confirmed by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. On January 14, the Defense Forces of Ukraine carried out the most massive attack on the military facilities of the occupiers at a distance of 200 to 1100 km deep into the Russian Federation. Targets in the Bryansk, Saratov, Tula regions and the Republic of Tatarstan were hit. Krystal Plant was hit twice during the week, after the first hit the fire lasted for five days. This oil depot supplied fuel to the Engels-2 military airfield, where Tu-160 strategic bombers are based. In today's conditions, when the Russians are under sanctions, it will be almost impossible to restore the lost resources. This is especially true of the fuel T-8B, which was manufactured exclusively to the order of the Russian army. Also twice, the Defense Forces attacked the Liskinskaya oil depot in the Voronezh region of the Russian Federation. The company belongs to one of the largest Russian state-owned corporations, Rosneft. Last week, two strikes were also made against the Ryazan Oil Refining Company, one of the four largest oil refineries in Russia, which annually produces about 840,000 tons of aviation kerosene. TS-1, which is 8.4% of the total production volume of this product in Russia. The loss of such a resource is a significant blow to the logistics and provision of Russian military operations. Ukrainian drones have also successfully visited oil refineries and fuel storage sites in the Kaluga, Volgograd and Nizhny Novgorod regions of the Russian Federation. In addition to the refinery, Ukrainian attack UAVs attacked production facilities involved in the production of Russian weapons. The Kremniy El microelectronics plant in Bryansk was affected. This is one of the key enterprises of the microelectronics industry of the Russian Federation, which produces a wide range of microcircuits and components used in the Topol-M, Bulava missile systems, S-300 and S-400 air defense systems, as well as in the on-board electronics of combat aircraft. In the Bryansk Region, in the city of Seltso, a chemical plant was hit, where ammunition for barrel artillery, rocket launcher systems, aviation, engineering ammunition and components of Kh-59 cruise missiles. The Smolensk Aviation Plant, where combat aircraft are modernized and produced, was also attacked by Ukrainian drones. In addition, the Defense Forces struck the warehouses for the storage of attack UAVs of the Russian occupiers in the Oryol region of the Russian Federation. Ukrainian drones hit concrete structures where thermobaric warheads, which are equipped with UAVs, were stored. It is known in advance that the enemy will no longer use more than 200 Shaheds against Ukraine. The defense forces of Ukraine also managed to successfully hit the locations of the Russian occupation troops. The force of our strikes was felt at three command posts of Russian groups in Kurshchyna. In the Belgorod region, it was possible to successfully hit the positions of the anti-aircraft missile division of the 568th anti-aircraft missile regiment of the radar company of the radio engineering battalion of the 336 radio engineering regiment. In addition, two enemy anti-aircraft missile complexes - -Tor- and -Buk- - were destroyed in Bryansk region during the attack on the chemical plant.

What UAVs are capable of on fiber optics: ArmiyaInform report on drone testing	We immediately noticed the pilot Tatiana with the call sign -Red-. The woman was constantly checking whether the drone was connected correctly, whether there was a video signal and whether everything was ready for the demonstration flight. — We use optical fiber in these drones to counter enemy EW, says Ruda. - Our goal is not to give the enemy the opportunity to muffle the fiber-optic control system, and this allows radio masking of the crews. Tatiana says that the absence of problems with radio interference provides high-quality communication from the point of take-off of the drone until it hits the target. - Our fiber optic FPVs can fly as far as the coil will allow. Currently available in 3, 5, 10 and 15 km. However, we plan to integrate larger ones so that the drone can fly 50 km, the pilot added. Meanwhile, one of the representatives of the -Sky Hub- school talked in detail about how to properly connect the optical fiber to the drone. - The assembly takes 30 minutes in total, followed by the setup procedure on the laptop. If there are ready-made settings, then it will take three minutes, if it is a complete setup process, then it will be 30 minutes. A very important stage is the testing of the drone. The pilot should fly it first without load, then with a load, give feedback so that the drone improves and is ready for use on the front, the military noted. He also emphasizes that the quality of the optical fiber is an extremely important issue, because it depends on them how high the rate of damage to the target by the drone will be. It is not only small FPV drones that are integrated under optical fiber. Recently, large bombers, or as they are also called -mothers-, have also been following this path. - In fact, optical fiber is a control system and can be integrated into all front-line drones except the Mavic. The advantage of such a solution for large bombers is that the reel, for example, weighs 3.2 kg, maybe less. If this can be significant for an FPV drone, then for our -mothers- it means simply taking one less projectile, - says Dmytro. — Bomber payload is 21 kg for every 10 km. Maybe it will fly a little shorter distance, but that's normal. In addition, the man noted that when the coil ends, the drone simply releases it and the UAV returns on its channels or azimuth to the point from which it took off.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/01/na-shho-zdatni-bpla-na-optovolokni-reportazh-armiyainform-z-testuvannya-droniv/	2025-01-31T20:47:33-08:00
About superiority in information warfare, support of front-line media and the project -Press officer...	—Mr. Serhiy, what, in your opinion, has changed in Ukrainian journalism, the national information space since the beginning of Russia's large-scale invasion of Ukraine? — I note that Ukrainian journalism began to transform even after the events of 2013-2014. She has changed a lot. After all, the concepts of war, hostilities, the need to repel the occupiers on the battlefield - these topics, difficult topics, have been in the Ukrainian media since 2014. But from the moment of a large-scale enemy invasion, every media person, in one way or another, has already become a war journalist from the point of view of fulfilling his duties. Because it was always necessary to take into account the increased danger in which our entire society is, within which our reporters have to work. And, accordingly, the agenda of the Ukrainian media from February 2024 is really determined by the factors that the priority should be topics that help Ukrainians to save lives, to unite in order to repel the occupiers. Topics related to coverage of the exploits of Ukrainian heroes and the Defense Forces in general. At the same time, it must be said that a radical restructuring took place in the activities and the very existence of the domestic media in a situation of increased danger, as well as in the conditions of the destruction of the unstable market of Ukrainian mass media, unstable financial income. Today, they define our information field. Unfortunately, we are saying that hundreds of Ukrainian media and thousands of journalists have stopped their activities both due to economic factors and factors related to the war and the occupation. Accordingly, it must be stated that Ukrainians' access to independent sources of information, in particular regional information, is unfortunately decreasing in Ukraine. But on the other hand, actually, in Ukraine, hundreds and hundreds of already experienced military personnel continue their daily work, professionally covering defense topics and providing objective current information from anywhere in Ukraine. But, of course, the key point that unites us and our colleagues from the international media of the democratic world is the existential challenge. Because Russia sees journalists and the media as a threat to its military offensive, a threat to its propaganda. Propaganda is an integral part of Russia's insidious aggression. So, here we see that this is also a certain battlefield for both Ukrainian and international media to protect their standards and values, which are defining for us, and the freedom for which our soldiers are currently fighting on the front. —Indeed, today hostilities are taking place not only on the fronts of the Russian-Ukrainian war, but also in the information space. In your opinion, on whose side is the advantage in these duels? What do Ukrainian media representatives benefit from, and where are we still failing? — Of course, we currently have a large-scale information war with the enemy. And here we still cannot say that we are on the same level as the Russians. And today in Ukraine, the majority of domestic media still do not receive significant state support for their existence and development. Here, of course, there is an objective factor: in wartime, the priority of state budget spending is directed to the support of the Defense Forces, because they must be provided with everything they need. But at the same time, it would be important for the Ukrainian government to loudly call on international partners to strongly support Ukrainian media so that there is stability in their reporting. Because if we talk about the professional quality of domestic mass media, it is at a high level: both nationally and regionally. And, accordingly, thorough journalistic materials - investigations, reports - they expose the fakes and lies of Russian propagandists. But, again, it is not enough for newsrooms to compete on the information field by themselves. The support of the Ukrainian media space is necessary. We say that the Ukrainian media will benefit from courageous, objective reports from the frontline. Representatives of our mass media document war crimes, so these objective materials are taken into account by international institutions, governments, and international media. Therefore, we say that Ukrainian media really win here, and we are visible. When we talk to our foreign partners and compare Ukrainian materials about the war with reports from frontline reporters of leading international media outlets, we again see the same level and the same expertise. Yes, they paint a terrible picture of the war, but we do not plunge into some primitive counter-propaganda, which would simply be a direct reflection of Russian propaganda. So it's still somewhat of a victory that we've been able to stay truthful in our coverage of these difficult events. Although, of course, the absolute priority for all journalists and the media should be the rule not to harm the Defense Forces and the Armed Forces of Ukraine. So, today, we see that our military mostly adheres to non-disclosure agreements regarding weapons, etc., so that the enemy does not use the mass media to plan their attacks. But, again, since the enemy is extremely powerful, it is difficult to conduct this duel without significant external support, both methodical and informational, analytical, and expert. - What projects did the National Union of Journalists of Ukraine start to implement in the conditions of a large-scale war, and why was it successful? - We completely restructured our activities. And, accordingly, the key priorities for us are both the issue of safety of journalists and the security of the media in general, as well as the search for resources for the survival of the media, for their sustainability. Among our initiatives, already after providing some kind of emergency aid, is mediation in providing journalists who escaped from temporarily occupied territories with financial support, assistance with equipment, as well as starting a network of journalistic solidarity centers. This is actually a network of small regional press hubs in separate regions of Ukraine. Initially, they were created in Western Ukraine. But at the moment, their activities are intensified in the front-line territories - these are Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipro. Within the framework of this network, we administer requests from journalists from all regions and from abroad, related to the provision of protective equipment for work on the front, with the receipt of equipment, with the receipt of psychological assistance. We organize seminars, trainings on physical safety, hand over first-aid kits. And, in fact, this is such a system of mutual assistance with the assistance of the National Union of Journalists of Ukraine, but with the basic support of the UNESCO headquarters, the International European Federation of Journalists and our various international partners. - One of the Union's activities now is the support of regional printed publications in the front-line and de-occupied areas. How important is this project? — Yes, in addition to the network of journalistic solidarity centers, our prominent task is the initiative to revive front-line newspapers. In the conditions when Russia is attacking infrastructure facilities, for thousands of Ukrainians living in the de-occupied territories or in areas close to the contact line, the print local media is often the only source of qualified and important information about their regions. The initiative of the Union is that we finance, again with the help of an international Japanese donation, the printing of the first issue of a local front-line newspaper as a restart of all processes in the circumstances of relocation, suspension of activities, etc. And then we recommend these projects to our other international partners for sustainable support. And, in fact, the result of such activity is the revival and support of 32 front-line newspapers. In particular, in Zaporizhzhia, Kherson, Mykolaiv, Donetsk, Sumy, Chernihiv regions. We understand that it is this network of front-line magazines, it is, perhaps, a newspaper information marathon that bridges the information deficit in regions where the National Telethon cannot technically reach. Get to places where Ukrainians do not have the opportunity to use the Internet or receive a TV and radio signal. This is our project of regional media lobbying both at the level of the government of Ukraine and at the level of international partners. Because it is often difficult for foreign donors to understand and see the contribution of journalists in the regions. - In continuation of this topic. Perhaps this is a trivial question, but periodically from the same volunteers who cooperate with international structures, we have to hear that partners from abroad are a little tired of the Ukrainian war: the international community is not so active in helping. At what expense do you manage to support this aid? — Indeed, we say that this is a general challenge for us, for the Union of Journalists of Ukraine, for other public organizations, and for the government to attract external support. Since the international organizations are somewhat tired of the war, one can say so. And on the other hand, this state of war between Russia and Ukraine and the state of conflict, according to their terminology, is no longer news for foreigners, it is no longer a stressful factor, as it was in 2022 from the moment of the invasion. And these are already certain realities. And that is why they are already shifting their gaze somewhere and are determined with certain priorities, switch to other countries, with other military conflicts. In particular, today many of our partners are paying attention to the Gaza Strip region, to the Middle East in general. Now the topic of the revolution and the liberation of Syria is gone. Yes, it is extremely difficult to attract high-level support to the Ukrainian media sector. But, on the other hand, despite the fact that we too are tired, we are exhausted, but we understand that we do not have the right to stop, we do not have the right to switch to any other topics at all. As long as this unjust war is going on in Ukraine, we increase our efforts, our activity: we inform the international community every day, prepare certain facts, report on the importance and effectiveness of aid. After all, let's take concrete facts: the same laptops handed over to Mariupol journalists. They allow colleagues to remain in the profession, to create materials that are necessary both for migrants from the Donetsk region and for informing the whole world. What unites and inspires us is the understanding that the resources, the help we attract, we proudly pass it on to our brave colleagues who work not in capital offices, not in quiet regional centers, but on the front lines. In particular, I admire the courage of the editor-in-chief of the newspaper -Vorskla- from Velika Pysarivka, in the Sumy region, Oleksiy Pasyuga, who lays out his so-called Route of Truth every week. Every week, he carries and distributes a freshly printed newspaper along the route from Okhtyrka, which is a relatively safe city, to Velika Pysarivka, on the border with Russia, leaving copies in village shops. I admire Svitlana Karpenko, who regularly brings copies of her newspaper to Orihiv, which is 2-3 kilometers from the contact line. And hundreds of residents of Orihiv, who live in basements without electricity, receive true and reliable information. I admire my colleagues from Kherson, Kramatorsk, Sloviansk, Pokrovsk and Myrnograd, who bring the truth to their fellow citizens. Such examples of dedication and courage of professional journalists are, in fact, the strongest arguments for us and for our efforts. And, of course, we cannot fail to mention another one of our priorities. This is a campaign of solidarity with Ukrainian journalists illegally imprisoned by Russia. We are making efforts to support the relatives and friends of our colleagues, whom Russia has unjustifiably thrown into its prisons, and to put pressure on international organizations with the aim of making efforts to release Ukrainian journalists from Russian prisons. After all, at least 30 Ukrainian media workers are currently in Russian prisons. At the same time, we have many of our colleagues who were detained by the occupiers in Zaporizhzhia, Kherson region, and their whereabouts are currently unknown. We also organize international photo exhibitions, such as -Freedom of Speech Shot-, which draws attention to our imprisoned colleagues. We make various printed reports, video materials. But, unfortunately, the key profile challenge in this war for the democratic world is that the aggressor country absolutely ignores all international rules and conventions that the Soviet Union and Russia ratified and integrated at one time. And on top of all that, Russia is slanderous, it makes -marks- on Ukrainian journalists that they are allegedly terrorists, subversives, spies, in order to discredit media workers in any way. But at the same time, we see that the civilized world clearly listens to the arguments of the Union of Journalists of Ukraine. We confirm the journalistic status of each of our colleagues. And we demand, of course, the dismissal of our colleagues. And the results are already there: the fact that Nariman Dzhelal was released in 2024 through exchange, and Maksim Butkevich, who was also released last year through exchange, is a certain contribution to this common cause and due to the efforts of NSJU activists. — Even before the first Russian attacks on Ukraine, many journalists served in the ranks of the Defense Forces in the ranks of the NSJU members. Already after 2014, and especially after 2022, military journalists were joined by mobilized communists. Do you lose touch with them? What is he like? — Of course, this is also one of our priorities — support for our comrades, our heroes, who are already performing their duties for the defense of Ukraine in various positions. And accordingly, both our regional organizations and the central office, we are also looking for volunteer resources to support our colleagues in the military. We also make a corporate contribution to the support of the Union of Journalists of Ukraine for the Defense Forces, and launched our initiative -Press officers are important!-. This is a direct joining of efforts to support colleagues who, in their ranks, organize information about our heroes and military operations. Which, in particular, provide escort of civilian journalists to frontline positions. And within the framework of such an initiative, we launched a special award of the Union of Journalists of Ukraine. This is such an honorable award from the multi-thousand-strong journalistic community to recognize the military work of press officers, about whom we receive the best feedback from civilian war-journalists who go to the front. And in 2024, Serhiy Cherevaty, Roman Chop, Ilya Yevlash, Serhiy Skibchyk, Kateryna Petrenko and other colleagues were among the first to receive this distinction. But, in addition to moral recognition, we also conduct fundraising campaigns and hand over vehicles to press officers. In particular, we also provided a car for Soledar's press service, once on the hottest Bakhmut route. And in 2024, we handed over a car for the press service of the 24th brigade. At that time, in May, the positions of the 24th Brigade were in New York, a Ukrainian village located a few kilometers from the contact line with the occupiers. Personally, it was a great honor for me, together with my colleagues, to come to the position in New York, hand over the car there and understand that it will really help the press service in its extremely responsible and dangerous work, both in terms of covering events from the front and accompanying civilian journalists, especially international filming groups Because we also understand that international support and great global solidarity with Ukraine largely depend on this. And in this unjust war, it happens precisely because the citizens of democratic countries will receive this terrible truth about the war, about its injustice, through their media. And, accordingly, they begin to demand from their governments to make efforts to properly support Ukraine. Recently, the NSJU has brought cooperation with the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine to a new level. Especially in the part of establishing effective communications between the Defense Forces and civilian media in matters of dissemination, additional attention to our army heroes, in general to the Ukrainian army. In particular, we regularly recommend publishing the best materials of the information agency ArmiyaInform in the leading regional media. These are portrait materials that add emotion and details to the images of Ukrainian soldiers and officers, our defenders. We also assist in collaboration between Army FM, Army Radio and the civilian media sector. The union conducts various activities to encourage civilian journalists and their editors to create more professional, in-depth materials on army topics, recruiting topics, army support topics, etc. So, we understand that the military media alone is not enough in informing to tell stories about all the realities that exist. Likewise, for the military, general public support is extremely important. We are very moved by the reviews when soldiers, officers are wisely remembered when their relatives, close people call them, say, from Sumy region, Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk and are proud of their relatives wrote a local newspaper or local journalists.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/01/pro-perevagu-v-informvijni-pidtrymku-pryfrontovyh-media-ta-proyekt-presoficzery-vazhlyvi-intervyu-z-golovoyu-naczspilky-zhurnalistiv/	2025-01-31T20:35:12-08:00
Blatant thefts of the fake state: when and from whom did Russia steal the coat of arms, flag and ant...	ArmyInform reminds of the most flagrant thefts of Russia, which it considers its -primordial-. The coat of arms of Russia is a double-headed eagle, which they -borrowed- according to the official version from the Byzantine Empire. According to another, no less popular, he was a legacy of the Golden Horde, because he was minted on their coins by Khans Uzbek (1283–1341), Janibek (d. 1357) and Aziz Sheikh (1365–1367). But it is more likely that this coat of arms became a trophy. It began to be used after the conquest of the Tver principality by Muscovy. Back in the 14th century, Tver was an implacable rival of Moscow for primacy in Zalissa, and the struggle between the Tver and Moscow princes for the khan label on the Grand Duchy of Volodymyr was very fierce. &nbsp; The double-headed eagle was on the coins and seal of the last prince of Tver, Mikhail Borisovich, issued in the 1470s. And already in 1497 (a few years after the conquest of Tver) he first appears on the state seal of the Moscow prince Ivan III, along with the title -prince of Tver-. The Russians got their tricolor from the Netherlands. The Dutch engineer David Butler, who oversaw the construction of the first Russian sailing ship -Orel- (a type of Dutch pinas), appealed to the Boyar Duma with a request -to ask His Royal Majesty for an order: which, as is the custom in other states, to raise on the ship a flag-. The king ordered to ask him, the butler, which is the custom in his country. Thus, the Dutch tricolor flew over -Orly-. According to another version, in 1693 Peter I ordered a Dutch-built frigate in Amsterdam. In 1694, when it arrived, the Dutch red-white-blue flag was flying on its stern, so the Tsar decided to declare it the trade flag of Russia. Soon, the Russian white-blue-red flags successfully misled the security of the Baltic Sea ports. They were simply confused with the Dutch&#8230; The basis of the modern Russian anthem is the song -Hymn of the Bolshevik Party-, which was written in the 1930s and glorified by Stalin. It was this work that later became the basis of the anthem of the USSR, which Putin returned with cosmetic changes in 2000. The author of the melody of the Bolshevik national anthem is the well-known plagiarist Oleksandr Alexandrov. Therefore, it is not surprising that this melody also turned out to be stolen, like everything else in Russia. The piece, which has now become Russia's national anthem, used a chord sequence from the -Canon in D major- by German Baroque composer Johann Pachelbel. Although, it is possible that Alexandrov took it from the later work of the Ukrainian composer Mykola Lysenko -Epic Fragment-. <iframe loading=-lazy- title=-Mykola Lysenko.

This song became popular during the Soviet-German war under the name -Holy War-. As we can see, Russia does not have its own coat of arms, flag and anthem. She stole them like everything else.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/01/krychushhi-kradizhky-derzhavy-fejk-koly-i-v-kogo-rosiya-vkrala-svij-gerb-prapor-i-gimn/	2025-01-31T20:22:23-08:00
Zradophilia Undoes, or Why Video Confessions About Mass Waste From Positions Is Fake	Another -investigation- of the Kremlin's fake agents is the -sensational confession- of the Ukrainian military about the alleged lack of rotations and massive waste from positions. A deepfake video, where some unknown fighters in -pixels- complain about the command, is already circulating in the Russian public. In the video, you can see a group of -Ukrainian military personnel- (although half of them wear Russian-style armored personnel carriers), who complain to the camera: -We have been sitting here without rotations for a year, we are not allowed to leave,- -The command has abandoned us,- -The Armed Forces of Ukraine is falling apart, guys just go-&#8230; One of the -fighters- even declares that his unit is -forced to leave their positions- because -they were betrayed.- 1. Deepfake - but not deep The voices of the characters in the video are superimposed on a separate track, in some places the desynchronization of lips and sound is visible. The conclusion is that either the Russians took an old video and re-edited it, or they used artificial intelligence, but again -saved-. 2. -Fighters- without faces and with strange chevrons Everyone in the video has their faces covered - some in balaclavas, some just in the shadows. But something else is interesting - one -military- unit has a chevron on his sleeve&#8230; up a drigue. Another one has it sewn on the other way around. 3. Phrases that the Ukrainian military will never say: -They have left us, no one is changing us- - the Ukrainian military clearly understands the system of rotations, and it is unlikely that they will -complain- about it to the camera for TG channels. -The command abandoned us- - the Ukrainian army is famous for the fact that the commanders fight alongside their subordinates, unlike the Russians, where the -mob- and the commander are two different castes. -We have nothing to fight- - well, except for the tens of thousands of drones, Leopards, artillery, and MSRW that somehow destroy Russian equipment every day. 4. Why are there -no rotations-? For some reason, the Russians do not explain how -the military is sitting without rotations- when literally every day there are official videos about the rotations of units in different areas of the front. But who cares about real facts when you can invent another betrayal? Russia is again trying to attack not only with drones, but also with fakes, but, as always, in a clumsy, primitive way and with a lack of understanding of how the real Ukrainian military works. Zradophilia is canceled, the video is in the furnace, and thanks should not be given to Russian fake generators, but to our infantrymen, artillerymen and drones, who do everything every day so that Russian mobs no longer have to -complain- about anything. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/02/01/zradofiliya-skasovuyetsya-abo-chomu-video-ziznannya-pro-masovi-vidhody-z-pozyczij-cze-fejk/	2025-01-31T20:01:29-08:00

As ArmiyaInform correspondent reports, Lieutenant General Ivan Havrylyuk, First Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine, announced this during a briefing on January 31. -I, as the First Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine, whose authority does not include the function of procurement at all, but due to the great failure and the understanding that many things will not be completed, I had to take about 30% of my official time, starting from September 2024, to focus specifically on the areas of procurement of lethal weapons. And at the end of 2024, the problem turned into a media problem in general, and later into the next plane. Not in relation to the structure as an agency, as a state enterprise, but in relation to the person of the head of this agency,- said Ivan Gavrilyuk. He emphasized that two state agencies will continue to function in Ukraine: the State Rear Operator and the Defense Procurement Agency. -Today, the budget of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine is almost 80% of the budget that goes to the Security and Defense Forces. This is about 1.5 trillion hryvnias in total. From this resource, more than 400 billion was allocated for the purchase of weapons, military equipment, as well as for repair and maintenance,- said Lieutenant General Ivan Gavrylyuk. Ivan Gavrilyuk emphasized the importance of uniform and timely supply of resources for the Armed Forces of Ukraine. -We cannot allow a decrease in the monthly provision of the needs of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. This is necessary to maintain the front line, stabilize it and create conditions for further actions that will bring us closer to the big goal — victory over the Russian Federation,- said the First Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine. He also emphasized that any involvement of the state in internal disputes will only delay the achievement of this goal. According to him, the more Ukraine is distracted by various -showdowns-, the more distant the victory will be. As ArmiyaInform wrote, on January 31, the MOU officially announced that from the position held the director of the SE -Defense Procurement Agency- Maryn was dismissed Bezrukova. Arsena Zhumadilov has been appointed temporary acting director.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/31/zmina-kerivnycztva-agencziyi-oboronnyh-zakupivel-zastupnyk-ministra-oborony-poyasnyv-prychynu/	2025-01-31T11:53:18-08:00

According to the investigation, the suspect sought out a conscript who wanted to leave the country during the war and promised to help with a transfer to Romania for $4,000. It has been established that he ordered the man to arrive in Prykarpattia, and from there ensured his delivery to the border town of Zakarpattia Oblast and settlement in one of the recreation complexes. In order to implement the plan, he involved several more accomplices, materials related to which are allocated in a separate proceeding. According to the developed plan, one of the accomplices was supposed to take the -client- to the border, and the other - to take him on foot through the area he knew well, past the checkpoints. The settlement, according to the agreements, was supposed to take place after the success of the illegal device. Law enforcement officers documented the criminal activity of the specified persons, and they themselves were detained on the way to the starting point. At present, precautionary measures have been taken against all those involved.

The enemy is trying to manipulate public opinion in the temporarily occupied territories, in particular through newspapers that contain distorted information about Ukraine. It is noted that, although such printed publications as Novorossiya and Gorlovka are not popular among the local population, the occupiers have intensified measures to spread propaganda. Since the beginning of 2024, they have been trying to impose narratives about -Russia's inevitable victory-, -protection of the Russian language- and -social assistance to its members- on the residents of TOT. Most of the publications in these publications contain outright fakes aimed at discrediting the Defense Forces of Ukraine and justifying the aggressive actions of the Russian Federation. Ukrainian military, analysts, and law enforcement officers continue to document cases of information terror and the fight against Russian propaganda. As reported by ArmyInform, the situation with the disposal of municipal solid waste (MSW) has reached a critical limit in the temporarily occupied territory of the Donetsk region. The occupation administration of the Russian Federation did not provide the normal functioning of the garbage collection and processing system, which causes increasing dissatisfaction among the local population.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/31/tak-starayutsya-a-nihto-ne-chytaye-gazety-novorossyya-ta-gorlovka-ne-populyarni-na-tot/	2025-01-31T11:44:30-08:00

According to reports, the attacker turned out to be a 33-year-old local resident, recruited by the FSB through social networks. -He was preparing coordinates for Russian missile and drone attacks in the region.

The kingdom of waste: the garbage crisis is worsening at the TOT of Donetsk region due to the inacti...	About reports Center of National Resistance. As it is noted, the waste disposal system during the years of occupation actually failed due to lack of proper maintenance. The occupiers not only do not support its functioning, but also completely ignore the problems in this area. The lack of separate garbage collection, the lack of specialized recycling enterprises and the chaotic accumulation of waste caused an environmental disaster at TOT. The situation is aggravated by an acute shortage of personnel in communal services, as a significant part of the workers was forcibly mobilized by the Russian army. This is another proof of the occupiers' indifference to the lives of local residents. The main goal of the Russian Federation is maximum exploitation of the region's resources and complete control over the population. According to the Center of National Resistance, the deliberate neglect of the communal sphere and forced mobilization is a direct violation of the Geneva Convention on the Protection of the Civilian Population in Time of War. As ArmiyaInform reported, the Kremlin is building dens in the occupied territories: a Rosguardian who -crushes- drug dealers was exposed.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/31/korolivstvo-vidhodiv-na-tot-donechchyny-zagostryuyetsya-smittyeva-kryza-cherez-bezdiyalnist-okupantiv/	2025-01-31T10:51:12-08:00

Yes, Russians from the Bryansk region are so afraid of swindlers and marauders from their own army that not only do they not want to help them in any way, but they don't even want to open their doors to these -heroes-, preferring to hide from them in their homes. -They walk elegantly, it seems that they are with some kind of Perm. Let us remove your fingers. Themselves dressed in uniform&#8230; They are robbing! That's why the hell knows what it is. It is better to sit closed. Do not open to anyone, even in the uniforms of these soldiers,- complained one of the local residents. As reported by ArmiyaInform, the military of the Russian Federation complains among themselves that mobilized Russians are sent -to m yaso- for refusing the contract.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/31/nas-grabuyut-meshkanczi-bryanshhyny-skarzhatsya-na-maroderstvo-z-boku-svoyih-vijskovyh/	2025-01-31T10:40:46-08:00

In Transcarpathia, two channels of illegal transportation of people across the border were exposed	About this informs State Border Service of Ukraine. One of the cases occurred on the outskirts of the village of Velikiy Bychkiv. Law enforcement officers detained two local teenagers, 17 and 18 years old, who tried to smuggle a 19-year-old resident of Lviv region to Romania. According to the ferrymen's plan, the boy was to cross the border by swimming across the Tisza River. He paid 11 thousand dollars for this service. The law enforcement officers documented the receipt of illegal benefits and detained the perpetrators in accordance with Art. 208 of the CPC of Ukraine. Another attempt to illegally cross the border was detected near the village of Solotvino.

The radar operator -Kasper- explained why, at the age of 19, he changed his duty at the monitor to t...	His story was shared by in the social networks of the command Air Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. According to the 19-year-old fighter, he always dreamed of being like his older brother. -Enter the Kharkiv National University of the Air Force, get the rank of officer. He still does not give up on this dream. He only postponed it a little - until the victory of Ukraine. He says: now he is more needed here,- said the PS of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. After entering the service, the boy became a radar station operator in the tactical aviation brigade, however, when the opportunity arose to join the Ground Forces, he immediately took advantage of it. -The work of a radar operator is interesting and responsible: you carefully look at the monitor, monitor, fix targets, send them to the command post- However, when the order came to rotate to the Rifle Brigade, I volunteered immediately. After all, it is the land that bears the heaviest burden of war today. And I - young, healthy, strong - can and want to be there,- he explains his decision. At the same time, Oleg complains that he has not yet been entrusted with direct participation in assault operations, maintaining forward positions or complex combat operations. -Now our main combat area is Vovchansk. We stand on the second line, and at any moment we are ready to replace our guys, who are directly on the front line. We hold positions side by side with paratroopers. Frankly speaking, there is no division between us. We immediately became a single strong organism, because in the end we all have one common goal,- Kasper shares. In this regard, he advises the youth who are trying with all their might to avoid service, not to be afraid and while there is still time, to undergo at least basic training in medical aid and military affairs. -This is our land, we have nowhere to run. So we just have to fight. Each of us must defend and win!-, the Ukrainian soldier urged. As reported by ArmyInform, earlier in the Air Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, the story of the unique aerial combat of the legendary -Beekeeper- was told, during which he destroyed enemy Su-25 without using weapons.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/31/operator-rls-kasper-poyasnyv-chomu-u-19-rokiv-prominyav-robotu-bilya-monitoru-na-sluzhbu-u-strileczkij-brygadi/	2025-01-31T09:56:26-08:00

The occupiers shelled the center of Kramatorsk for the second day in a row	This time the explosion was less powerful, so there were no casualties or damage. -This morning at 10:30 Kramatorsk suffered an enemy attack - the central part of the city. According to preliminary information, an attack UAV. Fortunately, there were no casualties or damage,- said Oleksandr, head of the Kramatorsk City Military Administration. Honcharenko. The consequences of the explosion and the work of utility workers were recorded by ArmiyaInform. Utility workers work tirelessly. A significant part of the windows that were broken yesterday have already been covered with chipboard plates, and the road surface is being restored at the site of the tear from yesterday's explosion. Today, an enemy munition hit a flowerbed nearby - just a few hundred meters from the previous hit. There are significantly fewer local residents on the street today. Lilia, who is inspecting the house, informs her neighbor by phone that the windows of her apartment, fortunately, survived, despite the fact that today's explosion happened much closer to her house. In Lilia itself, the windows were broken yesterday. The woman complains that building materials to patch broken windows are provided only to those who stay at home. Instead, nothing is issued for the temporary repair of the houses of those who left. Neighbors across the driveway left Lilia the apartment keys, but she can't help them. - They say, leave. Many of my neighbors have moved out and left me the keys to their apartments. And yesterday, building materials were issued only to me, because I am registered here and presented my passport. And what should I do with neighboring apartments? They are not given materials, although I have the keys to the apartments and copies of their documents, she says. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that On January 30, the occupiers shelled the center of Kramatorsk.

Two years under water - our fighters captured a unique trophy from the Russians	The video of the operation was published on January 31 on the brigade's channel. At one time, the Russians abandoned it when they fled. Left with full ammunition. For a long time, the BMP was not visible, due to the water, the level of which in the local pond had risen significantly. But during the fighting, the dam was damaged, the water level dropped, and our fighters noticed enemy armored vehicles actually in the middle of the pond. The idea immediately arose to withdraw the BMP and involve it in the Defense Forces. Preparation for this operation lasted one and a half months. Finally, the BMP was pulled out and after repairs it will start destroying the Russians. -On the one hand, this is a brilliant, thoughtful, heroic operation. On the other hand, if our soldiers had enough modern equipment, perhaps we wouldn't have to risk their lives and health for the sake of such -monsters,- the brigade commented on the video. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the 63rd mechanized brigade made a selection of Russian soldiers, which lit up after meeting our drones.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/31/dva-roky-pid-vodoyu-nashi-bijczi-zahopyly-u-rosiyan-unikalnyj-trofej/	2025-01-31T04:03:00-08:00
Change of leadership of the Defense Procurement Agency: official comment of the Ministry of Defense	This is stated in the message at site MOU. -This decision of the ministry is justified by the need to guarantee a stable and continuous supply of weapons and ammunition to the front,- the ministry said. Among the key reasons for the change of the head of the AOZ in the ministry were named: non-fulfillment of planned supplies for the front, numerous remarks of the General Staff regarding poor planning of defense purchases and untimely communication on the part of the Agency, unjustified postponement of supply schedules. Numerous leaks of classified information, which will become a separate subject of consideration by law enforcement agencies, are absolutely unacceptable. Given the significant interest in this case, the Ministry of Defense clarified the legal aspects of the change in the Agency's leadership. On October 11, 2024, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine approved the nominations of members of the Supervisory Board of the Agency, which included two representatives of the state and three independent members. In accordance with international corporate governance standards, the Supervisory Board had to play a key role in monitoring the Agency's activities, ensuring its transparency and effective management of public procurement in the defense sector. The appointment of the first three members of the Supervisory Board (which is sufficient for its jurisdiction) took place on October 25, 2024 by order of the Minister of Defense. However, for a full-fledged start of work, the members of the Supervisory Board had to conclude contracts with the Agency. After the official formation of the council by the Ministry of Defense, the Agency was unable to ensure proper legal registration of legal relations with all members of the Supervisory Board, which led to a delay in its work. This is confirmed by the fact that the first constituent meeting of the Supervisory Board took place on December 17, 2024 (almost two months after the approval of the Minister's order). On January 20, 2025, one of the independent members of the Supervisory Board announced his resignation from the board. The reason was the lack of proper communication on the part of the Agency regarding the agreement on the details of the contract with him. This situation led to the reduction of the number of members of the Supervisory Board to four, which disturbed the balance and efficiency of its work. In addition, this composition of the Supervisory Board did not meet the requirement of the law that the majority of members should be independent. On January 20, 2025, the Ministry of Defense received a letter from the Chairman of the Supervisory Board with a notice of a meeting on the same day, at which it was planned to extend the contract with the Director of the Agency. On the same evening, the Agency's message about this decision appeared on Facebook, although the Ministry has not yet given its approval. On January 21, the Ministry of Defense received another letter from the Chairman of the Supervisory Board, in which the Ministry was given only a few hours to respond. On the same day, the MOU officially recommended not to renew the contract with the director, justifying its decision with arguments. However, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board did not convey this information to all members of the Supervisory Board. In the evening of the same day, the Agency again announced on Facebook about the -unanimous- extension of the contract. The Chairman of the Supervisory Board of AOZ did not ensure proper communication with its members and the Ministry of Defense. Some council members reported that they had not received the positions of the Ministry of Defense, although they were sent officially. After the Ministry of Defense independently sent its position to all members of the Supervisory Board, the independent members changed their opinion and voted against signing an additional agreement on the extension of the contract with the director. The Ministry of Defense emphasized that the mentioned actions of the Supervisory Board did not comply with the principles of transparency and consistency and contained a number of procedural violations: -It is important that when Maryna Bezrukova was hired by the Agency in January 2024, the contract with her was concluded by the Ministry of Defense, which acted on its own behalf as the authorized management body of the Agency. The law establishes that the change of the contract takes place with the consent of its parties. Therefore, the extension of the contract with Maryna Bezrukova required the consent of the Ministry of Defense,- the MOU stressed. Despite this, on January 23, 2025, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board Yuriy Dzhigyr signed an additional agreement without the appropriate approval of the Ministry of Defense. By this, he exceeded the limits of his powers, defined by the law and the Charter of the enterprise. Considering the unsatisfactory performance of the Agency under the leadership of Maryna Bezrukova, as well as the lack of cooperation and proper communication on the part of the Chairman of the Supervisory Board (representative of the state), the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine decided to replace state representatives in the Supervisory Board. The relevant information was immediately brought to the attention of both the specified persons and the Agency. Thus, only 2 members out of 5 remained in the composition of the Supervisory Board, which made it ineligible. In accordance with the legislation, in the event of the Supervisory Board's incompetence, its powers are temporarily transferred to the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. This gives the Ministry of Defense the right to make decisions on the management of the Agency, in particular, on the appointment, dismissal and removal of the director, as well as the appointment of an acting director. -In the conditions of war, effective defense procurement is a key priority of the state. Currently, the Ministry of Defense and the leadership of the Defense Procurement Agency are focused on contracting and uninterrupted supply of weapons and ammunition to the front. Contracting continues daily as usual,- the MOU said. The ministry reported that in the near future, in accordance with current legislation and corporate standards, a permanent head of the AOZ will be appointed. Both procurement agencies of the Ministry of Defense continue their work. In the near future, the leadership will be elected and approved, in accordance with all due procedures. -Ukraine is a state governed by the rule of law, where every citizen can appeal a decision in court. At the same time, all actions must take place exclusively within the framework of current legislation. The Ministry of Defense also turned to law enforcement agencies for an investigation and legal assessment of the actions of the Agency's former leadership,- the statement said.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/31/zmina-kerivnycztva-agencziyi-oboronnyh-zakupivel-oficzijnyj-komentar-minoborony/	2025-01-31T03:48:21-08:00

According to him, such a result was achieved thanks to a detailed analysis of the enemy's actions.

And also hunt Russians every night and every day with attack drones, destroy shelters, warehouses with ammunition and fuel. -Actually, we do not observe assaults as such. For now, they are trying to pull up and concentrate some forces, moving in small groups of two, three, five people.

To which the soldier replied: -We knew and know only that we need to hold Pokrovsk.- As Olga Reshetylova notes, the new 155th Brigadier General and his deputies created an investigation department, which included representatives of each of the battalions that suffered losses: -The -investigators- are actually minute-by-minute reconstructing the events during which contact with servicemen was lost, with find out what measures were used for evacuation, analyze intelligence reports to understand what could have happened to the missing brothers.- The military ombudsman notes that this is a good example of not a formal approach to conducting official investigations, but a real investigation, which should be implemented in other military units. -True, such investigative departments should not be deployed after the fact, but in real time. In addition to conducting high-quality official investigations, it is also a source of analytics for commanders and a subject for conclusions and work on errors. In the near future, the families of the missing persons from the 155th brigade should be provided with comprehensive information about the situation with their relatives,- Olga Reshetylova wrote in her post. It should be recalled that for the first time information about the problems at -Anna Kyivska- was announced by journalist Yurii Butusov in his investigation -The true story of -Anna of Kyiv-: SBI opened a case regarding the formation of the 155th brigade.- As a result, the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, General Oleksandr Syrsky said that -paid particular attention to building the capabilities of the unmanned systems unit of the 155th Mechanized Brigade, as well as problematic issues that need to be resolved. I gave all the necessary instructions.- Subsequently, in mid-January, the commander of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Major General Mykhailo Drapaty, in his message noted that he reported to the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces about the situation in the 155th brigade and the decisions made by the command of the Ground Forces for support of the unit and resolution of problematic issues voiced both by the servicemen themselves and by journalists. -I believe that the 155th brigade named after Anna of Kyiv is promising and will prove itself. Yes, it takes time and effort of many to correct mistakes made during formation. But the newly created Ukrainian brigade named after Anna of Kyiv can and should become a real -Gallic rooster- - a symbol of France: proud, indomitable and ready to fight for freedom,- Mykhailo Drapaty wrote at the time. Recently, the journalists of -Suspilny- visited the 155th brigade. In the video story, Serhiy Tsvetkov, commander of the unmanned systems battalion, told about this: -When PR goes like this (we are talking about public publicity about the situation in the brigade. — Ed.): well, like, the brigade can’t do anything there, then it affects the meetings, people don’t want to inform, they don’t want to help, because, like, there is a missing brigade and can't do anything. But in reality it is not so. We never give up and go only together to victory.- As proof of this, on January 30, the official page of the 155th published a post from the video, where it is noted that the brigade once again captured a Russian soldier. -One of the priorities for the -Anna Kyivska- brigade is replenishment of the exchange fund. Often, capturing an enemy is a more difficult task than destroying it. After all, it exposes to additional danger the person who demands to lay down his arms. It is not the first time that the fighters of the 155th OMBr have been recognized in this kind of operations, regularly demonstrating resilience and ingenuity,- the post states. As the military ombudsman Olga Reshetylova reported in her post, the intensive work in combat units gives a completely different understanding of the course of events: -While discussions were raging in Kyiv about the fate of the 155th brigade, its servicemen continued heroic battles: they went on assaults, fought back and held their positions.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/31/rozsliduvachi-pohvylynno-rekonstruyuyut-podiyi-vijskovyj-ombudsmen-pro-sytuacziyu-u-155-brygadi/	2025-01-31T00:31:40-08:00

Separately, she spoke about the process of rehabilitation and prosthetics: - It begins when the injured person first finds himself in the hospital. First, it is necessary to understand what exactly the patient needs. If it is an upper extremity, it should be taken into account when choosing a profession. If the lower one, prosthetists find out how much he will walk, what his requirements are, etc. Employees of the prosthetics center go through the entire process with the injured, starting from the examination in the hospital and ending with prosthetics and training on how to use the prosthesis. The director of the Center for Prosthetics and Rehabilitation noted that since the beginning of the war in 2014, they had to quickly create conditions for studying new technologies. — We have mastered electronic prosthetics of upper and lower limbs, in particular sports. The NATO project helped a lot in this, because we managed to train 20 specialists who are currently working all over Ukraine. We studied the technologies that we need in prosthetics for young guys, Antonina Saleeva stressed. Today, many veterans have completed a full course of rehabilitation, and there are even those who continue to serve in combat units.

How the propaganda of the Russian Federation takes away the childhood and life of young people in th...	The militarization of youth in Donetsk and Luhansk regions, as well as in the Republic of Crimea, has been ongoing since 2014, and with the beginning of a large-scale invasion, the unfortunate -military-patriotic- upbringing will also be experienced by the younger generation of Kherson region and Zaporozhye. This -gentle time bomb- is laid by Russian propagandists purposefully and methodically. ArmyInform systematized what Ukraine and the world are doing to counter this; to bring to justice each propagandist personally, and the Russian Federation as a state. In 2016, the Russian Ministry of Defense created a youth -military-patriotic- military organization. In fact, it is a movement that imposes the ideology of Russian aggression and educates the future soldiers of the occupation regime. It includes schoolchildren aged 8 and over. Among other things, children are forced to take an -oath of loyalty- to Russia, promise to -protect its interests- and -cultivate great patriotism.- After that, they are taught fire and tactical training, drone control, etc. In addition to Russia and the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine, branches of -Unarmy- also exist in Armenia, Tajikistan, and unrecognized Abkhazia. The occupiers work with the youth not -quietly-, but also generously report on their work on brainwashing young Ukrainians under occupation - you can find a lot about this on the Internet. By the way, the occupied part of Zaporozhye. Only within a few months of 2024 it becomes known that: And this is not the whole list. And this is only part of the information from temporarily occupied Zaporozhye. &#xfe0f; The head of the Center for countering disinformation, officer of the Defense Forces of Ukraine Andriy Kovalenko in the ArmyInform comment states that at least 1.5 million children from the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine have already passed through Russian propaganda processing. The Center for Combating Disinformation is engaged in the search and identification of individuals and legal entities involved in the abduction of children on the TOT, their ideological processing and integration into the occupation structures. In addition, the center is working on identifying propaganda networks of the Russian Federation that involve children, identification of propagandists and cultural figures, special services of the Russian Federation, who are involved in these processes. -The Center forwards the collected data on identified propagandists, natural and legal persons who commit crimes against Ukrainian children to the appropriate state bodies for taking measures, including inclusion in the sanctions lists,- says Andriy Kovalenko. Yes, on War&amp;Sanctions site there is a separate section _blank- rel=-nofollow- href=-https://war-sanctions.gur.gov.ua/kidnappers/persons->-Kidnappers-. Everything about those involved in the specified crimes on TOT is systematized there. In particular, according to Kovalenko, we are talking about almost 300 individuals and about 100 legal entities. And all the curators from the Kremlin and the special services of the Russian Federation, who work in the direction of the militarization of children from the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine, are gathered on the indicated website in the section -Kremlin mouthpieces-. Their names are also known, emphasizes Kovalenko. -In social networks, with the help of Vkontakte or Odnoklassniki, Russians are building a structure of propaganda, and teenagers from TOT are involved in this work. Later, children with leadership qualities are -taken on a pencil-. This is how the Russians cultivate potential agents of influence. And no matter how the Russian-Ukrainian war ends, these processed teenagers will already be agents of influence in the future. And this is a big problem that Ukraine will still have to face,- comments Andriy Kovalenko. Therefore, Ukraine should take preventive steps in order to extract children from the occupation: that is, protect them both physically and mentally, from the point of view of national security, and from the point of view of the strategic future. Thus, the national initiative of the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy Bring Kids Back UA was launched in Ukraine. It is aimed at the return of children forcibly deported by Russia. In January 2025, CPD and Bring Kids Back UA presented an analytical report-Militarization of Ukrainian children in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine-. Only an abbreviated version was published for the general public, its non-public part was presented to the Ukrainian special services. Among other things, the authors of the report draw attention to the fact that the militarization of children on the TOT poses a threat to their very lives. -The involvement of children in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine by the Russian side in military formations, training them in combat skills and instilling the ideology of aggression has tragic consequences. Children's participation in hostilities not only deprives them of their childhood and the possibility of a peaceful life, but also often results in the loss of their lives. These actions of the Kremlin are not only a crime against children, but also part of a hybrid war strategy aimed at destroying the Ukrainian nation,- the report says. Analysts also collected specific names of children treated by Russian propaganda, who later joined the ranks of the Soviet Union and were eliminated by the Ukrainian Defense Forces on the battlefield. This is, for example, Dmytro Kotov. In 2015, he graduated from Gymnasium No. 6 in Jankoy. He was a member of the -Junior Army-, this is confirmed by data from open sources. After graduating from the Sevastopol State Technical University, he completed contract service on the large amphibious ship -Novocherkask- of the 197th amphibious brigade of the Crimean naval base of the Russian Federation. On March 24, 2022, Dmytro Kotov died while participating in the Russian Federation's war against Ukraine. Is Ivan Shifman. He studied at school No. 1 in the city of Kalmiuske. In 2019, he joined the ranks of the Youth Army. After coming of age, he joined the ranks of the People's Militia of the Donetsk People's Republic and began serving in the First Separate Guards Motorized Rifle Brigade of the Russian Federation. Since the beginning of the full-scale war of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, he has been a participant in hostilities in the settlements of Starognativka, Granitne, Maloyanisol, Zaytseve, and Rozivka of the Donetsk region. On April 14, 2022, he died on the battle line near the village of Novobakhmutivka, Donetsk region. Is Ilya Moskvitin. He was also a member of the -Junior Army- unit that operated on the territory of the temporarily occupied Donetsk region. According to the materials published on the page of the movement, on April 14, 2022, Ilya Moskvitin was killed when he was detonated by an anti-personnel high-explosive -Petal- mine. The authors of the report summarize: since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, the Russian Federation has intensified the militarization of Ukrainian children in all temporarily occupied territories. And it is used as a tool to accumulate mobilization reserves of the enemy army. -These actions show, in particular, that the Kremlin has no intention of stopping the war against Ukraine and the Ukrainian people,- analysts emphasize. Analysts single out several means of countering the militarization of Ukrainian children. In particular, it is necessary to increase international pressure on the Russian authorities through additional sanctions against organizations and individuals involved in the militarization of children in the Russian Federation. In addition, it is worth creating global monitoring mechanisms for such violations. It is important to intensify cooperation with humanitarian organizations to finance programs of psychological rehabilitation, social adaptation, and training of specialists for the reintegration of children. It will also be appropriate to develop educational initiatives to prevent similar crimes and create a platform for coordinating the actions of international and national structures in the field of child protection.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/31/yak-propaganda-rf-zabyraye-dytynstvo-i-zhyttya-molodi-v-okupacziyi-i-chomu-ukrayini-vazhlyvo-protystoyaty-militaryzacziyi-na-tot/	2025-01-30T20:53:37-08:00
Who cares about Oreshnik: the expert named the systems capable of stopping Russian terror	Which countries have a system capable of countering Oreshnik? But do we have the resources to create our own anti-missile system of the same level? Military expert Petro Chernyk answered these questions. Oreshnik is a very serious missile system. the Russians present it as incredibly new, but in fact it is far from the case. So what is it? First. This is an old RSD-10 -Pioneer-, which was developed since 1976. This is a pretty serious system. Up to 5,000 kilometers - the task of shocks. The speed of the acceleration units of each is within the limits of 10 thousand kilometers per hour. This is classic atmospheric ballistics that reaches its target at a very high speed. the Russians claim that at the moment there are up to 36 combat elements in the Oreshnik booster unit. But there is a serious point here: it is highly doubtful that there is an explosive. Most likely, this is the kinetic part, because when any body is accelerated to such a speed, even a kilogram of nuts at such a speed will release more energy than one kilogram of TNT equivalent. And if you look very carefully at the single strike (we are talking about last year's strike on the city of Dnipro - ed.) that took place, you can understand the following: from the look at how these combat units came, it is very doubtful that they had any quality. Because a lot of light is clearly visible in the video. So friction light is generally combustion. It is doubtful that the Russians struck a real hard blow. The second system from which the so-called Oreshnik could grow is the RS-24 Yars, its lighter part. Is it possible to knock it down? It looks like neither the MIM-104 Patriot nor the SAMP/T system can handle it at the moment. But to claim that this is impossible at all is also not entirely correct. The Americans have a simply fantastic THAAD system, designed to shoot down just such ballistic targets. This system is atmospheric, it works beyond 200 kilometers. But there is a nuance. One machine costs 2.5 billion dollars. Yes, yes, I was not wrong. This is for one car. And the calculating machine is $600 million. Americans can afford it. And the only country that could afford to buy it is Saudi Arabia. True, there is some optimism. The Americans made the Typhon launcher, literally in 2024 they brought it into service. First of all, this system is designed to fire such a beautiful missile as the BGM-109 Tomahawk. But the package also includes the same launch container: it can launch the RIM-161 Standard Missile 3. This is exactly what an anti-missile is. They were developed against such ballistic weapons. There can be optimism for us if our American allies come to the conclusion that it can be handed over to Ukraine. And it is necessary to look objectively in the direction of developing own systems. Let me remind you that out of more than 30 heavy intercontinental ballistic missiles developed by the Soviet Union at one time, two-thirds were developed in our country at Pivdenmash. That is, the technological potential is there, the scientific potential is there. Only apply intelligence, apply engineering thought, apply financing. I am more than sure that there can be an own strategic anti-aircraft missile system that can cope with what is called Oreshnik. Although, for the sake of justice, it must be stated that at this very moment we really do not have such complexes yet.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/31/komu-oryeshnik-po-zubah-ekspert-nazvav-systemy-yaki-zdatni-zupynyty-rosijskyj-teror/	2025-01-30T20:44:22-08:00
An unexpected sensation: the deepfake taught Ukrainian soldiers to fear and surrender	Well, the algorithm was probably trained on their -mobs-, because such logic is foreign to the Ukrainian army. On the front lines, everyone knows very well: rotations are indeed difficult, delays happen, but what happens for sure is hard counter-attacks instead of -organized retreats- to the camera. And now to the details that once again betray the masters of propaganda: So if you see a new -incriminating video- on the Internet, where -military forces- for some reason speak in the voices of bots and look as if they were drawn by a drunk neural network artist - feel free to laugh. Because the only thing that really leaves the ground after such fakes are the remnants of the reputation of Russian propagandists.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/31/nespodivana-sensacziya-dypfejk-navchyv-ukrayinskyh-voyiniv-boyatysya-ta-zdavatysya/	2025-01-30T20:29:39-08:00
The combat horse of the Defense Forces with an interesting history: on the battlefield is the Pinzga...	As told then our agency, in the acquisition of the first batches of these cars were invested by both businessmen from the -citizen- and a former entrepreneur who at that time was already serving in the Ukrainian army, but continued to inform the army while remaining incognito. Two SUVs from that batch served in the combat brigades of the Territorial Defense Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, the rest were sent to other branches of the military. Subsequently, a few dozen more machines were transferred from Britain, which began to work both as tractors and medevacs, and as deep reconnaissance, support and communication vehicles. Therefore, in the present material, we will pay tribute to the -Pintzgaurs-, or as our soldiers nicknamed these armored vehicles - -Pintzam- and we will recall both the history of their creation and deal with some technical characteristics. The concept of this SUV was developed at the beginning of the 60s of the last century by Erich Ledvinka, the son of Hans Ledvinka, who went down in history as the engineer of the legendary Czech Tatra design. The car was built in the late 1960s by Steyr-Daimler-Puch of Graz, Austria and named after the Pinzhauer, an Austrian horses. It became popular with military buyers and remained in production throughout the rest of the century. In 2000, the rights to the armored car were sold to Automotive Technik Ltd (ATL) in Great Britain. ATL was subsequently acquired by Stewart &amp; Stevenson Services, Inc. in 2005; in May 2006, Stewart & Stevenson became a subsidiary of the aerospace and defense group Armor Holdings, Inc. A year later, Armor Holdings was acquired by BAE Systems plc. -One that provides rock-solid reliability and true go-anywhere ability!-. This was the description given to this -grasshopper- by the British military. In the basis of the design of this car, instead of a frame, a large backbone tube is used, which is lighter and stronger than a conventional frame for the driver. And the most important thing is that not only the drive shafts pass inside this pipe, the gearbox and transfer case are integrated there. Thus, all these units are shockproof. The car also has an original independent suspension. Thanks to this design, Pinzgauer has earned a reputation as a reliable off-road vehicle. The capabilities of the civilian unarmored versions of these vehicles were better than those of the Hummer or Land Rover Defender in some situations. The armored version received an additional 3 tons of weight, which to some extent affected the passability. Pinzgauer Vector with a 6×6 wheel formula, namely, such armored vehicles arrived in the first batch to the Armed Forces of Ukraine, quickly developed for the needs of the British military in Afghanistan. As experts from the Dutch defense portal, the Army Recognition Pinzgauer Vector was developed and put into mass production in less than nine months under an expedited contract awarded by the then Defense Acquisition Agency (DPA) to meet Urgent Operational Requirements (UOR). The Pinzgauer Vector PPV (Protected Patrol Vehicle) 6×6 is an armored version of the Pinzgauer 718 light tactical truck. The armored vehicle was produced from 2007 to 2009. The machine was equipped with a new armored body developed by BAE Systems Land Systems. It is believed that this machine has the maximum level of protection for its weight category - Kevlar armor is actively used here, in particular on the floor, and multilayer armored glass is installed in the cabin and rear doors. The machine provides protection against fire from small arms and fragments of artillery shells. The armored floor provides better protection against explosion and rollover, and the case is equipped with a reflective coating to help control temperature. The design of the Pinzgauer Vector is similar to a light truck with a two-crew cabin in the front and a landing compartment in the back, which accommodates four soldiers who can quickly enter and exit the vehicle through two doors at the rear of the vehicle. However, as the experience of using these machines shows, in some armies of the world, up to 12 soldiers were placed in the landing section. Each of the landing doors is equipped with a viewing unit to provide a view of the rear of the vehicle. The roof also has two large hatches that will allow two crew members to have a good all-round view. The Pinzgauer Vector is equipped with a 10 hp diesel engine. It can travel at a maximum highway speed of 105 km/h with a maximum range of 700 km. The weight of the car is 4400 kg, the maximum payload is 1600 kg. If we talk in more detail about the engine and transmission of this armored car, in the mid-1980s, more powerful 6-cylinder in-line diesel engines with a capacity of 109 hp began to be installed on the Pinzgauer instead of the gasoline 4-cylinder engine from Volkswagen with a capacity of 88 liters. The new engine practically did not fit into the engine compartment, so these versions received a characteristic -hump- in the front part. Later versions received a 2.5-liter 5-cylinder turbodiesel engine with a capacity of 120 hp. with ZF automatic transmission. The engine met Euro-3 standards. The 145-liter tank was enough for the claimed 700 km of mileage. Different versions of the Pinzgauer had different top speeds: for the Pinzgauer Vector PPV 6×6, 105 km/h is declared. As for the specifics of the Pintsa chassis, depending on the configuration, its ground clearance can reach 40 cm. The machine has large amplitudes of suspension travel up to 20 cm, differential lock (separately for each of the three axles), traction control system. Minimum distance between front and center axle. Such geometry provided tremendous opportunities for overcoming off-road conditions. The car has short front and rear overhangs, that is, it feels free on the asphalt. Early versions of the Pinzgauer had drum brakes on all wheels, which had to be disassembled and cleaned after forcing a deep ford because they would clog and lose their effectiveness. New disc brakes are installed on more modern versions. RunFlat tires are used. These vehicles are capable of towing trailers up to 5000 kg on-road and up to 1800 kg off-road. Among the interesting design features, it is worth noting the presence of an obstacle-setting device installed directly during the production of the machine, which counteracts improvised explosive devices. Incidentally, it should be noted that such all-terrain vehicles were supplied to the armies of about 30 countries. In particular, Austria, Bolivia, Great Britain, Venezuela, Malaysia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Oman, Pakistan, Serbia, Slovenia, Switzerland, and later Ukraine. If we compare this Austro-British -horsefly- with machines of a similar class that were inherited by the Armed Forces of the Soviet Union from the Soviet army, then we are probably talking about the UAZ-452 - a car that occupies an intermediate level between a jeep and a truck. However, there can be no further comparison in the conditional classification: -Pinz- in all parameters is several heads higher than that miracle of the Soviet automobile industry.

-Unskilled hands do not hurt-: how a logistics officer ensures the battalion's combat effectiveness	The story of the fighter was made public on page 46 of a separate airmobile brigade of the DSHV. One of the vivid examples of his work is the restoration of the damaged Husky armored car during the battles near Robotyn. Despite the shelling and difficult conditions, -Smart- together with his guys was able to repair the car right on the position, which allowed it to be later evacuated and returned to the formation. -They literally forced her to puta on the position, under Robotyn,- Oleksandr recalls. — Even here, half a hundred meters away, the -Leopard- rolls into position, and we twist the nuts. To the accompaniment of the battle, we did not even hear him appear. He shot and rolled away. The enemy begins to cultivate the territory in response. Everything around is on fire. And we have nowhere to go, the task must be completed. And the car was restored to a condition where it could at least be towed on a trailer. Later, she was evacuated, and after a short repair, she returned to service.- According to -Umnogo-, his team is able to repair any equipment, even foreign ones. They find spare parts all over the world, turn to volunteers and even make parts themselves. -We had a problem with the fan on the Humvee. Tried on a tractor, reground, digested, adjusted&#8230; And it's still going. A clumsy person's hands don't hurt,- Oleksandr jokes. Thanks to -Umny- and his team, the time to repair equipment has been significantly reduced. What used to take hours or even days is now done in minutes. -For example, what used to take five hours to repair is now done in 20 minutes. What used to take a day is now just three hours,- says Umnyi. Oleksandr believes that the main thing in work is responsibility and constant self-improvement. He demands the same from his brothers. -Development, self-improvement, responsibility- is the motto of -Smart-, which helps him and his team to successfully perform their tasks and ensure the combat capability of the 46th brigade. As reported by ArmiyaInform, FPV-group bomb technician Ilya with the call sign -Murena- worked as an inspector of tactical-operational response of the patrol police of Kyiv before the beginning of the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation, but very quickly learned how to equip ammunition, -so that they explode before in the face of the Russians-.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/30/u-nevmilogo-ruky-ne-bolyat-yak-oficzer-logist-zabezpechuye-boyezdatnist-bataljonu/	2025-01-30T11:52:54-08:00
How do the mobile baths of the Armed Forces of Ukraine work and how do they differ from Russian ones	As the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine explain, it allows soldiers to maintain cleanliness even in the most difficult conditions, such as a training ground, a field camp, or even a combat zone. -This is especially important in winter, when the lack of normal conditions for washing can be dangerous to health,- the military said. According to them, the mobile bath and laundry complex (MLPC) is quickly deployed and quite easy to use, since all it needs is free space for installation, water and electricity. But how does the Ukrainian MLPK differ from the trophy field bath of the Russians, see in the plot.

For this, he involved a local law enforcement officer,- the report says. According to the investigation, the first client was to be registered as a driver of an international route bus for $18,000, but after receiving an advance in the amount of $10,000, the dealers were detained. Currently, criminal proceedings have been initiated against them under Part 3 Art. 332 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine. The sanction of the article provides for punishment in the form of deprivation of liberty for a term of up to 9 years.

Previously, he worked in the Federal Service of the Russian Federation for the control of drug trafficking, and after its liquidation, he transferred to the Russian Guard. Experience in -covering- the drug business helped him take the position of head of coordination of anti-narcotics commissions. According to the Central Bureau of Statistics, Yukhman not only organizes the activities of drug dealers, but also receives a regular salary from them. The Center has at its disposal the personal documents of the occupier and his family, as well as evidence of his criminal activities. The collected materials are used to form an evidence base that will allow Yuhman to be held accountable for crimes against the Ukrainian people.

As reports the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Staff Sergeant Ihor Zova once encountered such invaders , who is currently defending his native Kharkiv Oblast and has already managed to get injured, and before the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation, he worked for a large company and had a quiet civilian life. -I was born in a family of military medics. More than 20 years ago, he began his adult life with service in the anti-aircraft missile regiment. But already in the 2000s, he said goodbye to the army, as he thought then, forever. And here I am again. Came to serve in the radio engineering battalion of the Air Force. When the need arose, together with his brothers, he came to the aid of the Ground Forces, because, after all, we all have the same goal!- he explains his motivation. And somehow, during a combat mission, a whole group of enemy soldiers fell into the hands of Zova and his comrades. -Got into position. The first explosion causes a small earthquake. Zova rhetorically asks his comrade: -When do you think we should expect the next one?- Less than a minute has passed. Swarms of drones overhead. But the soldiers are determined not to give the enemy even a meter! That's why they are entrenched, keep the defense- - said the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. And already in the evening of the next day, a group of the enemy came to their positions. -The task is clear: destroy the enemy or make him surrender. The main problem is the unknown: what weapons do they have, are they guided by drones? Therefore, they decided to act decisively and in the most coordinated manner. -On your knees! Captivity is the only reasonable way out for you!- shouted Igor. The three occupants fell to the ground in confusion and immediately agreed. They were sure that they were going to their own. And the offer to surrender was met with joy,- the military said. According to Ihor Zova himself, this became a good motivation for his battalion, and later 12 more invaders were captured by his comrades. As reported by ArmyInform, Ukrainian soldiers met a -rare type of occupier- in the Siver region, who after the elimination of his henchmen had the sense to surrender.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/30/poloneni-rosiyany-ne-pryhovuvaly-radosti-shtab-serzhant-zova-rozpoviv-yak-zmusyv-zdatysya-czilu-grupu-okupantiv/	2025-01-30T11:09:32-08:00

The government is currently negotiating with suppliers in Sweden and Europe for the supply of priority equipment, such as artillery and drones, Kremlin ministers said. In total, the aid package announced by Paul Jonsson consists of eight components, the largest of which is various purchases of the latest equipment, mainly from Swedish and other European defense industries, to be transferred to Kyiv. In particular, it includes: As reported by ArmyInform, Lithuania transferred a batch of MANPADS and missiles to Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/30/shvecziya-ogolosyla-najbilshyj-paket-vijskovoyi-dopomogy-dlya-ukrayiny-na-12-mlrd/	2025-01-30T08:36:00-08:00
Documents confirming the Ukrainian past of Kurshchyna were presented in Kyiv	In particular, the exhibition opened on September 6 and was dedicated to the beginning of the operation of the Defense Forces of Ukraine in the Kursk region of the Russian Federation. As Yurii Savchuk, general director of the National Museum of the History of Ukraine in the Second World War, noted, -most of the materials presented at the exhibition were introduced into scientific circulation for the first time. They were unknown not only to the general public, but also to a narrow circle of specialists. The catalog contains 72 documents and is self-sufficient and important, because these materials will forever remain in Ukrainian historiography, in the formation of our knowledge about this region.- SBU Major General Yulia Laputina, candidate of psychological sciences, emphasized: -Today is a significant event, because in the conditions of asymmetric war, where the parties are different in terms of resources, physical strength, and military strength, strategic communications are very important as a tool for countering asymmetric threats. For many centuries, Russia manipulated history, hid the true facts, and people did not know their identity for generations. And today we are talking about the fact that Ukraine, as a nation of free people, must convey the historical truth to the world. We do not manipulate - we prove real facts.- According to Doctor of Historical Sciences, Director of the Central State Archive of Higher Authorities and Administration of Ukraine Larisa Levchenko, all 72 documents from the catalog have been translated into English. This ensures their availability not only for Ukrainians, but also for a foreign audience, so that the world learns about the situation in which ethnic Ukrainians found themselves in these lands. The catalog, like the exhibition, consists of three sections. The first section covers the 17th-19th centuries and introduces the history of the Ukrainian colonization of the Kursk, Belgorod, and Voronezh regions from the second half of the 17th century. The head of the State Archives Service of Ukraine, Candidate of Historical Sciences, Anatoliy Khromov emphasized: -The story of this exposition of the exhibition should begin with the process of settlement of Ukrainians in these territories and the formation of a coherent, homogeneous ethnographic, cultural, economic and military region, which historically belonged to Ukraine. In addition to the modern Sumy and Kharkiv regions, it also included significant parts of Voronezh region, Kursk region and, in fact, all of Belgorod region. It was on this territory that five Cossack regiments were located - Sumy, Okhtyr, Kharkiv, Izyum and Ostrogoz, founded by immigrants from Dnipro Ukraine.- Documents show that in the middle of the 17th century, this area was settled by the natives of the Hetman region - Circassian Cossacks. They came to lands that were uninhabited before, which is also confirmed by Russian imperial documents. In particular, sub-ensign Bobovnikov reported in his report that -people from the Hetman region settle on the wild steppes and create cities there, and live separately from the Russians.- The exhibition presents census books, which testify that these cities were inhabited mainly by Ukrainians. In fact, Kurshchyna and north-eastern Slobozhanshchyna were Ukrainian lands. However, in the second half of the 17th century, after administrative reforms, despite the demands of the local population to join them to the Slobid-Ukrainian province, these cities were included in the Kursk Governorate under the leadership of Pyotr Rumyantsev-Zadunayskyi. Thus, the Ukrainian territories became part of the Russian Empire. Despite this, for more than two and a half centuries, Ukrainians preserved their national and cultural separateness and did not assimilate with Russians. During the Liberation Struggle, there were attempts to join these territories to the Ukrainian People's Republic, but they were unsuccessful. Therefore, the beginning of the operation of the Armed Forces in the Kursk region can be considered the restoration of historical justice. The incident in the city of Suja, where the Russian flag was shot down by a well-aimed shot, became symbolic. It was demonstrated during the press conference. This step is another confirmation that Kurshchyna is Ukrainian land, and the history of Ukrainians cannot be erased by the Kremlin's manipulations. As reported by ArmyInform, from August 2024 separate units of the 92nd Assault Brigade named after Ataman Ivan Sirk perform combat missions in the Kursk direction. And although the offensive of the Ukrainian defense forces was unexpected for the enemy, it is putting up strong resistance.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/30/u-kyyevi-prezentuvaly-dokumenty-shho-pidtverdzhuyut-ukrayinske-mynule-kurshhyny/	2025-01-30T08:15:30-08:00

In the 155 brigade, an investigation department was created, which deals with missing people	reported this on January 30 by the Commissioner of the President of Ukraine for Rights Protection servicemen Olga Reshetylova. -Now the -investigators- are actually minute by minute reconstructing the events during which contact with servicemen was lost, finding out what measures were used for evacuation, analyzing intelligence reports in order to understand what could have happened to the missing comrades. This is a good example of not a formal approach to conducting official investigations, but a real investigation of the circumstances, which should be implemented in other military units. However, such investigative departments should not be deployed after the fact, but in real time. In addition to high-quality conduct of official investigations, it is also a source of analytics for commanders and a subject for conclusions and work on mistakes,- said Olga Reshetylova. According to her, in the near future the families of the missing persons from the 155 brigade should be provided with comprehensive information about the situation with their relatives. Currently, the brigade is fighting heavy battles in the Pokrovsky direction. -While discussions were raging in Kyiv about the fate of the 155th brigade, its servicemen continued heroic battles: they went on assaults, fought back and held their positions,- recalled Olga Reshetylova.

The devastating consequences of the Russian shelling were recorded by ArmyInform. The ammunition hit the road surface, causing a hole more than 1 meter deep as a result of the explosion. Large and small fragments were scattered several tens of meters around. In the entrances of multi-story residential buildings located closer to the hole, not a single whole window remained, and in some places the frames were torn out. -There was an explosion - all the windows on the second floor flew out. Both in the bedroom and in the hall, the whole apartment was covered in sweat,- says a local resident. Her high-rise is one of at least six buildings affected. Lyudmila, a teacher of junior classes, who conducted the distance learning class, names the almost exact time of the explosion — at 11:05 a.m. To do this, she usually follows the lesson schedule: -I had the third lesson. He washes the window on the fifth floor. I did not hear the warning sirens - and here the explosion is very loud. I'm sitting by the window right now, there's a desk. Rama survived, only flowers from pots flew at me.- She was really lucky, because the glazing of the balcony of her apartment, as well as the windows of most of her neighbors' apartments, were broken. However, the double-glazed window survived, protecting the woman from glass fragments that could have been fatal. -I didn't want to scare the children,- Lyudmila continues, -but it turned out, of course, that I screamed.- I had to cancel the lesson, I asked the children not to worry, but I still can't calm down myself.- The woman does not understand why the Russian military is hitting civilian buildings where there are no military positions. Later, the same opinion will be repeated by an elderly man named Oleksandr: -The scariest thing is that we don't know when it will come and why. Why shoot at peaceful cities? We cannot understand what it is at all. What do we have here, the troops are standing?- Other residents of the affected buildings complain that many apartments, which now have no windows, have been empty for a long time - people left to escape the war. So it is not known how it will be possible to cover the windows in the abandoned houses with materials that will be provided by the local authorities and benefactors. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that the number of wounded in Kramatorsk has increased to 13: Donetsk region under massive shelling.

Ice element: how special forces divers learn to work in extreme cold	Photos of the training of special forces divers were published on the unit's page. The training covered a wide range of disciplines, including diving, firefighting, engineering training, navigation and underwater navigation. Particular attention was paid to practical training of key elements, such as surveying the bottom with the help of a navigation system, searching for objects on the bottom, preparing and using pontoons to lift objects, as well as working underwater with descents and ascents. In addition, divers studied the theory of undermining underwater and surface objects. The commander of the group of divers of the CSP -Omega- with the call sign -Dart- said that the emphasis of the exercises was on practicing movement on watercraft. This included tasks such as convoy tracking and solo, convoy break-up, working out conventional signs, mooring to the shore, rushing to the coastline and reconnaissance from watercraft using unmanned aerial vehicles. Watercraft were also used to cover a group of divers during missions. Winter training has its own characteristics, because the work takes place in extreme weather conditions. Low air and water temperatures lead to rapid freezing of the equipment, which can lead to its breakdown. This, in turn, reduces the time of underwater reconnaissance and task execution. Dart also noted that the Omega diver group works on a wide range of tasks, including surveying water bodies, lifting cargo, demining coastal areas and shores, sabotage tasks, suppression of fire points on the shore and rescue operations. As reported by ArmiyaInform, throughout 2024, servicemen of the Omega Special Purpose Center performed tasks in the hottest areas of the front. Together with other Defense Forces, they took part in dozens of successful operations.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/30/kryzhana-styhiya-yak-vodolazy-speczpryznachenczi-vchatsya-praczyuvaty-v-ekstremalnomu-holodi/	2025-01-30T03:37:18-08:00

If you imagine yourself in Volodymyr's memories, you can feel the hot air that burns like boiling water in a cup of coffee. In front of our eyes are tired soldiers digging trenches with their helmets, and the only source of water is a small lake, whose transparency and sweet taste will be etched in our memory forever. One of the most vivid episodes of those days was an ambush on an enemy column. -We were lying down in the shelters, when the combatant suddenly ordered: -Ah, silence, everyone! -. In a few minutes, we see a VAZ and a KamAZ drive past us, blocked by the military. And then our stocky cook says: -Boys, whore, not ours! -. He was the first to open fire, followed by all of us. Some units survived, including a lieutenant colonel of the Russian army whom we captured,- Volodymyr recalls. The next memory of Volodymyr is the defense of Makarov in March 2022.

Fast and successful: the British army's high-energy laser system is used for the first time to shoot...	As stated in the release published on the official website of the United Kingdom government, soldiers of the 16th Regiment of the Royal Artillery tracked and destroyed several UAVs in flight with a directed energy beam, having demonstrated the effectiveness of the system in real conditions, ArmiyaInform reports. The statement noted that the latest system, using a powerful infrared laser, was tested at Radnor Proving Ground in central Wales. In turn, equipment developer Raytheon UK, part of RTX (NYSE: RTX) Raytheon, emphasized that the tests were the latest phase of the MoD's Ground Laser Directed Energy Weapon (LDEW) demonstration program, in which British soldiers used Raytheon's HELWS, successfully tracking and neutralizing moving air goals -Our high-energy laser weapon system is used in operations around the world, and now the British Army is experimenting with this groundbreaking capability,- Raytheon UK chief executive James Gray said. -The success of this trial is the result of the skill, dedication and vision of our scientists and engineers who have worked with the British Army to help fulfill its commitment to remain at the forefront of technological innovation.- The experiment marks the first time the British Army has tested high-energy laser weapons mounted on armored vehicles, and trained soldiers in the weapons' targeting and tracking technologies. Separately, the British government recalled the fact that, unlike conventional munitions, laser weapons are practically unlimited in terms of ammunition stocks, which means that they can be a cost-effective alternative to some existing weapons. -This ground-breaking technology demonstrates the UK's commitment to remain at the forefront of military innovation,- said UK Defense Procurement and Industry Secretary Maria Eagle. -The successful test of this laser weapon system is a significant step forward in our development of a possible future defense capability and demonstrates British engineering excellence.- The laser was developed through a collaboration between the US Department of Defense, including the Defense Equipment and Sustainment (DE&S) and Defense Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl), known as Team Hersa, and an industrial consortium led by Raytheon UK. The Raytheon High Energy Laser Weapon System (HELWS) was installed on the Wolfhound armored vehicle. Our editors spoke in detail about such a practical combination at the project level in one of -wolfhound-osnashhuyut-lazernoyu-zbroyeyu/->materials. This equipment has a command and control interface and can be integrated with wider combat control, radar and surveillance networks. It is adapted to be installed on different platforms according to different work requirements. However, according to the results of combat tests in Wales, for reasons of secrecy, it was not disclosed how long the beam of the HEL system must remain in contact with the target before it is hit. British officials stress that this development has ensured the implementation of the government's plan for change through the rapid development of technology and the creation of a strong national security foundation. Great Britain has tested a powerful new laser weapon from an armored vehicle. Video: HUF HACK Great Britain tested a powerful new laser weapon from an armored vehicle.

This was reported by the head of the Luhansk Regional Military Administration Artem Lysogor on his page . According to him, the occupation authorities have not paid the workers due funds since October 2015. This shameful fact affects not only those who currently work at these enterprises, but also those who were laid off during this period. People who conscientiously performed their duties found themselves without means of livelihood due to the criminal negligence of the occupiers. The fact that all these enterprises are in the so-called -state ownership- of the self-proclaimed -LNR- is especially cynical. This means that the occupying administration bears full responsibility for this situation. The specialists of the following enterprises were left without funding: -Luhansk Polymetals-, -Gipromashcoal beneficiation-, -Luhanskvougleremont-, -Vtorpromtorg-, -Chemical Government Association-, -Lutuginsky Scientific and Industrial Rolling Mill-, -Yunist-, and -Central Design Bureau of Mechanical Engineering- -Donets-.

Autocivilka for UBD: how to issue a policy	Since January 1, changes have taken place in the Law of Ukraine -On Compulsory Civil Liability Insurance of Land Vehicle Owners-. If previously combatants were exempted from mandatory civil liability insurance, now there is no longer such an option in the law. Therefore, the auto-civilian needs to be issued. Instead, combatants received a 50% discount at the legislative level. At the beginning of January, some motorists were faced with the fact that they could not find companies that would provide such a discount to combatants. However, now the market has already reacted to the changes and the corresponding offers have appeared. The easiest way to find is to use the services of online services that accumulate information from various insurance companies. They have online calculators. Including with an option for beneficiaries. It is necessary to enter information about the vehicle, the volume of the engine, the place of registration and the available benefit (somewhere it can be the item -veteran-, somewhere -combatant-). And the calculator will select program options offered by insurance companies. There are certain requirements and restrictions for receiving a discount, including: Another important point is that the discount is provided for only one vehicle of the insured.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/30/avtoczyvilka-dlya-ubd-yak-oformyty-polis/	2025-01-29T21:04:09-08:00
A conductor in an anti-drone cloak: a senior technician of a separate infantry brigade revealed the ...	The serviceman is 35 years old and comes from the Rivne region. In civilian life (and by profession - ed.) - a teacher of playing wind instruments. At one time, he was also a member of the club and a conductor. Before joining the ranks of the Defense Forces of Ukraine, he also worked at a meat processing plant and was an operator of a smoking plant. At the beginning of October 2023, Oleg Targonskyi was already at the training ground, and in the middle of October he was sent to the BZVP in Estonia. Stayed there for 35 days. -Well&#8230; It was different. Another country, learning to survive (laughs - ed). As they say: fell into a wolf pack - you have to live like a wolf. Well, I did: I didn't expect that, without a foreign passport, you could get across the border,- he says with a smile. After his return, he took the position of driver-radiotelephone operator in the 456th battalion of the 141st brigade. Now he is a senior technician in the ranks of the 141st separate infantry brigade. Once, during a combat mission, he managed to occupy lost positions and destroy the enemy's manpower. Our interlocutor does not go into the details of this operation, but reasons as follows: -The assigned task had to be completed, no matter what it cost us. When you think about the fact that you have a wife and children waiting for you at home, there is no other option but to return, because they need you.- If we talk about the secret of success on the battlefield, Mr. Oleg, relying on his own experience, states: -On the battlefield, the skills he acquired from the instructors at the BZVP were very useful. It was not for nothing that I studied something, everything was needed at the right time.- To a traditional question to a military serviceman, whether he is afraid while performing combat missions and, if so, how he copes with fear, Mr. Oleg answers: -Everyone is afraid. But this is war, so there is no choice. Everyone has fear. And during combat sorties - even bigger. But you just put on an anti-drone cloak and you have to be careful: if you don't see the enemy, he will see you.- Victory for Oleg Targonsky will be the day when he wakes up in the morning and hears: -The war is over.- Mr. Oleg's two brothers are also in the army, fulfilling their constitutional duty.

40 soldiers in an armored taxi with a machine gun: the M113 armored personnel carrier showed what it...	ArmiaInform was told about the legendary -Emka- in the armament of the 33rd separate mechanized brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine by the battalion's deputy armament commander with the call sign -Pasichnik-, the technical support platoon commander Oleksandr with the call sign -Tyson- and the mechanic-driver Anatoly with the call sign -Vozduh-. The M113 is primarily designed to provide front-line logistics — to bring fighters to and from positions, as well as to deliver everything necessary -to the front-. However, this armored -horse on tracks- can also provide landing and fire cover for infantry during assault operations. - We call them -taxi-. They are fast and reliable for quickly bringing in or picking up people, evacuating the wounded, transporting BC. They can also be used to storm some enemy positions and landings. We have 12.7 mm Browning and Canik machine guns on them. This is very good fire cover during an assault, says Alexander -Tyson-. In the place of the machine gunner in the basic modification of the M113, there are triplexes that allow you to survey the area, so that even before moving into a combat position, you know in which direction you should open fire. The view through them is quite safe and quite good, no worse than the view available from the driver's seat. — The machine gunner needs to climb up to fire. Therefore, he needs to see where we are going, from which side we are landing, in which direction he will have to work now. Thanks to this, when he opens his hatch and grabs the machine gun, he already knows where to shoot, explains the platoon commander. On some -emkas- in general, automated systems are installed that allow you to conduct machine gun fire without climbing up. Being inside the body of the armored car, the machine gunner can control the weapons located in a small turret and fire using the screen and two joysticks. — Now we have such tasks, when these cars go out purely for fire cover. If the Russians press very hard on our positions, our machine will run up, -scoot- with a machine gun on the landings, drive the enemy away and return, - explains Oleksandr. However, most often, M113s work as -workhorses-, delivering everything needed by mortars and infantry on the front lines. For this, their route is calculated in such a way as to cover several positions at once. — The machine can travel a maximum of 70-80 kilometers in one run. To do this, load the car to the maximum and let it go around the -ring- so that it visits several positions. For example, we have mortar units located deeper in the rear than infantrymen. Accordingly, first we go to the mortars and then we go further to the -front-, explains -Tyson-. One such trip usually lasts 1.5‒2 hours. During this time, up to 10 positions can be visited depending on the need. In order to avoid detection by the enemy, it is necessary to drive at night with a night vision device, move at the maximum possible speed and not stay in one place for more than 2-3 minutes. — They work promptly, as quickly as possible, because if the machine stands longer, the enemy will see it from drones. And if the -emka- stands there for a long time, it means that it is unloading and there are positions there, says the soldier. What is dangerous, he explains, is not so much the possibility of hitting the armored personnel carrier itself, which becomes a much more convenient target in its immobilized form, as the unmasking of the positions of the fighters to which the M113 arrived. — We put at risk those people who unload there. Because the machine will go, but the people will stay and then the artillery will start working on them. That is why, on average, there is a 2-3 minute stoppage: the equipment was dropped, unloaded - and on the move, Oleksandr explains the features of using the M113 on the front line. One of the M113 modifications is the so-called -mule-. Instead of an armored capsule, such an -emka- has a platform designed for the transportation of large-sized cargo, which cannot be placed inside a conventional armored personnel carrier. Also, this armored car is slightly longer than the usual one - it has six support wheels instead of five. Already in Ukraine, the -mule- has been improved for the transportation of logs necessary for the construction of dugouts. For this, a structure was installed on the platform, which allows very quickly, almost instantly, to unload the logs delivered to the construction site. — If you just stack the logs on the platform, it will take a few minutes to unload them. And this triangular design allows you to fasten 10 logs on each side with ties and additionally fasten them with wire. You fly to the position, click two screeds and the logs roll down, explains the deputy commander of the battalion with the call sign -Beekeeper-. - Unload lasts 15 seconds. And this can be done by one person - it is enough to jump out onto a platform that is comfortable to walk on. And then quickly the car flew back. Everything is quick, everything is fast. This allows you to minimize the time spent on the -front-, he adds. Clarification about the possibility of unloading the load by one fighter is important, because it will take at least two or even four people to dump logs stacked in the usual way. Such an interesting rationalization solution not only optimizes the process of delivering specific cargo to the front line, reducing unloading time and the efforts of fighters, but also literally helps save lives. After all, where 4-5 fighters (together with the mechvod) would have to take risks for a long time, one can quickly cope. A very important characteristic of the M113 is the speed of movement. The armored car easily moves at a speed of 45-50 km per hour on any terrain. And on a good road it can be accelerated up to 70 km/h. At the same time, the automatic gearbox installed on the armored vehicle allows you not to be distracted by shifting gears. — If there is a good straight road and there is no load on the gearbox, then I put the fourth position and drive. Then I only use the selector to switch - forward, neutral, backward or turn on the spot. There is a special provision for making a U-turn on the spot, says the platoon commander. Even an untrained fighter can learn to operate the M113 in just a few hours. But, of course, tractor drivers and mechanics with relevant experience in driving heavy agricultural or construction machinery are most likely to get into the driver's seat. They are offered to become M113 drivers in the first place. -Emki- are very convenient to manage. On newer modifications, control is carried out with the help of a rudder, on older models there are levers. On the command and staff modification, it is true that you should slow down before turning, on the other hand, on the combat one designed for amphibious landing, you can turn sharply at any speed. — When you turn the steering wheel, one -guitar- slows down, and the second adds more revolutions. On the combat modification, just turned the steering wheel - and the -emka- immediately makes a turn. On older versions, there are levers at all, so it is even easier there - which lever you clamp - in the other direction and turn. They must have caught the Vietnam War in 1967, -Tyson- jokes. In the command and staff modification of the M113, which is shown to the technical support platoon, turning is somewhat more difficult - for this, you need to slow down and only then start the maneuver. Therefore, driving it requires slightly better skills than -combat- modifications. — Everyone can learn to drive the M113, the main thing is that there is a desire. Automatic gearbox, gas, brake and steering wheel. Started the car and drove off. The most difficult task of the driver is to remember the road correctly - where to drive, where to turn, where you can and where you can't get off the road, because there may be mines there, - explains Oleksiy. Good orientation to the local area and the ability to remember the road is the main requirement for the professional suitability of the emka driver. If there are no problems with this most difficult task, then everything else can be taught gradually. — To teach a new mechanic-driver to navigate, he is first put in the machine gunner's seat and driven several times with him to the positions, showing the way. Where you should and can drive in, where you can't, what are the markings for orientation in the locality, -Tyson- continues. — In addition, drone reconnaissance is mandatory. Every day, drones fly over and inspect the roads, because there are, for example, remote mines and they need to be detected. Intelligence is working, a route is laid out on the map, landmarks are determined. Mehvod should be well versed in this, the military man emphasizes. All this information must be well remembered by the driver-mechanic. Also, he must interact well with the machine gunner and the landing group, pay attention to the information from the drone pilots, which comes via radio communication. - To skillfully manage the -emka- is the easiest task for a driver. The main thing is to turn in time between landings, smiles the driver-mechanic with the call sign -Air-. — After the 13th landing, there should be a -clearance- and you have to jump into it. You drive, you count: seven, eight - and here -arrive- next to -babah!-. And already gone astray. Then you don't start counting again, but just look closely at where that -clearance- will be. A special system of tactile commands was developed for communication inside the rather noisy armored vehicle. Hit on the right shoulder - turn right, on the left - left, on both at the same time or in the back - stop. - These are the main commands. When they leave, they agree among themselves in more detail how to communicate. Because it's hard to hear in the car and you can't shout at the driver - you need special signs. In addition, many people drive with headphones, because after 4-5 departures per night, the driver's head simply breaks, says -Tyson-. Inside the armored personnel carrier, it is practically impossible to really hear anything - tank laryngophones for normal communication are clearly lacking. This forces fighters to improvise, negotiating different ways to communicate. — For example, you can agree on some kind of signal to reset the speed before turning or stopping. Run the mechvoda with your hand from the head down to the back. Then he will know that the next signal - stop or turn - is coming soon, says -Air-. Fighters who are eagerly waiting at the positions for the arrival of the emka and listen carefully can hear its approach already 2-3 kilometers away, because the armored personnel carrier is quite loud. The roar of three armored vehicles moving nearby makes you speak quite loudly, and with the approach of one of them even raise your voice to a scream. -Emks- have reliable protection, capable of protecting the driver and the paratroopers from bullet damage from any small arms and debris from close-range explosions of mortar mines and artillery shells. — The armor here is made of aluminum alloy. If somewhere from the side -arrives- from a mortar or artillery, then it withstands shrapnel brilliantly. One of the driver-mechanics said that when he was driving for a landing assault, he saw a machine gunner hitting him from 50 meters away with a PKM, this is a 7.62 mm caliber. And he only heard something rattling on his armor, Oleksandr says. Then the M113 successfully landed the attack aircraft, covered the landing party with fire and calmly returned. In general, says -Tyson-, the armor of the -Emka- is designed to withstand hits from large-caliber machine guns and, most likely, will withstand a direct hit from a mortar mine. Anti-personnel or anti-vehicle mine protection is just as reliable. An anti-personnel mine is capable of causing some damage only to the tracks of an armored vehicle and will not cause any damage to the mechanized vehicle or the landing party, an anti-tank mine will at most partially disable the chassis. — If it hits an anti-tank mine, the crew will, of course, receive aquabarotrauma. And this is when the crew is sitting on that side where the -harp- catches the mine. We have a mine crew that has been blown up by mines four or five times - and everyone is alive, everyone is fine. -Compared to BMP or MTLB, it's -Mercedes- against -Zhiguls-, because there, if you fly into an anti-tank mine, it's a hook for both the machine and the crew,- Tyson M113 compares. The military man has experience working with Soviet armored vehicles, so he knows what he's talking about. Soviet-made armored vehicles are not only less comfortable and protected, but also, based on their design features, they are less suitable for combat missions in the conditions of modern warfare. One of the undoubted advantages over the Soviet armored fighting vehicles Tyson calls the aparel - an inclined plane that opens horizontally in the rear part of the machine. Lowering to the ground, it creates a convenient inclined bridge for landing fighters. — Soviet cars have doors instead. Now, if a normal person is in an outfit, it is difficult to move through those doors even slowly. Because if a normal infantryman goes out, he has a plate carrier or a body armor, RPS with all the results, a first aid kit, stores. Even for me, with my height and 60 kilograms, it is difficult to push through, - jokes Oleksandr. Instead, the armor allows two fighters to freely and very quickly leave the armored personnel carrier or enter it at the same time. To do this, they do not need to make any complicated movements or make special efforts - it is enough to bend a little so as not to hit their head. - You can walk through the wardrobe as if into a room - the door is wide. The man ducked down so as not to hit his head - and freely ran in and out. It is very convenient, the main thing is to shout to bend down. Because it's good that I didn't succeed in height, and there are people who are taller, so they can sometimes hit me with a helmet, -Tyson- smiles. Thanks to the apparatus, it is especially convenient to evacuate the wounded, who can be quickly brought in and taken out even lying down. - It's all time, and for us time is everything. The sooner, the more responsive you are, the better. And if you carry a wounded person through the door, he will get caught there, hit. It will be necessary to somehow return it, check it - this is all an unnecessary delay, - Oleksandr emphasizes the convenience of the device. As additional protection, the M113 is equipped with anti-cumulative screens, grills and superstructures of mostly artisanal production. According to Tyson, they have proven to be a fairly effective defense against enemy FPV kamikaze drones with cumulative charges. — We put this mainly because of FPV drones, because they hang such strong cumulative charges on these kamikazes that they pierce any armor. And this additional protection that we are now welding allows to dissipate the cumulative jet. The charge is triggered at a distance of 30-40 centimeters from the armor - and then it survives, he explains. The military tells how, from the powerful explosion of the FPV drone's screen-detained charge, the debris hit the triplex and almost pierced it through. If the blow came directly into the armor, then there would be no chance to withstand the blow. On the other hand, the deputy battalion commander with the callsign -Beekeeper- speaks less favorably about the protective superstructures on the M113, believing that they only add weight and can hinder the movement of the armored personnel carrier in dense forests. - The best protection is REB. And if the fiber optic works, it won't help either. What can we expect from this screen if there is a contact detonator on the charge of the FPV drone, and the cumulative jet still goes to the armor and can pierce it? he asks rhetorically. He says that in the past, protective lattice screens of rib-mounted steel strips were designed against RPG charges and were really effective. On the other hand, against the powerful cumulative charges of FPV drones, protective grids are powerless in the vast majority of cases. M113 are very convenient to repair, have easy access to the engine. Many minor breakdowns can be repaired in-house not far from the front lines with experienced mechanics, tools and equipment, and spare parts. And it is possible to pull a caterpillar that flew off the wheels from an anti-personnel mine explosion in the field. — If the edge of the -guisli- hits an anti-personnel mine, the explosion can knock out one of the mounts - we call them -binoculars-. When one -binoculars- flies off, the whole -fiddle- can fly off. But if there is a spare mount, then it is very easy to replace it. I installed it, hit it with a hammer, tightened it - and you can drive on,- says Oleksandr. Damage from anti-tank mine explosions is more difficult, as the explosion damages the rollers. -Emka- with such -wounds- has to be dragged 15-20 km away from the front line for stationary repairs. — If it is an anti-tank mine, then, accordingly, there will be some damage to the support rollers. But here, too, the replacement is quite elementary - drive up, unscrew, screw in a new one - and that's it. Everything is very simple, elementary - how to change a wheel on a car. The jack was placed, lifted, removed, placed and that's it, explains the technical support platoon commander. The biggest problem arises only with the availability of the necessary parts. He says that one of the armored personnel carriers damaged in the spring of 2024 could only be sent for repair in December due to the lack of spare parts. - They are very easy and practical to repair. But there is often a problem with spare parts, because you have to wait for the necessary parts from abroad. They are brought from Holland, Spain, America. Therefore, the whole problem is only with spare parts - if they are available, we will repair them quickly, - claims Oleksandr. The standard capacity of M113 - 8 landfill fighters, but if necessary, a armored personnel carrier can take on board and three times more people. Tyson recalls that there were 24 soldiers from the front of the Emca. - But 24 is when it is quite a battle. Although there were cases when even 40 fighters were exported on one car. Then, of course, not only inside, but also from the outside sat on the armor. They became and selected, because it is very difficult for people to go for many kilometers, especially on the marsh - when the big swamp and viscosity of the soil, - says Tyson. The Bagn -Emk- goes great, although there is some dependence on the type of caterpillars installed on a specific machine - with rubber pads or with the presence of special -soil- on both sides of Husley. This is noticed by the -beekeeper-, showing two neighboring M113 on the caterpillar. - This is where Guslya stands with rubber pillows without -soil-, so in the swamp it is worse controlled. And here are the lateral -soil-, which provide better clutch. Therefore, it is better to put such a -mud- caterpillar - the so -called -swamp- on a powerful machine, - he explains. Cuts with purely rubber lining, the military notes, very well show themselves on solid soil and on asphalt, instead, it is better to put such caterpillars with a soil with a soil with a soil or swampy area. In general, M113 armored personnel carriers, like Leopard tanks, proved to be very good. Fighters 33 of the separate mechanized brigade respond mainly to them. They point out that, if possible, good maintenance and spare parts are not new to foreign armored vehicles are quite capable of performing all the combat missions provided for them.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/30/40-bijcziv-na-bronovanomu-taksi-z-kulemetom-bronetransporter-m113-pokazav-na-shho-zdatnyj-reportazh-z-peredovoyi/	2025-01-29T20:35:57-08:00
The Russian Federation invented a new fake about the mobilization of teenagers in Ukraine	the Russian -information troops- decided not to trifle and launched a spiel about a -pilot project- of mobilizing minors, supporting it with fabricated -documents- and panicked headlines in the style of -Zelensky sends children to the front-. It looks as if the Russian propagandists have finally lost themselves in their own lies. Because just yesterday they were talking about -empty military commissars- in Ukraine and -total evasion- of service. And today they are already drawing pictures of how -minors- in uniform are holding back the onslaught of the -second army of the world-. Official Ukrainian laws and realities smash this -throw-in- to the ground: So the only thing relevant to the -pilot project- is the Russians' failed attempts to launch fake -news- without fact-checking. While the Kremlin is inventing fairy tales about Ukraine, Russia itself is passing laws that allow recruiting prisoners into the army, forcing students to serve, and handing out summonses instead of diplomas. Not to mention the fact that 17-year-old boys there not only receive summonses, but if they refuse, they can end up behind bars. So if teenagers are being mobilized anywhere, it is in the Russian Federation, where they are desperately trying to plug the holes in the army for everyone who can still hold a weapon. Russian propaganda is once again trying to present Ukraine in the role of a -military dictatorship-, while it itself sends schoolchildren and prisoners to the front. Well, if you believe their logic, then the next fake will probably be about Ukraine mobilizing babies and arming them with Molotov cocktails. But taking into account the rate of degradation of the Russian IPSO, we will not have to wait long.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/30/v-rf-vygadaly-novyj-fejk-pro-mobilizacziyu-pidlitkiv-v-ukrayini/	2025-01-29T20:09:31-08:00

Hunting for the disloyal: Kremlin repression in the occupied territories	About this informs Center of National Resistance. It is noted that this -filtering- involves thorough checks of personal data, interrogations and searches. Its main goal is to identify persons associated with the Defense Forces of Ukraine and any manifestations of disloyalty to the occupation regime. Detainees are subjected to psychological pressure, arbitrary arrests and even torture. The occupiers use these methods as a tool of repression and try to establish complete control over local residents. Despite harsh measures, the Kremlin is unable to suppress Ukrainian resistance. On the contrary, the intensification of repressions only shows the occupiers' fear of the indomitability of the Ukrainian population on the TOT. As reported by ArmyInform, the occupiers in Kherson Oblast naselennya/->introduced new taxes that increase the pressure on the local population.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/29/polyuvannya-na-neloyalnyh-represiyi-kremlya-na-okupovanyh-terytoriyah/	2025-01-29T11:53:39-08:00
Enemy drones rained down from the sky — UAV hunters covered the Defense Forces in Kurshchyna	Stanislav Krasnov, commander, told about this on the air of the telethon -Edyny Novyny- platoon of the 95th separate amphibious assault brigade. According to him, the Russians are attacking to the -accompaniment- of their artillery, air defense systems, missiles and drones. Each time they fail, and have huge losses, but they come back again and again. However, Krasnov notes, the number of enemy drones has decreased, because UAV hunters have appeared. -I know these guys. Very talented operators indeed. If at the beginning of the operation in the Kursk region, we constantly heard the sound of these wings above us, especially at night, then after such calculations began to work, both our brigade and our allies really became less of them. Artillery strikes are less accurate, anti-aircraft guns are less accurate,- Stanislav Krasnov said. As reported by /a> ArmyInform, Murena showed how he equips his FPV drones to turn Russians into jigsaw puzzles.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/29/vorozhi-drony-posypalysya-z-neba-myslyvczi-na-bpla-prykryly-syly-oborony-na-kurshhyni/	2025-01-29T11:49:03-08:00
A local resident who collaborated with the occupiers was exposed in the Kharkiv region	The Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office informs about this. According to the investigation, during the occupation of the village An unemployed local resident of Strelecha, Kharkiv district, voluntarily worked for the enemy. In April 2022, during a meeting in a gymnasium, a serviceman of the Russian Federation informed those present that the -people's militia- would soon begin work. The suspect expressed a desire to head the occupying law enforcement agency. True, the -people's militia- was never created, but the person involved actively followed the instructions of the Russian curators. The traitor accepted statements about offenses. He also forcibly checked people's documents. This was necessary to identify the pro-Ukrainian population, ATO veterans, law enforcement officers or their relatives. The defendant performed his -work- in accordance with Russian legislation. Before the deoccupation of the village by the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the person involved fled to the territory of the Russian Federation together with the Russian military. The issue of declaring a wanted suspect is being resolved. The pre-trial investigation is conducted by the Head of the SBU Department in the Kharkiv region.

President: Veteran hubs and business programs will grow	About this the head of state declared during the evening address. -I have already instructed to implement some key things with internal funds, as well as to conduct negotiations with European partners. These are programs in the field of energy — in particular, distributed generation and sustainability projects for Ukrainian communities. The second direction is veteran projects. Veteran hubs, support lines, help in creating your own business. The third is the checkpoints at the border, which were built in cooperation with international partners. New modern checkpoints are necessary to accelerate economic activity and increase the transparency of customs operations. This also applies to projects in ports that are directly related to the economic security of the country,- said Volodymyr Zelenskyi. He also emphasized that the government is currently looking for additional internal resources for these programs. In addition, according to the president, there are questions regarding the financing of projects of the Ministry of Health and the field of cyber security. -Instructed to continue the audit of the suspended lines of aid from the US, in particular in the humanitarian, security and social sectors. Our and European activity should be strengthened to support the people while the new American policy continues to be worked out,- the President added. The President reported that the Minister of Energy's report on the state of the country's energy system, its restoration and development was held today. -I am grateful to everyone who works in the energy sector, who does everything possible so that Ukraine can live. Regarding our cooperation with the European Union and neighboring countries: it is important that we maintain a constructive position. We can help partners who need it, and we are grateful to everyone who supports Ukraine. Europeans need this feeling that the common energy market, integrated systems and projects bring real benefits. This is possible only thanks to unity,- the head of state emphasized. Volodymyr Zelenskyi also announced that he had a conversation with the Prime Minister of Denmark Mette Frederiksen today. -They talked about global challenges and European issues. He thanked Denmark for its powerful support to Ukraine. We really appreciate it. We will develop bilateral cooperation that strengthens not only Ukraine, but also the whole of Europe,- he said.

Alumina embargo: assets of a Russian oligarch worth over 2 billion hryvnias were seized in Ukraine	About this informs the Security Service of Ukraine. This raw material was a key component for the production of aluminum at Deripaska's Russian Rusal plants, which work for the Russian military-industrial complex. Factories make components for Iskander missiles, combat drones and radar systems. The investigation established that the seized products belonged to Deripaska through a controlled company registered in the EU. This company acted as a formal customer of raw materials for further re-export to Russia. At the beginning of 2023, Ukrainian law enforcement officers blocked an attempt to export bauxite and alumina. In addition, in Ukraine, all the oligarch's plants that worked on the territory of the state have already been nationalized. The SBU informed Deripaska in absentia about the suspicion, in particular, of financing the war against Ukraine.

Ruins under new paint: the Russians imitate the reconstruction of Mariupol	About informs Center of National Resistance. However, the renovated housing turned out to be unfit for living. Due to a lack of funding, most renovation works are frozen, and in those apartments that are -officially handed over-, residents are forced to redo everything themselves. According to locals, the walls are made of low-quality material and resemble -paper partitions- that do not meet basic safety standards. The occupiers are trying to pass off these repair works as -help- to the people of Mariupol, although it was their shelling that destroyed the city and people's homes. The same situation is observed in other populated areas under occupation, where instead of real restoration, the Russians create only the illusion of care. As reported by ArmyInform, from March 1 in the temporarily occupied territory of the Luhansk region, the norms of Russian legislation come into force, which significantly simplify the procedure expropriation of land plots from individuals.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/29/ruyiny-pid-novoyu-farboyu-rosiyany-imituyut-vidbudovu-mariupolya/	2025-01-29T10:53:26-08:00

At one time, the outstanding commander and philosopher Sun Tzu in his treatise -The Art of War- wrote: -A general who knows military operations avoids an opponent with high morale and strikes when the opposing army is demoralized. This is a way to control the spirit,'' the military said. The brigade did not specify what exactly it is about, but the denial was made public against the background of the publication on pro-Russian propaganda resources of a video in which allegedly -fighters of the 155th OMBr of the Armed Forces- are being taken to the front in handcuffs. However, there is no confirmation that there are actually Ukrainian military personnel in the published footage. In addition, both in the video itself and in the credits to it, only the Russian language appears. What's more, even its author admitted that, in fact, soldiers of the 155th Separate Guards Marine Brigade of the Pacific Fleet of the Russian Federation were taken to the front in handcuffs. -The enemy is trying to sow panic and discord in the ranks of the Defense Forces of Ukraine with such simple, but extremely provocative and manipulative plots. But our spirit is steely and strong, like our guns and tanks, with which we destroy the occupier every day and every night. And so it will always be - to our common Victory!

Maritime coalition: the IOU told how 18 states are helping Ukraine to strengthen its fleet	About the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine informs. The issue of control over the Black and Azov seas is strategic for the security and economy of Ukraine, because the importance of maritime trade routes for a country that exports raw materials cannot be overestimated. Hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians work in industries such as metallurgy and agriculture that depend on these routes. Millions of people around the world are consumers of Ukrainian grain and food products. Control over rivers, which serve not only as convenient logistical routes, but also as natural borders between states, is also important. That is why in December 2023 Great Britain, Norway and Ukraine initiated the creation of the Coalition of Maritime Capabilities. Its main tasks are to ensure the urgent needs and long-term development of the relevant capabilities of Ukraine, to ensure the freedom and safety of civil navigation, to deter and repel any aggression from the maritime direction. In addition to Ukraine, 18 other states have joined the -sea- coalition - in addition to the leaders, there are also Belgium, Bulgaria, Greece, Denmark, Estonia, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, Germany, the USA, France, Sweden, Portugal, Poland, Romania and Turkey. Finland, Iceland and Canada are contributing to the development of Ukraine's maritime capabilities, but they are not yet part of the Coalition. Australia and Japan are considering becoming members. Activities of the Maritime Capability Coalition are among the least public. At the same time, it is known that the member states of the Coalition provide Ukraine with, in particular: technical staff and technical support for operation and application. Among the things that can be confirmed publicly, the Netherlands and Belgium are handing over three Alkmaar-class mine countermeasures ships to Ukraine this year. Great Britain, in addition to other capabilities, has already transferred two mine countermeasures ships -Chernigiv- and -Cherkasy- in early 2023, which are currently based in British ports. The crews of these ships are currently undergoing intensive training to perform assigned tasks according to NATO standards. The specified set of anti-mine forces is the basis of the anti-mine tactical group, which will directly eliminate the mine threat in Ukrainian waters. The USA, the Netherlands, Canada, Sweden and Finland have transferred a certain number of boats of different classes and fields of application: for search and rescue operations, transportation, reconnaissance and special operations. In Romania, the Coalition created a naval training center for the training of marines of the Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. On January 9, 2025, the heads of the defense departments of 14 leading states and Ukraine agreed on the road maps of all coalitions. This happened during the meeting of the Group of Leaders of Capability Coalitions within the Contact Group on Defense of Ukraine (-Ramstein- format). As reported by ArmyInform, demining and anti-mine work in the Black Sea continues continuously. The security work of the Armed Forces Navy is at a consistently high level.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/29/morska-koalicziya-u-mou-rozpovily-yak-18-derzhav-dopomagayut-ukrayini-zmicznyty-flot/	2025-01-29T03:39:54-08:00

A warrior with a thousand faces: Khotabych's path from a peaceful life to the front	The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. Roman understood from his youth that war with Russia was inevitable. -While still in military service, the officers said: our enemy is not the West, but Russia,- he recalls. Therefore, when the aggression began in 2014, he immediately joined volunteer activities, and later - military service. In 2015, he joined the National Guard of Ukraine and became one of those who formed the -Spartan- rapid response brigade. But in 2021, something told him that it was time to return to the service. So he signed a contract with the 128th Mountain Assault Brigade, with which he repelled a full-scale enemy invasion. -For many, the war began in 2022, for me it was long before 2014,- he says. -Khotabych- went through fierce battles for Mariupol, Novotoshkivka, Kupyansk, Kreminna. The latter was especially etched in his memory: -We conducted combat reconnaissance for weeks, held the defense and stormed in terrible conditions. The most difficult thing was to pull out the dead comrades when the 23-year-old commander was dying before your eyes. When he was wounded, he was taken to a hospital in Dnipro. There he was impressed by an 18-year-old volunteer who, having lost his family in Mariupol, did not take up arms due to religious beliefs, but helped wounded fighters. -I saw real strength of spirit in him,- says Khotabych. After the hospital, he returned to the army because he could not leave the unit without technical support. Currently, he heads a workshop that repairs small arms, equipment and supplies the military with necessary materials. -Who but us?- he says. Thanks to his efforts, the military has an equipped repair base, which greatly increases the combat capability of the unit. -Khotabych- is an example of how a person from a peaceful life can become an indispensable warrior, not only holding a weapon, but also helping the front with his knowledge and skills. As reported by ArmyInform, 28-year-old Oleksandr with the call sign -German- is drona-bomber operator 128 separate mountain-assault Transcarpathian Brigade.

About the raids in the Belgorod Region, the liberation of the Aggregate Plant and the ideology of -M...	- Tell me, please, how the new chapter of your life in Ukraine began? -When I arrived in 2014, I immediately met the future management of Azov during the Euromaidan. In fact, then, right after him, I came to meet with them on behalf of the Russian nationalist underground. We held a meeting there with them, the guys represented -Right Sector-East-, and the meeting itself was at the KMDA. I remember those steps that were splattered with blood, because that was the headquarters of the Revolution. I was immediately surprised by the protesting-looking people, who were clearly armed with pistols on their belts. When I already moved to Ukraine, I immediately got into Azov. From that moment on, I was already active in the Azov Civilian Corps. This is such an organization, which later turned into the National Corps, so to speak, the civilian wing of the Azov Dvizh. I attended the first ideological training school, just as the corn service was created in the summer of 2014, and I joined the regiment on September 1. - Please tell me specifically about your military experience. -My real and serious military experience began in the Russian Volunteer Corps (Red . hereinafter RDC), because everything that happened before that proceeded somewhat differently. Since 2015, I have been in the -Azov- regiment as part of a sabotage and reconnaissance group. We organized ambushes and attacks on enemy strongholds during 2015-2016. At that time, combat clashes were of the order of three times. The rest of the time we were engaged in patrolling, mining, training. Then I ended up in the corporal service of the -Azov- regiment - this is such an educational ideological service that was built into the army system. In 2018, I resigned from -Azov- and started working in Azov youth organizations. These were national wives, which later turned into -Centuria- - an organization that works with youth. A 3rd separate assault brigade also appeared directly from there. I was there and participated in the operation to unblock Mariupol. Later, I took part in some more operations, but the way my service in the RDK took place is completely different. I became a mortar team commander there. It's one thing to fight as an infantryman, not understanding the overall plan, not taking part in certain planning actions. Already directly in the composition of the RDK, I commanded the calculation, and then the unit, understanding the scale, organizing and planning the combat work, because I had a clear picture in front of me of what was happening in the serious directions, where the enemy's losses from our fire amounted to tens and hundreds of 200 them Therefore, I believe that my military career began directly in the RDK. I joined them at the beginning of 2023. — From the moment you were released from the Azov regiment to the start of a large-scale operation, how has your life turned out? in the -National Wives- organization organized by him. Our tasks were to show Ukrainian nationalism with a human face in order to strive for elections and all those things -that are not available in Russia.- I was a lecturer there. A large number of guys who actually went to war from 2022 and became our friends passed through this organization. There we constantly organized trainings and various events, traveled to all the cities of Ukraine, held entertainment events related to shooting, knife fighting, and sports. In that format, I represented the pan-European component of the composition. That is, we had lecturers who spoke specifically about Ukrainian nationalism, and I was more detached from politics, leaning more towards European history. I came up with the -Scythian Power- seminar series, which talked about the Scythian past of Ukrainians and Scythians in general as a civilization that was unfairly forgotten, although it boldly takes its place among the greatest civilizations of the Ancient World. In general, we constantly came up with activities that nurtured the youth with the right values, which later became Centuria. And there I continued this work. As the year 2022 approached, we were already concentrating on the coming large-scale war, because everyone understood that it would happen after all. They conducted trainings and ideologically charged people, why it is necessary to fight and told about moments related to combat work. - Did you come to Ukraine for the first time in 2014? - No, I was in Ukraine for the first time at the end of 2011. Then they came with a concert to Kharkiv. In general, in the past, Kharkiv was the cultural center of Ukraine in our circle. First of all, this is the Kharkiv right-wing scene — a phenomenon known to the whole world, which was important not only for Ukraine, but also for European listeners. It is a beautiful city that was really nice to visit. In general, the bands from Kharkiv had quite a strong influence on me, including thanks to them I got to know the Ukrainian language back in 2004, because I listened to their music. - How did the large-scale invasion begin for you? -I woke up at 10 o'clock when the war was raging everywhere. Got together and immediately went to our base. It was difficult to get there, because there was a column of people fleeing from Kyiv at the exit. I parked the car, brought people who were also walking and were already ready. Then we moved to another building because we thought there might be shelling. Then they began to organize, and the formation of that unit, which later received the name -Azov-Kyiv-, actually began there. —Did you take a direct part in the battles for the Kyiv region? —I became the deputy commander in our unit and I did not take a direct part in the battles. We went to temporary bases and there I was engaged in organizational work. With a submachine gun in my hands, I went to the blockade of Mariupol. Unfortunately, our idea was not implemented, because already on the spot it was not possible to simply break through the first line. — There were moments in Kyiv when everyone was scared. Did you think that this could be your last day and you would die? —I was sure that I would die in Kyiv. Right at 90%. This is my favorite city and it would not be scary to die for it. There were thoughts that we would get out of it in an organized manner if it was surrounded and bombed. There was no direct fear, because my whole life consisted of a struggle, and I cannot devalue my life by giving up the struggle. Yes, no one was holding me, I could cross the border calmly and freely, but I could not do so. I don't see my life outside the Ukrainian dvizh. Yes, if the war goes to Russia, then of course I will continue to fight there. And in general, all my musical and ideological activities, they have always been in Ukraine. I motivated others to war, and then how could I refuse it myself? Did you ever think that we would all die here? Yes, but it is not scary to die for Kyiv, but the essence is primarily in the people. I think it's better to think in terms of people rather than territories. If I thought so, I would not have left Russia, where life is not like that at all. The people of Russia live like poor people: in hardship, bad conditions, injustice, but at the same time they listen to songs about the -great land-. Although that land is not theirs either, that's why people are important. I was with those who are valuable to me and with those ideas that I carried and realized in creativity. - How did the blockade of Mariupol take place? -It was planned for the moment when we had not yet become the 3rd separate assault brigade, but were still the Azov-Kyiv unit. It was early April 2022. We reached Zaporizhzhia, then further along the populated areas and advanced to the positions. I was with the commander of the Centuria. Together we were there on the second line, so we did not see the enemy. The first line was not able to break through and everyone already knows how the course of hostilities went. There was such a story that a tank was driving, in which was the Hero of Ukraine. He was hit, and he climbed out of it, climbed into another tank and went into battle again. this is a truly incredible story that touches the heart. We stayed there for a day, and then had to return to Kyiv, after which we already left for the Zaporizhia direction. At that time, I was working in the media service there. Closer to autumn, the RDK was formed and it became clear to me that I should move there, because all service opportunities will be in the ranks of this unit. Now I have a team with which we can do large tasks, especially when I am assigned calculations from other departments. - Why did you decide to join the RDK in particular? -First of all, the commander of the RDK-is my old friend who was able to do such a great thing and break through all the bureaucratic hurdles. To tell the truth, at first it seemed that this could not even happen. I thought so, because why was this not done back in 2014, after the Maidan. Then many Russian boys came and took part in it. Even then, we wanted to make a Russian corps in order to influence the politics of Russia. In general, the emergence of our organization is connected with specific tasks, which are primarily of a political nature. I know that this war is about the idea of ​​freedom and slavery, that is, people of different nationalities can take one or another position. And fighting for freedom means working with people who choose the position of good. Nothing in our world is static, people can change their views and opinions, it depends on what information field they live in. It is clear to me why they did not work with Russian nationalists before, because this story has always been stigmatized in the world. Nationalists have always been portrayed as stupid and evil people, but the situation has not changed at all. In fact -it is among the nationalists that the largest number of ideologically minded people, if we talk about volunteers. After talking with them, you immediately understand that these are people who are ready to give their lives for freedom. Nevertheless, in the mainstream world media, nationalists try to be portrayed as the guardians of slavery, but this is a mistake, because we stand for freedom, unlike those people who try to suppress this will. - Why did you join the mortar group? -When I came to RDK, a mortar group was being formed there. With my friend from -Azov-Kyiv- we discussed where to move next and it turned out that the transfer process to RDK went faster for him. I was held back by some circumstances that I was doing in the media service and then in recruiting. When I already officially transferred, I thought that it would be cool and logical to apply the knowledge that I once received at the military department, and at the same time, in an ironic way, thank the university and the department where I received the knowledge and the rank of artillery lieutenant. In general, the meaning of my life isfollowing the ideals of justice. By serving Ukraine, I feel that I am restoring at least a little of this justice. I thought it would be really cool to be the leader of a mortar group, because in reality, a mortar and a barrel art are not very different, and from a command point of view, the difference is very little. I came to a meeting of commanders in different directions and proposed my candidacy. - How did the battles take place in the Avdiiv direction? -That operation was the most vivid for me personally. That was exactly one year ago. Our group was standing there, firing from the same position. Then we killed more than 100 Russian soldiers, and there were also many wounded. A video where the entire landing was littered with enemy corpses made its way onto the Internet. This is exactly the landing on which we worked with calculations. In general, we controlled two landings and worked specifically on them. Then I understood that the stories about meat assaults are not fairy tales, because I saw them with my own eyes. Once (at that time I personally commanded a mortar unit at the position), we destroyed more than 30 enemy personnel in half an hour. Yes, there were still adjacent units helping us, but for the most part we repelled that assault. That is, a group of invaders just came, we eliminated them, but we were surprised by the fact that no one came after them. Maybe someone was running away. But the rest are wounded and killed. It was winter, we saw everything in the stream and literally in a few hours the wounded were also considered dead. —How did the enemy carry out their assaults in the Avdiiv direction and what tactics did they use? —At first they went in larger groups of 20-35 people. Then they began to walk by 10-15, and later generally by one or two. We understood that the enemy had deliberately reduced the number of infantry in this way, because it is impractical to shoot at one person with all types of weapons available to us. By the way, where we controlled the landings, the enemy did not break through until the decision was made to withdraw from Avdiivka. We also worked with neighboring units that gave us a picture of where to shoot. Not far from us was the 47th -Magura- brigade. We were constantly on the radio and once a fighter died there, so it was discussed there for half a day. That is, when someone from the Ukrainian side dies or is injured, it is a great grief that everyone experiences and starts to act to take the person away. And on the Russian side, it's just like a flowing river, where everyone doesn't care. This is commonplace for the Russian military. It was in that direction that the Avdiiv operation lasted for about two months, and then we went to provide the -Road of Life-. We also worked a lot there. I was appointed the battery commander not only of our comrades, but we also had defenders from other units. When we first got there, we had one dangerous place. I went there with a friend and we conducted reconnaissance there, set up positions. Then, in a few days, we equipped positions and set up mortars. After that, we went to the control post, where we had several sleepless days and managed the operation. In reality, everything was very shaky there, because there was only one road left, which the enemy had not blocked, and the boys were going out along it. If this operation had failed, then there would have been a tragedy and there could have been many prisoners from the Ukrainian side. - Tell us about your raids on the territory of Russia. -In fact, they were successful operations. We had a second event in the Grayvoron area. There we entered the village of Kozinka. It was our mortars that did not enter Russian territory, because they shoot forward for 5 km, but they stood at the very border. Then we were most surprised by the number of KABs, because the invaders themselves demolished half of the Russian village with them. I was personally pleased that these ruins are on the territory of Russia, because when we constantly sit in similar places, it happens on the territory of Ukraine and is quite painfully perceived by us. And such a moment became quite symbolic, because it is important that the war was on the territory of the enemy. With their KABs, they turned this village, which was considered quite elite and with expensive houses, into -moonscapes-, thereby warming our souls. There we also destroyed about 40 occupiers with our mines. — Then the RDK took part in the battles for Vovchansk and Aggregatny Zavod. What can you tell us about it? —Then we expected that there might be an attack and the encirclement of Kharkov, then it was all taken very seriously. But, when the whole Russian brigade -ran- towards Vovchansk, reaching the middle of the city, their last point was the Aggregate Plant, where they jumped. Before the battles in the city, we went to Vovchansk, when we conducted reconnaissance. In general, the city was quite lively. Literally in a week there was hell&#8230; Now it is empty, all the houses that were intact are now simply demolished to zero, there are not even the ruins of the first floor. This moment made the release of the Aggregate Plant quite difficult. In September, RDK and other units, with the help of a smoke screen (which we created with projectiles from mines), broke into the territory of the plant and advanced for several weeks. Later, the invaders who were there were captured. In total, there were about 30 soldiers of the Russian army there, and ours captured 15 occupiers. It was just an ordinary motorized rifle unit. Among them was one Russian GRUshnik. The capture of the plant was a highlight, as it was the first time a plant had been liberated. They usually have negative stories associated with them. The most interesting thing is that the enemy for quite a long time disbelieved, saying that they did not lose the Aggregate Plant. And just recently, propagandists wrote in one rather large Russian public that they left the factory, although 3.5 months have already passed. - Why is your call sign -Hammer-? -That's the name of my group and that's how the call sign came about. Moloch is actually a combination of the two words Molot and Moloch. In black metal, this is quite important in pronunciation itself, such an ending reminds of some barbaric and brutal names from the Lord of the Rings universe. - How often do people from Russia try to contact you to join the RDK? - Such situations happen all the time. I even remind that if people contact RDK, then they should write in the chatbot to those whom they respect. You can always write in private messages to Denis—the commander of the RDK. You can write to me or others who run social networks, but do not write comments, because fsb hunts such people. They work there: create lists of those who leave comments under similar posts and pages (although we, of course, are closed) and these commentators pass raids. I know the person to whom they were heated purely for leaving a comment. Dozens of people are included in the lists of FSBShniki and they go to them every month, checking correspondence and that they are happening at home in general, because they say immediately that they are the enemies of the country. Also, to get to us, people can contact the recruiting chatbot of RDC. - What events or people formed your view of creativity? culture Later, in my teens, I began to admire music and this is probably the main and key event in my life. After all, I write music, poems, I do the production of concerts, clips, albums, and all this is closely linked to the fine arts. In fact, it is a combination of all kinds of art in one such cultural phenomenon. I was influenced by heavy music, the most radical form of metal - Black metal. At first, I just liked, and then I realized that such music has certain magical properties and on the one hand is part of rock music, but at the same time similar to ritual shamanic music. The rhythms of extreme and heavy music are so accelerated or slow down that the idea of ​​rhythm is lost. Then the music becomes deeper and in this genre the quality of music is in the place of atmosphere. That is, tools can not be written specifically, but this will have a special sound. It is difficult to explain music in general. The idea of ​​creating music - is the idea of ​​creating magic among the world where nothing holy is left, so everything is so good. - How are your ideas born in creativity? Is it a long process or more spontaneous solution? - I think both. Creativity - develops well when a person has free time. When I was put in prison in Russia, I developed my work very much there and wrote many poems. When a person is busy, he has less time for creativity. However, there are also nuances here. Being at the exit (it was in the beginning of 2023), we sat in a landing in the Zaporozhye region, where I invented the topic for the track -MLA over Bakhmut-. Just then there were cruel battles and I thought it would be a cool comparison of events there with the atmosphere of Howard Lavraft's books. But there, just instead of ominous characters from the books of Lavraft, we had special forces from the Wagner PEC and Storm-St. The idea of ​​war generally awakens the other horrors that are people. I write music when the instrument gets into my hands. That is, I play the guitar, if I do not forget to write it on the video, then super. The lyrics are born less often because the volume of information that goes through me through the - is difficult to concentrate somewhere, but my time, because I have a lot of luggage of unfulfilled creativity. While the old is implemented, there will be a lot of space for the new one. The last album -Hammer-, for example, was recorded for 10 years, because in parallel with it were Singles and other projects. We are now working on Occult, which we started from 2017 until now. The war gives the basis for creativity, but at the same time gives the right to talk about high things. Singing about the war and not being a military, it is not a clear concept for me. It was important for me from childhood that creativity corresponded to the individual. - When the idea of ​​creating a band first came about? Then it was a punk rock. But we already wanted to have a band. It seemed to me in a clear way to express myself in the world. In general, it is easier to write songs than, for example, a book, but on the other hand, the song can crystallize their worldviews and the fact that people will sing them - will affect their spiritual development. At the age of 16, I studied and could not teach someone something, but when in 2004 we recorded our first solo album, it turned out that it was serious in content and even now is not ashamed to listen and perform it. I was interested in philosophy, history, art since childhood. The meanings I read and admired, I digested them through myself and poured into my work. Thanks to the musical taste and therefore the cultural background and the genre, we have such success in our circles. —What do you have projects except the band? It concentrates a bunch of different genres, which is why the public loves them. At the same time, I have a whispering run. It was created to create a semi -ethnic, folk, acoustic side of my creativity, but later became a year and a distinctive feature of this project is that the vocalist - is my wife and I sing a little. Although other vocalists also perform songs there. We wanted to first separate the whisper of the runes, but the project came out in another genre, the type of ethno-year. Just different albums always sound different. For our listeners, this has become a separate kind of art that harmoniously complement each other. I also have a project that, on the contrary, goes towards a radical blackout. The hammer has become more versatile. There is an Okultt project, which in heavy and dark metal. I have said that we have been writing an album since 2017, because there is one demo version and sings, but the album never came out, because we were constantly working on other projects. I also devoted a lot of time to working on my friend's project with the call sign -Nezhegol-. The last album we recorded him with musicians who work with the hammer band, and he sang, so everything happened so well. With it we are another project, one song was even recorded. Now and so many events, so I think that in February there will be another material in the style of punk rock. Those who love our creativity will appreciate. - your concerts have always been special energy. How did it take the stage for the first time after three years of widespread? - was the same as -to- - cool. There were many young people in the hall. We have created asgardsrei Festival to be lavier, which took place in Kiev every year. People from Europe even came there. At the end of 2024, this concert was better, because the youth was more charged, they sang the choir, because they understand the text, there is an exchange of energy. For our absence on stage, a new generation of listeners has grown over these three years, because working with young people allows you to look into the future. It is they who leave these particles in themselves, and it is actually an impact on the future. In general, our recent Yule Night concert - was a powerful and cool phenomenon. In fact, for 3 years of widespread, the Russians gave a concert in the center of Kiev, but everyone understands the nuance &#8230; It is like that during the Second World War, the Poles would come to a concert to the Germans. And here the question is that nationalism has changed. It is about freedom, not nationality, although propaganda dictates exactly. That is, the idea of ​​value dominates the idea of ​​origin. If you reach the ultimate sense, the ideas of spirit dominate the idea of ​​the flesh. We were born in Russia, but chose the side of good - of Ukraine. There are Ukrainians who were born here but went to the so -called -LNR- or -DNR-. That is, the old ideas of nationalism said that where you were born, you should be. Now it's not at all. The more the spirit wins, the more we are to achieve the right goals.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/29/pro-rejdy-na-byelgorodshhyni-zvilnennya-agregatnogo-zavodu-ta-ideologiyu-moloth-istoriya-komandyra-minometky-rdk-oleksiya-lovkina/	2025-01-29T01:30:09-08:00
We can use shells, we can use drones - our gunners destroyed several enemy guns	The video of the blows was published on January 29 on the brigade's channel. Our gunners used both traditional methods of destroying the enemy's artillery - with shells (the enemy's ammunition also exploded) and new methods, when the enemy's guns were hit by drones. Traditionally, our pilots damaged the muzzles of Russian guns, where it is most difficult to replace them. -To destroy the enemy's guns, we use both artillery fire and drone strikes. We can do everything,- the team commented on the video. As reported by ArmyInform, soldiers of 45 separate artillery brigade named after General Myron Tarnavsky destroyed enemy cannon in the eastern direction.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/29/mozhemo-snaryadamy-mozhemo-dronamy-nashi-artylerysty-znyshhyly-kilka-vorozhyh-garmat/	2025-01-29T01:17:06-08:00
The Ministry of Defense is introducing a new model of food supply for the Armed Forces	About informs Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. The new contract has significant differences from the current supply model. From now on, the contracting functions of manufacturers go directly to the DOT, and the logistics operator remains only responsible for: completeness, timeliness and quality of transportation to the military units of food; warehouse operations at own facilities; coordination of processes of shipment of goods; documentation support and payment closing. This will make procurement processes more transparent and more manageable. The key goal of the project is to optimize the interaction between all participants of the supply chain, increase the efficiency of logistics and strengthen the quality control of products before their delivery to military units. -This is an important step to modernize the food system. The new format will make processes transparent, efficient and convenient for all parties. The separation of logistics and procurement functions will ensure the highest quality of products that will go to our military,- Hleb Kanevskyi, director of the Department of Procurement Policy of the Ministry of Defense, emphasized. The pilot project involves continuous monitoring of results for further improvement and scaling up to other regions. -We are already seeing significant interest from well-known Ukrainian brands. Thanks to the open selection of manufacturers, products familiar to them from civilian life will appear in the diet of the military,- added Halyna Litosh, director of the food program of the DOT. As reported by ArmyInform, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine working on the development of lightweight women's body armor and conducting military (research) tests of windproof winter jackets and trousers for female servicemen.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/29/minoborony-zaprovadzhuye-novu-model-postachannya-harchuvannya-dlya-zsu/	2025-01-29T01:07:13-08:00

-Vampire- saving lives: how military transfusiologist Rostislav Zauralskyi saves the wounded on the ...	The story of the military transfusiologist was published on the page of the Medical Forces Command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Rostislav Zauralsky has been working with donor blood since 1997. His first experience was in the maternity hospital, where he was in charge of the blood service. Thanks to his innovative approach, the institution became one of the leading ones in the country, and the Department of Transfusion and Enzyme Therapy was unique in Ukraine. In 2014, when the war began, Rostislav could not stay away. He saw that the wounded were brought to the hospital grounds already dead. The cause is massive blood loss. Then he realized that it was necessary to transport not only soldiers to the hospital, but also blood to them. This is how the -Blood Saves Life- project was born. To ensure the prompt supply of blood to the area of ​​hostilities, Rostislav began to develop mobile transfusion stations - -blood trucks-. Today, this is already the sixth modification of the unique transport, which is equipped with everything necessary for collecting, checking, storing and transporting donor blood. The equipment of a full-fledged blood bank is located inside an ordinary-looking minibus: transfusion systems, test tubes, devices for thawing plasma and heating blood. Most importantly, this process can be done simply while driving to get the vital resource to its destination as quickly as possible. During the war, Rostislav Zauralskyi and his team saved thousands of lives. If during the ATO and OOS he transported half a ton of blood per year, now this volume is transported every month. The record is 176 blood transfusions per day, which is a phenomenal indicator. The use of fresh-frozen plasma at the pre-hospital level made it possible to improve the survival rate of seriously injured patients by 30%. Today, -Vampir- continues to improve the blood service system in the Armed Forces, extending it to all military units. Its goal is to provide each branch of the army with modern facilities for the collection, storage and transportation of blood, so that no soldier dies due to its lack. Every day, hundreds of Ukrainians in peaceful cities donate blood so that it reaches Rostislav and his team in time. It is thanks to such people that military doctors get a chance to save the lives of our defenders. Rostislav Zauralsky is not just a doctor. This is a person who found a way to restore the lives of those who risk their own for the sake of Ukraine. And while the battles continue at the front, -Vampire- continues its struggle - with blood loss, with time, with death. As ArmiyaInform reported, Ihor from Chutivsky district of Poltava region is one of those who bear the burden of war every day. He is a grenade launcher of the 16th separate motorized infantry battalion of the 58th brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. His job is defend positions and repel enemy attacks.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/29/vampir-shho-ryatuye-zhyttya-yak-vijskovyj-transfuziolog-rostyslav-zauralskyj-ryatuye-poranenyh-na-peredovij/	2025-01-29T00:32:49-08:00
The Ministry of Defense has started its own production of FPV drones	This became known on January 29. . Within the framework of the pilot project that started in December last year under the general coordination of the Main Directorate of Defense Innovations of the Ministry of Defense, the state got the opportunity to produce codified FPV drones. As part of a tripartite agreement, a private developer granted a license for the production of UAVs on the basis of one of the state-owned enterprises belonging to the sphere of administration of the Ministry of Defense. It is foreseen that the produced products will be sent to units of the Defense Forces of Ukraine. After working out the production technology and its scaling, the SOE will be able to independently participate in the tenders of the Defense Procurement Agency and other potential customers. -The experience is positive. Thanks to the integration of the state into production chains, we got a clear understanding of the cost of drone production and our competitive advantages in this market. This will make it possible to improve the quality of finished products at the expense of constant competition,- commented First Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Lieutenant General Ivan Gavryliuk. Specialists of the Main Department of Defense Innovations of the Ministry of Defense worked out the road a map of the organization of similar productions together with other developers of unmanned aerial systems (UAS). Thanks to this, it is possible to significantly increase the production capacity for scaling the production of Victory means. -Ready to expand cooperation with private companies. We have a package of template documents and step-by-step instructions for launching similar lines for the production of BPAK at other state-owned enterprises,- said the head of the Main Department of Defense Innovations, Yuriy Taraniuk.

Enemy propagandists took over a village in the Luhansk region — the 10th Army Corps refutes the fake	announced this on January 29 10 Army Corps of the ZSU. According to his information, as early as January 26, a video was published on the enemy Telegram channel -Russian Kharkivskaia oblast-, which is actively distributed by pro-Russian channels of social networks, with the raising of the Russian flag on one of the buildings of the village of Novoyehorivka, Luhansk region, which proves the fact that this settlement was allegedly taken under control Russian occupation troops. -It has been established that this building is located in the settlement of Kovalivka. Based on the plot, the enemy is trying to spread a narrative about the rapid advance of his troops in this direction, to demoralize the personnel of the Defense Forces and the civilian population. And also to receive information about the placement of SOU units in this direction, to inflict fire damage,- said the message of the 10th Army Corps. During the reconnaissance, it was established that the informational operation to plant the flag was prepared in advance (on January 23), the object was chosen so that it was impossible to identify the location (population), as evidenced by data from radio interception. -After the spread of this plot, which was intended to hide the enemy's heavy losses during the assault without achieving success as such, probably the command of the -West- will raise a number of questions about misleading the top military and political leadership, commanders on the ground. Attention public and media! The settlement of Novoyehorivka is under the control of the Armed Forces,- the 10th Army Corps assured. As reported by ArmyInform, the Russian propaganda machine was once again -reborn- with another fake. This time, the Kremlin dreamers report that the Armed Forces of Ukraine are supposed to -leave Kurshchyna- by Easter, and ensure peace by May 9.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/29/vorozhi-propagandysty-uzyaly-selo-na-luganshhyni-10-armijskyj-korpus-sprostovuye-fejk/	2025-01-29T00:17:19-08:00

Having met resistance, our fighter retreated a little, took out grenades from his shoulder bag, twisted the fuse and then threw it into the hole in which the enemy was hiding. It was liquidated. -This video is not a movie or a game. This is the reality in which Ukrainian infantrymen fight every day for every meter of our land.

The spokesperson of the Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine told about this in the air -Suspilne.Novyny- Dmytro Pletenchuk. According to him, Russian explosives are periodically thrown onto the coast, which is constantly responded to by anti-mine units. Mine -clogging- is also prevented in the area of ​​the grain corridor. -You see that there are no incidents with mine threats. Precisely because this is a work that is carried out by Ukrainian military sailors all the time,- said Dmytro Pletenchuk. As for the global mine threat in the waters of the Black and Azov Seas, this, according to the spokesman of the Armed Forces Navy, is a deferred problem. It can be solved only by carrying out a full-scale operation. -But that will only be possible after this war is over. After reaching the appropriate level of security that will allow this operation. We are preparing for it. This is work for years, unfortunately,- said the spokesman of the Navy. ArmyInform told earlier that the terrorist country will continue the -ecological war- in the Black Sea, because it will not stop transporting oil on emergency vessels. The task for the Russians is simple - despite everything, sell resources, because money is needed for the war.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/29/peretvoryly-na-vybuhove-zvalyshhe-u-vms-zsu-rozpovily-pro-minnu-nebezpeku-vid-rosiyan-v-chornomu-mori/	2025-01-28T23:29:33-08:00
-This is war, everything is different here-: the story of a drone-bomber operator with the call sign...	The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. Despite his chronic illness, Oleksandr repeatedly came to the TCC to mobilize, but was refused. However, a year ago, during a trip to Transcarpathia, he was served with a summons, and he became a soldier of the 128th OGSHBr. Due to health problems, the -German- had legal grounds to serve in the rear, but he asked for a combat unit. -I immediately said that if I'm going to serve, I don't want to wipe my pants in the rear,- says Oleksandr. - He asked where the brigade was now, and when he heard that it was in Zaporozhye, he asked me to be sent there, closer to home. They offered me a position in the drone division, and I agreed.- After undergoing thorough training, the -German- began to perform combat tasks. He is a universal soldier - he can be a navigator, a pilot, prepare a combat unit for a drone. -Ordinary infantry grenades for drones are not always effective, it is necessary to make specific explosive devices, and I periodically deal with this. But we also use classic ammunition,- Oleksandr says. According to him, the brigade has many productive sorties. In Robotyn, the -German- with his -Baba Yaga- drone chased the Russians, stopped the assaults, and destroyed armored vehicles. Once, having received information about two Russian MTLBs with infantry, which were moving towards Ukrainian positions, he changed course right in flight and successfully worked on them. -Relatives sometimes ask if I have come to terms with serving in the war. But I'm fine, it's not term service, everything is different here. I can't say that I am the master of my life, because at any moment a command may arrive for combat departure - this is war, - says the -German-. -It's dangerous here, of course, but it's much easier from a moral and psychological point of view.- Oleksandr's wife and daughter left for Germany after the start of the full-scale war. For the first time, the fighter was able to see his relatives only two and a half years later, when he received leave. -My wife and daughter came to Dnipropetrovsk region, and after my vacation they returned to Germany again. My daughter is not even 5 years old, we haven't seen her for two and a half years (only occasionally communicated via video link). But on vacation we had such a feeling as if we had not parted at all, and the thought did not even cross my mind that there was a stranger near me or that I did not know something about her. The wife and daughter settled down well abroad, but after the war they will return home, we talked about it many times. I also don't see myself anywhere except Ukraine, I don't even consider other options. - shares Oleksandr. As reported by ArmyInform, 25-year-old Oleksiy, a fighter of the 92nd brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, -svij-dosvid-na-vijni/->who controls the reconnaissance drone Shark, passed the infantry and does not know firsthand what war is. He was awarded the -Defender of the Fatherland- and -Cross of Ground Forces- medals, and was twice awarded the -Golden Cross- by the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. With the modesty and sincerity of this guy, it is hard to imagine that he has met death on the battlefield more than once.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/29/cze-vijna-tut-use-po-inshomu-istoriya-operatora-drona-bombera-z-pozyvnym-nimecz/	2025-01-28T23:24:13-08:00

-The main thing is to keep your head on your shoulders-: the story of a grenade launcher from Poltav...	The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. Every day, the Russian occupiers try to destroy it by all possible means: aerial bombs, artillery, mortars and drones. However, he remains steadfast and even finds the strength to joke. -It was much more difficult in Donbas, there were constant assaults, even phosphorous ammunition was used. It's also dangerous here, but the main thing is to be attentive and careful,- says Igor. Once, he and a comrade miraculously escaped fire when 82-mm mines filled their small dugout. -We were sitting in a 2×2 meter shelter, we realized that we would not survive there for a long time. They decided to run out - and in time, because the 120-mm mortars started working immediately,- the fighter recalls. Despite the danger, Igor confidently performs his work. The guy also talks about his experience using the RPG-7, which he considers reliable and effective: -You can make several shots if you don't hit right away. When you see the enemy running away after being shot, it's encouraging.- Thanks to his perseverance and professionalism, Ihor destroyed an enemy sabotage group, for which he received a state award - the Order -For Courage- III degree. His story is an example of the dedication and true fighting spirit of Ukrainian soldiers. -Work is work, however hard it is. The main thing is to keep your head on your shoulders,- concludes Igor.

VAB armored personnel carriers: how French equipment saves Ukrainian infantry on the front line. Arm...	ArmyInform visited one of the -Anna of Kyiv- mechanized battalions, which is equipped with French VAB armored personnel carriers. The crews of these combat vehicles talked about their capabilities and advantages, what tasks they perform on the front line, as well as the specifics of military training in France. -Basically, the French VAB armored personnel carrier is an armored vehicle of the front edge,- says Oleksandr, driver-mechanic. He comes from Volyn. In the brigade since August 2024. Combat vehicles arrived at the units of the brigade several months ago. -The VAB (Vehicule de I'avant blinde) armored personnel carrier is translated from French as 'front edge armored vehicle.' From this follows its main purpose - to deliver infantrymen to the battlefield under the cover of armor as quickly as possible. Our defenders also use vehicles to evacuate the wounded, transport provisions, water and even ammunition. By the way, up to 10 people can be accommodated in the landing compartment of the machine, not including the crew - the driver-mechanic and the machine gunner. The landing compartment is quite roomy inside, the seats are soft, so comfortable conditions have been created for the landing. The communication system with the crew and the landing party for communication is working. In general, the machine shows itself well during combat trips to the front, although the VAB was manufactured in the 70s of the last century. Among the advantages of the armored personnel carrier is good passability on wet fields and swamps. In addition, the car is able to overcome small water obstacles with the help of two controlled water jets. There were situations when the car overcame terrain soaked in -wire tangle-. Then the wheels, axle and gimbal were wound. But that didn't stop the undercarriage. What is interesting, the tanker boys said that once their tank was so wound up with wire that the car did not go any further. Automatic gearbox. Renault engine. Weight up to 13 tons. Power reserve up to 1000 km. The French car is maneuverable plus very fast, for example on the track it can develop a speed of up to 100 km/h. Even on the ground, the armored personnel carrier moves up to 80 km/h. These technical features actually greatly increase the chances of escaping an enemy FPV drone attack. The speed of the car is also important because it is necessary to deliver the wounded guys to the stabilization point. This should be done as quickly as possible, the lives of our fellow citizens are worth their weight in gold. The APC is equipped with a large-caliber Browning M2 machine gun, which is covered by an armor plate. The machine gun is installed in the front part of the armored personnel carrier above the machine control compartment. The hatch opens from the inside, the soldier stands at full height and can fire. The machine gun is quite effective against infantry, various fortifications, unarmored and lightly armored enemy targets. The effective firing range of the machine gun is up to 2000 meters. Combat sorties and the delivery of troops to the front line are always a danger. The enemy is waiting for us. Therefore, we use Browning for fire suppression of the enemy. From work experience, this is a rather serious weapon, which does a good job of -stitching- the positions of the Rashists. How we usually work: there is a team for departure, we leave almost at dawn, when the weather is still -gray-. At that moment, the enemy is just rotating his -fpvishok-, switching from televisions to daytime. Depending on the combat situation, weather conditions and areas in the area, we deliver infantry almost to the position. It can be a distance of even 200-500 meters to the enemy. The armored personnel carrier has a welded body made of armored steel sheets, which provides protection against small arms fire and projectile fragments. The VAB is additionally equipped with a deployable anti-drone net to counter Russian FPV drones. In addition, the car is equipped with an electronic device. Just the other day, a neighboring armored personnel carrier from our unit was attacked by mortar fire. It cut the armor on the sides, but the hull survived. The machine did not stop and completed the task to the end. The guys inside were a little muffled, but it's ok. Fortunately, it has not yet been necessary to test the durability of French armored personnel carriers against air strikes, in particular from drops from FPV drones and attacks from kamikaze drones. We include the EW as we advance into the area of ​​the front line. Interestingly, the VAB has a self-inflating wheel system. Also, each wheel of the armored personnel carrier is additionally equipped with rubber, which works according to the principle of a pillow. If the wheel is pierced by shrapnel, this cushion allows the vehicle to continue moving without stopping, which is very important during enemy fire. We had cases when one wheel was punctured, but the APC left its position on its own at the front edge. In fact, the car traveled 50 km with a flat tire, while moving at a speed of 40 km/h. This technical feature saved the crew of the car, and the paratroopers, and the armored personnel carrier itself. France became the first country to fully train and equip an entire brigade of the Armed Forces with weapons and military equipment. It became the 155th separate mechanized brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine -Anna Kyivska-. There is a lot of information and speculation on the Internet about our studies in France. It is necessary to tell people the truth. We were prepared very well. The training lasted 1.5 months in the eastern region of France - Grand Est. The training of driver mechanics was actually carried out from the basics. These are the tactical and technical characteristics, equipment and combat capabilities of the VAB armored personnel carrier. After the theory, there are practical lessons on driving cars on the road, difficult terrain, overcoming water obstacles, delivering and disembarking troops at high speed during the day and at night, loading and unloading BC. Learned to carry out easy -repair manipulations-. There are different situations, so you need to be able to fix the equipment. They studied the capabilities of the Browning M2 machine guns, fired from them at various targets, on the spot and while the vehicles were moving. Moving and non-moving tall figures, some shelters were impressive. I will say from myself, for better efficiency, you need more time to prepare. A month and a half is not much time, as it seems. Of course, the French instructors taught 100 percent. They explained everything on their fingers, tried to convey as much educational materials to us, the listeners, as possible. The French have everything clearly according to the plan and instructions. Dialogues on the subject of the Russian-Ukrainian war were held with them constantly, and sometimes they had to argue. They have a custom: their unit will never go into battle unless outnumbered by more than one to three. I explained to them: I say, in Ukraine, during the offensive of Russian troops, the Armed Forces do not have such a luxury and are unlikely to ever have it. It included a video and showed how the enemy infantry is advancing with mechanized equipment, how much equipment the enemy uses only on one section of the front, and so on. He explained that the Russians have much more manpower and combat equipment. In France, they lived in a modular town on a landfill. The sleeping quarters were divided into sectors. Residential block for 12 people, nearby house with toilet, shower, sinks and washing machines. The dining room was at the same distance from residential buildings of different sectors. Meals, gyms, opportunities for recreation, in short, the French organized simply excellent conditions for studying and leisure for Ukrainians. We thank them for everything!-, adds Oleksandr, the driver-mechanic.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/29/btr-vab-yak-franczuzka-tehnika-ryatuye-ukrayinsku-pihotu-na-peredovij-reportazh-armiyainform/	2025-01-28T22:15:51-08:00

Battle near Kruty: the story of a brilliant defensive operation	But the events that unfolded, both before and after the Battle of Kruty, did not inspire optimism. Proclaimed in the conditions of the war with Bolshevik Russia, the Ukrainian Republic gradually turned into an occupied territory&#8230; the Russians in 1918 brought to Ukraine the same as in 2014: robbery, rape, arrests, shootings&#8230; But the majority of residents of Ukraine at the beginning of 1918 behaved passively and aloof, not wanting to participate in the defense of their native land, like the residents of Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk in 2014. One government, another - what difference does it make, what flags are there? As a result, Ukraine became part of the Bolshevik empire for 70 years. And everyone who had two legs had to fight. Those who did not fight for Ukraine were forcibly mobilized into the Red Army and died for the interests of Moscow. Stubborn ones were shot, others were imprisoned and sent to Siberia. The same thing is happening now in the territories occupied by Russia. Honoring our heroic predecessors, we remember the Battle of Kruty and know that only properly equipped and trained Armed Forces are the key to preserving statehood. Today ArmiyaInform reminds of what happened 107 years ago. The war between the RSFSR and the Ukrainian People's Republic began with the -Manifesto to the Ukrainian People with Ultimate Demands to the Ukrainian Rada- prepared by Vladimir Lenin. This official document of the Bolshevik Council of People's Commissars was adopted on December 16, 1917 at a meeting of the Soviet People's Committee in Petrograd and the next day telegraphed to the Central Rada in Kyiv. The document demanded unconditional support and assistance from the Ukrainian government to the Bolsheviks in Ukraine. For the answer, Lenin gave 48 hours: -in the event of not receiving a satisfactory answer to these questions, the Council of People's Commissars will consider the Council to be in a state of open war against Soviet power in Russia and Ukraine.- This happened after the unsuccessful Bolshevik uprisings in Kyiv and Odesa, as well as the release from the control of the UNR of parts of the Donbas Revolutionary Committees. On December 19, 1917, the Minister of War of the Ukrainian People's Republic Simon Petliura made a stunning statement at the Central Rada congress: -A campaign is being prepared for us! The Bolsheviks are concentrating their army to defeat the Ukrainian Republic&#8230; The first echelons from Gomel are approaching Bahmach!-. On December 21, Bolshevik Red Guard units led by Volodymyr Antonov-Ovsienko entered Kharkiv. On the night of December 22, they took possession of the city. On December 25, the Bolsheviks held the so-called All-Ukrainian Congress of Soviets in Kharkiv, at which they announced the creation of the -Soviet UNR- with the capital in Kharkiv. The Ukrainian People's Republic headed by the Central Council was declared illegitimate. The next day, Russian-Bolshevik troops began to advance from Kharkiv deep into Ukraine. On December 31, Soviet Russia captured and controlled part of modern Kharkiv region, Luhansk region, and Donetsk region. Also, Bolshevik units occupied the Zhmerinka district on the right bank within the Ukrainian People's Republic. The Bolshevik horde was rapidly advancing towards Kyiv. At the time of the proclamation of the Fourth Universal (January 22), the troops of the Ukrainian People's Republic lost Kharkiv Oblast, Poltava Oblast, Katerynoslav Oblast, and eastern Chernihiv Oblast. The headquarters of the Kyiv Military District expected that the main blow of the enemy would come from the side of Poltava (it was there that the freshest and most combat-capable units of the Army of the Ukrainian People's Republic were directed: the 1st hundred Sich riflemen, the combat regiment of black haidamaks of the 2nd Ukrainian military school, the Serdyutsky detachment named after P. .The head of the regiment is a total of 500 soldiers). But Muravyov went on the offensive in the Bakhma direction. About 400 cadets - senior officers and cadets of the First Ukrainian Military School named after Bohdan Khmelnytskyi, who at that time already had combat experience (some of them even went to the fronts of the First World War), as well as the fighters of Kurenya Smerti, a volunteer unit formed from soldiers who returned from the First World War, and free Cossacks from the city of Glukhova. older people who had combat experience. The battle lasted about six hours. Only in the evening, the Krut defenders were forced to retreat in an organized manner, mainly because they were running out of ammunition. Losses wounded and killed, according to the testimony of the commander of the units at the positions, centurion Averkiy Honcharenko, amounted to 10 officers and about 250 soldiers - mostly wounded young men of the 1st Ukrainian Military School. The dead, according to various sources, were from 70 to 100 soldiers, while the losses of the Bolsheviks, according to one of the reports, reached up to 300 people killed. The most tragic episode of the battle near Kruty was the death of a group of students who got lost during the retreat and went to the station, which at that time was already occupied by the Bolsheviks. Enraged Red Army soldiers the next day shot all the prisoners with explosive bullets. On their way out, the Krutyans dismantled the railway track, which delayed Muravyov's advance on Kyiv for several days. These days became decisive in the negotiations that were ongoing at that time in Brest, and provided an opportunity to conclude the Brest Peace Treaty with the countries of the Quadruple Alliance, one of the main points of which was the international recognition of the Ukrainian People's Republic. However, at that time perhaps the most formidable enemy was the Bolshevik agitation. As Simon Petliura wrote: -Criminal agitation against the Ukrainian People's Republic is mainly carried out by people who are not citizens of our Republic and who came from Great Russia and other countries of the former Russia. These people, instead of thanking our Ukraine for the bread they eat here, commit various rebellions, sow anarchy, rob the civilian population, engage in sabotage, provocation and speculation.- It was Bolshevik propaganda that turned some Ukrainized regiments from allies into potential opponents, as happened with Kuren. T. Shevchenko, who stood in Nizhyn and, having declared neutrality, was a threat to the defenders of Krut. It was she who pulled reinforcements from important areas of the front. So, 300 soldiers of the 3rd Haydamatsky Regiment, led by Simon Petliura, were supposed to come to the aid of the Krut defenders, but they had to return to Kyiv to suppress the Bolshevik rebellion at the Arsenal plant. The riot at Arsenal lasted 7 days and was subdued only on February 4, at the cost of extraordinary efforts. The armed action in Kyiv greatly facilitated the advance of the Bolshevik troops, because the way to Kyiv actually remained open. The Ukrainian military, tired of street battles, were unable to resist Muravyov's army, which at that time approached the outskirts of the city. On February 4, in Darnytsia near Kyiv, Muravyov issued an order for the -merciless destruction of all officers, Haydamaks, monarchists and all enemies of the Russian revolution.- During the storming of Kyiv, poisonous gases were used, massive artillery shelling was carried out (up to 15,000 shells). The population of Kyiv, which at that time reached 430,000 people (of which up to 20,000 were military personnel, soldiers and officers of the old imperial army), was generally indifferent to the struggle of independent Ukrainians against Soviet revolutionary formations. Moreover, the Kyiv pro-Russian public (in modern parlance - -Zhduns-) initially even sympathized with the Bolsheviks, but later paid dearly for their spineless position. Muravyov recalled: -I occupied the garden, hit palaces and churches- beat, showing no mercy to anyone! The Duma (Kiev) asked for a truce. In response, I ordered to suffocate them with gases. Hundreds of generals, and maybe even thousands, were mercilessly killed&#8230; So we got our revenge. We could stop the wrath of revenge, but we didn't, because our slogan is to be merciless!- In occupied Kyiv, the Bolsheviks organized the -Red Terror.- There were robberies, violence, and murders. Representatives of the intelligentsia, soldiers and civilians were shot. Up to 5,000 people were victims of the massacre, including Metropolitan of Kyiv and Halytskyi Volodymyr Bogoyavlenskyi, General Secretary of Land Affairs of the Ukrainian People's Republic Oleksandr Zarudnyi, and Central Rada member Isak Pugach. About a thousand officers and generals were also executed - B. Bobrovsky, A. Acceleration, Ya. Safonov, N. Ivanov, Ya. Handziuk and others. In general, terror and violence, including mass confiscation (looting) of private property, arrests, executions, forced labor, forced mobilization, the organization of famine, etc., was a typical Bolshevik practice in all the territories they occupied. The UNR was saved from being absorbed by Bolshevik Russia in 1918 by the Treaty of Berestei with the countries of the Quadruple Union, signed on February 9. On March 1, Bolshevik troops were forced to leave the capital of the Ukrainian People's Republic, and a week later, the government of the Central Rada returned to the city.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/29/bij-pid-krutamy-istoriya-blyskuchoyi-oboronnoyi-operacziyi/	2025-01-28T22:06:27-08:00
-He chooses Moscow- — The President of Ukraine commented on the statements of the Prime Minister of ...	The head of the Ukrainian state wrote about this in social networks. Earlier, information began to spread among Slovak publications that the Prime Minister of Slovakia, Robert Fico, during a meeting of the parliamentary committee on economic issues, continued the conversation about the transit of Russian gas through Ukraine, calling the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyi, an -enemy- of Slovakia. -To the knowledge of the current Prime Minister of Slovakia. A few days ago, President Trump made a strong decision that will make it possible to significantly increase US LNG exports, particularly to Europe. This is what is needed for security and stability - more energy resources from partners for Europe,- the President of Ukraine noted. According to him, you have to pay for American LNG with money, but for Russian gas you have to pay not only with money, but also with independence and sovereignty. -Many people in Europe have already gone through this and chose to preserve their independence and sovereignty. But not Mr. Fitso. He chooses Moscow over America and other partners who can provide his country with gas on commercial terms. This is his mistake,- Volodymyr Zelenskyi emphasized. He noted that everyone in Europe needs to be forward-looking and develop relationships that strengthen our peoples. At the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine declared that the Prime Minister of Slovakia Robert Fico against the background of falling confidence among the Slovak society and protests against his pro-Russian course, resorted to looking for enemies and found them in Ukraine. -We regard these yet another absurd statements as an attempt to shift the responsibility for our own failures in domestic policy onto foreign states and leaders. We advise you to look not over the border, but in the mirror,- the message says. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs noted that the Ukrainian side has repeatedly warned about the danger of the pro-Russian policy of Slovakia's leadership. -The result is obvious: Robert Fico and individual members of Slovakia's parliament have been poisoned by Russian propaganda, have stopped distinguishing between black and white, and have already begun to call the leaders of neighboring friendly democracies -enemies.- We are sure that such a position and policy of Robert Fico goes against the choice of the people of Slovakia to be an integral part of the European Community,- the Ministry of Foreign Affairs assured. As reported by ArmyInform, previously Volodymyr Zelensky stated that Putin instructed Fico to open a second energy front against Ukraine at the expense of the interests of the people of Slovakia.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/29/vin-obyraye-moskvu-prezydent-ukrayiny-prokomentuvav-zayavy-prem%ca%bcyer-ministr-slovachchyny-shhodo-rosijskogo-gazu/	2025-01-28T21:56:06-08:00

-Stingers- will be enough for everyone, the formula for finalizing the war and 200 -Hraks-: an exper...	How has the number of enemy airstrikes in this direction changed? But why did the infantry assaults of the enemy decrease? This was told by military expert Petro Chernyk. -The number of aerial bombings by the Russian Federation on Kurshchyna has increased. If at the beginning of January they used heavy bombs of the caliber FAB-100, FAB-250, because they are the most massive, somewhere between 3 and 24 per day, now this indicator has increased. the Russians raised it to almost forty strokes. Why does this happen? As we always analyze in two planes. The first and most important is geopolitical. There is already a lot of information that, they say, in this year's cycle of dry weather, the formula to finalize this war will be found. For the Russians, both in terms of prestige and purely in the military component, it is extremely important to get our troops out of Kurshchyna before the start of the negotiation process. This is very important. Because if the Defense Forces of Ukraine will still be there at the moment of finalization, it means that we will have the right to change Kurshchyna&#8230; Let's say I'm a big supporter of what's called the Zaporizhia Nuclear Power Plant&#8230; Therefore, this is a tell-tale sign that the finalization process has in fact acquired new qualitative features and is moving towards its completion. We must remember that the use of heavy aerial bombs means exposing our aviation, first of all, to the work of portable anti-aircraft missile systems. For example, we are the second country in the world to stock FIM-92 Stinger. At most, it was this portable anti-aircraft missile system that the Americans restored and put on the assembly line, because at the beginning of the zeros this system was removed from the arsenal. Do the Russians have a margin of safety, primarily in tactical aviation? Their most massive attack aircraft is the Su-25 Hrak. Russians use it quite often. They have some: before the start of the large-scale invasion, there were up to 200 machines in the line-up, and they still have about 200 machines in storage and have begun to de-conserve it. And the stockpile of bombs, in fact, is not counted in thousands, but in tens of thousands of units. That's quite a lot of potential. Plus, a very important detail is that the Russians managed to improve the quality of their bombs as part of the universal planning and correction module. Some bombs have managed to integrate this module already even with a small engine and declare that from the moment of reset to the point of impact, they have increased this distance to somewhere up to 80, even up to 100 kilometers. The general conclusion is as follows: the increase in rocket-bombing in Kurshchyna is a strategic sign that it is essential for the Russians to knock out our contingent, and not to get it out. Another very interesting cut in Kurshchyna is the reduction of large infantry ramparts. If there were about 50 of them per day, now they have decreased to 13-14. What does that mean? The first point is the so-called anticipatory extermination. the Russians can put no more than 40-45 thousand personnel into service for a month, because otherwise they have to announce a large mobilization. According to the results of December, the total loss of their personnel is more than 48,000. These are anticipatory actions on the march. Why did we manage to show such huge figures in Kurshchyna? First of all, thanks to the operation of our rocket salvo systems and simply unique cluster ammunition. And another phenomenal piece of work, especially over the past year, is our FPV drones. There are cases of aiming not just at a person, but at a separate part of the body, say, at the knee or at the head. In general, when it comes to FPV drones, we are delivering unprecedented results. So the lack of infantry - the North Korean contingent did not justify itself at all - and the very high-quality use of cluster munitions explains for the moment the decrease in the number of infantry assaults as such. But this does not mean that the Russians will not return to them. Let's not forget that they have up to three million mobilization resources, and at one time they produced more than 100 million Kalashnikov assault rifles of all types and varieties. Of course, there are not 100 million in warehouses, but what is there is quite a large stock.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/29/stingeriv-vystachyt-na-vsih-formula-finalizacziyi-vijny-ta-200-grakiv-ekspert-pro-kilkist-shturmiv-ta-aviaudariv-na-kurshhyni/	2025-01-28T20:45:57-08:00
U-2S Dragon Lady: America's spy plane protecting global security	As stated in the profile article of the world-renowned encyclopedia Britannica, the U-2 is a single-seat high-altitude jet aircraft that was used by the United States for intelligence gathering, surveillance and reconnaissance, according to ArmyInform. Perhaps the most famous reconnaissance aircraft ever created by engineers, the U-2, also known as the Dragon Lady, has been in service with the US Air Force since 1956. The prototype aircraft made its first flight back in 1955, and the last aircraft in the series was built in 1989. Experts of the Dutch defense portal Army Recognition emphasize the fact that from the moment of creation to the continuous evolution of the U- 2S demonstrates not only technological resilience, but also adaptability, making it a key tool for ensuring information superiority in an era where data dominance is key to operational success Known for its exceptional ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance) capabilities, the U-2S Dragon Lady has been a cornerstone of global security since its introduction into service with the United States Air Force in 1956. Developed during the Cold War era, the U-2 has undergone significant upgrades, with the current U-2S variant introduced in 1994. Over the decades, this aircraft has adapted to changing mission requirements, consistently integrating advanced technologies to stay at the forefront of modern defense needs. It is expected to remain in service until at least the 2040s, continuing its legacy as a vital ISR platform. The U-2S has an advanced set of technical capabilities designed to operate at extreme altitudes, thanks to the General Electric F118-GE-101 turbofan engine, which allows it to maintain flight above 70,000 feet (21,336 meters). Such a high operational ceiling allows it to perform missions that are far beyond the reach of most air defense systems. The aircraft's impressive wingspan of approximately 104 feet (31.7 meters) increases its lift and endurance, allowing it to fly missions lasting more than 12 hours with a range of more than 7,000 miles (11,265 kilometers). Equipped with a payload capacity of 5,000 pounds (2,268 kilograms), the U-2S can integrate advanced ISR systems, including electro-optical and infrared instrumentation, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), and signals intelligence (SIGINT) equipment tailored to a variety of mission requirements. The key to the success of the U-2S Dragon Lady is its modular design with an open architecture that allows for rapid integration and demonstration of advanced technologies. While traditional platforms require years of development to incorporate new advances, the U-2S can do so in a matter of weeks thanks to improved size, weight, power and cooling (SWAP-C) features. These features not only make it a flexible ISR platform, but also a testing ground for next-generation capabilities, ensuring that it is always one step ahead of emerging threats. SWAP-C stands for an optimized balance between size, weight, power and cooling, which ensures that the aircraft can carry extended payloads without compromising performance. The platform's Open Mission Systems (OMS)-compatible avionics system exemplifies the versatility of the U-2S. OMS is a modular architecture standard that supports a plug-and-play approach, enabling seamless integration of new mission-specific payloads, sensors, and capabilities. This adaptability ensures that the U-2S is not only relevant today, but also ready for the increasingly complex requirements of tomorrow's battlespace. The U-2S is ideally suited to meet the demands of future warfare, where dominance depends on the ability to collect, process and share data at unprecedented speeds. Its advanced data processing capabilities give warfighters access to operational intelligence, reducing the time from data collection to decision-making. Using machine-to-machine (M2M) communication, the U-2S provides seamless data transmission at the tactical, operational and strategic levels, improving coordination across the board. M2M communication involves the automated exchange of data between systems without human intervention, which enables faster and more accurate decision-making. This capability is particularly important in the context of Joint All Domain Operations (JADO), a military concept that emphasizes the integration of capabilities in the land, sea, air, space and cyber domains. The U-2S fills this gap with robust networking capabilities, enabling interoperability and providing a decisive advantage in complex multi-domain environments. Recently implemented program The Avionics Tech Refresh further strengthened the U-2S's position as an ISR platform. With advanced electronics and OMS compatibility, the aircraft now supports the rapid adoption of advanced technologies. This upgrade makes the U-2S the first fully OMS-compatible fleet, significantly reducing integration costs and timelines while providing unparalleled flexibility in adopting new mission capabilities. This technological leap not only expands its existing ISR capabilities, but also positions the U-2S as a tool for future combat operations where speed, flexibility and adaptability will be key determinants of success. The U-2S is operated by a single pilot in a fully sealed cockpit. The aircraft routinely flies at altitudes in excess of 70,000 feet, well above commercial air traffic and the operating ceiling of most other aircraft. U-2 Dragon Lady pilots undergo rigorous training and wear specialized full-pressure suits similar to those used by astronauts to withstand the extreme conditions at such altitudes. A team of ground personnel, including mission planners and technicians, support each flight to ensure the aircraft operates efficiently and safely. During the decades of their service, the U-2 planes wrote many significant pages not only in the history of aviation, but also in international politics. The same profile article about this device in the Britannica encyclopedia reminds us that this particular plane, while performing a secret mission, was shot down by an air defense missile over the Soviet Union on May 1, 1960, which led to -Affairs U-2-. And in 1962 during -Cuban missile crisis- U-2 took photos that confirmed the placement of Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba. As the US military continues to adapt to a more complex global environment, the U-2S Dragon Lady remains at the forefront of providing information superiority. Its ability to work hard at high altitudes, its modular design and advanced avionics make it an invaluable asset for today's missions and tomorrow's tasks. The U-2S is not just an airplane. It is a symbol of innovation and adaptability in the pursuit of global security. From its unrivaled ISR capabilities to its role in shaping the future of multi-domain operations, Dragon Lady is a testament to the power of combining proven performance with cutting-edge technology. As the battlespace evolves, one thing is clear: the U-2S Dragon Lady will continue to soar, protecting the skies and providing warfighters with the critical information they need to win the battles of the future.

Peace before Easter and May parades: Russian fantasies in Kurshchyna	This myth is a typical example of how propagandists try to keep their own population in the illusion of -control over the situation.- Imposing the idea that Ukraine has some -secret agreements- to withdraw from Kurshchyna is a way to quell panic among the Russian population, which in recent months has actively felt the approach of war in their own homes. Try to explain to the residents of the Kursk region why after every air raid signal they have to run to the basements, even though -everything is going according to plan.- Kurshchyna is a strategically important region bordering the northern part of Ukraine. The tasks of our units here are clear and multifaceted: So while Russian propaganda invents the next -graphs- of Ukraine's defeats, our soldiers are already systematically crossing out all the enemy's plans. Russia, losing on the battlefield, bets on information warfare. The goal of such fakes is to demoralize Ukrainian society and inspire its own. But here they are waiting for another failure. Ukrainians have long learned to distinguish truth from lies, and sarcastic memes on the topic of -ensuring peace by Easter- have already spread faster than Russian methods. The Armed Forces of Ukraine will not only leave Kurshchyna, but will also continue to destroy the enemy where it is necessary for the defense of Ukraine. And as for -May 9-, it is better for the Russian command to prepare not parades, but evacuation routes. The Ukrainian army has already shown that it knows how to work in advance. So let Russian propaganda continue to paint its scenarios of -peaceful life-, but we know that real peace will come only when the last occupier leaves our land. And no -holy date- will prevent this.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/29/myr-do-velykodnya-i-travnevi-parady-rosijski-fantaziyi-na-kurshhyni/	2025-01-28T20:12:12-08:00

During this time, -Monaco- together with its sister company installed thousands of mines and hundreds of kilometers of engineering barriers. On one occasion, they successfully destroyed a platoon of invaders by blocking their path with anti-personnel mines. -All the 'gifts' worked,- recalls Monaco. Of course, the work of a miner is associated with constant risk and stress. -There are moments of uncertainty and fear. But you understand: you have to make the task of the infantry as easy as possible. You always have to have a cool head to control the situation,- says Monaco. He also admits that he once experienced burnout and a panic attack, but thanks to the support of the commander, he was able to cope with it. The war changed the life of -Monaco-. The circle of his friends has narrowed, because many are now far away. -My morning starts with breakfast and sleep. Because I'm at work at night,- he says. -Monaco- has a girlfriend, but he does not want to talk about her publicly. However, he readily talks about his future children. -When they ask me who the Russians are, the answer is simple - the ones who wanted to kill your father,- Monaco says. As reported by ArmyInform, a machine gun with the call sign -Patron- from the 141st separate mechanized brigade of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine became a real nightmare for Russian drones.

-24/7 we live in victory-: the commander of the UAV calculation about her front-line experience	The defender's story was made public on the brigade's page. -The most important thing in war is cohesion, mutual support and readiness for any challenges,- Anastasia says. Anastasia started her military career back in 2014 in the border troops, when she was 18 years old. Later, she signed a contract and served in the Armed Forces of Ukraine. With the full-scale invasion beginning in February 2022, she returned from overseas with no doubts about her duty. -Returning to the service was an obvious choice for me. The main thing is that the closest person in my life - my mother - supported me in this,- Anastasia recalls. Currently, Anastasia heads the all-male unit and works on the modern Poseidon unmanned aerial vehicle complex, carrying out reconnaissance missions. The main goal is to identify the enemy's heavy equipment, weapons and manpower. To effectively manage the complex, Anastasia and her team have undergone specialized training. -At first it was difficult to imagine how to lead a unit where most of the men are much older than me. But in practice, everything turned out to be simpler. We have achieved excellent interaction, we understand each other from the bottom of a word,- says Anastasia. Anastasia is sure that the role of a woman in the army has become an integral part of the modern army. Her own example demonstrates that women can perform the most difficult tasks and make key decisions in wartime on an equal footing with men. -I don't feel any difference in the way I am treated as a woman. The main thing is to know your responsibilities and perform them at the highest level,- she says. She is sure that the modern Ukrainian army is no longer possible without women, who not only perform tasks, but also make key decisions. Despite all the difficulties, Anastasia maintains strength of spirit. -What motivates me is that 24/7 we live in victory. We have to drive the enemy out of our land so that no one ever wants to do it again,- she says.

The spokesman of the Navy, Dmytro, told about this in the broadcast of the national telethon -Edyny Novyni- Pletenchuk According to him, Russian sloppiness has not gone anywhere and -maybe- just as no new ships have appeared. Therefore, they will continue to use what is available, despite the fact that Russian old ships are breaking down en masse at sea. -This is about sanctions, which are only beneficial. Their funds continue to melt, which they created there, supposedly, in order to support the population and promise various social benefits. But all this is thrown into the furnace of war and, accordingly, they are not going to stop before environmental problems, of course. They are already playing all-in, in fact,- said Dmytro Pletenchuk.

The spokesman of the 33rd separate mechanized brigade told about this on the -Social News- broadcast. Nazar Voytenkov. In general, according to him, the situation is consistently the same — the occupiers are trying to move in small groups, which is now a typical Russian tactic. No armored assaults, instead — attacks by forces of one, two or three. -These attacks have to be repelled every day. Conduct reconnaissance in the air and adjust artillery fire, aim mortars, and tell our infantrymen what is happening several hundred meters ahead. Their main task is to find positions in which they can gain a foothold. Then they use such -shuttles- to drop new personnel there,- said the spokesman of the 33rd separate mechanized brigade. The main thing in this tactic, as Nazar Voytenkov said, is to move constantly. Use a truly inexhaustible number of personnel. So the Russians move and die en masse. -Despite the fact that we mine the areas, and they come across our mined areas, despite the fact that the FPV constantly destroys them from the sky, they leave. It really feels like it's just a mass of meat. It's really a resource, it's not people,- he said. As reported by ArmyInform, the situation in the Pokrovsky direction remains quite complicated.

ATACMS replacement: Pentagon eyeing PrSM Inc's new missile weapon 5	As noted by portal of the Army Times magazine, American generals said that development of a promising modification is underway at an early stage missiles PrSM conditionally the fifth version, which could significantly expand the army's strike capabilities, ArmiyaInform reports. -We are in the science and technology stage of what we may eventually call Increment 5,- said Brigadier General Rory Crooks, director of the Long-Range Cross-Functional Precision Fires Group. According to the plans of the developers, Increment 5 should have significantly larger dimensions than its predecessors. First of all, the length, which will probably allow combining a range of more than 1,000 km with a fairly powerful warhead. However, a kind of payback will be the refusal to use the existing MLRS/HIMARS launchers. They want to use unmanned launchers for launch, and precisely due to the abandonment of the cabin with the same dimensions (perhaps using the same chassis as in HIMARS, at least such an unmanned vehicle has been tested for some time) it will be possible to place a longer transport-launch container. In general, we can say that these are plans for the development of a separate new missile complex with only partial use of common components. Rory Crooks separately explained that initial work on a fifth option is already underway. And the initiative to implement scientific ideas and developed technologies will begin in fiscal year 2026. The idea, he said, is to develop a missile that can be launched from an autonomous vehicle. According to the implementation plan of the PrSM project: PrSM missiles of the first four versions have a length of approximately 4 m, limited by the dimensions of the launcher. Case diameter is 430mm. The increase in flight range, compared to the previous family of missiles, was obtained due to the introduction of a new solid fuel engine, a lighter warhead and other solutions. Now the relevant service of the Pentagon is in the process of using the first Increment 1 projectiles from Lockheed Martin, declared as a way to hit targets at a distance of at least 500 km. Over the past few years, the US Army has been developing four other PrSM missiles, designed to replace the Army's MGM-140 Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) and to be launched from both the M142 High Mobility Artillery Missile System (HIMARS) and the M270A2 MLRS. According to analysts of the Dutch portal for researching defense strategies Army Recognition, the development of Increment 5 is a key step towards the integration of autonomous technologies for advanced military operations. Despite significant technical challenges, this initiative underscores the United States military's desire to push the boundaries of long-range precision strikes. If successful, PrSM Increment 5 could offer significant strategic advantages in future military scenarios. Although the PrSM Increment 5 project remains conceptual, it reflects the Pentagon's clear desire to modernize its arsenal with the help of innovative technologies. The program's trajectory will depend on progress made in the coming years, with potential implications for future warfare. Development of the PrSM Increment project for the US Army.

Zatrofeev -Vintorez-: the story of an airsoft player -Andrew-, who became a paratrooper	The military heroism is confirmed by high awards - he is a Knight of the Order of Bohdan Khmelnytskyi and the owner of the -Silver Cross- of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the -Cross of Airborne Assault Troops- and the -Path of Honor- of the 46th Separate Airmobile Brigade of the Russian Air Force, awarded with a brigade ring and an award-winning weapon . -Andrew- is from Shostka in Sumshchyna, but has been living in Kyiv for a long time. In civilian life, he was the head of the sales department of a large international company that traded rolled metal. -Trumpets are everywhere,- jokes the soldier, recalling that he also had to be a mortar gunner during his service. The future officer first joined the Armed Forces in 2004 as a conscript soldier, studied at the Zhytomyr Military Institute named after S. P. Korolyova, majoring in electronic warfare. However, a military career did not attract the young man, so after the end of the -line- he returned to civilian life. The armed aggression of the Russian Federation forced them to join forces again. In 2015‒2016, the man served in the State Border Service, protecting the northern border of Ukraine in the Sumy region. -Then I didn't get into the real war, but now I'm raking it in full,- smiles the officer. The call sign -Andrew- is a tribute to the civilian hobby of playing airsoft, in which the future officer acquired and improved his combat skills. The service experience convinced the man of the need to always be ready to stand up for the defense of Ukraine, and the desire to independently acquire and improve the skills of shooting combat led him to this team military game. -The knowledge that was given in the army was not enough for me. Therefore, I decided to take up airsoft to improve my tactical skills. Later, a lot of gaming experience was really needed in the army,- says the soldier. The annual training sessions, which he regularly attended as a reservist in the 95th Separate Airborne Assault Brigade of the Polish Army, became just as useful. So, before the start of a large-scale invasion, -Andrew- had good military training. -Andrew- remembers the 2017‒2021 Annual Meeting of Reservists with respect and gratitude. He emphasizes that it was they who made it possible for Ukraine to have a sufficient number of trained fighters to withstand the first months and throughout the year after the beginning of the large-scale Russian invasion. -By February 2022, we had a sufficient number of trained reservists who had passed through the combat zone and had combat experience. Preparation was established, attention was paid to the formation of territorial defense, training meetings were held regularly. Reservists dragged out the war in 2022,- he says. So when the Russian Federation launched a large-scale attack on Ukraine, first of all, those who already had combat experience and regularly underwent retraining during military meetings were recruited into the Armed Forces. This explains the frequent stories of TCC rejections to inexperienced volunteers in the first months of the 2022 invasion. Since -Andrew- was a reservist of the 95th Separate Airborne Assault Brigade of the Polish Brigade, he met the first weeks of the invasion as part of this unit. Took part in the defense of Boryspil airport. And already in April 2022, together with other fighters, he was transferred to the 46th separate aeromobile brigade of the Russian Armed Forces. At the beginning, the soldier recalls with a smile, he had a different call sign - -Grudnichok-. Once one of the commanders saw that, after a hard day of combat, the man was sleeping as calmly and calmly as a baby, and jokingly called the soldier -Breast-. In memory of this old call sign, -Andrew- wears a patch on his forearm with the image of a baby in camouflage with a machine gun. -From April to June, we had a battalion reconciliation. Then they went to the south, fought in the Kherson region. He took part in the battles for Biloghirka, Davidiv Brid, Velika and Mala Oleksandrivka, Trifonivka. Then I reached Dudchan,- the officer recalls. On October 25, 2022, near Dudchany in the Kherson region, -Andrew- received two bullet wounds - one in the back, the other in the hand. The soldier was being hunted by an enemy sniper, but he was saved by a high-quality bulletproof vest. -That bulletproof vest saved me,- the officer shows the bullet mark. He now wears the bullet, which the armor protected, around his neck as a pendant. He was able to return to action after treatment and rehabilitation in March 2023. With a higher education - at one time -Andrew- graduated from the Interregional Academy of Personnel Management - the soldier could apply for the primary rank of officer. The command was happy to meet the desire of a capable, experienced and responsible fighter. -Officer courses in Odessa lasted two months. Plus I was lucky - I got to study in Germany for a month. They have a very good material base, high-quality training protocols. I really liked that they put a lot of emphasis on storming trenches and buildings. -Not everything we were taught works the same way in our war, but they laid a very good foundation,- recalls -Andrew- gratefully. After completing his training and returning to Ukraine, -Andrew- was given the rank of junior lieutenant and, as an educated and experienced man, was appointed to the position of deputy company commander. At this time, he had to take part in offensive actions in the South in the area of ​​the Robotynsky Salient. -There we encountered the Russian special forces of the 45th separate special purpose brigade of the airborne troops. This is considered elite among them, but we showed them that we are better,- says the officer. It was there that he managed to capture a unique trophy - the Russian Vintorez silent-shooting sniper rifle. -My photo with her has been around the Internet for a long time, so I can brag a little,- smiles -Andrew-. From December 2023, -Andrew- became an acting company commander, and soon after, a company commander. He fought in one of the most difficult areas of the front - the Marinsky and Kurakhiv directions. I watched how the nature of hostilities was rapidly changing. -The war has changed a lot. It began to change already in 2023 during the battles on the Robotynsky ledge. The mass use of FPV drones began, they radically changed the war. There used to be artillery, infantry, aviation, and now there are also drones,- notes -Andrew-. Being able to move covertly and camouflage in the terrain, counter drones with the help of EW and shoot down enemy drones with sniper fire is what determines the ability of fighters to survive on the battlefield and complete the combat mission. -Andrew- believes that this is what infantrymen should be taught first of all. -If you are struggling, if you are being pressed by the enemy, it means that you are a key point in a big defense mechanism. You are important in this place and at this time. Everyone needs to be where they need to be and do their job as efficiently as possible,- emphasizes Andrew. Addressing men who are hesitating about mobilization, the officer emphasizes: everyone is actually afraid of war, even the most experienced soldiers who have been fighting on the front lines for more than a year do not avoid this fear. The main thing is to overcome fear and not follow the coward's path of shame, but the warrior's path of honor. -Fear is a natural thing. If a person is not afraid of anything, then he is just stupid. You just need to be able to control your fear. It should be overcome, listen to commanders, believe in yourself and make the right choice,- the officer is confident. Because the -Path of Honor- is not only a high award of the 46th separate airborne brigade of the Airborne Assault Forces. This is primarily the choice of every defender of Ukraine.

Tactics -The Walking Dead-, or How to stop the enemy near Pokrovsk. ArmiyaInform report from Donetsk...	Oleksandr from Vinnytsia region. Already more than 5 years in the army. In the brigade, he started as a scout in a regular infantry unit. During the operation of the Joint Forces, he performed tasks on drones. With the beginning of the large-scale invasion of the Russian Federation, the brigade repelled the offensive of the invaders in the south of Ukraine, in the Kherson region. He has extensive experience in piloting and striking the enemy from various UAVs in different areas of the Russian-Ukrainian war front. Now the enemy is destroying Donbass. -The use of Maviks on the front is an extremely urgent need today, primarily in matters of situational awareness and control over the situation on the battlefield. This is reconnaissance of the enemy's positions on the front edge plus the depth of his battle formations up to 12 km. With the help of drones, the locations of manpower and firepower are determined, artillery fire is adjusted and the enemy is struck by drops of combat units. The command determines priority targets for destruction and gives instructions for combat use, for example, brigade artillery: calculations of guns, self-propelled artillery installations and mortars. It can also be FPV drone crews. We destroy the enemy depending on the type of targets and the distance to them. The drone has a good optical camera that allows you to shoot high-quality video from a height of up to 6 km and transmit it to the operator's console, and a thermal imager can monitor the situation at night. Optimally, -Mavik- can carry 600 grams of a warhead, maybe more, of course. Everything above is difficult for him. The motor overheats and sometimes it can just fall. At a discount. We cling to everything that can kill the invaders. Currently, the format of ammunition is very diverse: grenades, VOGs, combinative resets, thermobars, -ignitors-, explosives and high-explosive fragmentation bombs. Usually, we use fragmentation projectiles against the enemy's manpower, and high-explosive and cumulative drops for other purposes. Everything depends on the combat mission and the characteristics of the targets to be hit. If we need to stop small assault groups of the enemy, then, of course, we use shrapnel drops. To inflict maximum damage on the enemy and prevent his further attack. If there is a shelter, you can dismantle it with explosives. The dugout is covered with some kind of wood, then you can bring in a -lighter-. And if you find an enemy field warehouse with ammunition, you can drop a cumulative charge, a -lighter- or a high explosive to blow it up. A combat unit must be prepared in advance for each combat mission. In the Pokrovsky direction, the Rashists use the tactics of small assault groups. Every day, the occupiers gather at some point in the locality, the first to go is a group of 5-7 people, armed with assault rifles without BC. They are trying to advance to the afforestation to take advantageous positions for themselves. We see all this, we monitor them. At the stage of gathering the enemy, we strike at them. Half of the raschits are destroyed immediately, others with injuries flee to the sides and are shot. But not for long. Very often the Rashists themselves kill themselves with grenades, other -walkers- with injuries crawl and die from massive bleeding. It reminds us of the story pictures from the top American post-apocalyptic TV series The Walking Dead. That is why we sometimes compare rashists with -walkers- from this series, who wander aimlessly around the area and -ultimately- die from the bullets of the main character, policeman Rick Grimes and his men. Interestingly, another assault group of Rashists steps on the corpses of their own men. No one helps the wounded, and even more so no one evacuates them from the battlefield. The kamikaze mortals climb further, and we continue to -ground- the invaders. There are days when the Mavik crew performs only reconnaissance tasks. We -cut- a specific area of ​​the terrain, fly out and conduct observations. In today's conditions, it is important to increase the duration of the flight task. For this, we additionally attach a battery. Usually, we stand in for 4 days on combat duty. This is optimal for intensive combat work, and during these days another shift can sleep, deal with current issues and recover. Our positions are relatively close to the front line, in camouflaged shelters. So that the enemy does not discover our location. We are great prey for the Rashists, so they are looking for us 24 hours a day. Likewise, we are looking for the positions of their FPV drone crews and Maviks. It's a -counter-drone fight- of sorts. On days of combat work, when we work with Maviks with drops, we manage to destroy (hit) up to 60 occupants. This is with the wounded, who, of course, do not survive. It is about only one Mavik crew. There are other UAVs of the -Height Predators- unmanned systems battalion. They also -slice- rashits daily. When it comes to FPV drone crews, they usually manage to destroy the enemy more. After all, their functionality is only striking the enemy. Our crew is engaged in aerial reconnaissance in parallel. Plus, if we talk about the comprehensive defeat of the enemy by all means of defeat of the -Predators of the Heights- battalion, together with the artillery and infantry units of the brigade, approximately 300-400 enemy personnel are quite realistically destroyed. And this is just for four days on duty. It is in -lite- mode of operation, without any particular stress. Tanks, artillery systems, other heavy armored vehicles of the enemy are affected. One night they flew deep into the battle formations of the Rashists, somewhere up to 3-4 km. The tank was discovered, it was well camouflaged. They -burned- his cannon, which looked. The coordinates of the target were reset to our gunners and that was it. A little later, in the morning, they flew over the area again and noticed that this tank was burning. Or we give the coordinates to our -night bomber-. -Baba Yaga- is already attacking enemy equipment with drops. Interesting work within the limits of counter-battery. The enemy strikes with artillery, our -barriers- are activated. Art systems have been detected in some area of ​​the terrain, -Mavik-, which performs tasks in the air, goes to the given area and transmits the exact coordinates of the enemy's artillery. It can be a self-propelled gun, mortars, towed artillery of the Russian Federation. That is, the coordination of efforts and interaction between different units in the war is a key point. EW is a problem for us. But not always. I will tell one story. Once near the front edge of the enemy, a column of armored vehicles was discovered. the Rashists planned to storm our positions with the help of the MTLB. Our task is to destroy the first piece of machinery. We flew a little closer, visually saw a EW device standing on the -motorcycle-. We fly even closer, observe: the EW is either not working, or they simply did not turn it on. Then the first reset passed near MTLB, the second was already a direct hit. The car caught fire, the occupants ran out of it. Then our FPV drones joined, which finished off the enemy and the equipment. Other enemy vehicles turned around and rushed back. Our -fpvishkas- on the move there -took apart- them, it is much easier for them to attack targets while moving. And if the EW radar works, then you need to quickly fly up, -take- a picture, so that the enemy does not have time to turn on the signal suppression and get to a safe distance from him. Or we just bypass it, any EW device has a range, it can be 300 or 400 meters. The hardest part of the Mavik crew's job is to find well-disguised infantry positions, mortar or artillery nests. The adversary learns and improves as well. There is an understanding that not destroyed in time enemy equipment or accumulations of manpower are possible potential losses of our units. Therefore, only vigilance, concentration and experience. The crew must constantly develop and learn to -precede- the logic of the occupiers. To be more cunning, to come up with new tactical ways of defeating the enemy. If the rain is very heavy, we don't work, because the board can be trivially flooded. He is simply in the sky -short- and that's all - there will be no combat drone. If it's fog, some kind of haze, then we're definitely flying. But in these conditions it is difficult to navigate, you can't see where you are flying, you navigate along the -front-.

- Parachutist robbers: how Russian propagandists created a fake about the 95th ODSHBr	The 95th ODSHBr is a legendary unit of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which deservedly has the reputation of being invincible. In recent years, the paratroopers of this brigade have performed so many feats that the Russians can only look for a way to blacken them. And, as always, instead of the truth, we got a portion of fantasy, which can be described by the phrase: -When you can't win, create a stupid myth.- The essence of the fiction is simple: alleged Ukrainian paratroopers go to the homes of the elderly in the liberated territories and&#8230; robbing them. Propagandists do not specify what exactly they -take- from pensioners. Maybe beets from the cellar or an old TV? But the most interesting thing is that the Russian Telegram channels that promoted this -masterpiece- never even showed photos or videos of the -robbers- - because they themselves understand how ridiculous it sounds. In the liberated territories, on the contrary, the fighters of the 95th help the locals to survive. There are numerous testimonies from residents of Kherson region, Donetsk region, and Kharkiv region about how paratroopers took people out of dangerous zones, brought them food, medicine, and even evacuated their pets. One of these cases happened in Donetsk region: the paratroopers carried an elderly woman who could not move on her own, and carried her several kilometers to a safe zone. Russian propagandists are silent about this, because they do not need the truth - they need a picture that is easy to -sell- to their audience. This is a classic scheme of discrediting: to denigrate those who are models of courage and honor. Russian propaganda tries to -invert- reality, showing the liberators as criminals and their occupiers as -saviors-. However, when in one plot they say that Ukrainians do not have an army, and in another - that the Ukrainian army is so strong that it -bothers- the Russians, a cognitive dissonance arises. If you believe the Russian fakes, then the 95th brigade is not just paratroopers, but universal soldiers. At the same time, they manage to heroically destroy Russian units at the front, rob pensioners and, probably, also launch some -secret drones- in order to interfere with Skabeeva's work. What is there to say? Such a fantasy can only be compared with the scenarios of cheap action movies. Fakes like this are part of the Russian information war aimed at discrediting Ukrainian defenders. But the truth is always stronger than a lie. So while the propagandists paint their myths, the paratroopers of the 95th continue to do their job: to liberate the Ukrainian land and to help the people to whom they gave a chance to live.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/28/grabizhnyky-parashutysty-yak-rosijski-propagandysty-zlipyly-fejk-pro-95-tu-odshbr/	2025-01-27T20:02:21-08:00

Under the new rules, the residents of the region are forced to comply with the illegal tax demands of the occupiers. This creates additional financial pressure, especially on small businesses that are already suffering from repression and lawlessness. The real goal of these so-called reforms is to establish complete financial control over the region's economy. The occupying power optimizes taxation processes, effectively destroying the economic potential of the region and bringing residents to the limit of survival. The National Resistance Center emphasizes that the return of peaceful life and economic justice is possible only after the complete de-occupation of the territory.

The dodger-corrector - in the dark - used his roommate to transmit data to Russia	This is reported by the Security Service of Ukraine. The new suspect turned out to be a 46-year-old local resident who avoided mobilization and at the same time fulfilled the tasks of the FSB. The man was collecting coordinates for air attacks on the positions of the Defense Forces in the Dnipro. To avoid suspicion, the agent involved his roommate in intelligence activities. The woman went around the places designated by him, recorded the geolocations of military objects and transmitted them in the form of marks on Google maps. The attacker explained to her that it was necessary for -work-, although in fact he was unemployed and transferred the collected data to the Russian intelligence services. SBU counter-intelligence detained the traitor in his apartment. A mobile phone with evidence of cooperation with the occupiers was seized from him.

Communal collapse at TOT: the occupiers destroyed the housing and communal sphere	About informs Center of National Resistance. According to the so-called -head of Makiiv district- Vladyslav Klyucharyov, communal services are only 50% staffed. At least 1,500 workers are needed for the stable operation of the water and heat supply systems, but only about 700 people are currently employed. The root of the problem is the criminal mobilization of the male population of conscription age by the occupiers. This led to a significant reduction in labor resources. A similar situation is observed in occupied Luhansk, where only a third of the required public transport drivers go to work. The rest were forcibly mobilized into the Russian army. Currently, the occupiers cannot find even 300 drivers to ensure the minimum functioning of city routes. The National Resistance Center emphasizes that the forced mobilization of the civilian population in the occupied territories is a violation of Articles 49 and 51 of the Geneva Convention on the Protection of the Civilian Population in Time of War. According to these norms, the occupying power does not have the right to compel civilians to serve in its armed forces or to participate in hostilities. Ukraine emphasizes that sooner or later all those involved in these crimes will be brought to justice before the law and the Ukrainian people. As reported by ArmyInform, the Kremlin is trying to consolidate control over temporarily occupied territories, despite the opposition of the local population.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/27/komunalnyj-kolaps-na-tot-okupanty-zrujnuvaly-zhytlovo-komunalnu-sferu/	2025-01-27T10:50:12-08:00

In Kharkiv, a banker-spy and a speechwriter of Russian propaganda received long terms	The Security Service of Ukraine reported this on January 27. One of the convicts is a Russian spy - a 56-year-old citizen of Russia, who simultaneously worked in a local bank and performed the tasks of military intelligence of the Russian Federation (better known as GRU). It was established that he was preparing the coordinates for the aggressor's rocket-bomb attacks on the storage locations of technical documentation, which is necessary for the restoration of industrial facilities in the region. In order to obtain geolocations of potential targets, the Russian -darkly- tried to use his acquaintance - a local official who has access to secret information. In addition, the attacker drove around the city in his own car and recorded on a hidden video recorder the location of the defenders of Kharkiv. The counterintelligence of the SBU timely exposed the Russian spy and detained him in 2024. Taking into account his cooperation with the investigation, the court sentenced him to 10 years of imprisonment with confiscation of property. Another convict is a 42-year-old resident of Kharkiv, who prepared theses for the public speeches of the Russian -military corps-.

Consequences of Russian occupation: what will happen if the enemy enters our homes. The experience o...	Among many examples, one of the most revealing is the division of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, which took place at the end of the 18th century. Until recently, the powerful Poland lost its statehood and was absorbed by the Russian Empire for more than a century. And now the Kremlin dictator says that it was created thanks to -comrade Stalin-. ArmiyaInform reminds us of the historical lessons of such events, of what the Russian occupation was and what it led to. It is this example that clearly demonstrates what the capture of Kyiv can be like and what will happen to Ukrainians and Ukraine in the event of capitulation. And it all started with the Northern War of 1700-1721. It was during this armed conflict that, entering into an alliance against Sweden with the Muscovite kingdom, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth allowed the -protectorate- of Moscow to be imposed on itself. At the beginning, the Treaty of Narva, which was signed on August 30, 1704, stipulated that the eastern ally would support King Augustus II with a 12,000-strong auxiliary army corps and annual financial assistance of 200,000 rubles. After the victory of the Muscovites in the Northern War and the proclamation of the All-Russian Empire, its influence and appetites are growing rapidly. Throughout the 18th century, Russian soldiers went to Poland -like dogs to the kitchen.- And with each of their -special military operations-, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth became more and more dependent on its -eternal ally-. The culmination was the coup d'état of 1764 carried out -on Russian bayonets- and the -appointment- of Catherine II's lover, Stanislav-August Poniatovsky, by the king of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, who pursued a pro-Russian policy until the end of his 30-year reign. A weak Poland was beneficial to all its neighbors, and especially to the Russian Empire. Catherine II sought to preserve the -protectorate- over the entire Polish territory and further limit her sovereign rights. Despite this, in 1768 it even provided the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth with guarantees of territorial integrity! But already in a few years, as expected, she violated her obligations. the Russian army, which was constantly on the territory of the Commonwealth of Independent States, severely punished any attempts at anti-Russian demonstrations. She drowned the Bar confederation, Koliiv region, Šiauliai uprising in blood, took control of the church, the Diet, and forced a small crown army to carry out her orders. Turkey, which supported the barbarian confederates, began to demand from Russia to stop interfering in the internal affairs of the Commonwealth of Independent States and to withdraw its troops. Finally, without waiting for any reaction, in October 1768 The Ottoman Empire declared war on Russia. For Russia, the costs of maintaining the -Polish protectorate- against the armed resistance of the Confederates and the Ottomans turned out to be too high. And in Petersburg they did not invent anything better, like&#8230; division of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth between its neighbors. Prussia and Austria also took part in the partition, because it was important to -preserve the balance of power-&#8230; On August 5, 1772, authorized representatives of the -balance-forming- countries signed a treaty in St. Petersburg, according to which the so-called -sanitary strips- were annexed, i.e., the territories along the perimeter of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. The Kingdom of Prussia took Pomorie, Kuyavia and part of Greater Poland with a total area of ​​36,000. km² with a population of 580,000 persons Habsburg Monarchy - Lesser Poland and Galicia with Rus, Belz and the western outskirts of Volyn and Podil Voivodeships, a territory of 83,000 km² with 2,650,000 residents (since then, the Austrian period of the history of Lviv and the region began, which lasted until November 1, 1918). And the Russian Empire - East Belarusian lands with Polotsk, Vitebsk and Mstislavl, as well as part of Livland (Latvia), a total of 92 thousand. km² with 1,300,000 population. On September 30, 1773, the Russian-controlled Sejm ratified the agreement on the division of the lands of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, which gave -legitimacy- to these annexations. During the years 1773–1792, supporters of reforms tried in vain to save the remnants of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and to strengthen the state. The four-year Sejm (1788–1792), initiated by a group of patriotic reformers led by Hugo Collontaiy, adopted a Constitution on May 3, 1791, which introduced a hereditary monarchy (instead of an elected one that existed before that) and personal liberties and equal rights for all citizens. The restriction of status privileges caused dissatisfaction among a part of the magnates and nobility, who formed a separatist confederation in 1792 in the town of Torgovytsa (on the then Russian border), and called for the help of Catherine II. As expected, Catherine II reacted quickly. She ordered General Kachowski's troops to enter Poland, and General Krechetnikov's to Lithuania. Fighting broke out. Catherine II was supported by the Prussian king Friedrich Wilhelm II in the invasion of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. For about three months, the Polish army put up a desperate resistance. But under the pressure of forces that had a significant advantage, King Stanislav Augustus was forced to capitulate and submit to the demands of the invaders. The new, completely pro-Russian Diet, convened in the city of Grodno, announced the abolition of the -May 3- Constitution. Garrisons of Russian and Prussian troops were stationed in major cities of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, including its capital, Warsaw. The Polish army was to be significantly reduced, many units were supposed to be disbanded. In December 1792, Catherine II and Friedrich Wilhelm II agreed on a new, second division of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. On April 9, 1793, its conditions were announced: Prussia received Greater Poland with the cities of Poznań, Toruń, and Gdansk, and Russia received Eastern Belarus and Right-Bank Ukraine. In September 1793, the terms of partition were adopted by the Polish Sejm, which was controlled by separatist merchants and occupiers. At the end of 1793, the situation was as follows. Russian troops committed numerous robberies combined with political repression. There was an economic and financial collapse of the state - the seven largest banks in Warsaw went bankrupt, food prices rose. The new government introduced censorship, banning criticism of the Diet, Catherine II, her military and civil servants. A significant amount of the press was liquidated, banned books were removed from bookstores. Cultural contacts with Western Europe were interrupted - the country was artificially fenced off with an -iron curtain-. Despite this, far from all Poles came to terms with the actual occupation of what was left of their state, society carried out a social boycott of Russians. Secret societies were organized everywhere, which set themselves the goal of preparing a general uprising. The leader of this movement was General Tadeusz Kosciuszko, a participant in the American Revolution, who was in exile, the center of which was Saxony (Dresden and Leipzig). It was recognized that it was necessary to establish a military dictatorship in Poland and entrust it to Kosciuszko. It was the last chance to save independence&#8230; The rebellion began on 12 March 1794 with the mutiny of General Antony Madalinsky's cavalry brigade, which refused to obey the decision to disband it. Other parts of the army of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth began to join the rebels. A few days later, Madalinski's cavalry took control of Kraków, which became the center of the uprising. On March 24, the Act was published there, which proclaimed the slogans of the full restoration of Polish sovereignty, the return of the territories rejected in 1772 and 1793, the continuation of the reforms initiated by the Four-Year Sejm, granted Kosciuszko the title of supreme commander of the national armed forces, and transferred all power to his hands. The movement was supported by broad sections of the population, the formation and arming of insurgent units began everywhere. April 4, 1794 in the battle near Roslavice, the Poles managed to inflict the first tangible defeat on the Russians and believed in the possibility of victory. The focus of the struggle quickly spread to other regions: Warsaw was liberated on April 17-18, and Vilna on April 22-23. Kosciuszko announced a general mobilization. The quantitative composition of the rebel army was brought to 70 thousand, but a significant part of it was armed with spears and scythes. Despite this, by May the rebels had established control over most of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Soon after recovering, Prussia, Austria and Russia decided to suppress the uprising by armed means and force the Poles to recognize the partition of Poland. They began to invade the territory of the country from five directions. Since July 13, 1794, the siege of Warsaw by Russian and Prussian troops continued. On October 9, the Russian corps of General Ivan Ferzen defeated the main forces of the rebel forces in the Battle of Maciewovice near the town of Siedlce in eastern Poland. Tadeusz Kosciuszko was seriously wounded and captured. Of the 10,000 rebels who took part in the battle, only two thousand managed to reach Warsaw. The news about the disaster near Maceiovytsi caused panic in the capital. The main strategic point of the city's defense against Russian troops was Prague, the right-bank part of Warsaw. On November 6, 1794, Suvorov's troops launched an assault and, breaking the resistance of the defenders, began to destroy the civilian population with barbaric cruelty. Up to 20,000 people died as a result of the wave of killings that lasted several hours. This act finally broke the rebellion and led its leaders to surrender. The defeat of Tadeusz Kosciuszko's rebellion led to the third partition of Poland in 1795 and the complete liquidation of Polish statehood. This example demonstrates that everyone must fight to prevent what happened to Poland in 1794. Or even worse, because over time, the Russians' methods of warfare become even more barbaric. Everyone will have to fight: only now for the Motherland, or later on the side of the invader. And when Russian troops occupy our country and prepare a further offensive -on NATO-, forced mobilization by field -military commissars- of the Russian Federation will begin. Hardly anyone will speak against this then, because the alternative will be executions, repression, torture, forced labor in the -permafrost-&#8230; So do we want to live under Russian occupation, in eternal fear? The Poles did not want either, but they resisted for only eight months and lost their statehood for 123 years. We are now much stronger, more numerous and more motivated than they were then. We have been resisting for much longer and know very well that victory depends on each of us.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/27/naslidky-rosokupacziyi-shho-bude-yakshho-vorog-zajde-v-nashi-domivky-dosvid-polshhi/	2025-01-27T09:18:26-08:00

Earlier, ArmiyaInform showed how fighters of the 73rd SSO center in Kurshchyna kurshhyni/->hit the enemy's personnel and equipment by all available means.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/27/svoyih-vse-taky-kydayut-dron-speczpryznachencziv-zahopyv-u-polon-pokynutogo-vijskamy-rf-rosiyanyna/	2025-01-27T03:01:01-08:00
10 days under heavy fire: how Air Force fighters restrained the enemy in Kurshchyna	About how the fighters held a strategically important position, told in the Command of the Air Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Enemy reconnaissance drones and FPV drones monitored almost every step, the artillery was relentless, and there were mines and unexploded ordnance everywhere. Explosions rang out almost every second. A group of servicemen from the Combined Rifle Brigade was tasked with occupying and holding a designated sector until reinforcements arrived. The senior of the group was 28-year-old junior sergeant Ruslan, the oldest among his brothers. The night before going to the position was extremely stressful. The enemy met the aircraft with fire, the KAB destroyed a nearby building. Some were checking weapons, some were joking about -finally over the border- to hide their anxiety. -If everything goes well, we will return in 7-10 days,- Ruslan tried to reassure his brothers. But -if- was the key word here. Getting to the position was extremely dangerous. The soldiers walked for several kilometers in full ammunition, with ammunition and provisions. They didn't even walk, but ran and crawled, moving past ruins, burned equipment and bodies — a familiar picture for our military, but this time on the territory of Russia. -Each action has its consequences&#8230; As they say, you can play this game together,- the fighters commented on what they saw. Daily enemy assaults awaited them ahead. -Right now the fate of the country is being decided,- everyone understood. The first shooting battle lasted more than two hours. The Russians pressed with weapons and psychologically, shouting: -Get out! Let's take it in a circle!-. Ruslan supported his people: -Sectors, we hold! Let's knock them down!-. The second battle began in a few hours and continued for ten days: endless anti-aircraft guns, artillery, drones, airdrops, DRGs, assault groups. -Each bush could respond with an automatic queue.- The enemy tried to storm the position several times a day. With incredible efforts, the soldiers of the Combined Rifle Brigade held the sector until problems with ammunition arose. Exiting the position became a separate difficult operation, because the evacuation groups were always a target for the enemy. Unfortunately, one of the soldiers of the brigade, Serhii, who had previously served in the search and rescue service, died during the departure from the UAV. -Is it difficult to coordinate the actions of people who have no prior experience of ground combat?- Ruslan was asked. -No, because these are really motivated young guys. They were worthy specialists in the Air Force and became cool infantrymen! More than once, we experienced real hell together, when the enemy tried to destroy us every minute, and we, in return, tried to prevent him from doing it by all the means known to us,- he answered. Ruslan and his comrades have been fighting side by side in the eastern direction for more than nine months, they have seen heavy losses, kilometers of scorched earth and treachery of the enemy. -Here, in the infantry, we do our best!- - he emphasized. Ruslan, who started serving in the Air Force in 2016 and participated in ATO/OS, understood what he was getting into. After his release in 2020, he briefly returned to civilian life. Now he, although a junior sergeant, commands a platoon and is ready for new challenges. The only thing he regrets is that his two-year-old daughter only sees her dad via video link. But he is sure that one day she will understand what he is fighting for - for her future. As reported by ArmyInform, the officer of the Air Force -Major- told how the soldiers of the Air Force protect the country from the invaders, what tasks they perform on the front lines as part of the ground component of the troops and how they take the enemy prisoner.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/27/10-dniv-pid-shkvalnym-vognem-yak-bijczi-povitryanyh-syl-strymuvaly-voroga-na-kurshhyni/	2025-01-27T02:52:02-08:00
Mission planning of UAV crews: the Mission Control module has become available to all DELTA users	About informs on January 27, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. Mission Control also collects and analyzes data from missions, reduces the risks of -friendly fire- and helps to establish more accurate interaction between units. To date, the module has been used by more than 300 units. Every day, thanks to Mission Control, 900 missions were carried out, and over 200,000 during the entire existence of the module. -Mission Control is an important step forward in the development of the DELTA ecosystem and modern military technologies,- said Kateryna Chernogorenko, Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine for Digitalization. According to her, this module not only provides a high level of digitalization and decision-making support in complex combat conditions, but also opens up opportunities for the introduction of new management processes in the army. Mission Control interacts with DELTA's other tools, namely the Monitor situational awareness module and the Vezha battlefield video analysis platform. This creates a unified information picture for the effective use of UAVs, the successful completion of missions and the destruction of the enemy.

One against ten: how -Kipish- repelled the attack of the Wagnerites who surrounded his position	The soldier's story was published on page 33 of a separate mechanized brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. -Kipish- went to the front with a firm conviction: -Everything is simple - to chase the enemy who is encroaching on our territory. And in the trenches, and in the landings, and in the cities. We don't need him here.- His combat path ran through the Kherson region, where he was always ahead, in intelligence. Then there were Bakhmut and Klishchiivka, Zaporizhzhia, and now he is defending Ukraine near Kurakhovo. One of the fiercest episodes occurred during a clash with the fighters of the -Wagner- PMK. The Russian attack aircraft operated tactically, in small groups of 10, trying to surround the position. Armed only with an assault rifle, a few magazines, grenades and equipment, Kipish was able to repel the attack. The enemies died one by one, because they advanced wave after wave, without counting their own losses and without taking away their dead. -They don't care. They went and did not pick up their corpses. For them, the main thing is to fight back and keep moving, moving, moving. Assault, assault, assault. So, when the enemy sneaks up, you need to shoot accurately, keep on the defensive, and don't panic. Panic is contagious. Or you will have to leave,- Kipish shares his experience. Friend -Kipish- is convinced: the only way to Victory is to destroy the enemy without stopping, giving no chance to consolidate. His battle credo sounds simple and resolute: -Cover them all with concrete.- Destroy the Russians. This will bring us closer to Victory.- As reported by ArmiyaInform, a fighter of the 9th border detachment named after Sich Riflemen under the pseudonym -RE.K.S.- came to the defense of Ukraine in the first hours after the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation, despite the fact that he was born in Leningrad and is a Russian by nationality.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/27/odyn-proty-desyaty-yak-kipish-vidbyv-ataku-vagnerivcziv-shho-otochyly-jogo-pozycziyu/	2025-01-27T01:44:35-08:00

An enemy gunner was detained: he worked for the Russian Federation in the Kramatorsk district	This was reported on January 27 by the Prosecutor General's Office. According to the investigation, a native of Slovyansk, who had been living in Moscow for a long time, returned to Donetsk region two weeks before the beginning of the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation into the territory of Ukraine. In 2024, he was contacted in the Telegram messenger by an acquaintance - a military officer of the DNR. He asked to send him information of a military nature, which he planned to use during the offensive in the Kramatorsk direction.

Danylo Borysenko, head of reconnaissance of the anti-aircraft missile and artillery division of the -Rubizh- brigade. According to him, the enemy's tactics differ in different areas of the front, because different units use personal composition and equipment. However, in general, the main trend is clear — attacks by small infantry groups without the use of armored vehicles. -They are trying to infiltrate the landings, into some separate buildings and accumulate personnel there for further advancement. A group of four or five people is put forward, two get to land, because three have already been hit by FPV drones from our side. If they manage to survive for some time, then the next group is put forward to join them, and then the next,- said Dmytro Borysenko. According to him, the main task is to have time to work on the enemy and inflict maximum losses on him while still on the way to the front line. -They invent anything: they try to jump in on motorcycles and buggies. There was a case when two Zhiguli tried to reach us from the enemy's side. The first model of the Zhiguli and the second is a station wagon. All of them were impressed by our FPV,- said the intelligence chief of the anti-aircraft missile and artillery division of the Rubizh brigade. As reported AmriyaInform, in the Lyman direction, the enemy practically does not resort to mechanized assaults on the positions of the Defense Forces of Ukraine. However, he sends small assault groups of 2-3 people to attack almost around the clock.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/27/rozmah-na-karbovanecz-a-udar-kopijkoyu-rosiyany-atakuvaly-nashi-pozycziyi-dvoma-stareznymy-zhygulyamy/	2025-01-27T00:48:34-08:00
The motorcycle blitzkrieg failed: the Armed Forces of Ukraine repelled the Russian attack in the Kra...	The video of combat work was published on the brigade's page. Russian troops involved a motorcycle group consisting of four crossbikes in the assault. Counting on the speed and maneuverability of the motorcycles, the enemy planned to imperceptibly bypass the positions of the Ukrainian defenders and strike from an unexpected direction. However, thanks to the timely work of the aerial reconnaissance of the 5th assault brigade, the plans of the occupiers were thwarted. Ukrainian drones detected the enemy group in time and coordinated fire to destroy it. At first, artillery with cluster ammunition worked on motorcyclists. And for the final elimination of the enemy group, FPV drones were used. A Russian attack aircraft was destroyed by a well-aimed strike from one of the drones, which forced the rest of the motorcyclists to stop and seek shelter. The enemy's attempts to break through the defense did not end there. The occupiers sent an additional motorcycle group and even a tank for reinforcements. However, even these forces successfully struck the Ukrainian defenders. As reported by ArmyInform, operators of the Phoenix 5 unit of the Kyiv assault brigade showed a series of blows on the enemy's hiding places.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/27/motoczykletnyj-bliczkryg-ne-vdavsya-zsu-vidbyly-ataku-rosiyan-na-kramatorskomu-napryamku/	2025-01-27T00:39:45-08:00

Sergei and his anti-aircraft gun: how a fighter turns hatred of the enemy into action	The story of the fighter was made public on the brigade's page. -Kobzariv's -wide field deer- have always been something sacred to me. I loved my job, but the feeling that our land is under threat became unbearable,- says the fighter. Despite his Azerbaijani surname, Serhiy grew up in independent Ukraine under the blue and yellow flag. His grandfather is from the Caucasus, but his father is Ukrainian, who raised him with love for his native land. -I don't understand those who are afraid to take up arms. I went to war not to die for Ukraine, but to kill its enemies,- Serhii shares frankly. During two years of service, Serhiy gained a lot of combat experience. His 23 mm anti-aircraft system successfully shot down enemy drones, including the Lancet and Zala, and worked on the positions of the occupiers. -When our work was recognized, it was very motivating. You understand that you are not just following orders, but actually changing the course of the war,- he says. Serhiy feels a deep hatred for the enemy, especially after Buchi, Mariupol and the attacks on peaceful cities. -Every day the occupiers give even more reasons to hate them. We want not just to stop this evil, but to pay back for all our losses,- says the soldier. Today Serhiy wears a sergeant's epaulettes and trains his brothers in a new infantry unit. -The boys are still a little skeptical about my drill, but I hope they will understand later: all this is to survive and return home. We must be able to use every minute on the training ground for training and training,- he is convinced. Despite the war, Serhiy dreams of the future of a free and peaceful Ukraine. He wants to start a family and raise children in a country where sirens will not be heard. His strength of spirit, love for the Motherland and responsibility for the future make him an example for everyone who fights for the freedom of Ukraine. -Our future is in our hands.

The hottest border in the north — Sumyshchyna is under attack by enemy drones and saboteurs	The spokesperson of the State Border Service told about this on the broadcast of the telethon -Edyny Novyny- Andriy Demchenko of Ukraine. According to Demchenko, the length of the border with a terrorist country allows the enemy to constantly look for new routes by which he launches his UAVs. But most of these routes pass through the Sumy region. As well as the ways of enemy sabotage and intelligence groups. -The enemy did not give up conducting sabotage activities on this stretch. Again, the enemy is most actively trying to enter our territory through the Sumy region. At the same time, the threat from enemy sabotage and reconnaissance groups does not disappear for Chernihiv Oblast and Kharkiv Oblast,- said the spokesperson of the State Border Service of Ukraine.

Weeds as an excuse for looting: the occupiers simplify the expropriation of land from residents of t...	This was reported by the head of the Luhansk Regional Military Administration, Artem Lysogor. According to the new rules, it will be enough for the inspectors to identify the so-called unused plot in order to start the process of its -nationalization-. At the same time, the criteria of -non-use- are extremely vague and create a wide field for abuse by the occupation authorities. According to the head of the Luhansk OVA, land can be lost even due to ordinary clutter or the presence of weeds over one meter high. -If the inspectors see an unused plot, they can issue a fine and start the procedure of its so-called nationalization. The land can be lost, for example, due to its littering with garbage and the presence of weeds over 1 m high,- the report says. In effect, this means that the occupying power receives practically unlimited powers to seize private property from the inhabitants of the occupied territories. Vague wording allows any plot to be interpreted as -unused-, creating a constant threat of property loss for the local population. This step is another example of violation of human rights and norms of international law by the occupying power. The simplified -nationalization- procedure is actually a legalized robbery under the guise of -fighting mismanagement.- The situation raises serious concerns about the fate of the residents of the occupied Luhansk Region, who are at risk of losing not only their homes, but also their land, which is often their only source of livelihood. It may also lead to an even greater humanitarian crisis in the territory, which is already suffering from the consequences of Russian aggression.

In Ukraine, a course was held on the training of specialists of escort services for military personn...	During the training, they told how to organize interaction and support of wounded servicemen during their treatment and rehabilitation. It was explained how family members of the deceased are accompanied when they apply for the benefits specified by the law. -The Ministry of Defense, together with the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, introduced the service of escorting servicemen. This service should become an institution that will help military personnel and their families to solve key issues related to receiving medical, psychological, legal and social assistance. The training project started in 10 combat brigades. Specialized training for the first group has already been conducted,- Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Brigadier General of Justice Serhii Melnyk noted. As volunteer Olena Sherzhukova, co-founder of Help Army, said, -the issue of training such specialists is extremely urgent. We prepared such a training program, the necessary lecturers and trainers and worked with existing teams, where there are really enthusiasts for this business, where there are people who are involved not by orders, but also by the call of the heart.- Colonel Oleksandr Kutkov, the head of the Central Security Service of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, noted that -conducting such courses is extremely necessary and important for the exchange of experience and the acquisition of opportunities by our support services, which will allow us to perform tasks as effectively as possible within the framework of social support and provide assistance to servicemen who are undergoing treatment, rehabilitation, and members of their families, including including the families of missing, captured, and deceased servicemen.- The officer added that during the training he talked with the present representatives from combat military units: -The course was very useful for them. We revealed the concept of general communication, general information within the framework of providing assistance to servicemen, how to improve interaction between escort services within the military unit and external service providers that are relevant to the organization of escorting our servicemen.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/27/v-ukrayini-provedeno-kurs-z-pidgotovky-fahivcziv-sluzhb-suprovodu-vijskovosluzhbovcziv-ta-chleniv-yihnih-simej/	2025-01-26T22:25:25-08:00
In Dnipro, as a result of the Russian attack, three high-rise buildings were damaged	informs the head of Dnipropetrovsk OVA Serhiy Lysak about this. -In the evening and during the night, units of the East Air Force destroyed 13 drones in the Dnipropetrovsk region. However, the enemy attack did not pass without consequences. Infrastructure is damaged in the Samarivsky district. There was a fire. Three private houses and an outbuilding were also damaged,- the report said. Three high-rise buildings were also damaged in Dnipro. One of them caught fire, but it was extinguished by rescuers. In addition, the occupiers hit Nikopol region with Grad anti-aircraft guns and heavy artillery. We kissed around the district center and the Marganets community. There is destruction on the territory of the industrial enterprise. As reported by ArmyInform, during the day, the occupiers inflicted 263 blows on in 11 settlements of the Zaporizhzhia region, as a result of which 18 reports were received about damage to private houses and apartments.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/27/u-dnipri-vnaslidok-rosijskoyi-ataky-pobyti-try-bagatopoverhivky/	2025-01-26T22:21:08-08:00
In the Pokrovsky direction, the occupiers intensified the use of armored vehicles	On January 25, the officer of the information and communication service 14 told about this on the ArmyTV stream on January 25. Maksym Bakulin of the operational assignment brigade named after Ivan Bohun -Red viburnum- of the National Guard. -Now in the Pokrovsky direction, there are constant battles, around the clock the enemy is trying to advance, using various tactics,- Maksym Bakulin noted. He paid special attention to the change in the approach of the occupiers to the use of manpower and equipment. If earlier the enemy relied more often on infantry, now there is a tendency to increase the use of heavy and all-terrain vehicles. -Their assaults became more frequent precisely with the help of technology. They use less manpower than before, and use more heavy and off-road vehicles,- the press officer emphasized. This information is important because, as the presenter noted, many speakers from other units in the Pokrovsky direction rarely reported a significant amount of enemy equipment. Maxim Bakulin explained this by the features of the terrain in his brigade's area of ​​responsibility: the presence of paths suitable for vehicles. -In the area of ​​responsibility of my brigade, in those settlements, it is currently possible to pass by vehicles, there is a lot of traffic. They began to bring personnel as close as possible. Earlier, they sent them more often on foot, now in most cases they bring them as close as possible, drop them off and try to fight under the cover of barrel artillery and volley fire systems,- the officer explained. Regarding the size of enemy vehicle columns, Maxim Bakulin clarified that these are usually small columns consisting of two tanks, such as T-72 and T-90, which lead the column, drop off personnel, shoot back and leave. However, as the officer noted, they do not always manage to withdraw completely, as the Ukrainian defenders put up a decent fightback, and some equipment remains on the battlefield. Thus, the situation in the Pokrovsky direction remains tense. The enemy is constantly looking for new ways to break through defenses, changing tactics and increasing the use of equipment. However, the Ukrainian military continues to courageously defend its positions, inflicting significant losses on the occupiers. As reported by ArmyInform, the occupying forces are trying to najgaryachishomu-napryamku/->bypass Pokrovsk from the west to cut important routes and force Ukrainian troops to retreat.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/27/na-pokrovskomu-napryamku-okupanty-aktyvizuvaly-vykorystannya-bronetehniky/	2025-01-26T22:16:59-08:00

What to expect from the enemy in 2025: an expert on Russia's capabilities in the Black Sea and Crime...	About the combat potential of the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation and enemy groups in the Crimea, the available combat capabilities of the enemy in the Azov-Black Sea region as of the beginning of 2025, military expert, retired captain 1st rank, candidate of military sciences, associate professor Stepan Yakymyak told ArmyInform in an interview . —How will the enemy operate at sea in 2025? Does it have sufficient capabilities to seize the initiative and change the nature of actions in maritime spaces to its advantage? What exactly can the enemy oppose to the strikes of the Defense Forces in the Black Sea and will its actions be successful? — The development of the situation in military operations at sea in 2025 will be influenced, first of all, by the consequences of the actions of the parties in the previous period, in particular in 2024. Considering the results of the previous year, it is important to emphasize that in 2024 the Defense Forces of Ukraine achieved a new large-scale success at sea. They forced the enemy to withdraw from the Crimea to the eastern part of the sea the entire combat composition of the surface and underwater forces of the Black Sea Fleet. But at the end of the year, Ukraine surprised the whole world with new unique military operations at sea. Let us briefly recall them. From December 6 to 7, the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, for the first time in world practice, carried out a combined attack with the simultaneous use of at least four different types of air and sea drones, one of which was an FPV-type UAV carrier, and destroyed enemy objects and manpower on gas production platforms near the coast of Crimea. From December 5 to 6, the Security Service of Ukraine, using unmanned surface vehicles equipped with large-caliber machine guns, damaged enemy helicopters in the Kerch Strait region during the battle, in which, in addition to helicopters, enemy aircraft and patrol boats also participated. On December 31, the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine destroyed two and damaged one enemy helicopter near Cape Tarkhankut, located on the western coast of Crimea, using missiles from unmanned surface vehicles for the first time in the world. With these robotic operations, the Defense Forces of Ukraine proved their superiority over the enemy and the possibility of destroying any of his forces deployed at sea. In fact, the enemy's capabilities remain very limited. Most likely, the enemy will not conduct active operations at sea in 2025. The exception will be strikes by sea-based Kalibr cruise missiles from coastal areas near Novorossiysk. He will also try to involve naval aviation and coastal missile forces in actions for the defense of Crimea and defend the areas of the base of forces against strikes from the sea and from the air. In the end, it should be emphasized that in 2025, the enemy will not be able to seize the initiative or at least somehow change the nature of actions at sea in their favor. — Not only recognized foreign experts, but also representatives of the military and political leadership of the leading countries of the world are talking about the successes achieved by Ukraine in the war at sea in 2022-2024 and the revolutionary innovations in military affairs demonstrated at the same time. In your opinion, do and how exactly can the already achieved results of military operations at sea affect the military-political situation around Ukraine in 2025 and the possibilities for a just end to the war? - Of course, changes in the situation at various strategic directions, or in other words, on different fronts, can worsen or improve the general the situation regarding the defense of the state in the war. Now we can clearly state that the successful actions of the Defense Forces of Ukraine at sea are a factor contributing to the state's defense capability and its support from our foreign partners. And it is not only about moral and psychological or image factors. First, the achieved advantage over the enemy at sea forces it to redistribute its own strategic defense resources, including financial, material, change priority and distribution along strategic directions. Secondly, in the military context, the loss of control over the maritime spaces around Crimea, in the Kerch Strait and near the Black Sea coast of the Krasnodar Territory of the Russian Federation necessitates the strengthening of comprehensive defense, primarily anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft, as well as counterintelligence, economic and other measures in these territories. At the same time, this is a diversion of significant resources from other areas of action. Thirdly, the successful actions of the Defense Forces at sea can lead to the complete isolation of the temporarily occupied Crimea from the sea, and the cutting of communications with the mainland - to its liberation and the Russian Federation losing its center of gravity in operations in southern Ukraine. In addition, some experts are inclined to believe that in the event of negotiations to end the war, Ukraine's superiority at sea could be an important counter-argument in the discussion on territorial control. Similar to the situation regarding the control over the territories in the Kursk Oblast of the Russian Federation, the control by the Defense Forces of Ukraine of the maritime spaces within the territorial sea of ​​both Ukraine and the Russian Federation and their exclusive (maritime) economic zones in the Black Sea is, of course, a factor that strengthens the position of Ukraine . Summing up, it can be confidently asserted that Ukraine's successes in operations at sea are an important component of the future victory over the enemy in war. After all, the Russians have practically nothing to oppose the Defense Forces of Ukraine in a war at sea. - What capabilities do the adversary have from performing the tasks listed above in military operations at sea? - First of all, let's consider the adversary's strike capabilities at sea. The conducted analysis testifies to a 25% reduction in the ability to strike sea-based cruise missiles with a range of up to 1,500 km against ground targets. As it is known, this happened as a result of the destruction of two small missile ships -Zyklon- and -Askold-, as well as significant damage to the large submarine -Rostov-on-Don-. There was also a decrease in the striking capabilities of surface ships with anti-ship missile damage by 38%. This was facilitated by the destruction of a missile cruiser and a missile boat. At the same time, there was no reduction in the strike capabilities of the enemy's coastal missile forces, which include two coastal missile brigades located in Crimea and near Novorossiysk, which are capable of simultaneously launching 112 anti-ship missiles. Of these, 48 missiles have a firing range of 800 km and 64 missiles have a firing range of 260 km. Also, the enemy has almost completely preserved the strike capabilities of naval aviation. However, it should be emphasized that due to the current lack of large warships in the Black Sea fleet of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, the enemy's ability to strike with anti-ship missiles by the forces of missile ships and coastal missile units remains unused and does not affect the course and results of actions on the sea - And how do you assess the enemy's naval amphibious capabilities, especially taking into account that they can be used for enemy sea transport? - Analysis of the enemy's naval amphibious capabilities shows critical losses in amphibious ships and boats and the enemy's loss of the ability to landings of operational and tactical marine landings. Based on the real conditions that have developed as a result of the successful strikes of the Defense Forces of Ukraine at sea, it can be argued that the Russians do not have the opportunity to conduct any naval amphibious operations and significant sea transportation. To be specific, according to the results of actions at sea, as of now, the enemy's naval amphibious capabilities are characterized by a decrease in the number of amphibious ships and boats - by 61%. 7 units were destroyed, including 4 large amphibious ships, 3 amphibious boats. In addition, 3 large amphibious ships were significantly damaged and are currently undergoing long-term repairs. The combined capacity to transport landing troops decreased by more than 54%. It is important to emphasize the significant reduction of the enemy's ability to prepare and use the marines as an advanced detachment of marine landing forces intended to capture the landing bridgehead. After all, it is known that as a result of the constant involvement of the 810th Marine Infantry Brigade of the Russian Federation in the capacity of mechanized units in the composition of ground groups of troops and significant losses in the personnel of the brigade, in particular in Kurshchyna, this unit is not suitable for operations as intended. In general, as a result of the strikes of the Defense Forces of Ukraine against the enemy's shock and naval landing forces, the loss of combat capability of four main units of the Russian Armed Forces was achieved. Added to this were losses due to the closure of the Bosphorus to warships with the start of a full-scale military invasion. Because of this, as is known, only one frigate, one small missile ship and two large submarines remained from the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation in the Mediterranean Sea. Thus, in total, 30 divisions of surface ships, 41 brigades of missile ships and boats, 4 brigades of submarines, 197 brigades of amphibious ships lost at least 30% of their combat personnel. In addition, and this is very important, the enemy suffered losses in special, supply and management capabilities. After all, they directly or indirectly affect the results of the use of forces at sea! - Can you give some detail about which additional capabilities of the enemy in sea operations were reduced in the previous period? - In the course of military operations at sea, in particular in 2022, the enemy actively engaged in sabotage and reconnaissance activities. Using Snake Island and gas production platforms as advanced minibases, the enemy made almost daily attempts to land sabotage and reconnaissance groups on the Ukrainian coast. It is natural that in the subsequent actions of the Defense Forces of Ukraine, efforts were focused on the fight against these units and the special capabilities of the enemy were reduced. Thus, as a result of the strikes, a significant number of personnel of special units and more than 10 special purpose boats were destroyed, including the boats of projects: 03160 of the -Raptor- type, 21980 of the -Grachenok- type, 12150 of the -Mongoose- type, 02800 of the -Tavr- type, KS -701 of the -Tuna- type. - How do you assess the enemy's logistical and management capabilities in the Black Sea? Kerch Strait. As a result of these strikes, the transportation of personnel and material, including heavy military equipment, was restricted for a long time by the road and rail parts of the bridge, and the operation of the ferry crossing was suspended due to the damage to two ferries, one of which sank. Attention should also be paid to the use of the Crimean Peninsula as a logistics hub, i.e. a set of logistics hubs and centers, for the comprehensive support of Russian military groups (forces) in the Black Sea region, in particular those based in Crimea. Also, this logistics ensures the actions of enemy troops in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. So influencing her is essential. At the same time, it can be asserted that as a result of the strikes of the Defense Forces of Ukraine on the missile cruiser -Moskva-, the command post of the Russian Armed Forces in the village of Verkhnyosadove and the headquarters of the Russian Armed Forces in Sevastopol, other important facilities in Crimea significantly reduced the ability to control enemy forces at sea and in Crimea. After all, at least three main control points of the operational link were destroyed or damaged, and the control points of the Sevastopol and Crimean naval bases are probably not in use due to the withdrawal of forces to Novorossiysk. Losses in trained management personnel should also be taken into account. After all, in the course of destroying and damaging control points of the operational-strategic and operational levels, the enemy suffered certain losses in the operative composition of these control points. Any replacements in the leadership of the fleet also have a negative impact, which has also happened several times with the command of the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation! —Recently, we have been observing systematic strikes by missile weapons and strike drones on targets in Crimea and the Krasnodar Territory of the Russian Federation. Could you share your assessment of the capabilities of the enemy's military groups operating in the Crimea? - Of course, in order to provide a more complete assessment of the enemy's capabilities for operations at sea and from the sea, its capabilities to defend the Crimean peninsula should be taken into account. After the occupation of Crimea in 2014, the Russian Federation formed the 126th Coastal Defense Brigade as part of the Russian Armed Forces, and later the 32nd Army Corps. Also, a number of units of the Russian Guard, other security agencies of the Russian Federation and types of armed forces were deployed in Crimea. It is clear that an echeloned system of enemy defense has been created in both areas that connect Crimea with the southern regions of Ukraine (Perekop and Chongar) with the aim of preventing the breakthrough of Ukrainian army groups to Crimea. In addition to what we often see in the photos in the Telegram channels, elements of the anti-aircraft defense system of the peninsula have been created in the amphibious areas on the coast of Crimea, designated beach areas and other areas. However, in my opinion, conducted in 2022-2024 Sea raids by the special operations forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and units of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine in several areas of the Crimean Peninsula have shown the presence of weak points in the defense system of Crimea created by the enemy. These facts are also confirmed by the actions of the resistance forces in the temporarily occupied territory of Crimea in conducting reconnaissance, exposing the enemy's facilities and the actions of his forces (troops). It should also be emphasized the constant reduction in the capabilities of air defense forces, which are engaged by the enemy to protect the Air Force, other forces and troops, important facilities in Crimea, as a result of systematic strikes by the Defense Forces of Ukraine. Although the military leadership of the Russian Federation regularly conducts measures to restore the air defense system of Crimea, the number of sets of forces and air defense vehicles detached from other directions will probably decrease with each subsequent time. Summing up this brief analysis of the enemy's capabilities to defend Crimea, it should be noted that this direction is most likely one of the key priorities of the Russian leadership in the war against Ukraine and the implementation of its own expansionist neo-imperial policy in the Mediterranean region. — What do you think are the possible directions for strengthening the enemy's capabilities in the Black Sea? How realistic are his plans for the creation and use of marine unmanned surface and underwater complexes? Can the capabilities of the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation be increased at the expense of forces from outside the Black Sea? — It is clear that the enemy is trying to draw conclusions from failures in combat operations at sea, learn and take into account lessons from the experience gained. After the defeat by the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine of enemy units on gas production platforms near the coast of Crimea with the use of aircraft carrier unmanned surface complexes in December 2024, the enemy, I hope, begins to understand new threats and the scale of future losses. Attacking by unmanned units of the SBU and GUR of the enemy's aircraft over the sea nullifies its superiority over the sea and opens access for these forces to the enemy's facilities in the coastal zone and on the coast. At the same time, with what own successes and achievements can the enemy react to this? There is no clear answer. Currently, the successes declared by him in the creation of marine unmanned surface and underwater complexes are not visible in concrete tests or the application of such equipment in combat operations at sea. Renewal of the enemy's strike capabilities at sea is delayed indefinitely. Moreover, the enemy tends to hide its newly built ships from the strikes of the Defense Forces of Ukraine, as happened with the small Tucha missile ship, which was being completed on the Black Sea, but was accepted into the Black Sea Fleet as far as Caspiansk, which is located in the Caspian Sea. Can the enemy strengthen its strikes from the sea by using forces from outside the Black Sea? Currently, this possibility is assessed as not feasible. The fact is that when some media outlets, as breaking news, report the number of missile-carrying ships in the Mediterranean, it is surprising, to put it mildly. After all, everyone knows that according to the Montreux Convention, no military ship of the Russian Federation, as well as of Ukraine, can be transported from the Mediterranean Sea to the Black Sea under the current conditions. In addition, such a ship cannot use its missile weapons, because it must obtain permission to use aircraft in Turkey, Greece, Bulgaria and Romania. Flea over other states is also unrealistic due to a significant increase in the rocket. That is, from the Mediterranean rocket strikes of the Russian Federation in Ukraine are impossible. If you adhere to another logic, it is also necessary to provide Ukrainian society as daily -hot- new information about Muscovite Krakhetnos ships, for example, in the Baltic Sea. Regarding the possibility of involvement in rocket strokes of Krakhetnosi ships from the Caspian Fleet of the Russian Federation from certain areas of the Caspian Sea, it should be noted that this is unlikely. It should be borne in mind that the missile of the Caliber complex at normal equipment insufficient capacity for firing range. It is known that their maximum range - up to 1500 km, and the distance in the straight line to Odessa is 1500 km, to Kiev - 1600 km, to Lviv, Rivne, Uzhgorod - more than 2000 km. For comparison - in the present conditions, the Muscovites strike the caliber missiles from the Novorossiysk district, from what distance to Ukrainian cities are: to Odessa - about 650 km, to Kiev - 800, to Lviv, Rivne, Uzhgorod - 1200. Thus. , to attract Caspian Fleet Ships, they need to be carried out Volgodonian channel to Azov and then to the Black Sea. With this Muscovites, as we have mentioned above, they do not rush. Summarizing, it can be predicted that there is no significant strengthening of any capacity of the Russian Federation to conduct actions on the Black Sea. Ukraine confidently prevails at sea. First of all, this will certainly happen due to the constant increase of efforts of Ukraine's defense forces, their intellectual and technological advantage over the enemy. The strikes, which took place recently, in January 2025, at the military and logistics centers in the depths of the territory of Russia and on the coast of the Krasnodar Territory, in particular on the objects of marine oil and gas infrastructure, give confidence in the success of Ukraine in the fight against the aggressor.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/27/chogo-ochikuvaty-vid-voroga-u-2025-roczi-ekspert-pro-spromozhnosti-rf-u-chornomu-mori-ta-v-krymu/	2025-01-26T20:50:28-08:00
No longer -limitedly suitable-: how to pass VLK in one day	This is required by the Law of Ukraine dated March 21, 2024 No. 3621-IX -On amendments to some laws of Ukraine on ensuring the rights of servicemen and police officers to social protection-. The demand of the Law is not a caprice: I will go, and I will not. Failure to comply with the rule on timely passing of the VLK is a violation of the rules of military accounting, defense legislation, mobilization training and mobilization, for which a fine in the amount of 17,000 to 25,500 UAH can be imposed. Although the Ministry of Defense assures that if a person with the status of -Limited Suitability- does not undergo a re-examination by February 5, the electronic military registration document in Reserve+ will remain unchanged, it is still not worth taking a risk - it is better to comply with the requirements of the Law and protect yourself from fines. I want to tell you about my personal experience of passing the VLC in January 2025 in one of the district TCCs and joint ventures in the city of Kyiv. Therefore, the observations and advice made cannot in any case be extrapolated to all recruitment and social support centers in Ukraine. It is possible to appear at the TCC and SP to pass the VLK in order to determine suitability for military service as -limited suitability- in the morning any day - there is still time. A summons is not required for this. It is not necessary, but it is better to be registered for this day in the electronic queue. In the TCC, you will receive a referral for a medical examination, a bypass letter and an algorithm for further actions. If the VLK works simply in the building of the TCC and SP, as in my case, then conscripts who have all the necessary up-to-date medical reports on their illnesses can pass the commission in one day. But when you go to the TCC, it is better not to plan anything else for that day, because the process can be unexpectedly long, and you will not be able to leave the premises until the necessary procedures are completed. However, the VLK can work in a separate room or in general in one of the civil hospitals. Enrollment on the VLK in civil medical institutions is done through the medical application. You can go to the required page of this application using the QR code that will be provided by TCC and SP. Then the process due to objective reasons (signing up and arriving at the medical facility) will take more time. Currently, the Ministry of Defense is implementing the VLK reform and soon it should be possible to send a request for a VLK referral through the Reserve+ mobile application, receive a notification with details and go to the health care facility specified in the referral without the need to visit the TCC. If you have illnesses due to which at one time you were recognized as -limited fitness for military service- or -unfit for military service in peacetime, limited fitness in wartime-, then you should not appear at the VLK without any medical documents at all . It is necessary to have at least some statement with a diagnosis. A recent one is better. If the medical conclusions were made a long time ago (during the previous VLC examination or before), you will most likely be sent for an examination to a specialized specialist with an electronic referral and a summons to continue the VLC examination in a few days. An additional examination should update data on your health status. And this is where the real quest begins, because electronic appointment to doctors in public hospitals is a lottery. And the examination may include the need to visit several specialists or do tests. Queues for some specialists are filled a month in advance and are already here - as luck would have it. Perhaps, in order not to wait, you will have to go to a paid appointment. I was lucky enough to make an appointment with an electronic referral to a state institution outside the waiting list due to the fact that I constantly consult a doctor and had a summons from the TCC in my hands. In general, a summons to undergo a VLC is a strong argument for any civilian hospital, because military personnel and mobilized people are served there outside the queue (even during a VLC) and it can really help to speed up additional examination. But, unfortunately, it does not always work, so it is not worth waiting for reception outside the queue everywhere. When the doctor's conclusion about your current state of health is in your hands, you can go again to the VLK doctor who referred you for additional examination. It is he who will record the diagnosis, according to which the head of the VLK will determine the degree of suitability for military service. In the end, the whole process with additional examinations took me 10 days. For comparison, when I passed the VLK 2021, it lasted almost 1.5 months. So, the progress is obvious. There is no longer a definition of -restricted fit- in the Conscription and Military Service Act. Currently, in the majority of cases, regarding persons with serious illnesses, resolutions -fit for service in military support units, TCC and SP, VVNIZ, educational centers, institutions (institutions), medical units, units of logistics, communication, operational support, security- (at least this is the conclusion suggested after conversations in the queue of several dozen conscripts who went through the VLK together with me, both the first and second day). After all, this is exactly the work of the VLK: to find out and record the medically established facts, on the basis of which to make a conclusion about fitness and make the appropriate decision.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/27/vzhe-ne-obmezheno-prydatnyj-yak-projty-vlk-za-odyn-den/	2025-01-26T20:40:42-08:00
From -Google, help!- to a mine-explosive training instructor: about the symbol of faith of a princip...	The fighter told ArmyInform about what his personal symbol of faith and inviolable principles are. Evgeny received his nickname -Monk- because of his beard and the calm demeanor of a prudent, responsible and confident man in his words and actions. — It was a bit funny such a situation. When our brigade was formed, a boy with such a big beard, who was nicknamed -Chaplain-, served with me. I have a smaller beard, so they started calling me -Batyushka-. I then said that I would not aspire to a high rank and would be a modest -Monk,- Yevgeny says. The warrior says that he likes to be alone to collect his thoughts. In his spare time, he often reads the Bible, which he always keeps with him. — During the formation of the brigade, there were guys from different regions, it was necessary to somehow remember each other, that's how it caught on — first as a joke, and then seriously, — he explains. In civilian life, Yevgeny was an industrial climber, he worked at high altitudes for many years, so he had good physical training. During the formation of the brigade in March 2022, -Monakh- was assigned to the intelligence company. — We thought we would get into the regular part, but our part was formed from the reserve. All from scratch, all mobilized. The officers are young guys who have not yet finished their studies. And so we passed the formation in less than a month and entered the combat zone in the Severodonetsk region, says the soldier. The experience of military service came in handy for Yevgeny, however, the man emphasizes, the level of training then was not too high and clearly insufficient for a major war. — It was 2004, there was such devastation in the army&#8230; Then I got into -Desna-, an educational center. Then he served in Bakhmut - then it was still called Artemivsk. They shot a little, threw grenades, but that was not enough, even if you were taught to shoot with aim - you need to learn tactics, train, - the -Monk- is convinced. — The enemy was more ready for war. And at first it was difficult for me, because when you are engaged in your profession all your life, you have invested a certain period of years in one thing, and here you have to fight, you have to defend yourself, you have to kill - it was difficult for a civilian, Yevgeny says. In the -Monk- reconnaissance group, he was a machine gunner, he worked with the RPK - a Kalashnikov manual machine gun. Later, he mastered the Swedish AT4 grenade launcher. Yevhen also has a funny story related to this, because in order to master a new weapon, he had to search for instructions with the help of Google. - RPK is the same Kalashnikov assault rifle, only bigger, so there were no problems with it. But NATO weapons were mastered with the help of the Internet. We even had such a joke in the section: -Google, help!-. -We went on the Internet and looked for videos on YouTube that explained the basics of using weapons,- recalls the -Monk-. The military characterizes the Swedish AT4 grenade launcher as a very high-quality and effective weapon, significantly better than Soviet hand grenade launchers. Although I had to work with the RPG-18 Mukha and RPG-22 Netto, which performed quite well. -Monk- and his brothers mastered the new weapon extremely carefully, because they understood that the performance of the combat mission and their own lives depended on it. Went to the headquarters, asked to connect them to the Starlink signal in order to be able to watch the necessary videos. - Tried to be very serious about it - practiced, practiced, practiced all the time. Because our lives and our combat mission depended on it. If you are killed or wounded, you will no longer be able to complete the task that the command set for you. And I was in the reconnaissance of our brigade, and we had difficult tasks, - says -Monk-. It was often necessary to work on identifying the positions of enemy artillery with the purpose of counter-battery combat. At that time, scouts went into the so-called -gray zone- and calculated where the enemy was firing artillery or mortar fire. — You may not shoot a single cartridge in a week, but bring a lot of useful information. The same -counter-battery-: you sit in a shelter and, with the help of a tablet and a compass, calculate the sound of enemy artillery or mortars. Then you give the coordinates and our artillery works according to them. Then the infantry is easier. And the infantry always have the hardest time - they need to be helped first of all, Evgeny is convinced. While resting and recuperating between rotations, Monks and their brothers were always studying. Together with his comrades, he thoroughly mastered engineering - first at courses organized by volunteers in Kharkiv, and later with the receipt of an official certificate in Kamianets-Podilskyi. - In Kharkiv, they taught the basics - how to detect a mine and understand what kind of mine it is and what damage it can cause. What can be done with it to neutralize it and what can not be done in any case. I learned all the theory on these courses, and the practice was good on the educational materials, Yevgeny recalls with gratitude. The training in Kharkiv lasted three weeks, but since the courses were voluntary, it was not possible to get an official certificate of advanced training and mastery of the new VOS. Therefore, later -Monakh- continued his studies in Kamianets-Podilskyi, where the courses lasted for a month and a half. — I really liked Kamianets-Podilskyi - very qualified, serious teachers. The material base they have for training is excellent - I am very satisfied. The program is very full for 45 days, but you cannot allocate more time during the war, says Yevhen about training in mine and explosives. Thanks to previous training in Kharkiv, it was easier for Monk to acquire knowledge than for guys from other brigades who did not have such experience. However, under the guidance of experienced specialists, they also successfully coped with the training and received the relevant certificates. — It was scary at first, but under the supervision of teachers, all this was done calmly. And when you have made the first or second blow, you somehow calm down, you become confident in your actions. You can, when you know how, it's already a favorite job, -Monk- smiles. After the second serious injury, the soldier was transferred to a group of instructors due to his health, so now he imparts knowledge to less experienced comrades. The military is convinced that teaching well and learning well is necessary for everyone who wants to survive on the battlefield, successfully complete a combat mission and win. — When you teach people, it is a big responsibility. If you neglected a person, behaved carelessly, then he may die. What if suddenly the very training exercise you failed to teach cost a soldier his life? Therefore, we try to give 100%, to the maximum. Other people's lives also depend on us, Yevhen emphasizes. A serious wound in the hand does not allow the soldier to work at full strength, but he is glad that he was not discharged and was allowed to pass on knowledge and skills to his comrades. - I can show you how to neutralize the stretcher placed by the enemy. Explain how to work with it so that it does not explode. I have enough strength for this. I believe that I can still serve the brigade, bring benefit, contribute to our victory, which we are very much looking forward to, says the soldier. In the time since Evgeny became an instructor about a year ago, he has already trained hundreds of fighters. He remembers everyone and tries to help them even after graduation. — Here we always do everything to ensure that a person remains alive, does not get injured and completes a combat mission. We try to work so that the students know everything no worse than the teachers and even surpass us, - smiles Yevhen. This is what the -Monk- creed is all about - learning yourself and teaching others to survive on the battlefield and win. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/27/vid-google-dopomozhy-do-instruktora-z-minno-vybuhovoyi-pidgotovky-pro-symvol-viry-prynczypovogo-monaha/	2025-01-26T20:29:21-08:00
- Escape of a female sniper to Europe-: a fairy tale of the Russian Federation for an audience in sl...	So, according to the script of the Kremlin directors, the -sniper from Ukraine- after several years of service realized that the -Ukrainian army is doomed-, took off her camouflage and disappeared somewhere in cozy Europe. Up to this point, the story sounds more or less familiar for Russian fakes: no names, evidence or photos - just fantasy and loud headlines. And now some facts. Firstly, none of the Ukrainian snipers confirmed the existence of such a situation. The Armed Forces is not a chaotic gathering of random people, but a professional army where every soldier is part of a single system. Of course, there are occasional losses or transfers to another service, but there is nowhere near a mass exodus. Secondly, if someone actually decided to leave the service, it is unlikely that he would choose the high-profile route with -dramatic statements-. This looks like an attempt to give his fiction a dramatic color for the Russian audience. Ukrainian snipers are the elite of the army. They are not just trained, but are formed into real professionals for whom service is not just a job, but a vocation. The stories we see every day only confirm: even in the most difficult conditions, they remain true to their oath. So, the idea that one of the snipers suddenly -freaked out- looks, to put it mildly, unrealistic. As always, this fake is aimed at two types of audience. Let's imagine what the -escape- of this mythical female sniper looks like. Does she take off her uniform, pick up a guitar and go on a European tour with songs about lost home? Or does she record a video message on Tik Tok, where she tells how she is -disappointed- in her own country? I wonder why everything is always so dramatic in Russian fiction? With the same success, one could invent that all Ukrainian snipers took a vacation at the same time to go shopping in Istanbul. Because it is probably as realistic as their escape. The reality is that the Armed Forces continue to hold the front. There is no collapse or panic. On the contrary, the Ukrainian army is becoming stronger thanks to the support of its partners and the resilience of its own people. While Russian propaganda creates myths about fictional -desertive snipers-, real Ukrainian soldiers continue to defend their land. And no fake will change that fact.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/27/vtecha-snajperky-do-yevropy-kazka-rf-dlya-audytoriyi-v-tapochkah/	2025-01-26T20:05:19-08:00
The President of Ukraine introduced the new Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of...	He informed about this during an evening address to the citizens of Ukraine. -Today I want to celebrate the heroic actions of our soldiers in different areas. I especially thank the 95th separate brigade for the efficiency in Kurshchyna, the 25th separate airborne and the 68th separate hunting brigades for the successes in the Pokrovsky direction. Special thanks to the soldiers of the 24th and 100th separate mechanized brigades for their heroism in the battles for Chasiv Yar and Toretsk,- the President noted. Significant personnel changes took place in the command. Major General Andriy Hnatov was appointed Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Its main task is to improve the quality of training of operational staffs and to establish better interaction between command structures and the front. The president also thanked Ukrainian developers and manufacturers of long-range drones and missiles, which effectively reduce Russia's military potential. -Our weapons bring results: unrest in Russia, falling oil prices, limiting the enemy's capabilities - all this brings peace closer,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy emphasized. According to him, the year 2025 should be decisive in the struggle for Ukraine's independence. As reported by ArmiyaInform, the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy decided to strengthen the command staff at the hottest areas of the front in the Donetsk region. Major General Mykhailo Drapaty was appointed head of operational- of the Khortytsia strategic group of troops.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/26/prezydent-ukrayiny-predstavyv-novogo-zastupnyka-nachalnyka-genshtabu-zsu/	2025-01-26T11:48:39-08:00
Key appointment in the East: Mykhailo Drapaty will head OSUV -Khortytsia-	He informed about this during an evening address to the citizens of Ukraine. Major General Mykhailo Drapaty was appointed the head of the Khortytsia operational-strategic group of troops. This group operates in the areas where the fiercest fighting is going on. The head of state also noted that Mykhailo Drapaty will retain the post of commander of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which is the largest component of the army. The combination of these two roles will contribute to the coordination of combat missions with the proper training of brigades. The president added that it is the needs of the front that will determine the standards of staffing and training of military units.

OSUV - Khortytsia - explained the change in tactics of the Soviet Union in the Pokrovsky direction	On Sunday, January 26, told on the broadcast of the telethon, the spokesperson promptly- Major Viktor Tregubov of the strategic group of troops -Khortytsia-. -They don't have an unlimited number of personnel, which they used to throw at the city in wave after wave, until it began to cling to some suburbs, then enter the city, then destroy buildings closer to the center, and so on. They have already used this tactic on Pokrovsk. And this indicates that they simply do not have the people to use such tactics,- he said, commenting on the situation in this direction. According to the speaker of the -Khortytsia- OSUV, all this was the result of Ukrainian efforts to contain the enemy. -The goal of the Ukrainian troops is to slow down and destroy the Russian troops. To knock down the moment that allows them to advance now. It is partly successful, and we can see it on the example of Pokrovsk, where the Russians do not go forward, as they used to go straight to all the cities, but try to cover it,- Viktor Tregubov noted. As reported by ArmiyaInform, previously OSUV -Khortytsia- hortyczya/->denied rumors about the alleged encirclement of Ukrainian troops in Velika Novosilka.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/26/v-osuv-hortyczya-poyasnyly-zminu-taktyky-zs-rf-na-pokrovskomu-napryamku/	2025-01-26T10:53:23-08:00
No wonder the city was bombed, but water was brought: weekdays in occupied Popasnaya	About reports Center of National Resistance. It is noted that the occupation -administration- announced its intention to organize a -regular- delivery of drinking water to the destroyed city of Popasna. Popasna, which was virtually wiped off the face of the earth by Russian troops, still has no public utilities, and promises of water supply remain unfulfilled. In the town, where about 250 people now live, water used to be delivered only periodically in bottled form. As before, the pickup schedule and water quality are not reported. According to the occupiers, water delivery is carried out together with Russian -volunteers- and the so-called -municipal district administration- of the city of Sokologhirsk, to which the remnants of Popasnaya were formally annexed. However, even these plans do not address key humanitarian issues such as the lack of electricity, communications and other basic living conditions. A similar situation is observed in other occupied settlements of Luhansk Region. For example, residents of Novopskov and Bilovodsk have been waiting for the promised Internet connection for more than a year. The Center of National Resistance emphasizes that the occupiers are not able to provide even the minimum needs of the population. Only the de-occupation of the territories can put an end to the humanitarian catastrophe that has been going on for years. As reported by ArmyInform, locals are leaving, migrants are coming: Kremlin is changing the face of occupied communities.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/26/darma-shho-misto-rozbomblene-zate-vodu-pryvezly-budni-okupovanoyi-popasnoyi/	2025-01-26T10:31:20-08:00
The defense forces destroyed warehouses with UAVs of the Russians in the Oryol region	This was reported by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on Sunday, January 26. -The concrete structures where the thermobaric warheads used for drones were stored were hit. There is information about a strong secondary detonation,- the message reads. As noted, it is already known about the destruction of about two hundred enemy kamikaze drones. -The results and extent of damage are being clarified, but it is known in advance that more than 200 -shaheeds- will no longer be used against our country. Combat work on important objects involved in the destruction of the civilian infrastructure of Ukraine and the terror of the civilian population will continue,- the General Staff of the Armed Forces emphasized.

At the same time, Viktor Tregubov noted that the situation in Velyka Novosilka is currently quite dynamic and the battles for it continue. He also added that the Ukrainian military is still present there and continues to destroy the Russians and their equipment. -I can't clarify where exactly they are and where the Russians are trying to maneuver, simply because it would jeopardize the operation itself,- explained the speaker of the Khortytsia OSU. As reported by ArmyInform, earlier in the 110th separate mechanized brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, they announced that after entering Velika Novosilka, the Russian occupiers got there in -fire bag-.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/26/okupantam-ne-vdalosya-otochyty-ukrayinski-vijska-u-velykij-novosilczi-osuv-hortyczya/	2025-01-26T09:51:54-08:00

Because they didn't sign the contract. They are mobilized. Tears and swords. There is nothing at all. You also know what happens in hospitals,- one of the Russians whines about this. In turn, his interlocutor, in response to this, notes that the same fate, most likely, awaits him.

In particular, there were clashes between assault groups of the occupation army and fighters of a separate brigade of territorial defense, border guards and hunters,- the message states. According to the -Khortytsia- OSUV, the losses of the enemy during the unsuccessful assault amounted to several dozen people.

A video with another such case was published in their Telegram channel by fighters of the -KHYZHAK- brigade at Department of patrol police. It shows that after being dropped from the Ukrainian drone, the occupant, who was still alive, decided not to wait for what would happen next, but immediately shortened his life by using his own grenade. -I will break for Rus'. Predators carried out a drop near an enemy infantryman, after which the injuries received forced the occupier to detonate a grenade under him. Probably, this is the first (and last) right decision in his life,- the patrolmen said, commenting on the Russian's choice. As reported ArmyInform, the DPSU told the story of a soldier who during the battle with the occupiers received wounded in the head, but continued his service.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/26/za-rus-vzirvus-dron-patrulnoyi-policziyi-sponukav-okupanta-vkorotyty-sobi-viku/	2025-01-26T08:20:03-08:00
- I was considered 200-th. A flamethrower of the Armed Forces spent the day in a trench with the Rus...	He told his extraordinary story to the journalists of Suspilny. According to the fighter, who is currently serving in the 704th regiment of radiation, chemical and biological protection, everything happened last year, during a combat mission in the village of Robotyne, Zaporizhzhia region, when his commander was seriously wounded. -He immediately told me to take responsibility, then lead the group. He told the boys to retreat in twos, because this was their first battle. I thought that they should retreat, and I would stay with him and help,- the fighter recalls. However, when he was helping the wounded commander, the Russians threw a grenade at them, as a result of which he died. -I still managed to go in and clear the hole, climb in and be there. I thought I would stay until the shelling was over. Fortunately, Muscovites did not see that I was there, because later, as it turned out from our drone footage, it was clear that I died there together with my brother, I was considered the 200th. I woke up somewhere at 6 in the morning&#8230; I didn't know what to do, whether to go out or not, I had already come to terms with the fact that I had died,- Vasyl admits. Suddenly he heard the voice of one of the Russians nearby. -Falled next to me, got up, limped. I see that he has a red bandage on his leg, I think, well, that's it, they arrived. I take out a grenade, I think, if anything, I will blow it up.- Here he says: -Who are you?- I say: -My-. I don't know how the head generated it. He: -Move, I'll come to you, after the injury, after the assault in Robotyn.- They got nuts there. I say: -No, go further, there is one of our people further away, go to him, there is still a place.- And he left,- says the Ukrainian defender. However, later the occupier did return, so Vasyl had to continue pretending to be a -Russian-. In the end, he left his shelter, telling an enemy soldier that he was going to get water, and when he met four more invaders, who also did not realize that he was Ukrainian, the fighter decided to find a new shelter. -I was sitting under a metal sheet, I was dying of a drone, because I didn't know at that time whose drone it was. The soldier got on the drone, I see the drone flashing, giving a signal. I did not understand anything, my head hurt so much. Probably recognized.

The occupiers on boats in the fog: our military explained why the occupiers are trying to force Oski...	Ruslan Piddubny, the commander of the battalion of unmanned systems -Antares- of the 4th brigade of NSU -Rubizh-, announced this on the air of the telethon. According to him, due to the fact that the river has not frozen, the occupiers cannot carry out a full-scale forcing using, for example, heavy equipment. Instead, they use small watercraft at night, or in foggy weather, to move in small groups of 5-8 people. After crossing, these groups try to hide in the forest plantations, waiting for reinforcements. -If they are not detected in advance, this reinforcement will number up to 20 people. And the first group to advance already knows our weaknesses. Therefore, it is even easier for subsequent groups to advance. In principle, the enemy's advance across the Oskil River took place in foggy weather,- said Ruslan Piddubny. This advance is not significant, says the commander of the Antares unmanned systems battalion. In addition, it is a very difficult area to arrange logistics. -If you take our experience, when we held a bridgehead in Makiivka, Luhansk region, it was very difficult for the enemy to cross the river there. Therefore, the bridgehead wedged into the defense. The enemy could not advance further. And in the few places where he was able to advance, he was unable to provide logistics. And was forced to retreat. Accordingly, using the terrain, we can stop such advances in advance,- added Ruslan Piddubny. As reported by ArmyInform, since the beginning of the day, the total number of combat clashes along the entire front line increased to 99.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/26/okupanty-na-chovnah-v-tumani-nashi-vijskovi-poyasnyly-chomu-okupanty-namagayutsya-forsuvaty-oskil-unochi/	2025-01-26T07:08:53-08:00

Locals are leaving, migrants are coming: the Kremlin is changing the face of occupied communities	About informs Center of National Resistance. Local residents continue to refuse to work for the occupation administrations or leave the cities where terrorists brought the -Russian measure- in the form of destroyed communities and death. In 2024 alone, almost 12,000 foreign citizens and stateless persons were placed on the migration register in the occupied Luhansk region. For comparison: at the end of 2023, there were approximately 3,800 such persons. In addition, according to the Eastern Human Rights Group, in 11 months of 2024, 109 applications for invitations to enter the Russian Federation were accepted, 101 visas of various categories were issued and extended, and also satisfied 516 applications for obtaining a residence permit. However, even such actions do not solve the region's key problems, such as distrust of the occupation authorities, lack of infrastructure, and the personnel crisis. In fact, knowing that the local population will continue to resist, the occupiers are carrying out ethnic replacement in the region. Instead of Ukrainians who leave or are deported by the Russian Federation, terrorists bring migrants from Central Asian countries or Russians from depressed regions of the Russian Federation. As reported by ArmyInform, the occupiers in Siverskodonetsk require residents to empty their apartments of furniture during repair works, which are carried out on a forced basis.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/26/misczevi-vyyizhdzhayut-migranty-pryyizhdzhayut-kreml-zminyuye-oblychchya-okupovanyh-gromad/	2025-01-26T06:12:02-08:00

In general, the situation in the Chasiv Yaru region is difficult, says a representative of the 24th separate mechanized brigade. The enemy conducts assaults every day. For the most part, uses tactics of small groups, when a small number of people try to penetrate into the rear of our positions. At the same time, it bears great losses. -This week it was possible to capture several Russians from the 98th Airborne Division. They came very close to our positions,- Andrii Polukhin said.

-Sniper rifle- with weak armor? We talk with the crew about how the Leopard 1A5 performed in combat	Already in the early autumn of the same year, their saw ArmyInform, and later Army TV showed how 44 OMBr fires at these vehicles. A year after that, we visited the 44th Separate Mechanized Brigade and asked the Leopard 1A5 tank crew about how the machine performed on the battlefield. The guys, in particular, responded to common criticisms about weak armor and outdated equipment. Read about combat capabilities, additional protection, maneuverability and comparison with Soviet analogues in the ArmyInform report from positions in the northeast. The material was recorded in late autumn: the crew had just returned from a combat mission; was on recovery, the gunner was preparing for vacation. Although the fighters had been at their positions for quite a long time and were tired, they still spoke very lively about their machine. We begin our conversation about what expectations were from this tank. We will remind that immediately after it became known about Germany's decision to transfer Leopard 1A5 tanks to Ukraine, a wave of skepticism was observed in the network - they say that we are being transferred outdated equipment that is not suitable for the realities of the modern Russian-Ukrainian war. Indeed, at that time, dissatisfaction was caused by the fact that Ukraine was supposedly being handed over machines that are at least 50 years old, and not modern Leopard 2. The first German tank after the Second World War was also criticized for its weak armor. Gena, a charger from Sumy Oblast, and Volodymyr, a mechanic-driver from Cherkasy Oblast, tell us about their tank. We immediately ask what the guys think about the numerous comments about the fact that this is an outdated car. We have him for at least a year. There are downsides, but there are big pluses. Well, yes, an old man, but he does his job. Easy to maintain. All equipment breaks, but we were taught how to look and how to repair it. That's why nothing so critical happened to him this year, says Gena. Vladimir shares his opinion: - She is old, but she justifies herself. Nothing to add here, it's 100%. The main thing is the proper care of her and the harmony of the crew. I drove the T-72, and I can say that the Leopard 1A5 is better. The boys remember that they were taught everything in Germany - how to take care, and how to maneuver, and how to shoot. Everything was practiced there, because the tank was being prepared for maneuver warfare, so that it could reach anywhere, overcoming all possible obstacles. — The Germans were cheerful, they tried. As far as I remember, soups were not given away there. And I wanted borscht. But every weekend they have a tradition of making a barbecue. They did a particularly nice farewell - they roasted a lot of their sausages, brought various non-alcoholic beers, - recalls Gena. Volodymyr adds that they were taught by instructors who were over 50, because the younger Germans had already learned on the Leopard 2. It happened that one of the former instructors left his business for a certain time and returned to the training ground to teach Ukrainians. Volodymyr has been in the war since 2014, when he volunteered. He served for more than a year in the 30 OMBr as an infantryman, then resigned. He fought in Debaltseve. In 2022, he was also in the ranks of the Defense Forces from the first days. Gena says that in the first days of the large-scale invasion, he went to the Military Commissariat, passed the VLK and waited. The summons came five months ago. — He did not immediately want to join the tank battalion, because he had not previously been associated with equipment. He even asked to be sent back to study as an infantryman. But, as you can see, they are still here, they worked with the boys, - he laughs. Volodymyr says that at first he was also in the infantry, fought in Severodonetsk. But the unit was disbanded, and he became a tank driver. - I was not afraid. I know that a tank is a tank, when it moves to a position, the enemy is afraid in any case. When the dance works, it's something. It cannot be compared with anything. He simply leaves, disassembles trenches and dugouts for spare parts, and so on, - confidently explains the mechvod. He emphasizes that it was easy for the crew to master this machine. This is especially noticeable when compared with Soviet tanks - in the Leopard 1A5 everything is accurate, understandable, everything is done faster than on -our- analogues. To become a tanker driver, he says, the main thing is to have the desire. And don't be afraid to sit inside. Sometimes, fighters are afraid, because a tank, no matter what, is a priority target for the enemy. The worst was the first time. But in general, fear is present every time you leave. Gena remembers how once on a combat tour he had to spend the night in a tent: it started to get cold, something was already falling, damp, rain, mud all around. A stove that can be turned on without starting the machine comes to the rescue here. And in summer, in such situations, the air conditioner saves. - We sat in the dance floor, hid, and could not get out. When the sky is dirty, you have to lie in wait and wait for the command. When we are delayed in such cases, canned goods come to the rescue, the charger recalls. By the way, it has the most space inside the tank. We climb onto the tank with the boys so that they can show the place where the engine is located. It can be replaced here in 40 minutes. -It's fantastic, but it's true,- says the driver, adding that the car is very easy to maintain, and that's its advantage. The tank of the Leopard 1A5 holds 970 liters - this, taking into account its additional protection, is enough for 400 and a half kilometers of travel. The tank can develop a considerable speed for driving in reverse - 55 km per hour. This is very telling, as compared to Soviet tanks, which can barely go 5 km/h backwards, says the mechvod and clarifies that the Leopard 1A5 primer can go up to 65 km/h. The charger adds that he really likes the quiet operation of the machine. The mechvod agrees with him, calling it a great advantage over Soviet machines. Both praise the thermal imager in their work, because they work mostly in the dark or -in the dark-. They mainly work in dugouts and other fortified positions of the enemy. I also had to work on technology. -You can sneak into ravines and do a good job,- the guys say about the Leopard 1A5's advantages. Then we climb inside together with the crew. - The car is very sensitive, it is extremely easy to control, - Vladimir climbs into the driver's seat and demonstrates a small steering wheel that responds very smoothly to his hands. - There is no need to pull anything here. Everything is clear and effortless. Automatic gearbox. It -quickly-, easily works like that. Sitting in the place of the loader, we conclude that maneuverability is one of the main advantages of the Leopard 1A5. It also has a -chip- when the left and right tracks rotate in different directions, so the tank can turn right on the spot. - These are all great advantages in it. There is no such maneuverability and speed in the T-64 or T-72. This -Leopard- only drives in reverse as the T-64 drives forward. And maybe even faster, - says Vladimir. The gunner probably has the least space in this spacious cabin. However, he is in direct contact with the tank commander. We ask what are the disadvantages of this car. Mehvod immediately says that he does not like the fact that the tracks are on rubber pads: - Often, Western machinery has such pads on the tracks so as not to spoil the roads. If it weren't for them, the tank would go even faster. They can be replaced manually, but this is a very time-consuming process, because each thing must be removed separately with a special tool. We sit in the seat of the tank commander and talk to the loader. He shows what his job is and mentions that he has the most space in the cabin. And also shows the twin 7.62 mm machine gun that this machine is equipped with. Gena emphasizes that the tank has a modern fire control system, which is why it has the A5 prefix. Also shows the place where he stores shells - they are different, depending on the type of tasks, but you can't talk about them. A mechvod crawls through the place of the loader to us and confirms that the fire control system is very good, works effectively both day and night: - If we received the exact coordinates from the adjuster, then this tank works like a sniper rifle. I can't tell you all the details, but we have the power and the means to know in real time where we hit. This system significantly helps in correcting the shot, how many corrections to take, azimuth and level. The guys say that Leopard 1A5 shells fall very accurately, and sometimes the enemy did not even have time to understand what exactly was flying at it, confusing the Leopard with a mortar, and they note that it hits very accurately, how to compare with Soviet counterparts is like heaven and earth. Separately, we dwell on the dynamic protection, which was recently installed on this tank. It helps not only against cluster bombs, but also against RPGs, LNG, grenade launchers and drones. Footage of the training of its crews on the Leopard 1A5 with such armor was already shown by the Ground Forces . The guys say that this is not a fundamentally new decision, because the command is constantly thinking about how to protect personnel and equipment. Therefore, such tanks in the 44th OMBr have been fighting with dynamic defense for quite some time. By the way, on Sukhoutka video you can see what the Leopard 1A5 looks like with the -barbecue- installed. Mehvod is not ready to say that the tank is somehow very different from Soviet tanks: -It's no secret, this tank has homogeneous armor. But, thank God, it was not necessary to check its strength. Our advantage is that the command uses this machine very competently.- Although it is mentioned that it was this Leopard 1A5 that was once hit by an enemy FPV, and also received shrapnel from the Lancet. Vladimir shows the mark left on the armor and says that it did not affect the tank in any way, he drove on and worked. The guys say that they are given vacation according to the rules, they are able to recover minimally, but still 30 days is not enough. At the same time, the tankers claim that they are here to win. -I don't want my children to be under the invaders,- adds Gena. We are talking about the fact that there are not enough people to replace those who have been fighting for the third year. - There is enough of everything here - equipment, clothes, and normal food. The team is cool, everyone is adequate. Whoever comes will be supported here, will be shown everything. It doesn't matter how he gets here, says the mechvod. — Our crew is like clockwork. All are interconnected. It's like a family. Only in a tank,- adds Gena with a slight smile. Finally, we say that the fighters on the front lines, especially those who have been fighting for three years or longer, are tired: -When someone says that we are running out, it is not necessarily irreversible losses. People get tired physically and mentally, they need to be replaced.- - We need to get involved, because we are not here forever. And don't be afraid. Yes, war is scary, but there is no need to be afraid. Someone has to do this work. Everything has its resource. Just because we're not eternal doesn't mean we're gone and dead. This means that people are getting tired, and the army needs fresh strength, - adds Gena.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/26/snajperska-gvyntivka-zi-slabkoyu-broneyu-govorymo-z-ekipazhem-pro-te-yak-leopard-1a5-pokazav-sebe-v-boyu/	2025-01-25T21:09:50-08:00
It took a while, now he is a double elite. The story of a paratrooper and a sniper -Gryni-	Oleksiy told ArmiyaInform about his life choices and combat path, as well as the importance of sergeants in the Armed Forces. — All my life I wanted to join the Air Force, because it is a real elite. True, half a year later the Airborne Forces were renamed to the Airborne Forces, but we still remained paratroopers, - smiles -Grynya-. Over time, service in the Armed Forces became for a military man not only an episode in his biography, but also a vocation and a final life choice, and the Airborne Assault Forces was the place where Alexei found the most sincere and loyal friends. — I was thinking of signing a contract for three years, and after it ended, go -for a civilian.- But then it dragged on - even when there was a calmer phase of the war during the time of the ATO / OOS, so I serve until today, - he recalls. Oleksiy began his service as a soldier, gradually acquiring the knowledge and experience necessary to attain the rank of sergeant. — I spent three years in the soldiers, because then everyone said: a clean shoulder is a clean conscience. But then I realized myself, and the commanders saw that I already had the experience to move on, says the senior sergeant. As a skillful and skilled shooter, Oleksiy was sent to study at a sniper school, where he completed the basic courses and received the appropriate certificate. — Then for a year and a half, I ran in snipers - in a line company, but as a sniper. Dual elite - a paratrooper and a sniper - jokes a military man. It was as a sniper that -Grynya- met a large-scale invasion, taking part in high-intensity battles with the enemy. — During the first month of the full-scale war, I had eight -minuses- (confirmed liquidated Russian occupiers - ed.). Then it was a lot, but now it is, of course, little things, - modestly informs the soldier. Soon, responsibility, leadership qualities and many years of service experience allowed Oleksiy to become a unit commander, and later a platoon commander. The soldier was given the rank of sergeant. - Those who could organize people and carry out a combat mission were appointed as commanders. I believe that a sergeant, from junior sergeant to unit commander, is an extremely important rank in the Armed Forces. Everything rests on it, a confident military man. He is convinced that sergeants are the main backbone of the Ukrainian army and play the role of a connecting link from the soldier to the highest levels of command. — A sergeant can hold positions from a department commander to a platoon commander — and that's all a sergeant. It is the backbone of our Armed Forces. Without a sergeant there is no army, without a sergeant there are no normal troops. A professional military sergeant, a universal warrior, characterizes Oleksiy the importance of sergeants in the Armed Forces. In the 199th training center of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Oleksiy serves as an instructor of the Sergeant Training Center, so he is well aware of the requirements for the -universal warrior- of the Armed Forces of Ukraine - from the performance characteristics of any weapon available in the army to making combat decisions and giving orders. — The sergeant must have leadership and commanding qualities. So that he is not afraid to make a decision and is not afraid of responsibility, and also has a good understanding of any weapon from a machine gun and above - up to MANPADS or some kind of equipment. A sergeant must know all the weapons of his unit and be able to replace any of the soldiers, the soldier explains. However, the most important quality of a sergeant, Oleksiy calls humanity and attention to each of the soldiers. Because if a sergeant knows how to work with people of different backgrounds and ages, with different life experiences and education, he will be able to gradually master everything else and become a real leader in the team he will lead in his position. - When I commanded a platoon, soldiers could turn to me with any questions. Or I myself approached them and talked, if they did not go to contact. Because a sergeant is a person who must do everything possible for his soldiers, the instructor is convinced. At the training center, Oleksiy and his colleagues are training precisely such sergeants who are capable of becoming not only commanders, but also representatives of fighters in the teams they lead. There are not many such people, but the best ones get here, the instructor is convinced. — Military personnel with combat experience and command experience come to us. They already have the rank of sergeant and strive to develop and improve. Therefore, there are no problems with motivation - they themselves strive to rise to the next level, to become even better than they were, - explains the senior sergeant. Graduates of the Sergeant Training Center of the 199th Training Center of the Military Intelligence Service really become the real combat elite of their units. The most valuable achievement in training and communication with brothers and fellow sergeants is called mutual assistance and strong friendship. — What I really like in the army is brotherhood. This is such a strong friendship that I would never have met -in a civilian life-. It is this friendship in the army that keeps and does not want to let go. As if I could have -written off- by now, but I made friends here with the boys - and I don't want to go anywhere, I want to be with them and help them, - concludes our conversation.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/26/zatyagnulo-teper-vin-podvijna-elita-istoriya-desantnyka-i-snajpera-gryni/	2025-01-25T20:37:35-08:00
Two million mines: -undermining- reality in Russian	The first question that arises is how much does it all weigh? For those who don't know, one antipersonnel mine weighs 2-4 kilograms on average. If we take only two million such mines (and this is -only- what Russian -experts- tell us), then the total weight of the -arsenal- that we allegedly buried is 4-8 thousand tons. Yes, it is several echelons or a colossal convoy of trucks. And where is all this -evidence-? Or maybe they are also mined? In modern warfare, mining the rear is not only illogical, but also technically difficult. Mines of this scale would take a colossal amount of resources, time and manpower, which are simply not available during active hostilities on the front. At most, Ukraine receives weapons from partners mainly for offensive or defensive purposes, and not for building a mine museum somewhere in the rear. However, Russian propagandists lack logic. For them, the main thing is to come up with something shocking, preferably such that even an old grandmother from Kursk would have her blood pressure raised. Here everything is simpler than it seems. Firstly, through fake statements, they are trying to discredit the Armed Forces of Ukraine, to create an image of -cruel and inhumane Ukrainians- who -do not count for anything.- Secondly, they divert the attention of their own citizens from the fact that their own mobilized people continue to get into -cotton shows- in the rear and on the front lines. And most importantly: this is an attempt to justify his own crimes. For every detonation of a civilian object or mass death of civilians, they already have an alibi ready: -it's not us, it's Ukrainian mines.- Let's imagine that we really -mined- the rear. What's next? Shall we put up -Caution, Russians not allowed- signs along these mines? Or maybe we will sign each mine: -Made in Ukraine, but only for fakes-? It seems that the Russian propagandists were so engrossed in their lying scenarios that they themselves began to believe in this movie. But the reality is this: their fictions are more like a poorly staged play for jaded audiences than anything worthwhile. Real evidence? None. No satellite images, no reports, no photos, no videos. Nothing. the Russian mass media once again created a myth on an equal footing, because inventing horror stories about Ukraine is their way of life. In fact, Ukraine fights honestly, in accordance with international norms, while Russian troops are famous for their minefields, which remain after their retreats. The next time you are told about another -sensation- from Russian propagandists, just think about who benefits from it. And remember: Ukraine is fighting for life, freedom and security, while Russia is fighting for -Olgino ratings-. The reality is simple: Two million mines is not about us. It is about those who undermine themselves on their own inventions.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/26/dva-miljony-min-pidryv-realnosti-po-rosijsky/	2025-01-25T20:15:15-08:00

Hands up, bayonets in the ground — in the Zaporozhye direction, drones continue to capture Russians	This was reported by the head of the communications department of the 118th separate mechanized brigade, Dmytro Pelikh, on the broadcast of the -Yedini Novyni- telethon. According to Pelikh, along with conventional FPV drones, the enemy is now more actively using fiber-optic drones. For their part, the Defense Forces also actively use drones. In particular, in order to capture Russians. -By the way, this week we also captured an occupier who decided to surrender to our drone. That is, after weighing his strength and his physical condition, he raised his hands and followed our drone. After all, they know very well that they are disposable and there is no way for them. They confirm this to us,- said Dmytro Pelikh. As reported > ArmyInform, the Ukrainian military decided to encourage the Russian occupier, who chose captivity instead of a senseless death, by treating him to a tangerine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/25/ruky-vgoru-bagnety-v-zemlyu-na-zaporizkomu-napryamku-drony-prodovzhuyut-polonyty-rosiyan/	2025-01-25T09:49:02-08:00
They climbed into a gap, got into a coffin - the Russian attack aircraft did not reach our positions	The video of the combat operation was published on January 25 on the channel of the battalion, which is now being reformed into a regiment. The attack of the invaders was met with fire. Some of the disorganized Russians remained to spend the night in holes after realizing that their plan had failed, and the lifeless bodies of their comrades had already littered the battlefield. -We do not know for sure whether the Russian attack aircraft understood the inevitability of the moment. However, we know that our UAV operators clearly understood that the enemy must be destroyed to the end so that no occupier comes close to our infantrymen,- the brigade commented on the video. Therefore, the capture and destruction of Russians continued the next day. The enemy tried to continue his pressure from two directions, trying to infiltrate the adjacent positions of our comrades from the 118th Territorial Defense Brigade, as well as our positions of the 54th Brigade nearby. However, the coordinated work of the armored group, artillery and drone operators again broke their plans. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the battalion K- 2 54 of the mechanized brigade named after Hetman Ivan Mazepa appreciated the courage of the occupier, who was able to come closest to our positions. &nbsp; &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/25/lizly-v-shhilynu-potrapyly-u-trunu-rosijsku-shturmovyky-ne-dijshly-do-nashyh-pozyczij/	2025-01-25T09:29:59-08:00

However, the Ukrainian army remains within the borders of the city, restraining the assaults in which the enemy is sending such -pickles- of unqualified soldiers. -They perform the function of bait. That is, they are blindly directed. Their task is to infiltrate past us, or expose our fire ambushes or fire positions. Run as deep as possible, hide in some kind of shelter, and wait for further orders or carry out demining measures,- said the commander of the 49th separate assault battalion -Karpatska Sich-.

The super two - -the Witch- and the chaplain go to help the wounded paratroopers	A video about this work was released on January 25 on the brigade channel. -Witch- until recently performed tasks in an assault company, and now helps wounded soldiers. -Supporting our wounded soldiers in hospitals and other medical facilities is an important part of paratroopers' rehabilitation. Every kind word is a small step towards their recovery. Now, visiting soldiers in hospitals, she talks with them, laughs, recalls various life moments, because it is easier for soldiers to speak out, to share what is on their hearts,- the brigade's message said. The path to the recovery of wounded fighters is a difficult process. Physical rehabilitation is only part of this path. Equally important is psychological and heart support, which heals wounds that cannot be seen and restores the motivation to move on. As reported by ArmyInform, since the beginning of the Kursk operation, 80 brigades managed to destroy over 5 thousand people personnel composition of the enemy, taking into account the killed and wounded.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/25/superdvijka-vidma-ta-kapelan-idut-na-dopomogu-poranenym-desantnykam/	2025-01-25T08:15:52-08:00

Oleg Romanov, commander, told about this on the air of the telethon -Edyny Novyny- anti-tank battalion of the Third Assault Brigade. According to him, the enemy is trying to capture the settlement of Kopanka directly in the lane of the Third Assault Brigade. The positions of the brigade are under constant assaults. -Because of this, we have to send assault groups to clear different areas every day. Also, the combined fire support of the brigade is currently working at full capacity. This also helps our infantry with FPV drones, artillery and mortars. By all means available to the brigade,- said the commander of the anti-tank battalion of the Third Assault Brigade. The enemy storms with great force. This is not surprising, because according to intelligence, the composition of the Russian First Tank Army and 20 Armies, which oppose the Third Assault Army, is approximately 80% full. And the motivation to fight the enemy is very simple. -Prisoners during interrogations say that when they go to the position, and this path is about 10 kilometers on foot, they see about 100 killed Russians in the landings. Some said that up to 300 were counted. And they go forward anyway, because if they turn back, they will be shot. They have only one way - to go forward, as during the Second World War,- said Oleg Romanov. ArmyInform already reported about a mass attack by -mangals- in the Kharkiv region - then the Defense Forces repelled the assault that the Russians had been preparing for a month.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/25/sto-mercziv-na-desyat-kilometriv-jduchy-na-shturm-rosijski-shturmovyky-rahuyut-poperednykiv/	2025-01-25T07:49:02-08:00

Theoretical training will be integrated into the curriculum as a separate discipline. Practical classes will be held during the holidays, which will avoid a conflict with the main study. Who conducts the training? Experienced retired military personnel, veterans of war and military service will be involved in the teaching of BZVP. Mandatory requirements are fluency in the Ukrainian language, an appropriate level of higher education, as well as good health and physical fitness. What practical skills do the students get?

70 thousand photos of the war for two: about the escape from the FPV drone, unpublished photos of Da...	Famous Ukrainian documentary photographers Kostya and Vlada Liberovy told the correspondent of ArmiyaInfrom about how their work has changed, what emotions are the most difficult to show in the shots, as well as about photos that are perceived personally and moments when it seemed that this would be the last shot. - How did the war affect you and your perception of life? - Everything has changed completely, starting from the circle of our communication, values ​​and ending with the style of clothing. From people who were not aware, not involved, we began to live a war. It's a real shame the way it used to be and would like to do a lot more now to balance it all out. If you look at what we shot before the wide scale, it is a photo where people are hugging, kissing, where people are smiling. Now, yes, we still have the main colors in photography, the search for our favorite light, that is, visually our language has not changed, but what the photos are about has changed. It took us half a year to get a feel for filming war. At first, we just duplicated what we knew before as photographers, but this is a completely different field of photography, it didn't turn out well, but some part of this experience remained, and you can say that this is some of our individuality in it. Speaking of colors, I don't know about Kosta, but I hate the blue sky in war, Vlada says and continues. — It hurts me so much. The sky is always so happy, right, just imagine: the blue boundless sky above the battered landing where our best men are dying and wounded&#8230; It creates a very strong dissonance for me, because under such a magical blue sky there must be something beautiful, and you find yourself where terrible things happen. Personally, I feel more comfortable filming the war under cloudy skies: in the rain, under the snow, when the weather is bad, then it is logical, I don't expect anything good. We work a lot in Donetsk region, and there are incredible dawns. In Kherson Oblast, there are unsurpassed sunsets, when nature begins to give you something super beautiful, and against the background of all this horror, for some reason I even feel anger inside. - Has your perception of death in the war changed over time? - We have lost many good friends and acquaintances, some of them even before our eyes were injured and died&#8230; Death used to be scary, now it's a habit. It's actually terrifying. Thinking about death, I always have a story in contrast, it was before the large-scale invasion, where we lived in Odessa. A person fell out of a window and died. It so happened that at that moment I was leaving the entrance: I see something covered with a bag, doctors are standing, people are gathering. It knocked me off track for more than a week, then I even dreamed of that situation. I didn't know this person, I didn't see anything, but Kostya knows that it almost became a nervous breakdown for me. Now, like, a lot of things are happening before your eyes and you just keep silent. It's scary that things like this are becoming commonplace. Even for the most sensual people, it is perceived that way, because there is no other way. This is how the human psyche is arranged - we get used to everything and there is no other way. These experiences remain, the pain remains, but it is somehow more dulled. The pain is throbbing, but you can live with it. But, it can last much longer than the sharp pain. - When you return from a war zone, are there any rituals to return to a more calm and peaceful life? - For both of us, it's just sitting at home and doing nothing, but at some point we feel acute the need to go back and do your thing again. We always emphasize that we are not in the army, we are not mobilized, but it so happened that all our social circle is military and it is difficult for us to find ourselves in ordinary civilian life in Kyiv. The government begins to prepare, because it found itself in this. -These are absolutely simple things, but this process, when you cut something, it cooks there, it calms me down and becomes a meditative element. Kostya Pravda then washes the dishes, and he doesn't like it,- Vlada says with a laugh. Kostya looks at his wife with a tender look and says: -She cooks perfectly and it's all very good. We started going to the hall when we are in Kyiv. It is more related to work, we found our coach, to whom we want to return. — When you work on the front lines lately, it's a constant load, you walk around in ammunition, fully equipped. During the time of Vovchansk, I completely changed my protection, I now have Kevlar everywhere: on my sides, neck, lower back, a large striker. I first encountered an FPV drone there, from which I was running away, says Kostya and continues. — When you run away from a drone that is chasing you with one goal: to kill or maim you, you draw a model in your head, where you imagine how the debris will fly into your body, and you think about how best to hold your hands so that less debris will fly. It is generally a weapon against humanity. And it turns out that you already want to take with you some equipment, provisions, and all this is additional weight on you, constant marches of 5-10 km, so sports are in fact an investment in your health and life. We tell all our friends not to neglect protection, so for the New Year holidays, for those who serve, we have updated the armor to be with the attackers. - What are the most difficult emotions for you to show in your works? - You can actually just open our Instagram page and see all the photos we took from the last to the first of the war. Every photo is pain and emotion. The most painful are the burials. This is simply the worst thing that can happen in this life. If these are your good friends, then this is just some surreal plot. We hate shootings like this, but at the same time we understand their importance because we have been thinking a lot lately about the importance of how future generations will remember and remember this war. There is such a persistent feeling that quite often Ukrainians find themselves defenseless before the enemy, because from generation to generation we forget who our enemy is. There is a feeling that the Russians have a background hatred for Ukrainians, and we do not have a background hatred for them. When the acute phase of the conflict, which has been going on for centuries, stops, we forget and begin to build relations with them again, we draw culture and language to us. We want to make it so (this idea was planted by Iryna Tsybukh - ed.) that future generations remember what happened in detail. The burial itself is the plot that best shows what kind of pain the Russians cause us in this period, because we show how painful it is to lose relatives and friends. - You constantly work together in quite difficult and stressful situations. Has the war changed your relationship? - Fortunately, no. Even from the beginning of our relationship, when we were not married, we worked together. All our lives, starting from the moment of meeting, we do everything together. Kostya says: -I love spending time with my wife and I wouldn't trade it for anything.- Vlada, thinking for a moment, proudly answers: -My perception of the person next to me has changed. I never knew Kostya was brave. There were simply no such cases when he was not a person who, for example, gets into a fight, because he is calm. I was surprised that he could work in such conditions. I can't do that, so I haven't been to the infantry for a year. All this year, Kostya actively worked with the infantry and went on assaults. It was a trait of his that I didn't know about. -Are there any stories that you have documented and would like to see them adapted? - An incredible number of stories that we see are actually ready-made plots for some very good cinema. Any infantryman and what happens in the positions is worthy of a screenplay. There is simply an incredible heat of passion. The horrors we saw there, the boys live them day by day. Sometimes when we watch some movies about the war, it seems that everything is much simplified there than what the military tells you, which is 11 years into this war. And we would very much like as many ordinary people and infantrymen as possible to go down in history, to save them and their faces, because they deserve it. - What was the most risky moment for you during filming, when you thought: -This could be my last shot-? - The first time it happened was when Vlada was injured. We were driving the car, not thinking about anything, and here the -Gradiv- packages are opening in front of us. You are muffled, everything is ringing in your ears, you don't even have time to be scared at this moment, but just think how stupid it is to die like that. We had the same thoughts, although we sat on different sides of the car. -I thought that's it, this must be it. I didn't have time to be scared at the moment, only then I was terribly scared for Vlada when she said that she had something wet in her side. I couldn't even open the car door because I was so scared. Then I had a real panic, although I usually tolerate everything very calmly and just shoot it. At that moment I was just confused, Vlada was given first aid, she told me to film this process,- Kostya recalled. -I understood that it was a minor injury, I was not dying and I was not in a panic. I had another moment. At that time, we worked with the -Azov- brigade. The shelling started, we started running and it's all about physical fitness and why it's so important. I had a very heavy armored car, I was not physically ready, and at a certain point I just fell on the shot bridge, because my body simply refused to run any further. I lie on it and think that's it, now the next projectile is in me. Then I got up, crawled, it wasn't scary, I was very angry with myself for putting people near me in danger. I can't move at their pace, everyone slows down because of me and it was a feeling of anger. And there was a second in the moment when I was lying down and thinking about everything: I felt sick,- Vlada shared her memory. - Do you have a -border of fear- that you do not cross? , when you don't physically pull, superimposed on fear after being wounded. When my husband works at zero, I shoot medical evacuation or art. - How do you feel about the fact that your photos can be used for Russian propaganda or manipulation? At most, it was one thing when it was their usual propaganda, but when it was those who tried to position themselves as an independent Russian mass media and could have access to a bank of photo agencies, where they officially buy them, put them on websites, and then write: -Here , again the Armed Forces failed to storm: losses of 500,000 people for today.- However, over time, they got used to it, because they understood that this is a Russian base - to lie. - How do you feel about the fact that your photos may be in history textbooks in the future? - Our close friend told us that there is a teacher in one Odesa school who shows our photos to the children and it really bothers us. moved It just feels like a dream come true that you've done something important. There is a new generation and they are shown our works, and it is an honor for us. Feeling like you've won an Oscar at the same time. It's not about the physical reward, it's much more weighty and meaningful. If our photos will one day be in the history books, it is not for nothing that we lived and did something valuable for future generations. - What are the most unexpected emotions you had to show in a frame? - Burial of Kosti Yuzvuk. He left a will as to how he would like his funeral to be conducted. Honestly, it looked like a party and everyone got into it. It was sweet and brought tears to my eyes. Taken out of context, this may seem strange to the average viewer. We edited a certain part of the photos and did not give them to the agency, because these photos could be taken out of context and propaganda could use this to their advantage. That is, the fact that today, following the will of the deceased, friends and relatives find the courage to smile precisely at the moment of farewell, because this person wanted it, is super cool, because this is the strength of the Ukrainian people. We give these photos to relatives, but do not publish them. - What good emotions did you have to convey in the frame? - There are also a lot of good emotions, despite the pain. In contrast, there are many such bright moments, such as love and sincerity, which are very powerfully felt. We've shot a lot of weddings on the front and it's always so real. When shooting a lot of weddings before 2022, it didn't always feel like it was on the front. People get married for different reasons and you don't always feel such sincerity in them at the moment. It is also the birth of children, brotherhood, the feeling of a strong shoulder and support. By the age of 30, of course, we had friends, but it was somehow sterile. Like okay, like a proper friendship from the TV series, sometimes we visited each other. And here it is completely different. Maybe you see this person 2-3 times, but he becomes so dear to you that you are ready to give everything for this person and this person gives you back. Such feelings are difficult to compare with anything at all. This is possible only during the war, and I hope that we will carry it further after the war. —After the end of the war, don't you plan to create your own museum or space where the personnel will speak for themselves? — On the one hand, this can be related to memory, because we really want to be a part of making sure that our actions do not forget all the horrors of war. We didn't think specifically about a museum or a space, but we don't have the resources now or ever to do something this big. But we do hope that there will be a resource for creating a photo book. Every year we say that we should start doing, but then we think that it is too early. Over the last month, we started working on our archive. These are about 70,000 photos that need to be re-examined, reconsidered and tried to assemble into something unified and harmonious. We hope to do so one day. - What is the most personal shot, even though the viewer doesn't know it? - Personal is an unpublished story that we haven't shown anywhere about the dead Da Vinci. We don't know if these photos will ever see the world, but his story and how he died are very personal to us. In general, it is all personal, it is difficult to single out one or several stories. All our work is with some involvement and emotionality, it cannot be otherwise. There are stories that make their way to the very heart and you can't do anything about it. It happens that we take a picture, and then relatives contact us and ask for a photo. They say that this was the last shot of this soldier and they ask to send a photo in good quality and it also becomes personal. These are quite painful moments. - How often are there moments when you cry after filming? - There is no such thing right away, because no nervous system could withstand that. But all the delayed emotions, Vlada personally catches up in the form of tears or in the form of aggression. That is, everything accumulated comes out later. - Will you return to filming peaceful life after the end of the war? - We will definitely shoot peaceful life, but we do not know in what format. This will definitely not be a love shoot, that is, everything that was done before the large scale. When peace comes, we will look for ourselves in it, but we will remain in documentary photography. We fell in love with this genre, because before we had an influence on the plot and everything that happened in the frame, and now our task is to catch the moment, because we don't have such influence, and that's why we fell in love with documentary photography as a genre. - Do you have a photographic dream that you have not yet realized or are you on your way to it? - When we were just starting out, the dream was to take, as probably every military photographer has, a photo that would stop a war . But the more you take such photos that should have stopped the war, the more you realize that it is not in the power of photographers and photos. We dream of shooting Victory. When we filmed the de-occupation of Kherson, it felt like a small celebration of Victory Day, but in the context of a separate city. And this dream that this day will come. However, now it seems that we will not celebrate it like that, but will remember those who gave their lives for her. We will be given the official casualty figure that day. And we will all go home in silence to think about this number. The best photos are the ones you were able to post, so you're alive.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/25/70-tysyach-foto-vijny-na-dvoh-pro-vtechu-vid-fpv-dronu-neopublikovani-foto-da-vinchi-ta-shho-czinnishe-za-oskar-intervyu-z-liberovymy/	2025-01-24T21:10:00-08:00
-I have never seen so much FPV in my life-: the story of a rugby player, and now a company officer, ...	Senior lieutenant, commander of the countersabotage company in the ranks of the 241st separate brigade of the Territorial Defense of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. In civilian life, he was professionally engaged in rugby (since 1993), played for the Aviator club in the capital. He also had a private business. An active participant of two revolutions (Orange and Euromaidan), he has a stable and unyielding position regarding the future of Ukraine, its sovereignty and territorial integrity. -When I graduated from the ninth grade, in my graduation album, I was the only one with a blue-yellow badge on my school uniform,- recalls Viktor Baranov with pride. He says that after the end of the Revolution of Dignity, in the spring of 2013, he was in the center of Kyiv near the tent where volunteers were being recruited for the ranks of the -Donbas- battalion and thought about joining this unit. -I'll be honest: I didn't have enough courage. I justified myself by the fact that I have a 4-year-old daughter and I need to raise her. But he started volunteering. When the marine units left the Crimea for Mykolaiv, I visited them. Later, in Mariupol, he also worked under Debaltsev, Shchasti on the Svitlodar arc as a volunteer.- He admits that he did not expect a large-scale Russian invasion, and on February 24, 2022, he was in Transcarpathia, at a sports meeting with the Ukrainian rugby league team. -When I was told -Kep, war- - I immediately jumped into the car and drove to Kyiv. It is remembered that a lot of cars drove from the capital, and only a few cars went to Kyiv. When I entered the South Bridge, a rocket exploded overhead,- he says. In order to get into the ranks of the Defense Forces in the first days of the large-scale, says, laughing, -Cap-, it was necessary to resort to -corruption-: the queues at the military checkpoints were crazy, and those who wanted it were in the dark. In the end, Viktor Baranov as a soldier joined the ranks of the Territorial Defense Rifle Battalion (3rd Rifle Company). Got into -my- environment: out of 7 people in the department, 5 are athletes. In June 2022, during the battles for Dementiivka in Kharkiv Oblast, he received an injury. -&#8230; And I -escaped- from the hospital in order to, together with my brothers, with the whole platoon, plan an operation to remove the bodies of our dead, among them was the fallen company commander with the call sign -Sherman-. When everything was successful and we returned with the body, everyone just looked at us with wide-open eyes, speechless. After this incident, everyone respected us very much.- The career growth of an ambitious military man with good physical training was rapid and well-deserved: in March 2022, Viktor Baranov headed a department, in September 2022, a platoon (and, accordingly, already had the rank of junior lieutenant). And in 2023, he became a company commander. I ask which of these command positions was the most difficult for a military man. He says he's a mouthful. -It's a terrible position. The most difficult thing in it is to inform relatives about the death of their husband, son, brother in the war. Or when they call and ask about the circumstances of the death or why the body was not evacuated from the battlefield. It's incredibly difficult. As a company member, I know all the callsigns and year of birth of my soldiers. For example, -Duke-, born in 1999. He died. I know that he is the only son of his parents. And I realize that my son is the same age. I remember talking to him for 30 minutes. And I understood how important this conversation was for him, and my task during this communication was to provide information and support as much as possible. Although I understand for myself that parents do not need all the heroic deeds of their children - they need their child alive. The second most difficult thing in the position of a company commander, continues -Cap-, is to send his subordinates on a combat mission. -And my boys were born in 2003-2005. And the most difficult thing is to give them an order and send them on a mission. But when they return, then the best thing happens in the commander's life: I hug them, thank them for their work, and see how their eyes light up. We always discuss everything. And I always emphasize: any task can be done. Even burning Moscow is possible. But: not today, not by our strength, and not by our means. That is why we discuss each and every task in detail, chewing it down to the smallest nuances. And I am very nervous and very nervous at such moments,- shares the mouthpiece, smiling. And the most valuable thing in the life of a commander, says the interlocutor, is to hear from subordinates words like: -I trust you, commander, and that's why I will do it.- -These are the best people. And they are the best because we, the commanders, make them so.- In his mouth, -Kep- promotes a healthy lifestyle: -Our laws are -wild- - they don't even drink beer. And the chief sergeant of the company, by the way, has 536 jumps with a parachute, before the war he was engaged in parachuting.- &#8230; December 1, 2024 was one of the harsh combat episodes in the life of Comrade Viktor Baranov and his comrades. The place of action is Donetsk region, Velika Novosilka district. Then, according to the command, during the execution of combat missions, he skillfully built defenses in the settlement entrusted to him and thus blocked the enemy breakthrough of 40 infantrymen and eight units of Russian armored vehicles. -We predicted what sort of landings the Russians were planning to take, brought our BMP-2 into position there, it was 5 o'clock in the morning. Among the weapons was also -Fagot- and RPG. I myself was driving a pickup truck. And it so happened that we&#8230; drove into the flank of the Pod*rska column. She was 600 meters from us. We simply did not see them because of the peculiarities of the terrain there. To say that I was scared then is an understatement. If the Russians had seen us then and turned their -cannon- on us, we would be gone, I'm honest. I have never seen as much FPV as December 1st in my life! Three enemy UAVs flew into our pick-up truck, and they also worked on us with anti-aircraft missiles. In total, there were about 20 FPVs - in three years, we have not received such attention,- says -Kep-. The military calls the success of this combat sortie the good strategic position of the Ukrainian units in relation to the enemy; a good, well-camouflaged attack position, etc. During these events, the officer received a second concussion. But this whole story is summed up succinctly: -They crossed each other and left.- All this lasted from approximately 7:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. In conclusion: 10 Russians were eliminated, about 10 were wounded and 15, unfortunately, survived. Traditionally, we ask military personnel from the Defense Forces about how civilians can overcome their fear of the army, mobilization, and war. -Cap- replies, -I always tell my guys that I'm scared every time, every time I go out. Because only an idiot or a person under the influence of some substances is not afraid. For a normal person, fear is a normal phenomenon. And I explain that no matter how they feel about the word courage, courage is the ability to do what we have when we are afraid. That is, you are afraid - but you have to do it. That's what the concept of -courage- is. And to our second traditional question about what will be the end of the Russian-Ukrainian war for him, -Kep- answers as follows: -&#8230; But what is victory?.. Crossing the borders of 1991?.. I understand that it will be difficult to return Crimea now - but I would really like to. Perhaps some sanctions, exchanges, etc. will help. We would categorically not want a freeze on hostilities. Because the enemy will only accumulate armored vehicles, artillery, rockets, increase the army - and again deliver a massive blow. I don't trust the Russians&#8230; But do you know what I dream about? So that the shelling would stop, a kind of -buffer zone- of at least 1 kilometer would be formed on the contact line, and so that we would have at least half a year to take the bodies of our dead brothers from the battlefield. And the bastards took their own, if they need them, of course. After all, I very often talk with the relatives of those soldiers whose bodies have not yet been evacuated. And this is the only thing they ask me as a commander: -Take away at least the body - he wanted to go home so badly.- But I cannot expose my subordinates to such risks and dangers, because now the enemy has a lot of drones. But it is important for me to posthumously award these soldiers. After all, without a body, they are considered -400-, if there is a body - -200-. And only then will I be able to submit them for an award, and for me as a commander, this is very important.- And then, after thinking, the officer adds: -And I would also really like a big fence, about six meters high, on the state border of Ukraine - so that the Great Wall of China would envy us- Or that there was a North Sea on the eastern border of Ukraine, from Vovchansk to the Urals, with beluga and a lot of caviar. Or that we border the Arctic Ocean.- Photo from Viktor Baranov's personal archive	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/25/stilky-fpv-ya-shhe-ne-bachyv-nikoly-u-svoyemu-zhytti-istoriya-regbista-a-nyni-rotnogo-viktora-baranova/	2025-01-24T20:50:22-08:00
-Houston, we've got a problem-: How the International Legion Intelligence Control Point 2 works	Pavlo, commander of the special purpose company, deputy commander of the battalion tactical group, told ArmiyaInform about the combat work of the intelligence control point of the 2nd International Defense Legion. — Previously, when we worked in the Serebryansk Forest, we called such a point TSUP — the Flight Control Center. Now we call it PUR - Intelligence Control Point. Our main task is to coordinate combat work. Everything that can be obtained from radio-electronic intelligence, intelligence reports, and messages from neighbors flows here. We analyze radio-electronic intelligence - the report of our PEP arrives here - and draw conclusions about what the enemy's actions will be in our area of ​​responsibility, Pavlo explains. He notes that the enemy works on both analog and digital radios. The available PEP equipment allows you to listen to all analog communication. As for the -digit-, the keys to it are selected by hardware and also allow radio interception. - We learn the enemy's conventional marking grid - how they mark this or that landing and the points in it. Thanks to this, a layer is created in -Kropyva-, on which we fix points with the conventional markings of the enemy, which he uses in radio intercepts, says the officer. It is possible to find out the conventional signs of the enemy from the testimonies of prisoners and thanks to analytical work. For example, by listening to radio intercepts and observing the events on the battlefield, it is possible to determine how the occupiers mark this or that point on the site. — When shelling occurs, the enemy corrects it. We hear how they mark the point where they are shooting and record it on the map. Or when we inflict fire damage on them, certain assault or counter-assault actions take place, then through interception we also understand how the enemy marks this or that area. Then we put it on the map and report to the management for consideration in further work, says Pavlo. Thanks to such analytical work, it is possible to find out the vast majority of conditional marks used by enemies in the area already in a week. This makes it possible to understand which areas the intercepted messages are talking about and to react accordingly to the actions of the enemy. — When there is some accumulation, some movement, we intercept it all and report it. Because of this, we know and understand what the enemy is going to do, some time before the assaults, or the movement, or the massing, or other movements of the enemy. This is a simple linear analysis, there are no complex systems here. There is just an interception, in which callsigns and some dots sound. This is normal analytical work, there is nothing extraordinary here, he adds. The enemy's radio-electronic intelligence works in a similar way - the occupiers listen to the air and try to intercept and analyze the messages of the Ukrainian military. To prevent eavesdropping, countermeasures are used to effectively counter these hostile attempts. — There are algorithms according to which the encryption system in the radio air changes with a certain periodicity. For example, we change code-plugs on digital radio stations every week. Therefore, even if the enemies decoded our frequencies by hardware and can somehow eavesdrop, very quickly, after changing the encryption codes, they lose this opportunity, says Pavlo. He notes that the ethics of using radio stations, when speaking as little as possible on the air, also plays an important role. Another advantage is the Ukrainian language, because Russians understand Ukrainian much worse than Ukrainians understand Russian. And when it comes to foreign volunteers of the International Legion who communicate in their own languages, it becomes even more difficult for the enemy. — But still the most important are the encryption table, the ethics of communication in the radio air, and the most frequent change of the coding system. This is the only way we can prevent the enemy's PEP from working, the military man emphasizes. — The most important thing now is not to miss the movement of small groups. A year and a half ago, the Russians moved in groups of 4-6 servicemen, and now they are walking in groups of two. I think that in three months there will be one at all. It is much more difficult to -catch- the movement of one serviceman than to see a group of four or six, Pavlo tells about the features of modern military operations in Donetsk region. The movement of such doubles of the enemy is very dangerous, because if they are not detected and eliminated in time, they accumulate at the front edge and assemble into assault groups capable of attacking the positions of the Defense Forces. — Let's say two servicemen passed by and we didn't notice them. And they have already settled somewhere, taken some kind of shelter, buried themselves in a hole and are waiting for the next two. This is how accumulation occurs gradually. It's been three days, and they could already have a whole assault group there, the soldier explains. It is for this reason that surveillance of the area and listening to radio broadcasts must be round-the-clock and as thorough as possible, because even one enemy infantryman who has reached the accumulation point without hindrance is already a problem for the Ukrainian defenders on the front line. Soon, the officer speculates, the Russians will be moving near the front lines all alone, because intelligence can see them from drones at a depth of up to 5 kilometers. — Progress along the front is now measured by population centers. But it is very difficult to hold a settlement if there are no high-rise buildings there. The village is one-story houses, there is no shelter. It's fine to have some utility basement, but it usually can't withstand artillery or even mortars, let alone targeted strikes by FPV drones or UAVs. Instead, the forest or plantation can be maintained much more efficiently, the military officer emphasizes. In order to destroy a small village, he notes, it is enough to drop 6-8 KABs on it. After that, it will be almost impossible to hold it, because there will not be any suitable shelter left there. Such fortifications can be built in the forest or on the plantation, which will be very difficult to destroy with artillery fire or even aerial bombardment. — In order to demolish a fortified area in the forest, it needs to be -plowed- with tens of thousands of shells. Destroying a village is much easier. Therefore, hiding from artillery and drones is much better in thick plantations and forests. Therefore, in my subjective opinion, success should be measured and tasks should be set not by population centers, but by dense forests and forest strips. Because it is much easier to keep them, it is much easier to fight in them than in the village. Because in the village there is nothing to hold on to and we lose it very easily. Instead, we can keep the planting for a month or three, and the forest for six months, Pavlo explains his opinion. In view of this, the loss or retention of small villages should not be considered as much as key, defensible locations outside the population centers. It is by them that the successes and failures of the Defense Forces should be measured. — The relief here is very interesting, because there are folds of the terrain, differences in heights. This all defines the radio horizons for UAV flight. Now you need to maintain altitude not so much in order to put a gun there, as in order to put an antenna there and be able to fly 10 kilometers to the rear of the enemy, the officer explains. This is why it is important to maintain control over dominant heights, because their loss takes away important advantages in the use of drones. Instead, their capture by the enemy opens up significant opportunities for him to inflict damage deep into the Defense Forces' positions. — If I am pushed into some hole, then I cannot take off from there, because I do not have a radio horizon. Or I will be forced to fly at a high altitude, then the image quality will be low and, accordingly, the data quality will be low. In the same way, FPVs, if they are launched from a pit, they fly at a certain height, but when they reach the target, it may not be possible to control them, Pavlo notes. Artillery, having high-quality intelligence and targeting, can shoot from anywhere - it is not so much a high position that is important for it, but reliable shelter and high-quality camouflage, so that it is difficult to detect and hit during a counter-battery fight. The International Legion Intelligence Control Post 2 is a communications hub. Information flows here from intelligence, from strike drones, from REP. It is needed in order to collect information about the enemy, analyze it and bring it to the command. The task of the PUR is to provide the most objective and complete information so that the commander can make the right decision. - Intelligence is always the most progressive guys and girls in every unit. It is they who have the most operational information not only about the enemy, but also about their own. And when there is normal communication between the intelligence control points on this lower horizon, then the plus-minus units cooperate normally. Management is then given information on which to make objective decisions. That is, the quality of decision-making by commanders depends on how well the PURs work in the units, the officer is convinced. In order to be able to qualitatively process all the information that flows to the PUR, at least two military personnel who are able to engage, monitor and organize several processes at the same time must be on duty at the point. - The main problem with operators on the PUR is immersion in several processes at the same time. Information is processed in several - more than four - parallel processes. The thing about -standard- military is linearity. In general, our army is mostly straight linear processes, and where there is branching, there is some parallelism, problems immediately arise. Therefore, we first of all need managers - people who managed or were involved in the work of several parallel processes at the same time. The more a person can process parallel processes at the same time, the better he is an operative on duty at the PUR, the military officer notes. You can learn the technical component of work at the intelligence control post in a month. Instead, civilian experience as a project manager will be a significant advantage, because a person with the appropriate skills and abilities will be able to easily join the organization and management of several processes at the same time. It is the operative on duty who brings together a group of several servicemen needed to perform a certain task within the limits of a separate -myth- - an online meeting. This can be, for example, the pilot and drone operator, who adjust the direction of artillery fire, and the battery commander, who conducts fire damage to the enemy. At the same time, several people scattered many kilometers from each other can be within the -myth-. However, during a mission, they work as a single military body, receiving information, making decisions and executing tasks in real time. — Our intelligence control point is needed to keep a balance between desires and capabilities. In order to identify the enemy and choose the best way to defeat him. In order to constantly keep a hand on the pulse of hostilities, Pavlo emphasizes the importance of PUR 2 of the International Legion.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/25/gyustone-u-nas-problema-yak-praczyuye-punkt-upravlinnya-rozvidky-2-internaczionalnogo-legionu/	2025-01-24T20:33:46-08:00
-Digital defender- for France: the American company will build new planes for the Navy of the countr...	As emphasized in the text of the official release published by the company's management on this occasion, aircraft builders from the United States have signed a contract for the production of of the French Armed Forces three E-2D Advanced Hawkeyes, the delivery of the first of which is expected in 2027, according to ArmyInform. Grumman casually announced that the E-2D -Advanced Hawkeye- aircraft will replace the E-2C Hawkeye 2000 aircraft of the French fleet, which served for more than 25 years. -Our partnership with France has been going on for over 25 years. We are proud to have supported the French Navy with the Hawkeye 2000, and we look forward to the leap in aircraft generations with the E-2D Advanced Hawkeye,- said Northrop Grumman Vice President Janice Zilch. Since entering service with the French Navy in 1998, the E-2C Hawkeye 2000 has been a critical component of the French air defense system, supporting the Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier strike group. The new AVACS (Airborne Warning And Control System) aircraft has the ability to refuel in the air, which significantly increases its operational flexibility. Currently, France remains the only country other than the US to operate these aircraft from an aircraft carrier. If we recall the history of the creation of this aircraft, at the beginning of 2007, the Northrop Grumman company demonstrated at its plant in St. Augustine (Florida) the first E-2D -Advanced Hawkeye- radar long-range surveillance (RLDS) board. Its first flight took place on August 3 of the same year. The E-2D is equipped with Lockheed Martin's AN/APY-9 electronic scanning radar, which provides enhanced search capabilities and combat applications as an airborne combat control system. The APY-9 radar has an electronically scanned active phased array. The new radar will be able to detect aircraft equipped with stealth technologies, such as the Russian Su-57 and the Chinese Chengdu J-20. According to the concept of the Navy NIFC-CA, the E-2D aircraft can direct the missile weapons of the fleet (such as missiles AIM-120 AMRAAM and missiles SM-6, which our editors talked about in their materials) on a target beyond the detection range or capabilities of the launch platform. Demonstrated in 2007, the experimental aircraft was the first of two to be built during the $2 billion System Development and Demonstration (SDD) phase of the E-2D aircraft program (a contract with the US Navy for work on the SDD phase was awarded in 2001). The US Navy has said it plans to build 75 of these aircraft over two decades. Unlike previous options, the new Advanced Hawkeye aircraft can coordinate air strikes against air, ground and sea surface targets. According to Northrop Grumman, -the E-2D aircraft will allow the armed forces to take a large amount of information from various sources and synthesize this data for active intelligence.- Along with the fact that the appearance of the new aircraft is similar to the E-2C aerial reconnaissance aircraft, the systems and capabilities presented on the E-2D aircraft have been completely improved. The aircraft's mushroom-shaped rotating radar antenna fairing, designed by L-3 Communications, features continuous scanning with a 360° field of view, along with an electronically scanning grating antenna. The system allows operators to focus radar on selected areas of interest. Operators of the E-2D also have new radar workstations, satellite communications capabilities and other tools to provide their units with enhanced situational awareness, according to Northrop Grumman. Another new feature is a modern crew cabin with increased glazing and computerized graphic displays that have replaced the previous generation's indicators and on-board radio electronics. One of the advantages is that pilots can also act as weapons system operators. In November 2007, the flight tests of the E-2D aircraft were completed in the USA. The machine spent about 600 hours in the air. Half of them were dedicated to testing the functionality of radar systems. And during the tests, no significant deficiencies were found in the aircraft's systems. The E-2D Advanced Hawkeye DRLO aircraft is equipped with Allison T56 turboprop engines (more than 4,000 hp) and a rotating radar dome with a diameter of 7.3 meters, which is mounted above its fuselage and wings. Spanning more than sixty years of history, the E-2 family has performed early warning and airborne surveillance functions in several countries around the world. Equipped with advanced radar and advanced combat control systems, the E-2D Advanced Hawkeye is considered the global benchmark for carrier-based early warning aircraft. With an active production line and a track record of just-in-time delivery, E-2D ensures operators stay ahead of rapidly evolving threats. By adopting the E-2D Advanced Hawkeye, the French Navy reaffirms its commitment to remain at the forefront of maritime operations, using state-of-the-art technology and long-standing partnerships to protect its national interests and effectively contribute to international security.

- Sensation of the year-: Russian fake about a Ukrainian military man who became a maniac	Let's dive into this -sensation- and analyze why it causes more laughter than fear. First, it is worth noting that the sources of this information remain very mysterious. The primary sources of such -news- often come from fringe news sites or anonymous Telegram channels known for their wild accusations and horrific -scenarios-. We are reminded of the seriousness of the situation, but mostly forget to point out that there are no verified facts and, on top of that, these stories are fantasy. Could it be such an interesting fiction, as in the old youth novels? Apparently, this is definitely not for a documentary film. The appearance of such fakes is part of a wider propaganda campaign designed to discredit the Armed Forces of Ukraine. According to the scenario, Russian propagandists are trying to present the Ukrainian military as unpredictable, who instead of protecting the country are trying to organize -cleanses- in their homes. Here is the perfect picture of a Russian propagandist: a soldier who has learned the horrors of war, is unable to control himself and turns to crime. But let's look at the reality. Most of the Ukrainian military on the front lines are distinguished by a high level of discipline and professionalism, defending the country from the aggressor every day. And think about it, do the Russians really believe that one made-up story can destroy this reputation? Disinformation of this kind is not just a fake, but a psychological game aimed at creating hatred and fear. By releasing such -news-, the Russian mass media hope not only for emotional resonance, but also for destabilization of society. In real life, of course, no one has recorded such a case, but in a moment of impasse, readers think it is better to believe spectacular headlines than to analyze reality. Returning to our -sensation-, the real question is not whether to believe this story, but how many more fakes will be invented to create the necessary image. Each new fake only confirms the statement about the unsubstantiated nature of Russian propaganda. The real challenge is to get information that seeks factual confirmation of what is happening on the front, and not to succumb to provocation. So, the next time you come across a news story about a mysterious military maniac, remember that it's most likely just another piece of the disinformation game.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/25/sensacziya-roku-rosfejk-pro-ukrayinskogo-vijskovogo-yakyj-stav-maniyakom/	2025-01-24T20:10:49-08:00
