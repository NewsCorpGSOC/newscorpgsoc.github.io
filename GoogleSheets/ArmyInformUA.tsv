On the position of the CAESAR self-propelled artillery installation, we leave in anticipation of combat work. You don't have to wait too long after arrival - before the command -Cannon to battle!- we barely have time to inspect the positions of the gunners. This is a deep caponir, in which a considerable French self-propelled gun is completely sheltered, as well as a dugout of artillerymen and two separate ammunition storages, one with shells, the other with gunpowder charges, far from the gun and the shelter of the gunners . Positions are disguised so that they can be seen at a distance of several dozen steps is almost impossible. Even knowing that gunners are stationed somewhere here, one has to look closely to see traces of people and equipment. Separate storage of ammunition in two stacks away from the gun and the dugout is necessary so that the shelter of the gunners, the -self-propelled gun-, projectiles or gunpowder could not be hit with one ammunition. At the same time, from two to five dozen charges at a distance of 20‒30 meters from the gun. This amount is enough for effective combat work and at the same time it allows not to expose the position to the danger of losing a significant amount of ammunition. — Depending on the situation and tasks, there may be 50-60 charges at the same time, but, as a rule, we try distribute them so that the enemy's random projectile does not cause terrible damage, - says the commander of the artillery division, Major Nazar Balagutrak. Later at the command post, the officers will explain the priorities of such arrangement of the position: in the first place is the preservation of the lives of the soldiers, in the second place - equipment, in the third place - ammunition. live contact with settlement fighters, find out their needs and monitor combat work. — I try to visit positions, look people in the eye, thank them to them for their work. Or not to thank, but to scold, if they suddenly become stupid. But in most cases, I praise them, because they not only try, but also do well, - says the commander of the artillery division, Major Nazar Balagutrak. humanity in wartime should also be taken into account purely economic criteria, no matter how cynical it sounds, for the first view. - People are an irreplaceable resource. You can sacrifice any equipment just to save a human life. This is primarily from a purely human point of view. But if you calculate how much it costs the state to train one artilleryman, prepare a calculation, then the sums will be huge, - the military officer explains his opinion. So finding ammunition, repairing damaged or replacing lost equipment is much easier and ultimately cheaper than to train experienced artillerymen, provide treatment and rehabilitation of the wounded or pay the families of the dead. Major Nazar Balagutrak is a military man who has connected his life with the Armed Forces since his youth. Since 2019, he has participated in Operation United Forces, at the front from the very first day of a large-scale invasion. Comparing the combat operations of the time of the OOS with the current war, the officer draws attention not only to the colossal increase in the intensity of combat operations, but also on the delegation of authority and responsibility, which did not exist before. — It is difficult to compare the war of the time of the Soviet war after 2022. It was much easier in the OOS — everyone already knew the positions and simply changed brigade to brigade during rotation, handed over and organized combat duty, he says. Now it is necessary to completely organize combat work in a new place from scratch - move the military body, set up positions, establish management and logistics, solve many related issues. — You understand that there are people behind you, there are weapons behind you, and it is necessary to protect, firstly, people, and secondly, to fulfill the assigned combat task with the available forces there. You have to make accurate and correct decisions, because your life and the lives of your people depend on them, - explains the commander of the art division. Lieutenant Petro Molodik, who participated in the anti-terrorist operation in 2014‒2015 , says that all his experience of about one and a half years at that time can be invested in three days of war after the start of a large-scale invasion. In France, fighting on -Caesars- both experienced combat gunners, such as the officers we are talking to, and newcomers, who over the course of two months underwent basic combined military training and professional training in Ukraine, studied. training for gunners at the 199 training center of the Military Academy in Zhytomyr. Even before we went to France, we had a formation of batteries and tactical exercises with live fire, says Major Nazar Balagutrak. fighters to perform combat tasks and the suitability of the unit to participate in combat operations. The first stage is BZVP, the second is individual training in a specialty, the third is collective training as part of an entire unit. - Studying in France is a great experience, because the opportunity to form a unit from scratch is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. As you make him, so he will fight. We were very lucky with the fighters, especially with the firemen, because the people all came with the right attitude, says Lieutenant Petro Molodik. like clockwork — quickly and flawlessly. From the team -Cannon to battle!- just over a minute passes before a shot is fired. During this time, the fighters have time to set up the gun, perform guidance, raise the projectile and gunpowder, and charge the self-propelled gun. Following the first shot, the next one takes place almost instantly - during this time, the calculation has already managed to make adjustments and deliver the charge. For their knowledge of the Caesar self-propelled guns and the ability to work with a cannon, the calculation fighters owe their training in France. It was there that they polished the skills acquired in Ukraine to an impeccable level and learned a lot of useful things about the -self-propelled gun- from experienced French colleagues. - The most important thing that the French taught us was the maintenance of the gun during combat work. From the beginning, we explained that fighters have general training, they can fire on a target, but they need to simulate combat work when the gun is damaged or malfunctions. Therefore, during the exercises, the French could specially pull out a pipe or damage something in the computer so that it malfunctioned, and taught the soldiers how to calculate how to detect and correct an error, says Major Nazar Balagutrak. Also significant attention was paid to individual training by specialty and combined training with simultaneous training in tactical medicine. However, Ukrainian artillerymen note, not everything taught by French colleagues in this regard is suitable for use in the conditions of modern war. — The French have combat experience, but these are completely different theaters of combat operations — Iraq, Afghanistan , Mali in Africa. But you understand that fighting a Muscovite is a completely different story. Therefore, we had to adapt what they taught us to our realities, because ours is not the kind of war they are used to, - explains Lieutenant Petro Molodik. and tactics of combat use of artillery. For example, according to French rules, gun positions are set up at a distance of 20 kilometers from the line of battle, but in Ukrainian realities we have to set up positions at a distance twice as close. because we must have a fire maneuver in the depth of the enemy's ranks. That is, based on the technical characteristics of the gun, we have no other option than to place it 10-12 km from the anti-aircraft missile system, - says Nazar Balagutrak. The French gunners note material support and well-thought-out and well-organized logistics as the strengths of the French. - Their logistics work perfectly - this is exactly what we were sorely lacking at the beginning of the war. The French have it very well thought out and adjusted, but we started to develop in this regard only during the war, - says Major Balagutrak. On the other hand, Ukrainian artillerymen, thanks to their combat experience, have serious advantages in communication and situational awareness. - When the French saw our Delta in action, they would be shocked. They have a similar thing called -Atlas- and it is very complex, it needs secure radio communication channels. Our system works much simpler and better, - says the officer. With special pleasure, the gunners remember how they impressed their French colleagues with the accuracy of shooting. - We showed class at the shootings. There was a training ground where old tanks were broken. The French bought 200 shots for us - and our -Nettle- and the use of drones simply shocked them. Because we simply raised the -Mavik- and from the third shot, having the plug -missed - flight-, put the projectile directly into the tank, - smiles Lieutenant Petro Molody. So the French gunners not only taught the Ukrainians, but also learned themselves, having tried to apply the acquired knowledge in practice at the end of the training. The officers say that the foreign colleagues succeeded quite well, because the level of their basic training is very high. - Everyone likes the comparison with cars. Let's put it this way, 2C1 -Carnation- against -Caesar- is like my father's old -nine- and a good -Mercedes-. The -Nine- drives and she doesn't care, and the -Mercedes- is comfortable, but if the on-board computer is covered there - that's it, call a tow truck, - Lieutenant Petro Molodik says about the advantages of the -Caesar- ACS. The advantages of -Caesar- are obvious, but a complex computerized system can cause an unexpected failure in small moments that can negatively affect the work of self-propelled artillery installations. As an example, gunners talk about the work of a -self-propelled gun- during frost. -Caesar- has many moving parts, and if moisture gets between them and freezes, the system may malfunction. — Because if a little moisture gets in, it freezes and this affects the operation of the sensors. The pressure of the hydraulic system is 200 atmospheres, it is definitely enough to expand the cannon. But the sensors are very sensitive and start to fail. Therefore, it is necessary to disassemble and assemble the cannon every two hours, - explains the officer. In addition, the gunners pay attention to the resource of the cannon barrel of 4 thousand shots, noting that during intensive combat work it will be good if it is enough for 10 months, if not less. And also for the failure of fighters during intense shooting. However, it is not difficult to replace them, because there are spare ones in the kit. However, -Caesar- has significantly more advantages - from several ways of quickly binding to the terrain to the ability to almost instantly calculate individual corrections for each gun when firing . A significant advantage of -Caesar- for ensuring shooting accuracy is the ballistic station, which measures the initial speed of the projectile at the exit from the barrel. Towards the end of the conversation, we return to the greatest advantage of Ukrainian artillerymen. These are motivated and well-trained fighters of gun calculations. During exercises in France, they gave a head start even to younger, stronger and more trained French colleagues and in competitions with crews of foreign colleagues on accuracy and speed of fire they won with a score of 3:1. — You know what they are in did we win In a tug of war! Because there are all young healthy guys, 18‒25 years old, many representatives of the peoples of French Polynesia — healthy, stocky, very strong. And we have older men, says Lieutenant Petro Molodik. However, when it came to combat shooting, the Ukrainians -showed their class- and performed better than the French teachers themselves. — When a person fights for his Motherland, when he understands who and what is behind his back, it is a completely different feeling than participating in military conflicts somewhere far from home on a foreign land. -Patriotism is not an empty word,- says Major Nazar Balagutrak, speaking highly of the soldiers of the gun combat units. Each of them bears the names of Ukrainian hetmans and military leaders — Bohdan Khmelnytskyi, Ivan Mazepa, Petro Skoropadskyi, Simon Petliura and even Nestor Makhna. This is how the French self-propelled guns -Caesar- received Ukrainian callsigns from the 155th brigade named after Anna of Kyiv. The gun, the combat work of whose crew we observed at the positions, is named after Hetman Petro Konashevich-Sagaidachny. Like her heavenly patron, who marched on Moscow, she strikes Muscovites with mercilessly murderous precision.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/12/franczuzkyj-czezar-dlya-anny-kyyivskoyi-yak-vchylys-i-voyuyut-artylerysty-155-brygady-reportazh-armiyainform/	2025-01-11T21:22:20-08:00

Hitchhiker stops drones: US companies join forces with AI to counter barrage munitions	As stated in the information from the authors platforms UNITED24, this partnership brings together IronDome IronNet , a cyber threat detection system, with Asterion's experience at neutralization of unmanned aerial targets. This synergy is aimed at meeting the Pentagon's growing demand for integrated defense solutions, ArmyInform reports. //www.newsweek.com/->magazine Newsweek, the advanced interceptor drone HitchHiker (-Hitchhiker-, in Ukrainian) is an advanced platform designed to counter a wide range of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), not only increases battlefield situational awareness, but is also an effective tool for neutralizing aerial threats. Its deployment underscores the growing role of advanced technology in modern warfare. HitchHiker is a multi-role unmanned interceptor aircraft capable of speeds of up to 450 km/h with a range of 200 kilometers. The system integrates advanced sensors for situational awareness and a secure network environment that enables early detection of enemy drones. Experts in the Netherlands portal Arms Market Research Army Recognition said that the HitchHiker is launched through the ASTERION PERIMASTER C4 system, a sophisticated command-and-control platform that integrates data from long-range sensors. This system places the HitchHiker directly behind incoming threats, allowing operators to visually inspect potential targets in real-time before neutralizing them or recalling the drone to base This flexibility makes the drone valuable for both surveillance and direct action missions. One of the defining features of the HitchHiker is its ability to automatically launch from fixed or mobile platforms. This capability allows it to quickly respond to threats and even counter swarms of drones, a growing concern in today's conflicts. By automating launch and operation, the system reduces response time and maximizes battlefield effectiveness. Looking ahead, Asterion Systems is developing a reactive version of the HitchHiker capable of engaging high-speed reactive UAVs. This upgrade will further expand the tactical application of the drone, allowing it to intercept targets beyond the reach of current electric models and solidifying its position as a leading anti-UAV technology. In today's fast-changing battlefield landscape, HitchHiker deployment is essential addition to the defense arsenal of any country. As conflicts increasingly use UAVs for intelligence, surveillance and strike, platforms like HitchHiker provide a significant advantage. By integrating advanced artificial intelligence and autonomous systems, HitchHiker not only strengthens defense capabilities, but also offers a glimpse into the future of drone warfare. Success in the trials could pave the way for wider deployment across NATO forces, setting a new standard for anti-drone solutions in modern warfare. Rear Admiral Mike Hewitt, director of IronNet, described HitchHiker as a -picture- for warfighters capabilities with the potential to change the dynamics of modern warfare. Economic operation of a drone that uses an all-electric propulsion system provides lower operational requirements and maintenance costs compared to traditional air defense systems such as expensive Patriot missiles.

A fake about NATO generals in Dnipro hospitals: why is it the enemy?	In the news circulating on Russian channels, it is said that Ukrainian hospitals, in particular in Dnipro, are receiving NATO officers en masse after the -defeats- of the Armed Forces on the battlefield. Kremlin -journalists- even invented -informants- who saw how -foreigners with expensive equipment- were allegedly brought to hospitals, and the entrance to hospitals was guarded by SBU units. And, of course, all patients speak English! In fact, hospitals in Dnipro, as well as in many other Ukrainian cities, are full of our soldiers who risk their lives every day defending Ukraine. They are heroes treated by dedicated doctors. There are no -high-ranking NATO officers- there and there cannot be. This fake is another attempt by the Kremlin to explain to its own audience why the Ukrainian army turned out to be stronger than they thought. Such fakes help Russian propaganda to create the illusion of a -war with NATO- and not with Ukraine. After all, to admit that the Ukrainians themselves are defeating the Russian army is to destroy the myth of the -second army of the world-. That is why the NATO generals appear, who allegedly flooded the Dnipro hospitals. Apparently, Russian propagandists completely forgot that Ukraine has enough of its own talented commanders and strong soldiers who destroy the enemy even in such difficult conditions. As for hospitals, if there are -high-ranking- persons there, then these are our heroes, who deserve this title by their exploits. The story about the NATO generals in the Dnipro hospitals is another example of how Russian propaganda tries to hide its failures. But the truth is simple: Ukraine is fighting without needing fictional heroes. And let fictions remain for Russian talk shows - they fit there.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/12/fejk-pro-nativskyh-generaliv-u-likarnyah-dnipra-navishho-cze-vorogu/	2025-01-11T20:15:49-08:00

Mostly in the so-called rehabilitation centers for -svo- terrorists. There they will work in local clubs and entertain decommissioned -heroes- with cult events. This production practice of cultural studies students is part of the Kremlin's policy of occupying Ukraine. First of all, to Russify the youth and destroy their Ukrainian self-identity. Another thing is to impose a sense of involvement in the -Russian peace- and its exploits, and as a justification for the crimes of terrorists. And Luhansk -academy- of culture and arts is not the only one.

Life in the -failure- mode: the occupiers are creating social chaos on TOT	This was reported by Artem Lysohor, head of the Luhansk OVA. According to the official version of the occupation authorities, the reason for the delays was a -technical failure- due to which the data of tens of thousands of pensioners was lost. Now everyone who applied for Russian pensions is forced to update the information in the databases. At the same time, the situation in the field of passenger transportation in Luhansk remains critical. Back in October, transport companies complained about a shortage of about 300 drivers due to forced mobilization. Despite an attempt to attract workers by offering one-time payments of 100,000 rubles, a job as a driver in Luhansk can only be obtained through the Military Commissariat. The shortage of personnel and delays in social payments are becoming increasingly obvious consequences of Russian aggression in the occupied territories. As reported by ArmyInform, the occupiers closed entry to Lysychansk for civilians without local registration and Russian documents.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/11/zhyttya-v-rezhymi-zbij-okupanty-stvoryuyut-soczialnyj-haos-na-tot/	2025-01-11T05:15:02-08:00

The President of Ukraine disclosed the details of the operation to capture North Korean soldiers	This was announced by the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The capture was made possible thanks to the coordinated actions of tactical group No. 84 of the Special Operations Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and paratroopers. Despite the injuries, the prisoners survived and were taken to Kyiv. They are currently communicating with SBU investigators. -This was not an easy task: the Russian military usually finishes off its wounded to hide any evidence of the participation of other countries, including North Korea, in the war against Ukraine,- noted Volodymyr Zelenskyi. Detainees are provided with necessary medical care in accordance with international standards. The President also instructed the Security Service of Ukraine to ensure journalists' access to these persons so that the world learns the truth about North Korea's participation in the war. This case is yet another proof of Russia's use of military personnel from other countries for aggression against Ukraine.

One with a broken jaw, the other a talker - the first North Korean prisoners from Kurshchyna	About this reported on January 11 by the Security Service of Ukraine. Thus, the Security Service of Ukraine, which documents and investigates relevant crimes, received indisputable evidence of North Korea's participation in Russia's war against our country. We are talking about two North Korean soldiers, one of whom was captured on January 9, 2025 by the fighters of tactical group No. 84 of the SSO, and the other by paratroopers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Immediately after capture, the foreigners were provided with all necessary medical care, as provided for by the Geneva Convention. They were taken to Kyiv to carry out primary investigative measures. They are kept in proper conditions that meet the requirements of international legislation. The captives do not speak Ukrainian, English or Russian, so communication with them takes place through Korean translators in cooperation with South Korean intelligence. At the time of capture, one of the foreigners was carrying a Russian-style military ID issued in the name of another person with registration in the Republic of Tuva, Russian Federation. And the other was without documents at all. During the interrogation, the DPRK soldier, who had the ticket, told the SBU employees that this document was issued to him in Russia in the fall of 2024. Then, according to him, part of the combat units of North Korea were coordinating with Rashist groups for one week. He himself stated that he was born in 2005, held the position of a rifleman and served in the military in North Korea since 2021. It is noteworthy that the prisoner, as well as the Russian military at the beginning of the full-scale invasion, emphasizes that he was allegedly going for training, and not for the war against Ukraine. Another prisoner of war confirmed the testimony of his -partner-. He gave part of the answers to the questions in writing, because his jaw was injured. According to preliminary data, he was born in 1999, and has been serving in the North Korean army since 2016 as a sniper-reconnaissance. Currently, the SBU is conducting the necessary investigative measures to establish all the circumstances of the participation of the North Korean military in the Russian war against Ukraine. The investigation is conducted under the procedural guidance of the General Prosecutor's Office under Art. 437 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (planning, preparation, initiation and waging of an aggressive war).

There is not enough capacity: the Russians are trying to bypass Pokrovsk	reported this by the speaker of the Khortytsia operational-strategic group of troops, Major Viktor Tregubov According to him, the enemy is trying to bypass Pokrovsk, clinging to suburban buildings. -They (the Russians - ed.) do not want to engage in urban combat. They just don't go there. Our efforts are to prevent the enemy from doing this. And there (in the Pokrovska region - ed.) there is a kind of protracted struggle for small villages,- the spokesman noted. And he added that if Russia had the power to do so, it would go to Pokrovsk in the same way as it went to Toretsk, Kurakhove or Chasiv Yar: -It would simply engage in urban battles and try to destroy the city if it could not be captured. But, judging by everything, it does not have these capacities now. At least there is no way to concentrate enough forces and make enough sacrifices. Therefore, they are trying to bypass him (Pokrovsk - ed.).- Previously ArmyInform reported that the enemy does not spare its infantry in the Vremivsk direction.

The head of the communications department 48- of the separate artillery brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Bohdan Petrenko. -The course of hostilities is affected by weather conditions. First, the fogs. Limited visibility does not allow the use of reconnaissance and strike drones. Secondly, the types of soils that exist here are chernozems. They make it quite difficult for equipment to pass, and therefore it is quite difficult for the Russians to use wheeled equipment to drive on country roads,- said the head of the communications department. According to him, in such conditions, the Russians use infantry groups that try to advance: -In assaults, the Russians do not spare their infantry. A fairly common picture is when one assault group advances, for example by landing, and in order to advance they have to step over the bodies of their predecessors. In order to later become forerunners for those who will follow them.- Earlier ArmyInform reported , that Russian troops use weapons and ammunition manufactured in the DPRK.

How to get to the top sniper world league: about the marksmanship course and techniques from experie...	The sergeant-instructor of the sniper training school of the 199th training center of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine with the call sign -Zub- told ArmyInform about how the role of a sniper on the frontline has changed and how future snipers are trained. The future sergeant-instructor chose contract service in the Armed Forces of Ukraine in 2019 after, as a young man, he tried himself in various professions, but never found his vocation in civilian life. — I worked in many places, tried my hand at many things. At some point, he decided to go to serve on a contract, not knowing at the time what service in the army was like. A representative of the 79th Airborne Assault Brigade offered two vacant positions for selection - a scout and a sniper. A sniper sounds cooler, it sounds proud, so I decided to become a sniper, says the soldier. The first visit of -Zuba- to the OOS zone was in 2020 to Maryinka district - half a year before the silence regime was introduced. A year after returning from Maryinka, the district of Stanytsia Luhanska and Shchastya was included in the second rotation. There, at the end of the rotation, the sniper met a large-scale invasion of the Russian Federation. After several injuries, including a serious one, the soldier was transferred to the position of an instructor at the sniper school at the 199 training center of the DSHV, where he has been serving for almost a year - since February 2024. The sniper was not even interested in the possibility of leaving the service, because he wanted to continue protecting Ukraine from the Russian invasion. — As long as I'm alive and head-hands-legs are in place, I will serve. I love Ukraine, and although I don't like everything in our country, I am ready to fight for it. the Russians simply attacked, invaded, ruined our lives, ruined the lives of my relatives, friends, and relatives. So it's a matter of principle for me, he says. It is an honor to wear a military uniform and to be among fellow soldiers, to have respect among them, to give them and to receive support from them. Because oath and brotherhood in battle are extremely important. -Zub- says that during the large-scale invasion, the role of the front-line sniper changed a lot compared to the previous period of the war during the ATO/OOS. During the three years of the war, the sniper turned from a highly specialized fighter into a universal soldier. Before full-scale, a sniper is some kind of -semi-legendary figure- who works in a -detachment- from the main forces and no one knows what, where and how he does. A little like in the movies - your tasks, your subordination. Everything is its own, everything is separate. Now a sniper can go to war with a machine gun, and with a grenade launcher, if necessary. If he is near the positions that the enemy is storming and he understands that at that distance it is impractical to work with a rifle, then he will work with a machine gun, says the soldier. Now a sniper must be a universal soldier who cannot work exclusively with a sniper rifle, because during urban battles at short distances of 30-50 meters, an automatic rifle with a thermal imager is much more appropriate and effective. — At the beginning of the war, the first seven months, I didn't even know what a pit was. And many did not know what a pit was - especially those who worked in intelligence units, in sniper units. Arta was met simply: when flying, fell to the ground - and you are already safe, -Zub- explains. Instead, drones now — with skids and kamikaze — require reliable shelter and careful camouflage, and even that is far from always helping to escape them. — The buzz of a drone now feels scarier than the whistle of a falling mine. Because it is enough to fall on the ground from a mine - and 80% that you will not be affected. And with a drone - fall, don't fall, but if there is no shelter, then it is much more difficult to escape. And even if there is cover, the FPV can fly after you, says the sniper. Camouflage has also become significantly more difficult, because often drones are equipped with thermal imaging cameras, from which it is almost impossible to hide. — If earlier it was necessary to camouflage primarily from infantry, now everything has changed — first of all, it is necessary to camouflage from the sky, from drones. That's why we now teach cadets to take cover and camouflage from UAVs to the greatest extent, the instructor emphasizes. Enemy infantry, he says, are now virtually incapable of detecting a trained sniper and rarely attempt to do so. Instead, drones have become a major threat, so hiding from them is critical. — It is now better to spend more time learning to cloak from drones, aerial imagery, and thermal imaging drones than infantry. This is much more important now, because the enemy tries to detect snipers primarily using UAVs, says Zub. Suffering from enemy drones, the sniper is able to help his own drone operators, who cannot provide surveillance and reconnaissance due to difficult weather conditions - strong wind, high humidity, a significant drop in temperature. — In autumn and winter, with worsening weather conditions, the sniper's role as an observer increases, because these are eyes that can watch 24/7. The guys in the trenches can't look at the thermal imager or the -nightlight- continuously, every 5-7 minutes they give their eyes a rest. A sniper is trained not to take his eyes off the sight almost constantly, says the soldier. This allows you to carefully monitor the -gray zone-, because the lack of reliable round-the-clock and every-second surveillance is extremely important - according to the law of meanness, the enemy will try and be able to move unhindered precisely at the moment when no one will see him. It is impossible to start training for a sniper immediately after the BZVP, even with a very significant training target and high indicators of accuracy and accuracy of shooting - it is necessary to pass the selection at the next stage within the limits of separate training. — First of all, you need to take a marksmanship course. This is a 45-day basic course that trains infantry snipers, the entry level of sniping. -We try to take people to the basic or advanced level only after marksmanship courses,- says the instructor. Already after that, training begins for the basic and advanced level of sniping, during which specialists who work with large calibers at significant distances are trained. First of all, they teach night shooting from awkward positions, camouflage and interaction with UAVs. - Shooting - at least 3 times a week. We learn to shoot both at night and during the day, although with the start of a full-scale invasion and especially with the widespread use of drones, day work has lost its relevance. That's why we switch to night work - classes with thermal imaging cameras - how to shoot, where to shoot, how to work, how to adjust, how to install, says the instructor. The course of enhanced intensive training lasts 45 days and is mainly aimed at acquiring practical skills. Theoretical training is also available, but it is tried to be given at the same time as practical training during training, rather than spending time on separate long-term courses without a rifle in hands at the range. — It turns out that we show and explain how it works in practice, and from practice we go to theory. Often the theory written in books is for competition, for shooting in ideal conditions. -We are training a sniper for war,- Zub emphasizes. — We are trying to give the cadets as much shooting as possible from awkward positions, shooting under loads. Just lying down, let's shoot minimally, because it's very simple. We let them do it so that they -scored- their plates and understood how ballistics work. And then there are loads and awkward positions, explains the sniper. This is how preparation for real combat takes place, during which it is now very rare, almost never, to lie quietly with a rifle. — That is why we try to adapt the exercises described in the book in such a way as to adapt them to combat conditions as much as possible. Because the person we let out must be ready for the real conditions he will encounter on the front line, the instructor emphasizes. - The base course is a 308 caliber and an Archer thermal sight. Rifles, usually UAR-10 or Z-10. The increased level is already 338, 8.6 mm. And even higher is already 50 caliber, 12.7 mm. It's Barret and Cadex, says the sniper. Instructors undergo training in NATO countries - France, Britain, Norway, and then transfer knowledge and skills to cadets in Ukraine. However, -Zub- notes, foreigners also learn a lot from the Ukrainian experience. Ukrainian snipers already belong to the top world sniper league. Anyone who shows a high level and shows desire during the BZVP and marksmanship course can join their ranks after undergoing specialized training at the 199 training center of the DSHV.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/11/yak-potrapyty-do-vyshhoyi-snajperskoyi-svitovoyi-ligy-pro-marksmenskyj-kurs-ta-pryjomy-vid-dosvidchenyh-instruktoriv/	2025-01-10T21:13:09-08:00
Professionalism is not measured by age: which company is rearming sniper units of the US Army	The American publication We Are The Mighty, devoted to military topics and materials about military equipment, notes that such Thus, the history of the long process of procurement of new sniper rifles by the Ministry of Defense of the United States, which began in the early 2010s, is coming to an end. ArmyInform reports. The general contract with the Pentagon is for the Army's new sniper weapon system, the MK22 Adaptive Design Multi-Role Rifle. In turn, the official website of the development company Barrett Firearms Manufacturing Inc., late November -is proud to announce that the Marine Corps Systems Command has achieved full operational capability (FOC) to field the MRAD® MK 22 Mod 0 Advanced Sniper Rifle (ASR) one year ahead of schedule term-. -The MK 22 isn't just another rifle, it's a modular, mission-adaptive system that gives the warfighter unparalleled accuracy and flexibility,- said Brian James, Barrett CEO. -We are honored to contribute to this essential effort to modernize the U.S. Army and Marine Corps and to support our nation's elite forces.- The MK 22, according to its developers, offers unmatched versatility with caliber conversion kits that allow easy conversion between 7.62mm, .300 Norma Magnum and .338 Norma Magnum. This adaptability improves the ability to engage targets with accuracy at long ranges. Combined with the state-of-the-art M317 Precision Day Optic, a variable-power scope that calibrates 7-35x magnification, the MK 22 provides a significant leap in capabilities over legacy sniper systems. Barrett designed the MK 22 as a complete system that provides Soldiers with an integrated solution designed to create operational efficiencies. Each rifle kit includes three barrels, a hard and soft carrying case, 15 magazines, a set of cleaning tools and accessories, a silencer, an optic with a scope mount, and special components such as a sniper scout tripod kit and anti-glare. -The MK 22 combines what was previously two rifles into a single platform, easing the burden on the Marine Corps and improving logistics efficiency,- Mr James said. -The ability to change caliber in the field ensures that Marines are ready for any mission, anytime, anywhere.- Another important advantage of the MK 22 is its durability. Maintenance is simplified, most repairs will now be done at the organizational level. In the rare event of a barrel failure, the rifle can be quickly converted to a different caliber, providing continuous operational readiness, an improvement that was unattainable with previous systems. -At Barrett Firearms, we are committed to equipping our armed forces with the tools they need to succeed on the ever-changing battlefield,- said Brian James, Barrett CEO. -The advanced MK 22 Mod 0 sniper rifle exemplifies our commitment to precision, innovation and mission success. As the Marine Corps enters this new era of sniping capabilities, Barrett is ready to support their efforts and the future fight.- As the experts of the Dutch defense research portal Army Recognition told, the MK 22 Mod 0 sniper rifle was developed and manufactured by the American company Barrett, known for its high-precision long-range rifles. Barrett is well known in the market for the M82 .50 caliber sniper rifle, and the MK 22 continues their legacy of creating state-of-the-art sniper systems for military and law enforcement applications. The MK 22 Mod 0 is a large-caliber modular sniper rifle designed to engage targets at distances of 1,500 meters and beyond, meeting the growing need for long-range accuracy in a variety of operational environments. Despite the fact that Barrett Firearms is a young company by the standards of the arms world (it was founded in 1982), Barrett has already managed to make a name for itself as a manufacturer of quality small arms, optical devices and ammunition. The headquarters of the company is located in the state of Tennessee in the city of Murfreesboro. The main focus of the company's work for many years has been large-caliber sniper rifles. After completing the Full Operational Capability stage, the MK 22 Mod 0 ASR (Advanced Sniper Rifle) is now fully operational and available for use by Marine Corps sniper teams. The ongoing success of this program underscores the US Army's commitment to modernizing its equipment and equipping its military personnel with the best possible tools to succeed in any combat environment. As the US Marine Corps continues to improve its sniper capabilities, the MK 22 will become a cornerstone of its strategy to ensure long-range combat superiority. Emphasis will now shift to continuous training, maintenance and operational integration to ensure the MK 22 remains an effective and reliable asset for years to come. US Marines test the new MK 22 ASR bolt-action rifle.

Cash support in the Armed Forces: how much will be paid in 2025	For the year 2025, significant changes in the cash supply and various payments for military personnel are not foreseen for the most part. Unless, of course, changes are made during the year that will allow for increased payments to defenders. But there are those who are promised an increase in money - cadets of higher military educational institutions. How reported by the Ministry of Defense, this was stated by the Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Serhii Melnyk at a meeting with cadets of the National Academy of Ground Forces named after Hetman Petro Sahaidachny: -As of March 2025, cadets of the 1st-2nd courses will receive payments at the level of the minimum wage in Ukraine, which is 8 thousand hryvnias. Taking into account that the salary will increase, the financial support will also increase in the corresponding ratio. Cadets of 3-4 courses, which are equivalent to contract service, will receive more than 20,000 hryvnias.- Currently, the minimum amount of financial support is 20,130 hryvnias for recruitment. And then everything depends on a very large number of factors: rank, position, seniority, etc. You can read in more detail about what the financial support consists of here. By the way, you can find out the amount of your allowance in just a few clicks. The Ministry of Defense introduced an online calculator /a>. It allows you to find out the amount of payments you should receive quite easily and quickly. You only need to know your rank, length of service and tariff class (you can find it out from the financiers of the military unit). Currently, -combat- pay is the largest financial source for many members of the military. Depending on the place of service and the tasks performed, the Ukrainian military can additionally receive 30, 50 and 100 thousand hryvnias. In addition, there is an additional payment of 70 thousand hryvnias for those who are on the front lines. 100,000 is given to servicemen who are directly participating in hostilities at forward positions, in occupied territory, or between the positions of the Defense Forces and the enemy. This reward is also given to those who carry out fire damage tasks - these are rocket launchers, gunners and anti-aircraft units. Of course, they are not directly on the conflict line. But their time working against the enemy is also counted towards the payment of the 100 thousand reward. 50 thousand are paid to those who perform combat (special) tasks as part of military administration bodies, headquarters and command, which carry out operational management of units. Including outside the areas of hostilities. 30 thousand are received by servicemen who perform combat (special) tasks in accordance with combat orders. In particular: Also, 30,000 gratuities should be paid to those engaged in demining (outside the areas of hostilities) and anti-aircraft cover and ground defense of critical infrastructure facilities. It should be taken into account that such a reward is paid in proportion to the time spent on the front line or the performance of combat missions. On average, a little more than 3 thousand hryvnias per day. For example, if you spent 10 days on the front line, the payment will be a little more than 30 thousand hryvnias. 70 thousand is intended for those who directly perform combat or special tasks on the front line with the enemy or in his rear. This surcharge does not replace -combatants-, but is in addition to them. But it works on a storage system. That is, this money should be paid only after a total of 30 days have passed on the front line. It can be for several months. This is a one-time benefit for servicemen signing their first contract with the Armed Forces. The amount of the benefit depends on the subsistence minimum for able-bodied persons, which is approved every year in the state budget, as of January 1. In 2025, it is UAH 3,028.00. So now, after concluding a contract, you can get: This payment is provided for the military: To get help, you need to write a report in the name of the commander. This is not a complete list of additional benefits that a serviceman can receive. Some of them, for example, regarding sublease or assistance for solving social and household issues, depend on the decision of the Minister of Defense of Ukraine. After all, the order of payments is determined for each year. As soon as the order for 2025 becomes known, ArmiyaInform will immediately report about it.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/11/groshove-zabezpechennya-v-zsu-skilky-platyat-u-2025-roczi/	2025-01-10T20:48:55-08:00
Intergalactic mercenaries on the side of the Armed Forces: another fantasy from the Kremlin kitchen	According to the Kremlin fantasists, these -mercenaries- are not only part of the Ukrainian army, but also plan to attack peaceful Russian citizens, disguising themselves in Russian military uniforms. Why not add flying saucers to it, or at least spies in the form of crows? It would be no less plausible. This entire narrative is a common attempt by Russian propaganda to explain its failures in its own border zone. The only real -threat- in the Kursk region is panic, which Moscow itself creates. Ukraine defends its territories and does not need to invent provocations or look for -mercenaries-. it is beneficial for Russian propaganda to paint the image of an -external enemy- that intimidates Russians and justifies the further militarization of society. Foreign mercenaries are a favorite subject that plays on people's imaginations. After all, how else to explain that the Kremlin will lose the war to Ukraine? This story about foreign mercenaries is another proof that propaganda in Russia works according to the principle: -It doesn't matter if there is logic, the main thing is to sound scary.- Meanwhile, the world is just wondering how deep this morass of absurdity can be.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/11/mizhgalaktychni-najmanczi-na-boczi-zsu-chergova-fantaziya-z-kremlivskoyi-kuhni/	2025-01-10T20:20:12-08:00

According to the officer, although the ammunition comes directly from North Korean factories and is -fresh-, it does not meet modern quality standards. Special remarks concern powder charges, which often have defects. -The North Korean ammunition currently used by the Russian Federation has low-quality powder charges and components. We have seen cases where shells have broken in the bore due to manufacturing defects. Such situations have already happened with the Soviet D-30 howitzers. If these defects are repeated with the North Keres self-propelled guns, it will only be better for us,- the representative of the Armed Forces noted.

About it on the air of the telethon -The only news- said the officer of the intelligence department of the brigade of NSU -Rubizh- Hero of Ukraine Vitaly Lytvyn. According to him, the Russians are actively using aerial strikes with guided aerial bombs (CABs), and the selective use of these bombs is a clear confirmation of the aggressor's intention to destroy civilian objects. -We are not observing serious strikes on military positions, on the contrary, the Russians are mercilessly destroying civilian infrastructure, in particular energy networks,- Lytvyn said. The destruction of energy facilities has become a serious problem for local residents. By the end of 2024, almost 90% of Pokrovsk's energy infrastructure was destroyed. This not only made life difficult for civilians, but also became part of the terror strategy. According to Lytvyn, at the end of 2024, the destruction of about 70 civilian buildings was recorded, which underlines the scale and systematic nature of this terror.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/10/vshhent-rosijski-vijskovi-rujnuyut-czyvilnu-infrastrukturu-pokrovska-za-dopomogoyu-kabiv/	2025-01-10T11:58:46-08:00
From armored vehicles to ATVs: how the weather changes the tactics of the Russians	He told about it on armyTV stream officer of the information and communication service of the 14th operational brigade named after Ivan Bohuna NSU -Chervona Kalyna- Maksym Bakulin. According to him, difficult weather conditions force the enemy to change their approach to combat operations, giving preference to mobile transport. -Today, the enemy does not use a single tactic. They use various means to carry out assaults. Most often, these are quadricycles or high-terrain vehicles, because heavy equipment or armored vehicles cannot overcome difficult terrain, especially swampy areas, due to weather conditions,- the officer noted. As Maxim Bakulin explained, the main assaults take place during the day, and the enemy uses the night time for preparation and planning. -The enemy mostly operates during the day, because now the day is shorter than the night. At night, they conduct preparations for assaults: reconnaissance of the area, reconnaissance and planning of attacks. Assaults are carried out in groups of up to 10 people,- Maxim Bakulin added. As reported by ArmyInform, the enemy continues active hostilities. a>, trying to capture important cities, including Pokrovsk and Myrnograd.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/10/vid-bronemashyn-do-kvadroczykliv-yak-pogoda-zminyuye-taktyku-rosiyan/	2025-01-10T11:43:01-08:00

On the Vremivskyi direction, enemy drones on fiber optics are flying deep into our rear	Senior Lieutenant Roman Rudenko, commander of the 3rd mechanized battalion of the 31st mechanized brigade, told about this on the ArmyTV stream on January 10. -Today was a very active day in the enemy's use of fiber-optic drones. If he used it not so actively before, then yesterday and today he uses it in large quantities and over a long distance. Today I noticed a range of more than 15 and up to 20 kilometers. They usually carry not very heavy ammunition, but fly very far,- said Roman Rudenko. As for the personnel of the Russians, it consists mostly of recruits. -There were prisoners who managed to serve less than a month. In one, the training lasted one day and it was only the firing of weapons, and in the second BZVP lasted only a week,- said Roman Rudenko.

But before agreeing on something, it is very important that these are serious security guarantees for Ukraine and for the whole of Europe,- the president emphasized. According to him, such guarantees should make it impossible to repeat aggression on the part of Russia, as it happened after the occupation of Crimea in 2014 and subsequent events in 2015. During the interview, Zelenskyi also noted the importance of Italy's support for Ukraine and emphasized the need to maintain European unity in the fight against Russian aggression.

$300 per head — in Odesa, a border guard cut a hole for evaders to Europe	The State Bureau of Investigation reported this on January 10. SBU employees, in cooperation with the SBU and the State Border Service, exposed a law enforcement officer who organized money on the passage of men of conscription age through the transit section of the road with the Republic of Moldova. Since the beginning of the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation into Ukraine, the transit section of the Odesa-Reni road, which passes through the territory of Moldova, has been subject to regime restrictions. In particular, the control bodies must inform the TCC about men who are subject to mobilization and try to pass the checkpoint without registration documents. In December 2024, one of the law enforcement officers decided to make a little money from the unimpeded passage of conscripts and offered a businessman he knew to transport willing men under the guise of -goods-. For the passage of such a -transit taxi- he asked to pay him $300 per passenger. According to operational data, he could let dozens of people through the post. ArmyInform reminds that it is better not to break the law or risk your life, but to use the aggregator of vacancies in the Armed Forces and recruiting centers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/10/po-300-za-golovu-na-odeshhyni-prykordonnyk-prorubav-dlya-uhylyantiv-shparynu-do-yevropy/	2025-01-10T11:03:50-08:00

According to Volodymyr Zelenskyi, these measures significantly affect the financial basis of the Russian military machine, because they block key elements of the supply chain. Russian energy companies, insurance organizations, service providers in the oil and gas industry, 184 tankers of the -shadow fleet-, as well as logistics facilities and companies from third countries were sanctioned. -It is especially worth noting the pressure on companies such as Surgutnaftogaz, which is a key financial source for the Putin regime,- Volodymr Zelenskyi emphasized. The head of state emphasized that such steps send a clear signal: criminals should be held accountable for their actions. The less income Russia receives from oil and energy resources, the sooner peace will come. The president also noted that energy resources should not be used as a weapon, as the Russian Federation does. He called on countries that respect international law to ensure a stable and reliable energy supply for the world. -We are sincerely grateful for America's leadership in holding Russia accountable. I am sure that these steps will significantly reduce oil revenues, and with it Russia's ability to continue aggression,- concluded Volodymyr Zelenskyy. As reported by ArmyInform, Ukraine continues to fight for the return home of children who were victims of illegal deportation and forced displacement by Russia.

Medic -Norman-: six destroyed enemies and 16 days of steadfast defense	His heroic story was shared on its Facebook page by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine . -Norman- is a 48-year-old combat medic of a mechanized platoon who, together with three brothers, stopped the enemy's attempts to advance deep into Ukrainian positions for 16 days. As -Norman- tells, in the composition of four fighters, they occupied two observation points that were located close to each other. -Norman- divided his men in such a way that the experienced fighters were in the front post and the younger ones were in the rear. An important element of their success was a competent position, thanks to which they became almost invisible to enemy UAVs. -Thanks to our competent position, we were practically invisible to enemy -birds-, so the enemy, coming to our positions, practically did not see us,- he notes. Considering the situation, -Norman- decided to use the available weapons in order to stop the enemy. Three cluster mines were initially planted, and one of them stopped three Russian soldiers. After that, using grenades, -Norman- destroyed three more occupiers. -We let them get as close as possible and destroyed them&#8230; The main thing is to prepare the guys, to give them an understanding of who and what to do, to tell what everyone's actions are if the enemy approaches from one side or the other. When people understand what they need to do and what to expect, then they are more confident and calm,- he explains. His calm expression and confidence help to maintain the morale of his subordinates. -I don't know, it somehow works out that way. The fighters see me, my calm expression on their faces, and, probably, they are also less nervous. Even if I'm nervous or tense, it doesn't show in any way, so the fighters feel a certain confidence in me. I don't have any other explanations,- adds the military man.From anticipation of war to the front line: how -Matroskin- became a machine gunner	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/10/medyk-norman-shist-znyshhenyh-vorogiv-ta-16-dniv-nepohytnoyi-oborony/	2025-01-10T09:19:24-08:00

Volodymyr Zelenskyi: Ukraine returned home 449 kidnapped children in 2024	President Volodymyr Zelensky reported this on January 10. -These are thousands of our children who have become victims of illegal deportation, forced displacement and detention in the temporarily occupied territories. They are going through terrible trials that should never have been a part of their childhood,- the President of Ukraine emphasized. During 2024, as part of the Bring Kids Back UA initiative, 449 Ukrainian children who were abducted by Russia and kept in temporarily occupied territories or on the territory of the Russian Federation were returned.

Russians are massively looking for their missing soldiers: the Ukrainian project received 52,000 req...	This was reported by the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. This figure does not include the dead and is 2-3 times less than the total number of missing Russians, because not all relatives turn to the Ukrainian project. The Russian authorities are trying in every possible way to hide information about the losses that the Russian army is suffering in the attempt to occupy Ukraine. The topic of missing, captured and dead occupiers is taboo in Russia. &nbsp; Using the information provided within the framework of the project, Russians get the opportunity to confirm the status of prisoners of war or the dead and to request exchanges from the Russian authorities. In 2024, information was provided about 1,570 Russian soldiers being held captive in Ukraine, of which 397 were exchanged for the Defenders of Ukraine. The statistics of appeals to the -I want to find- project show the increase in losses of the aggressor's army in Ukraine. The majority of applications relate to those missing in 2024, with 29,472 occupants. The largest number of invaders disappeared in the fields and plantations of Donetsk region — 19,025 occupiers, in particular in Pokrovsky (8,597) and Bakhmutsky (5,164) districts. Another 3,069 occupiers disappeared on the territory of Russia, mainly in the Kursk region. 63% of the missing are young men aged 17-39. Among the 20 units of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, which lead the lists in terms of the number of missing persons, 8 are staffed by illegally mobilized people in the ORDLO (-people's republics-). The Russian military leadership uses these units as -cannon fodder- and does not pay attention to the loss of personnel. 73% of Russians who contacted the -I want to find- project said that they do not support Russia's invasion of Ukraine. It seems that only after losing their loved ones, Russians begin to realize the real cost of the bloody war unleashed by their country.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/10/rosiyany-masovo-shukayut-svoyih-znyklyh-bezvisty-vijskovyh-ukrayinskyj-proyekt-otrymav-52-tysyachi-zapytiv-za-2024-rik/	2025-01-10T06:26:49-08:00

According to the soldier, in the hottest periods, his unit had to repulse up to 15 enemy assaults a day, and even under conditions of constant shelling. -They started when we just got the boats to the shore. The ground was on fire under our feet in a literal sense. Immediately something exploded in front of our boat, we miraculously survived. That, it turned out, was only the beginning of hell. We were able to gain a foothold and repulsed Russian attacks around the clock,- the soldier recalls. And this happened for almost three months, until Dmytro and his comrades began to leave after the losses, but their evacuation actually failed in the end, as a result of which he was left alone on the shore with a serious wound. However, despite this, the Ukrainian marine managed to do the almost impossible, namely, to swim across the Konka River with a broken leg, and after that, to walk almost 2 km to get to his friends. -The current in the river, although it was narrow, was simply furious. I went in at one place, and went to the shore 200 meters from it. Crossed the river twice - there is an island between its arms. Then he walked through the swamps, leaning on a stick. Before that, I studied the map on -Kropyva- in detail, memorized everything, so it was as if it was in front of my eyes all the time. It took me a day and a half to reach our positions,- Dmytro said.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/10/zemlya-gorila-pid-nogamy-boyecz-zsu-88-dniv-strymuvav-z-pobratymamy-navalu-rosiyan-u-krynkah/	2025-01-10T01:48:13-08:00

Genocide of the occupiers, -secret laboratories- for -fpvishok- and printing parts for a drone on a ...	The Royal Brigade is defending one of the strategic cities in Donbass - Chasiv Yar. For more than half a year, the brigade has been destroying the occupiers and preventing the enemy from advancing. The enemy suffers colossal losses in manpower and equipment. ArmyInform asked Vyacheslav about how it is possible to deter raiders in battles in urban areas, why FPV drones have become -ambulance- on the battlefield for our infantrymen, about the work of the -secret laboratory- of maintenance of -fpvishok- and how much time requires a 3D printer to print one part for the drone. The city of Chasiv Yar is located on the heights. The occupiers really want to capture it, because it is actually the gate to Kostyantynivka, Druzhkivka and Kramatorsk. The Russian offensive on the city began back in April 2024, the 24th Brigade arrived here to replace units of the Defense Forces in June. The strategic advantage of our forces here is the channel, which makes it difficult for the enemy to move and use armored vehicles. However, the city is constantly under enemy fire: anti-aircraft missiles and constant artillery fire. the Russians are trying to cross the channel and advance in the city itself. In some areas of the city, there are heavy urban battles. -The main concept of functioning of our unit? We are organizing a local genocide of Russians in our direction. Our daily tasks are to make the world less dirty and cleaner. Fighting our defenders from the Royal Brigade is the Russian 98th Airborne Division plus attached units. Racist paratroopers are not some fools, not a bunch of mobs from the -DNR-, -LNR- or the Siberian hinterland. They know how to fight, there is nothing disorganized or chaotic, their offensive actions are thought out. But people do not mean anything to the Kremlin, the Rashists die en masse and this does not stop them for a single day. Currently, there are no significant changes in the tactics of the enemy. As before, the occupiers are betting on manpower, small assault groups. They try to cross the Siverskyi Donetsk-Donbas channel, accumulate in broken houses and basements, and then try to attack. This is a brief description of the enemy's actions. We stop enemy attacks with kamikaze drones and drops from FPV drones and Maviks. We cut the occupiers, wherever they are hiding. Our drones are always in the air. the Rashists, as they enter in small assault groups of 5-6 people, immediately disperse, run to basements, broken houses and sit. We use drones to -smoke- them out of hiding places. If it is not possible to get the Russian army out into the fresh air, we attach a powerful reset and hide the enemy under concrete slabs forever. Lately, this is what we do regularly, so as not to fly after each individual rashist, we -ground- them all together in the basements. And we destroy the enemy, and he will no longer use the shelter to entrench himself in the area. The main thing during combat missions is interaction with reconnaissance UAVs, strict adherence to the orders of the command, which determines the priority of targets and gives the go-ahead for use. In fact, FPV drones have become an -ambulance- for our front-line infantrymen. If the enemy did not reach our positions, then the task was completed perfectly. Once, during the occupier raid, two rioters ran into the basement of an apartment building. Our -fpvishka- flew there immediately and as many as eight Russians ran out. We were in shock. So, on that day, I remember, we caught these -paratrooper rats- hiding in the holes all over the city for more than three hours. They put everyone together. Ideally, how combat work should go: one drone - one sortie - one destroyed occupier. But it doesn't always work out that way. Sometimes more drones go to the same target. Depending on the nature of the terrain, weather conditions, pilot accuracy. Somewhere, the enemy may have been -silenced- or the radio horizon does not allow lowering, or they simply missed the target, something else, different things happen. How we work: a drone is attached to a reset system - it's a bomber. We have an FPV-kamikaze that did not catch a reset. Accordingly, the reset systems are very different, there are many variations. Incendiary substances, cumulative, fragmentation, high-explosive, thermobaric, in the word -love-dove-. Of course, in an urbanized area, we use fragmentation ammunition less, but they are always ready. There is a certain amount of cumulative ammunition in case enemy vehicles go on an assault. Russians also learn, they understand that during the day it is better not to use equipment, even with electronic devices, because sooner or later it will be -unwinded-. The enemy uses it during bad weather conditions, for example, when there is low cloud cover and a plus in the morning -in gray-. Armored vehicles jump in just to land a landing party and immediately run away. But it is quite often blown up on our mines.- The collection, maintenance, retrofitting and testing facility for FPV drones supplied to Royal Brigade units is hidden away from the front line. The boys jokingly refer to it as the -secret lab-. In fact, this place is a -fat- target for the enemy. From the outside, you'll never know what's hidden inside. Large room, multiple workstations, laptops, inspection and repair equipment, 3D printers, drone storage, staff rest beds. Work is also boiling in another room. Literally every meter of the -laboratory- is sharpened for working with drones. CCTV cameras are working so that no one from outside can enter the territory. Maintaining secrecy is important to the unit today. The guys are all in civilian clothes. The vast majority of military personnel are from Western Ukrainian regions. This is also, obviously, a brigade from Lviv Oblast. -FPV drones come to us both through government funds and through volunteer support. Almost all of them come in raw, to say the least. Before sending them to perform combat missions, it is necessary to -trust- them to a combat-ready state. The secrets to a long FPV drone life: careful maintenance and replacement of parts to ensure their reliability and durability. We check the integrity of the drone, inspect each component in detail to make sure there are no damages or weak points. These are the hull, propellers, electronics, engine and mountings. Quite often, -fpvishki- come with low-quality parts, especially the mounts for the camera, antennas and other important elements. Then -flashing- the electronic system, checking the signals from the radio system. Where it is necessary to replace the batteries, the duration of the flight depends on it. The greater the weight of the resets, the more capacious and more powerful the battery should be. Maintenance of motors and propellers is self-evident, everything is important here - noise, vibration. If the camera is weak, we change it, the same applies to the video transmitter. In general, the application of an FPV drone is a rather complicated system. This is the work of repeaters, ground stations plus remote controls, glasses. Everything must be collected and tested. Testing is carried out on a training ground. Our -lab- masters are all able to fly drones. To feel its work with your fingers. In fact, they check the maneuverability of the drone, its stabilization, how it performs at a long distance and other parameters. The FPV drone must show its best performance before sending it to combat. A priori, he must be combat-ready. This is an axiom. If there are defects, the guys find out the causes of the problems and further test them. Until it's ok. Work without days off, around the clock. Combat units for -fpvishka- are prepared in another place. Depending on the combat mission and its complexity, we prepare a certain number of FPV drones for combat sorties. Guys go to the position with a certain margin. If more is needed, we promptly deliver drones to the positions. There should always be plenty of them. It cannot be that there are few of them. Capable and abundant drones help save the lives of our infantry on the front lines. 3D printing makes almost everything for FPV drones. Parts, some fasteners, covers, different shapes, even a case for ammunition can be made. That is, it is cheap and very fast, which is the main thing. Anyone can make it themselves, you don't need to be a great specialist to learn how to work on a 3D printer. The software is launched, we draw the desired part, pour it onto the printer itself, and printing begins. For example, one mount for a video camera is printed in about 3 hours, of course, something simpler takes less time. We have plenty of plastic for printing parts. The printer works non-stop, 24/7. Honestly, I don't know how we lived without it, without a 3D printer. By the way, we also print the details on the -maviks- here. Fortunately, we have a guy who, before the Great War, was an architect in civilian life. Tyamushchy, -cuts- details on a printer like a chef ingredients for his dishes in an expensive restaurant. We are at war with the Russians, there are a lot of them. Russia presses and advances every day. Therefore, we will always lack people. More FPV drone operators and pilots are needed to destroy Russia. We must stop them and destroy them. Accordingly, as many people as possible are needed to prepare the drones for battle. We have guys with completely different specialties serving here. Humanitarians, teachers, journalists, builders, citizens of Aitiv, ordinary workers. All are self-taught, no one taught us how to hold a soldering iron in our hands. Only two of our -civilian- unit repaired computer equipment. Join the Ukrainian army. Now it is possible to independently choose a place of service, a specific division and a position, even without the participation of the TCC, if someone is afraid. Ukraine must be defended now, you cannot just sit at home and wait for Muscovites to come to your home. Our military part belongs to the list of priority equipment parts, so there should be no problems. There are recruiting centers where they will help you and the candidate will receive up-to-date information on available vacancies. By the way, the recruiting center of the 24th separate mechanized brigade named after King Danylo operates at the address: Lviv, st. Osmomysla, 9.

The actor from the series -Dilnychiy from the DVRZ- commands a platoon at the front: the story of Ju...	Before the large-scale invasion, Ihor was known to Ukrainians thanks to many films and series, in particular, -Dilnichiy z DVRZ-, where he played one of the roles. How is the Ukrainian actor doing now? Did previous production experience help in the army? But what should he say to the men who have not yet joined the Armed Forces? The junior sergeant told our correspondents about this: -I have two higher educations: one is acting, the other is economic, -Theatrical Business Organization.- It so happened that two of them helped me in the army at the same time. Because now I am acting as a platoon leader, and my organizational skills have turned out to be useful. I worked at the Kyiv Academic Theater of the Young Spectator in Lypki. By the way, the director Artur Artemenyev is there and he is also fighting now. But even on vacation, he tries to come and stage and rehearse plays. Asked me if I was ready to play. I think not yet, I cannot jump over this barrier and quickly return to civilian life. By the way, many actors from the theater have already been drafted into the army. Yes, I am known for my roles in the films -Iron Hundred-, -Mom, I love the pilot-, -District from the DVRZ-&#8230; In general, if you look at my filmography, some of my roles are military. For example, in the tape -Khalep for 5 bucks- I play a military man who was in the ATO. But when you see all this not on the set, but in real life, then, you know, in the war, everything is completely different, the other truth of life is cruel. I joined TCC in 2022. About two or three months after the beginning of the large-scale invasion, he was engaged in volunteering. Well, then I already said to myself: I can't be here, I must be there, because my duty as a citizen of Ukraine is to protect. After Buchi and Gostomel and many occupied cities, I felt that I should be there, with my brothers. My family accepted and supported my decision. Was trained in Britain. They really cooked well there. At least people do not get lost in a stressful situation after such training. The more you know and are able to do, the more chances you have to survive. When he got to the 21st separate battalion, at first they performed tasks in the Kyiv region. Then we moved to the Bakhmut direction. When commanding people, in my opinion, humanity should come first. You have to carry out combat orders, combat orders and always think about how to save personnel. But you must also have a core. Of the places where our platoon visited, the most difficult, perhaps, were in Klishchiivka, Vesely, Krasnohorivka. Although in fact it is difficult everywhere. We have enemy assaults almost 24 hours a day. Lots of drops, lots of drones, fiber optic drones. And here in civilian life you see: one is walking, the other is afraid, the other is at the border. The Great Abyss&#8230; If I had the opportunity to address the men who still live in rose-colored glasses and cling to women's skirts, I would tell them that they should understand who is behind their backs. Do I need to be reminded of this? You have to be ready to walk this path. If we don't do it, no one will do it for us. Otherwise, we will be destroyed, or the enemy will force us to fight for him. If the occupiers come, they will bring you to your knees, kill your wife and children. Because the present enemy is cruel. Therefore, civilian men should at least think about their families. This should be their main motivation. It is necessary to go to the army in order to restrain the enemy and in order for us to live normally in the future, raise children and grandchildren, work, talk and breathe freely in our country. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/10/aktor-z-serialu-dilnychyj-z-dvrz-komanduye-vzvodom-na-fronti-istoriya-molodshogo-serzhanta-igorya-pisnogo/	2025-01-09T20:33:22-08:00
Fragile killer -Shakhediv-: what is known about the anti-aircraft missiles that Ukraine will receive...	How reported ArmyInform, this was discussed at the beginning of November 2024 at a meeting in Kyiv of the Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine, Brigadier General Anatoly Klochka with by the management of the specified company. By data of the official Frankenburg portal, this defense firm from Tallinn aims to revolutionize the guidance systems in specialized weapons. The Mark 1 missile uses an AI-based situational awareness program. Frankenburg Technologies General Director Kusti Salm calls this technology reliable, and its testing in Ukraine should begin in 2025. According to him, everything is ready for testing, and the developed technology has attracted wide attention of representatives of the specialized market. -The technology is very reliable, and we will start testing it in Ukraine this year,- said Kusti Salm, which cited by Estonian news portal ERR.ee. According to the rocket builder, the project is already ready for testing. Probably based on the principles of military-commercial secrecy, this Baltic company does not reveal any details about their product. On the manufacturer's website, it is only stated that the mission of the Estonian gunsmiths is to -equip the free world with the technologies necessary to win the war-. Meanwhile, Bloomberg authors highlighted the Frankenburg company among the four leading European high-tech start-ups in the defense industry. -Estonian company with a simple motto - &#8220;Technology will win in war&#8221; — produces cheap missiles to shoot down drones that use software to accurately hit targets,- Bloomberg notes. According to Kusti Salma, a possible ceasefire in Ukraine will not reduce the demand for new weapons. > -There will be a new and much larger war in Europe,- he predicted gloomily in a conversation with Bloomberg reporters. In turn, analysts of the research portal According to information from open sources, the ICC Defense Express (DE) made quite meaningful conclusions about this product. The publication notes that the specific characteristics of the Mark 1 anti-aircraft missile have not been published. But an official image posted on the company's website gave them a hint. -Obviously, we are talking about a very small anti-aircraft missile, perhaps with a total length of about 0.5 meters. And this is really the only possible option to mass-produce such means,- DE experts state. That is why, according to them, the photo below is obviously a full-size mockup of this anti-aircraft missile, which received other aerodynamic surfaces. span> After all, according to the researchers from IKK Defense Express, the task of the Mark 1 is to intercept drones, and therefore it is quite logical to use a comparable means. -Because objectively, of course, it is possible to hit Shahed with 7-meter missiles from the S-300, but it is orders of magnitude more profitable - with much cheaper means, if they demonstrate the appropriate effectiveness,- DE emphasizes. According to the vision of the weapon under study, the publication's experts believe that considering everything in Frankenburg Technologies made a number of absolutely correct conceptual decisions. -Based on the given description, for example, (Estonians, ed.) could use a camera and &#8220;machine vision&#8221; as a homing head. with auto-detection and auto-targeting. And such a solution is orders of magnitude cheaper than any other option with a radar, infrared, or even semi-active laser guidance system,- DE believes. there is a radio command solution, when only control signals are transmitted to the missile itself, and the ground station takes over all calculations with the missile and target alignment in space. -The small size of the rocket immediately means that its creation requires many times less solid fuel and other materials. But there remains the question of the range, height and power of the warhead,- DE emphasizes. At the same time, they tentatively took the Stinger missile as a guide: with a length of 1.5 meters, it has a range of up to 6 km, a height of up to 3.5 km, and the weight of the warhead is 2.3 kg. -If Mk 1 from Frankenburg Technologies is three times smaller, then it is possible to expect approximate parameters to 2 km in range, up to 1 km in height and a warhead weighing about 0.5 kg.

Protests that did not exist: the factory of fakes of the Russian Federation created a new fact about...	This time, the Russian media decided to -hint- to Ukrainians that they themselves allegedly do not like their own struggle for freedom. According to the scenario of the propagandists, a wave of mass protests against mobilization and the continuation of hostilities swept across Ukrainian cities. Of course, there were no such protests. But when was propaganda about the truth? Russian media said war-weary Ukrainians took to the streets to demand an end to mobilization and talks with Russia. Fake videos circulated on Telegram channels purportedly show crowds with placards shouting anti-war slogans. This -information piece- was supplemented with classic elements: The first and main proof that this event did not happen is the complete absence of mentions in independent media or even Ukrainian social networks. The modern world leaves no chance to hide large-scale rallies, no matter how much some government wants it. The second proof is the absurdity of the idea itself. Ukrainians know what they are fighting for. Even in the most difficult moments of the war, society continues to support the Armed Forces of Ukraine. There are simply no prerequisites for such protests. This fake has several functions: We are all well aware that Russian propaganda has long since turned into a theater of the absurd, where fiction and manipulation play the main roles. But every such fake can and should be exposed. Ukraine is fighting not only for its territory, but also for the truth. And every exposed fake is another victory in this war. Therefore, the next time you see the -news- about Ukrainians protesting against themselves, remember: this is another scene from a Russian drama that has nothing to do with real life.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/10/protesty-yakyh-ne-bulo-fabryka-fejkiv-rf-stvoryla-novyj-fakt-pro-ukrayinu/	2025-01-09T20:01:06-08:00
Our prisoners were tortured - three jailers-traitors from Horlivka were informed of the suspicion	This was announced by the Security Service of Ukraine on January 9. The extras are three residents of the region: Andriy Kononenko, Dmytro Andreev and Artem Karyanov, who at the beginning of the full-scale war joined the occupation -department for the execution of punishments for the DNR-. There they were appointed guards of the Russian torture chamber, which the Rashists had set up on the basis of the captured correctional colony No. 27 in Horlivka. In the torture chamber, they organized so-called -receptions-, when during the first day of imprisonment Ukrainian prisoners were beaten to death with special PR-73 batons. According to the military counterintelligence of the SBU, in this way the Rashists immediately tried to psychologically break the victims and -beat- their consent to cooperation with the Russian Federation. In case of refusal, the perpetrators imprisoned the prisoners in solitary confinement or overcrowded cells, where they were left standing for a long time, without food and water. Another form of torture used by the perpetrators was an imitation of a -shooting- with firearms, when the victims were placed against a wall and shot next to them. On the basis of the collected evidence, the investigators of the Security Service informed Andreyev, Karyanov and Kononenko in absentia about the suspicion under part. 2 Art. 28, ch. 1 Art. 438 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (war crimes committed by a group of persons based on a prior conspiracy). Since the perpetrators are in the temporarily occupied part of the territory of Donetsk region, comprehensive measures are being taken to find them and punish them. As reported by ArmyInform, law enforcement officers detained a couple suspected of involvement in the terrorist attack near the administrative building of the TCC in Dnipro.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/09/katuvaly-nashyh-polonenyh-povidomleno-pro-pidozru-3-tyuremnykam-zradnykam-z-gorlivky/	2025-01-09T11:58:22-08:00

Weather conditions will play into our hands a little. As long as the enemy does not use either light armored or heavy equipment. We are talking now about an infantry advance, about an infantry effort to storm our positions,- he said. According to him, the enemy has recently started shelling Ukrainian positions more with artillery. He is looking for our firemen and begins to have a little nightmare. Here they became more active. And the heavy bombardment intensified,- he noted. The -Italian- noted that there was fog for most of the day, so the enemy began to use artillery more. -It is very difficult to work with drones. And due to the fact that they have more ammunition, it seems to me that they like to shoot at random, like artillery training,- he explained. As reported by ArmyInform, in the Pokrovsky direction the enemy 31 times /->started collisions of varying intensity.

Drivers and doctors - what kind of specialists is the top division of the HUR looking for?	published answers to common questions about service in military intelligence on its social media pages. subdivision of GUR MOU -Artan-. In particular, the post refers to the salary and material support of intelligence officers. -Salaries are calculated according to a separate tariff grid. It can reach 200 thousand. per month: depending on the tasks and duration of stay in the area of ​​execution of the combat order,- the post says. The unit also provides personnel with food, medical aid, ammunition and transport for the period of stay in the district. At the same time, the intelligence representatives emphasized that most of the positions in -Artan- are combat positions. Therefore, the unit created an effective system of rotations of the military, so that people could restore strength after completing tasks. -We compensate the load on the military with regular rotations: after each task. This year, the unit has grown across the state. Additional positions of driver mechanics, medics, and engineers have appeared,- the department's page reports. Separately, the special officers commented on the current topic regarding the possibility of transfers. According to the published post, it is currently easier for civilians who wish to serve in intelligence to immediately mobilize to Artan than to later look for ways to transfer to GUR from the Armed Forces. The main difficulty lies in the different subordination of structures, so the procedure can be extremely long. Earlier, the officer of -Artana- with the call sign Favorite congratulated Ukrainians on the New Year and summed up the year 2024. According to him, during the year, the unit has grown many times over, and it has also been possible to significantly improve the system of intelligence support for planning operations.

That is, the work is ongoing, the reform of the procurement system in the Ministry of Defense is ongoing,- noted Hleb Kanevskyi. He recalled that in 2024 the procurement agencies of the Ministry of Defense - -State Rear Operator- and -Defense Procurement Agency- used the largest budget in the history of Ukraine for the provision of the Armed Forces during a large-scale invasion. In total, 370 billion hryvnias were mastered during one calendar year. Independent Supervisory Boards were also established in both agencies, most of whose members were chosen by recruiting companies as a result of open tenders. As reported by ArmyInform, the Ministry of Defense responded to criticism regarding changes to the charters of procurement agencies. Introducing these changes is not an attempt to destroy the procurement reform of the Ministry of Defense, but a legislative requirement to prevent threats to National Security.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/09/zakupivli-dlya-zsu-agencziyi-minoborony-gotuyutsya-do-roboty-vzhe-z-novym-byudzhetom/	2025-01-09T09:48:34-08:00

The aggressor uses its research fleet for sabotage against NATO countries — the SZR	About this reported on January 9 the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. We are talking about the Baltic, Barents and North Seas, as well as the world ocean as a whole. The capabilities and threats posed by Russian research vessels are being explored on the University of Texas platform. At first glance, the study of the world ocean is a peaceful field of activity, but in the execution of the Russian Federation it poses many risks for the modern world. Experts from the University of Texas recall the recent incident in the Irish Sea with the research vessel -Amber-, which was intercepted by the Irish Navy while deploying a UAV in the area of ​​vital underwater power and internet cables. Russia has been using hydrographic vessels for reconnaissance and sabotage against the underwater infrastructure of NATO and EU members for decades. They are taken care of by the -research fleet- of the Department of Navigation and Oceanography together with a unit of the Ministry of Defense of Russia called the -Main Directorate of Deep Sea Research-. In particular, the latter has at its disposal the special-purpose nuclear submarines BS-64 -Podmoskovye- and BS-136 -Orenburg-, research vessels -Yantar- and -Almaz-. The Russian Navy also has numerous hydrographic vessels designed for sea, river and lake surveys and pilotage work, catamarans and boats, which are often used with a dual purpose. However, despite all the alleged multifunctionality and technology, most of the vessels of the -scientific fleet of the Russian Federation- were built in the 1970s and 1980s. Soon the Russian Federation will be forced to decommission them without replacing them with new ones. At the same time, anti-Russian sanctions have significantly narrowed Moscow's opportunities to modernize and equip -scientists-. Thus, in the report of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation -On the state of national security of Russia in maritime activities- for 2017, it was emphasized the terrible condition of research vessels, the average wear of which already exceeded 80%, the average age was 34 years, and the technical condition of the majority of vessels was assessed as unsatisfactory. As reported by ArmyInform, the SSR believes that -z-pozyczyi-syly/->pressure from the USA and a negotiating track -from a position of strength- are predicted in Russia.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/09/agresor-vykorystovuye-svij-doslidnyczkyj-flot-dlya-dyversij-proty-krayin-nato-szr/	2025-01-09T09:21:08-08:00

It was implemented by our team and we hope to multiply its gains, including at the expense of frozen Russian assets in the EU in 2025,- said Hleb Kanevskyi. As ArmiyaInform reported, thanks to the implementation of the -Danish model- of support for the defense industry of Ukraine, the Armed Forces of Ukraine have already received weapons for 538 million euros.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/09/zakupivlya-zbroyi-dlya-zsu-v-minoborony-hochut-aby-ukrayinskyj-opk-finansuvavsya-za-rahunok-zamorozhenyh-rosijskyh-aktyviv/	2025-01-09T09:17:21-08:00

The Ministry of Defense responded to criticism regarding changes to the charters of procurement agen...	The director of Radio NV told about this in an interview with Radio NV. Gleb Kanevskyi of the Procurement Policy Department of the Ministry of Education and Culture. According to him, in April 2022, changes to the Law on State Property were adopted, according to which the management entity is obliged to monitor and warn of risks to national security during the management of state-owned companies. The -Defense Procurement Agency- and the -State Rear Operator- are just operating in the form of state-owned companies. -The Ministry of Defense has developed a management policy for state-owned companies. Over the past year, the charters of six strategic enterprises have already been changed. They precisely contained the rule that in the event of risks to National Security during martial law, the governing body has the function of monitoring and preventing the threat and taking measures. Including personnel,- said Hleb Kanevskyi. He emphasized that this norm applies only during martial law and only under conditions of threats to national security. -How do we see it in the Ministry?

-‎The Danish model of supporting the defense industry of Ukraine: the Armed Forces of Ukraine receiv...	About this reported in the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. These funds are the result of agreements concluded in 2024 with the Danish Ministry of Defense regarding the financing of arms procurement projects from Ukrainian manufacturers. The sources of funding are the governments of Denmark (125 million euros through the Danish national Ukraine Fund), Sweden (20 million euros), Iceland (2.7 million euros) and interest from frozen Russian assets (390 million euros). In 2024, Ukraine started with Denmark a new mechanism for financing the procurement of weapons for the Armed Forces, which was called the -Danish model-. It provides for the financing of Ukrainian defense enterprises by the Danish government. Ukraine forms a list of projects that need financing, and Danish specialists check the recommended companies, evaluate their capacity and experience in fulfilling contracts. -We are grateful to Denmark for its leadership position, steadfast support and effective implementation of the -Danish model- of cooperation with the Ukrainian defense industry. Purchased equipment is already proving its effectiveness on the battlefield, strengthening our ability to confront the enemy and bring victory closer. We hope that the example of Denmark will inspire other countries to take similar initiatives, because it will help to make a joint contribution to the future security of Europe and the world,- said the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Rustem Umyerov. -I am very proud of the cooperation between Denmark and Ukraine within the framework of the -Danish model-. I am also impressed by the speed that the Ukrainian defense industry can provide. Support already on the front line or on the way is important, and I hope that more countries will consider supporting Ukraine through its defense industry. Denmark will continue to lead,- said Danish Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen. At the first stage of implementation of the -Danish model-, Ukraine received self-propelled artillery installations -Bohdan-. Subsequently, the production of long-range drones, anti-tank and anti-ship missiles was financed. Purchasing from the Ukrainian defense industry has significant advantages: In addition, such purchases support the Ukrainian economy in times of war, allowing to preserve jobs and promote the development of domestic industry. Denmark does not stop supporting Ukraine. 135 million euros have already been reserved for further purchases in the Ukrainian defense industry in 2025. In addition, approximately 43 million euros are planned to be sent from Norway.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/09/danska-model-pidtrymky-oboronnoyi-promyslovosti-ukrayiny-zsu-otrymaly-ozbroyennya-na-538-mln-yevro/	2025-01-09T02:08:51-08:00

-Headquarters on wheels-: the trophy Russian -Linza- became a brigade command and headquarters vehic...	-During the fighting in the Sumy region, Ukrainian defenders seized a trophy from the Russians - the newest sanitary armored vehicle -Linza-. April 2022. Defense forces destroyed Russian columns and knocked out the enemy from Kiyanitsa settlement of Sumy region. It is a few kilometers from the border with the Russian Federation. Our soldiers attacked the racist machine with large-caliber machine guns, and the occupiers sharply maneuvered at the turn. Given that the car is not stable at speed and has nuances in handling, it turned over on its side. Then the Russian crew was also captured. For some time, the Lens was used as an evacuation vehicle for our wounded defenders. But she showed herself very badly. The command decided to reformat it into a command and staff vehicle to perform the functionality of -staff on wheels-, control of -battalion-brigade- level troops. Now this trophy vehicle is used for the needs of 117 separate heavy mechanized brigades of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Russian equipment is very heavy - 15.5 tons, has large dimensions: length 7.1, width 2.5 m, and height is 3.5 m. -Linza- is built on the platform of the Russian armored KamAZ -Typhoon-K-. All-wheel drive, automatic transmission, electronics, all possible functions are available to improve off-road driving, anti-mine protection of quite high quality. Accurately withstands hits from large-caliber machine guns and hits even from a grenade launcher. It was checked in practice - machine guns failed to penetrate the car's armor and windshield. As for more powerful weapons, it has not yet been tested in practice. A comfortable driving speed on the highway is about 70 km/h. It is difficult to tell on rough terrain, because the car is not stable, high speeds cannot be in it in principle. Yes, it is -passable-, overcomes obstacles, but it does not have off-road speed. That is, 20, 30, sometimes it can be 40 km/h. This is if the road is straight, normal and level. And it is very difficult for her. After all, it has a lot of weight and a high center of gravity, so it is not maneuverable. -Lens- has a very high suspension above the ground, plus armor and a heavy rear compartment, and all the weight in it is located not closer to the bottom, but in the center - closer to the top. Therefore, it is very dangerous -on bends-. It is necessary to have a very experienced driver who knows how to drive this car with confidence. Of interest, there are also tire inflation, hydraulic brakes, a winch in front of the car, and a crane installed in the back. the Rashists used it to load their wounded into the car. This crane can also be used to assist other vehicles. The car is quite economical, fuel consumption is more than 20 liters per hundred kilometers in more or less calm driving conditions. First of all, a local communication network based on ASL-SAN devices is installed inside for crew communication. Previously, this was not the case, in fact, it was impossible to contact the driver on the move. How the Russians communicated with each other is not clear. Five workstations are equipped: desktop, screen, radios and laptops. Equipped workplace of the brigade commander. Plus, the work is provided by two -starlinks-, one in the automotive version to provide communication directly while driving, and one is completed as a regular -starlink- for already stationary deployment. There is, of course, a generator, its own autonomous power supply. The machine has the option of installing cryptographic protection devices. To provide secure communication during battle management or during unit communication and interaction. It is not always possible to deploy a stationary command post, such as a battalion or brigade, in a timely and operational manner. At this time, the command and staff vehicle assumes the role of this command point, can move, constantly change its location. And with it, a brigade commander or chief of staff can conduct quality management of troops. It can also be a maneuvering vehicle during some assault operations. The commander can be on it relatively close to the front line and competently manage his subordinate units. As much as this car, due to its large dimensions, attracts a lot of attention, you can't get too close to the collision line. Usually, this distance is 20-30 km, it can be even closer. If, of course, there is a need for it. Everything depends on the conditions and circumstances at the front. The work in this machine is built on the principle of a standard command and observation post of a battalion or brigade. There are main screens with a video image, on which any broadcast, for example from a UAV, is displayed for the commander. At his workplace, he sets tasks for subordinate units through communication channels. Next to the commander at the workplaces according to the directions are, for example, air defense, EW, artillery, reconnaissance, UAV control, etc. That is, people from the appropriate departments or services of the brigade also join the crew, work here, manage the battle and provide all the necessary information to the commander. The armed brigade has Roshel Senator armored vehicles, some of them are also used as command and staff vehicles. They were transferred as part of international military-technical assistance from Canada. If these machines are compared with the Russian -Linza-, they are ahead of it in some technical parameters. For example, Canadian combat vehicles are much lighter, weighing around 8 tons depending on equipment and upgrades. -Rochelles- are faster, more maneuverable, lower on the road and, most importantly, less noticeable. They are much better than -Lens- in the context of engine electronics. Because here in the Russians, everything is built on the basis of KAMAZ, plus their engineers tried to develop some -their own- engine control units and on-board computers for it. But it all looks very primitive like most all the built equipment of the Russians. It doesn't work quite as logically as it should. More time is spent to master it. Simply put, the -brain- is technologically not enough. In -Rochelle- this is all much easier to implement, because in fact it is a Ford. And this is the top level. The car is built on a Ford F-550 chassis. Seven-liter diesel engine, automatic transmission. -Canadian- is not as noticeable as this -Lens-. But at the same time, it is smaller, because of that there are fewer jobs. The landing compartment provides for 6 places. Also, the car is less armored, it has a maximum protection against a 7.62 mm machine gun. Mine protection in Rochelle is not of a very high level, unlike the Rashist machine. Due to the fact that the -Lens- has a V-shaped bottom of the case and is raised above the ground, it is more resistant to explosions. But the Roshel Senator is equipped with a system of protection against weapons of mass destruction. The car is equipped with a system that can counteract chemical, biological, radiological attacks, generating clean air inside the sealed cabin. This is definitely a big plus.- Oleksandr from Poltava. Before the large-scale invasion, he worked in areas close to the IT industry and communications. Entered the ZSU at the end of 2022. The -military commissars- flatly refused to call up, the state of health did not allow. But the boy was very persistent. At first, he served in the 5th tank brigade, over time he was transferred to the 117th brigade, which was just being formed. Back then it was just a mechanized brigade. The call sign -Turetsky- was given to Oleksandr by the commander of his unit. -It's a bit of a funny story. We lived together with the commander at the same location. Once, before the first combat deployment, I spent the whole night watching some Turkish TV series, it was a melodrama. For some reason, I was tired of action movies about war and I decided to watch something -light-. Commander in the morning: -You will be -Turkish-! That's how it took root,- Oleksandr told Komvzod.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/09/shtab-na-kolesah-zatrofeyena-rosijska-linza-stala-brygadnoyu-komandno-shtabnoyu-mashynoyu/	2025-01-08T21:07:02-08:00
-One mine destroyed three enemies at once-. The story of -Norman- from the 23rd OMBR	-Managed the position of the detachment, skillfully organized the all-round defense, maintained the stable and morale of the subordinate personnel in the position,- - say about this sergeant of the Armed Forces in the higher command. So let's get to know -Norman- better: about how he got into the army, about his combat path, interesting and funny memories from the war and a lot more - the military man told in a conversation with the correspondent of ArmiyaInform. Before the start of the full-scale war, he worked for 15 years at the insurance company PZU Ukraine in his native Kryvyi Rih. For the last 5-6 years, he was the head of the department. -We were engaged in motor insurance, housing, corporate sector insurance, medical, personal property, as well as long-term life insurance. We cooperated with banks, car dealerships, and large and medium-sized enterprises of our city,- he recalls his civilian experience. Joined the Armed Forces of Ukraine on March 3, 2022. -Then I got a call from the Military Commissariat (I already had a term of service behind me) and was offered to come to issue a summons. He passed the medical board in one day, and two or three days later he was already in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. I was sent to the Kryvyi Rih automobile battalion, which transported fuel and ammunition to the front. I was in the security company, which was engaged in the protection of transport,- he recalls. At first, the service was in Kryvyi Rih, then in Kharkiv region, then in Donetsk region. This is how the first two years of the full-scale war passed. In April 2024, he was transferred to the 23rd separate mechanized unit, where he still serves. At the BZVP, he recalls, they taught exactly those things that would be needed in battle. -There were no old -scoop- methods of fighting, such as -cover-run- and so on. There were practical things that would save my life and help me in real battles,- states the serviceman. Once, in the area of ​​the combat mission, -Norman- during the repulse of the attack, thanks to the ability to use the available weapons systems, destroyed 6 military personnel of the aggressor's army, while preserving subordinate personnel. -I don't think it's a feat - we were just doing our job. There were four of us. We occupied two SPshkas that were practically next to each other. I divided the people: so that two experienced fighters were in the front SPshka, and the young fighters were behind us. I consider the key to our success to be the fact that, thanks to our competent position, we were practically invisible to the enemy -birds-, so the enemy, entering our positions, practically did not see us. We also installed three anti-personnel mines of the fragmentation type, with which we managed to destroy three enemies at once with one mine,- recalls -Norman-. And he continues: -Then six grenades, thrown in the direction of the enemy, finished their work. Three other Russians were leaving the landing from 12:00, where we let them as close as possible and destroyed them&#8230; The main thing is to prepare the boys, to give them an understanding of who and what to do, to tell what actions everyone should take if the enemy approaches from one side or another. When people understand what they need to do and what to expect, then they are more confident and calm,- the interlocutor emphasizes. We ask how the military manages to support the morale of the soldiers. -I don't know, it somehow works out that way. The fighters see me, my calm expression, and probably feel less nervous too. Even if I'm nervous or tense, it doesn't show in any way, so the fighters feel a certain confidence in me. I have no other explanation,- says the soldier with a smile. He emphasizes: -You have to remember that thoughts materialize. If you think good and good, so it will be. If you set yourself up for a bad scenario, it will wait for you at the end. I understood this a long time ago, in everyday life - when, for example, you drive into a supermarket parking lot and already draw in your head a parking space for your car - and yes, it appears! Or a car pulls away, and your parking spot is waiting for you. It's the same in the army: I program in advance how my combat exit will be: OK, let's get to the position, we won't have any -birds- above us, or if they fly, they won't see us. But the problem with today's guys who get into the Armed Forces is that they want to get injured as soon as possible and go to the hospital for treatment.- On the same note, we ask -Norman- about the recipe for a successful commander. He modestly replies that he is not a commander, but he has the vision of such a commander. -He should be close to the fighters, breathe their life, understand their problems and what awaits them there. He himself had to go through everything that boys go through. After all, the boys' lives depend on his decisions. And subordinates should remember that their lives also depend on their actions in battle, on how they behave. You need to give your all, do everything that depends on you, as they say, -we will always manage to give up.- He recalls -Norman- and his most vivid memory, which will forever be etched in his memory - when he carried his first wounded. -We came to the dugout into which the mine landed and saw there one alive and one wounded out of four fighters. Others, unfortunately, have already died&#8230; So we saved this soldier with the call sign -Ternopil-. It was the first wounded person that I carried out of the battlefield, so I think it is like the first girl - it will be remembered for the rest of my life.'' There are also happy memories of the war - although few, but the interlocutor admits, sometimes a smile still appears on his face. -I remember Chasiv Yar, we hide from drones in the private sector. Not all locals left, some -Zhduns- lived there until the last. Almost all the houses were damaged and destroyed. Only a few survived. And so we hide from the drones, look out the window, and see a picture: a grandmother runs with a bucket through the water, crosses the road in front of her, and an FPV drone flies behind her. He only made sure that she was a civilian and flew on. But the way the grandmother christened the road,- Norman laughs. And after catching up, he tells another story: -Or we remember two local drunkards who met us before going to war. One with a bandaged head, the other with roses&#8230; Apparently, they were going on a date. Petal mines are scattered underfoot, landing pits are everywhere, and they are on a date&#8230; Sad and funny are next to each other.

Command of time: Britain plans to increase the submarine fleet with the help of unmanned submarines	As the authors of the French naval defense write edition Naval News, a team of British engineers based in Portsmouth, successfully demonstrated a new type of autonomous submarine designed specifically for military use off the southern coast of England, reports ArmyInform. BAE Systems reviews ultra-large autonomous underwater vehicle with wide customization and modification capabilities (XLAUV) Herne (-Эрн-, - Ukrainian) as a flexible platform, adaptable for various operations, including anti-submarine warfare, reconnaissance, surveillance, intelligence and electronic warfare. Commenting on the development, Scott Jamieson, BAE Systems Maritime Managing Director, said: -This will be the first time any British company has tested its advanced autonomous capabilities in this industry and I am very excited to be working with Cellula Robotics.- He further emphasized the goal of creating a system that would be -faster, more functional, more flexible and cheaper for customers-. underwater infrastructure, as well as intelligence. -We are very excited to work with BAE Systems and look forward to a demonstration that will pave the way for the future of enhanced underwater security and intelligence,- he said. a target=-_blank- rel=-nofollow- href=-https://www.baesystems.com/en/product/nautomate->Nautomate, a high quality autonomous military management system naval surface and underwater vehicles. She was successfully tested on a surface vessel earlier this year. The vessel is built within a lightweight aluminum frame that maintains a total weight of 8-10 tons, depending on payload and energy storage configuration. The Ern is 12 m long and its body has an approximately 1.7 m square cross-section. It does not have the single cylindrical hull found in typical submarines, instead the bow and stern sections are sealed, and payload bays fill freely. Therefore, items carried in payload bays must be sealed in their own pressurized containers. Payload bay modules are easy to remove and replace. The entire space of the Herne UAV could theoretically be quickly swapped out for new payloads and power packs in less than an hour. There are forward and aft payload bays, each with a volume of 2.5 thousand liters The power modules are centrally located between the bays, but the layout can be changed to create a single 5K bay. liters for larger items. These could be anti-submarine torpedoes, small UUVs, sensor arrays, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUGVs), or an anchor for anchoring to the seabed. Erne can also winch deploy fine-line towed arrays or deploy flanking sonar for anti-submarine detection/tracking missions. The vessel is designed to have neutral buoyancy and cells filled with foam to provide buoyancy , approximately equivalent to its empty weight. There are also sophisticated passive and active ballast systems to keep the vessel afloat and compensate for weight loss when payloads are deployed from the vessel underwater. In the event of a major malfunction, the Herne can be programmed to fail-safe mode, forcing the drone to ascend to the surface or sink to the bottom. The movement of an unmanned submarine is provided by two electric motors that independently drive two propellers, which provides a measure of redundancy in the unlikely event of engine failure or propeller damage. The maximum speed of the sprint is 8 knots, although it usually develops a speed of about 3 knots. Herne's diving depth reaches 3 thousand. meters, which is much deeper than any SSN or SSK. The vessel, which was originally designed to work on underwater energy infrastructure, is highly maneuverable, equipped with two sets of lateral and vertical thrusters. Power is provided by a set of lithium-ion batteries, which guarantees its operation for approximately 7-10 days . Additional batteries carried in the payload bay will allow for increased sprint speed if needed. Cellula has tested a solution where the batteries are replaced by hydrogen fuel cells, which provides a range of 5,000 km. km and 45 days of work. Due to this coverage of the water area, -Herne- has a real potential to participate in the fight against UAVs in the depths of the ocean. For example, a small Herne fleet permanently stationed in the GIUK Gap could provide a continuous guard with greater persistence and with much more lower costs than manned platforms. A successful anti-submarine weapons mission does not necessarily require sinking a submarine, but rather deterring and disrupting their operations. Such vehicles could reportedly give the military the ability to control large underwater areas without crew restrictions. span> Herne unmanned submarine.

-And the voices, -not in the topic-: propaganda voiced the American talk show in its own way. Anothe...	At first glance, the video looks like a typical fragment of a television broadcast: two presenters in the studio are commenting on something with a smile and sarcastic notes in their voices. For Russian propaganda, this is a -perfect blow- to Ukraine: they say that even our allies are already tired of the war and consider us -expendable-. But behind this -sensation- hides a rather trivial and at the same time dangerous disinformation mechanism&#8230; Wait! Let's take a closer look. The attention of disinformation researchers immediately focused on the inconsistency between the presenters' lip movements and the text behind the frame. The voice sounds -off topic- and this is the first signal to the disclosure. It turns out that this video is a mix of two completely different sources. The first component is a real excerpt of a talk show, but without context, where the presenters comment on a curious case in the United States. The second is a fabricated audio track created using deepfake technologies. Russian -fake masters- put a new soundtrack to give the video a completely different meaning. Russian propaganda uses the weakness of human thinking: we tend to believe what we see with our own eyes. The montage looks so natural that most people don't even think about checking the source. In addition, the video is focused on emotions: indignation, anger, a sense of betrayal. In an emotional state, we are less prone to critical thinking. The fact-checkers' investigation revealed that the American journalists depicted in the video did not even comment on the situation in Ukraine. At most, they publicly expressed support for our country. And the -sensational statement- about the losses of the Armed Forces is just a lying audio track created to incite despair among Ukrainians. This situation reminds us that information warfare is not just part of modern warfare. This is a front where even fake laughter becomes a weapon. And if you come across a -sensational- video, do not rush to share it on social networks. Better take a closer look, think about it, ask yourself: -Who benefits from me believing this?- If we all pay attention, we can protect the truth, no matter how loud and sharp the lies.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/09/a-golosy-to-ne-v-temu-rospropaganda-ozvuchyla-amerykanske-tok-shou-po-svoyemu-chergovyj-deepfake/	2025-01-08T20:11:48-08:00

-Stopped, unwound- — remote mining helps our soldiers repel enemy assaults	About this on the ArmyTV stream on January 8, the commander of the unmanned systems battalion of the 30th mechanized brigade with the call sign -Prosecutor- told . -They are not guided by resets, but by remote mining. Our forces are on active defense and that is where our attention should be focused. Constantly mine, mine and mine. At the base of our battalion, there are engineering and explosive workshops that can afford to manufacture munitions for remote mining. Because if the enemy is not stopped and he enters the rear zone with a column, then big problems will begin there. And when mines stop him on the way, the enemy suffers losses and abandons planned actions. And then everything goes like clockwork, we destroy them in the fields,- the -Prosecutor- said. According to him, the enemy in the Kramatorsk direction behaves defiantly, constantly carries out assault actions, both in small infantry groups and with the support of armored vehicles. Actively uses buggies and tries to go to the rear with subversive and reconnaissance groups.

They came into contact with the FSB of the Russian Federation through Telegram channels, looking for -easy- earnings. Detainees were declared suspicious for h. 2 Art. 113 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (sabotage under martial law). They face life imprisonment with confiscation of property. As reported by ArmyInform, the capital's lawyer was detained with 15 phones in his hands: an intelligence group was collecting information for Russia.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/08/pidirvaly-koliyu-pryamo-pered-potyagom-na-hmelnychchyni-zatrymaly-dyversijnu-grupu/	2025-01-08T01:15:30-08:00
The defense forces hit the oil depot that supplied fuel to the military airfield -Engels-2-	This was reported by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. In the vicinity of the target, numerous explosions were recorded, and a large-scale fire broke out. The local authorities confirm that the -industrial facility- was hit. It should be noted that this oil depot provided fuel to the military airfield -Engels-2-, where the strategic aviation of the enemy is based.

The Ministry of Defense has approved new standards of pre-medical training for servicemen	About this notified in MOU. The document includes two main standards: The first standard is designed to be used primarily in basic military training and covers training to provide care for critical bleeding, respiratory failure, chest, head and eye injuries, burns and fractures. Also, the standard includes the prevention of hypothermia, the use of an individual set of medicines and rules for the evacuation of victims. The second standard expands the list of knowledge and skills compared to the first, as it was created for the training of paramedic riflemen and their corresponding officers and sergeants, military specialists. Training units lasting from six hours focus on providing care in an adverse environment, techniques for moving victims to shelter, ensuring the patency of the airways, assessment and support of breathing and circulation, as well as features of care during evacuation. Training according to both standards involves the format of lectures with multimedia support, practical classes in small groups and simulation classes in field conditions with imitation of a combat situation. Certified instructors must use informative-evidential and explanatory-illustrative methods, as well as interactive tools, including computer equipment and educational mobile applications. Assessment of knowledge and skills will be carried out with the help of special sheets combining theoretical questions and practical tasks. Military personnel who demonstrate high potential may be recommended for further professional training in medical and military accounting specialties. -We hear the needs of the front, and one of them is quality training. The skills and knowledge required to successfully provide pre-medical care must be regulated. We formed new standards taking into account the unique combat experience of our medics and soldiers, gained in the fight against Russian aggression, and the standards of partner countries. Thanks to the implementation of this practice by the Ministry of Defense, servicemen will receive more relevant practical knowledge and skills that will help save lives on the battlefield,- said Oksana Sukhorukova, director of the Department of Health Protection of the Ministry of Defense. Implementation of these standards will ensure a high level of military training, which will allow them to effectively provide first aid in combat and other extreme situations, saving the lives and health of their fellow soldiers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/08/minoborony-zatverdylo-novi-standarty-domedychnoyi-pidgotovky-dlya-vijskovosluzhbovcziv/	2025-01-08T00:44:21-08:00

Judging by the released footage, we are talking about the reconnaissance UAVs of the occupiers SuperCam and ZaLa. As noted, enemy drones were destroyed with the help of Ukrainian-made FPV drones. -These unmanned reconnaissance systems are actively used by the enemy on all aspects of the front. As we can see in the video, the special forces have no less actively learned to shoot them down,- says the comment to the video from Omega. As reported by ArmyInform, in the Toretsk direction, the Russian invaders began to actively use -toreczkomu-napryamku/->drones controlled by a fiber optic cable, which do not jam electronic warfare equipment.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/08/speczpryznachenczi-za-den-vpolyuvaly-odrazu-dva-rozviduvalni-bpla-voroga-nad-kurahovym/	2025-01-08T00:11:45-08:00
War is not training: how Russian conscripts are thrown to the front instead of training grounds	This is discussed in an interview with Russian prisoners of war published in social the -I want to live- project, initiated by the Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War together with the GUR of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. Artem Tsepkovsky, a 22-year-old serviceman from the Voronezh region, recalls in an interview how he was sent to -training- along with other conscripts. -We were told that we were going to the training ground in Pskov, but it turned out that we were being transported to the Ukrainian border in Kurshchyna,- he says. The prisoner of war says that there was almost no combat training. They were only taught to dig trenches, and they were also promised quiet service. However, the reality turned out to be completely different - he woke up already under artillery fire. -I managed to run into the dugout when the shelling started. And the guard was less lucky - his leg was immediately torn off, and another was pierced through the calf. There were a lot of explosions, artillery was constantly working.- Without proper training and equipment, the conscripts witnessed the Ukrainian offensive, during which the commanders fled, leaving them to fend for themselves. -Our platoon leader said that we are not the first ones here, everyone is going home. But I woke up to the shelling, and everyone's pants were full. All the commanders immediately -kicked in the slippers-, says Artem. As reported by ArmyInform, a Ukrainian soldier with the call sign -Basaltas- together with his partner -Bars- carried out a successful combat sortie, during which destroyed six enemy tanks, an enemy drone and stopped the Russian infantry attack.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/08/vijna-ne-navchannya-yak-rosijskyh-strokovykiv-kydayut-na-front-zamist-poligoniv/	2025-01-08T00:07:17-08:00

The staff sergeant of the department told about this on the air of the telethon -The only news- communications of the 25th separate Sicheslav Airborne Brigade Serhiy Okishev. -The intensity of hostilities has changed, it has become greater. Now opposite us are a separate motorized rifle brigade and a motorized rifle regiment of the Russian Federation. According to our data, they were reinforced by one of the special units of the Russian army,- Serhii Okishev said. According to him, the Russians are currently operating formations that have come out of recovery in this direction. -They were forced to go to recovery, as they could not and still cannot break through the defense line at this point. That's why they obviously transferred fresh forces here for a new attempt,- explained the representative of the 25th OPDBr. Serhiy Okishev added that the occupiers use armored vehicles even less often, preferring more maneuverable vehicles such as buggies, golf carts, and passenger vehicles. In this way, they try to reach positions faster. As reported by ArmyInform, assault groups of Russians it is not possible to reach the positions of the defense forces in the Robotyn region of the Zaporizhzhia region.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/08/vorog-aktyvizuvavsya-v-napryamku-myrnograda-zamist-bronetehniky-obyrayut-bagi-ta-golf-kary/	2025-01-08T00:03:26-08:00
The occupiers in Luhansk region raised fines: new rules hit the wallets of TOT residents	This was reported by Artem Lysohor, the head of the Luhansk Regional Military Administration. The fines officially increased by one and a half times, but the occupation authorities simultaneously reduced the discount for their payment during the first 30 days from 50% to 25%. As a result, the total amount of fines actually doubled. For example, if earlier a person had to pay 500 rubles in the first month for a violation worth 1,000 rubles, now a similar fine is 1,500 rubles, with the amount in the first 30 days — 1,125 rubles. The new rates include, in particular, a fine of up to 7,500 rubles for speeding or driving into the opposite lane, as well as 45,000 rubles for driving while intoxicated. In addition, in Severodonetsk, due to the lack of mobile communication and the Internet, residents call emergency services using payphones or radio communication. Several payphones installed by the occupation administration are available during the day. At night, during the curfew, townspeople use radio transmitters to communicate with the Russian ambulance or police on the UHF range. These changes cause significant difficulties for the local population, especially in critical situations. As reported by ArmyInform, Russia has approved a development strategy that /->provides for the closure of unprofitable mines in the temporarily occupied territory of Luhansk Region.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/08/okupanty-na-luganshhyni-pidnyaly-shtrafy-novi-pravyla-vdaryly-po-gamanczyah-meshkancziv-tot/	2025-01-07T23:55:50-08:00
Our artillery hit the control point of the Russian invaders	The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine informs about this. Also, the enemy launched about five thousand artillery strikes, 139 of them from rocket salvo systems. The enemy carried out airstrikes, in particular, in the areas of Serebryanka, Verkhnyokamianske, Dilyivka, Toretsk, Katerynivka, Petrivka, Pokrovsk, Stepove, Kostiantynopol, Rozlyv, Velika Novosilka settlements of the Donetsk region. However, our soldiers inflict significant losses in manpower and equipment on the occupying forces and actively undermine the enemy's offensive potential in the rear. Over the past day, missile troops and artillery of the Defense Forces hit eight areas of concentration of personnel, weapons and military equipment and the UAV control center of the Russian invaders. As ArmiyaInform reported, the Armed Forces stopped 176 Russian attacks: tense situation in the Kursk region.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/08/nasha-arta-vdaryla-punkt-upravlinnya-rosijskyh-zagarbnykiv/	2025-01-07T23:38:37-08:00

The Armed Forces explained why the occupiers cannot reach Robotyny	The head of the communications department of the 118th of a separate mechanized brigade, Senior Lieutenant Dmytro Pelikh, commenting on the situation in the Orihiv direction. -We do not detect large enemy assault groups, the defense line is stable. We do not give a single meter of Ukrainian land to the enemy, but this does not mean that he does not take any actions against our forces,- he said. According to the military, the occupiers are forming small assault groups that try to storm the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine several times a day in order to find some weak points in their defense in order to carry out some more massive strikes on these points in the future. However, due to the peculiarities of the local landscape, all attempts of the enemy to reach Ukrainian positions will fail. -They are very bad at it. These assault groups of theirs are disposable, quite often they do not even reach their front lines, because our gunners work very well. There is such a terrain here that you can see for almost two dozen kilometers. Even from the moment the occupiers advance to our positions, we have the opportunity to see them and, accordingly, work with all available means. And to walk one and a half to two tens of kilometers towards our positions is quite a difficult task,- Dmytro Pelikh explained. According to him, the same applies to the enemy's attempts to advance with the help of armored vehicles. -In our direction (Russians - ed.) armored vehicles have not been used for a long time. Here is a rather specific place, which is mined very densely. It was replaced by the occupiers themselves back in 22-23 years. Our Defense Forces also carry out demining every day,- added the representative of the Armed Forces. As reported by ArmyInform, on the Pokrovsky direction the enemy continues its pressure, trying to bypass the city.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/08/u-zsu-poyasnyly-chomu-okupanty-ne-mozhut-dijty-do-robotynogo/	2025-01-07T23:09:10-08:00
A severed nerve, art--badminton-, revenge on the enemy dance and the Order of Bohdan Khmelnytskyi: t...	Awarded the Order of Bohdan Khmelnytsky III degree. What tasks did you perform during the anti-terrorist operation? But how did he get injured in 2022? This is what the officer told our correspondents. -After the end of the first contract, he resigned and rejoined the Armed Forces after mobilization in 2015. After distribution, he took the position of platoon commander in the 25th Parachute Brigade. At that time, it was the only brigade and the only military formation in Ukraine, which was able to carry out landings not only of personnel, but also of equipment. I did not have time to visit the hot spots because I got to the 25th in September 2015. At first, we performed tasks in Donetsk region. Later, we were sent to the Perekop district, to the administrative border with Crimea. And the main task there was to make throws to the dividing line. In this way, we found out what the enemy had on the other side. And on that side there was a lot then&#8230; If I'm not mistaken, at the factory in Armyansk there was, as a minimum, the enemy battery -Gradiv- and the D-30 division. And it was all reinforced by tanks, helicopters and their airborne units. &#8230;When you are a platoon leader, in my opinion, you should treat people the way you want to be treated. This, first of all. And secondly, you can't ask your staff to do something that you can't do yourself. Well, for example, during a large-scale invasion, when it was necessary to make wire lines of communication, to throw them directly along the front edge, then I, as the commander of the battalion communication group, brought soldiers from the communication platoon there and showed what should be done. When a commander walks with his staff, it inspires people. This is a first. And secondly, people see that if the commander leaves, he owns the situation: if something was wrong there, he would not leave. In 2016, I resigned and was enrolled in the operational reserve of the first line. In my personal opinion, OR-1 are those people who later in 2022 joined the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and thanks to whom, among other things, we are talking here now. &#8230;On February 24, 2022, of course, I returned to the army. Most of the people who came to the TCC at the beginning of the large-scale invasion were guys from OR-1, people who passed the ATO. And they had fighting spirit. Like hunting. They were predators. In a good sense of the word. Because the most dangerous predator on the planet is man. And a person who is motivated to kill as many enemies as possible brings more results. Many people then used their own automotive equipment. Most of the people who came came with their own gear. I ordered my plate carrier, for example, as far as I remember, in December or January. Because I thought it would all start in January. Because all the signs were there. And then at the beginning of a large-scale invasion, I found myself in the 95th Airborne Assault Brigade. The intelligence and sabotage group -Bravo- was formed there, and I joined it. She performed one of the tasks in 2022 in the Kyiv region in the area of ​​Kopylyv and Motyzhyn settlements. Thanks to the work of the group, many enemy armored vehicles were burned in that direction. I also want to add that our 3rd Battle Tank inflicted the main damage and liberated such settlements as Korolivka, and then Kopyliv and Motyzhyn, where the Bravo reconnaissance group worked before that. &#8230;In the summer of 2022, I performed tasks in the Kherson direction, already as part of the 46th Airmobile Brigade. I was the head of a communications group in one of the battalions. -At zero- time passes in a completely different way. You've been there for, say, two weeks, but it feels like you've been there for months. Probably because it is constantly on adrenaline. Every day then, about 100 enemy shellings took place on our site. Even on the KSP, you could not sleep properly, because this artillery -badminton- was constantly happening over you. Because we were also responsible. Initially, I had a concussion in that direction&#8230; I was leaving the room and about ten meters from me I saw the first break of the enemy NURS, and the whole package lay diagonally from me. Later, at the KSP of the battalion - and he was almost in combat formations - I received a greeting in the form of a fragment of a high-explosive shell from an enemy tank. His crew, by the way, acted very competently. Before that, I tried to destroy it with the help of our artillery for about a week and a half. But on that day, an enemy tank hit a tree with a shell near the KSP, where we were. The deputy combatant and I flew the most. It immediately felt as if the legs were dipped in boiling water and left there. The bulk of the debris passed through the notebook in the side pocket and entered the leg. It's like a shot from a shotgun at close range. And two fragments passed below the knee, cut the nerve responsible for sensitivity&#8230; But the most important thing is that we destroyed that dance after all.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/08/pererizanyj-nerv-art-badminton-pomsta-vorozhomu-tanchyku-ta-orden-bogdana-hmelnyczkogo-istoriya-kapitana-tkachuka/	2025-01-07T23:07:08-08:00

After a long drone attack on one of the advanced Russian positions and under the cover of fire from their comrades, two soldiers of the 79th brigade came forward for an assault. Having come close to the enemy dugout, paratroopers with the callsigns -Genie- and -Dummy- threw several grenades at its entrance. The occupants realized that they would not be able to get out of the hole alive and decided to surrender. They immediately put down their weapons and left the dugout. 14 representatives of the -second army of the world-. -Jin- and -Dummy- handed over the prisoners, and then returned to the cleared positions of the Russians. There, our soldiers found many more enemy weapons - 13 assault rifles, a machine gun, about 500 loaded magazines, grenade launchers and cartridges. The paratroopers set up a position and held the defense for another five days, repelling enemy assaults. -They approached us at a distance of 20 meters, we -two hundred- them. They gassed us, we had to wear gas masks a couple of times,- says the 48-year-old -Mannequin-, who has been at the front for about a month and a half. -The sector was constantly fired upon, there were drops from drones. We are not backing down, we are on the defensive,- adds 38-year-old -Jin- from Cherkasy.

It became known how many Ukrainians voted for members of the Public Anti-Corruption Council	The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine informs about this. Despite the DDoS attack, the technical team protected the voting process. Attempts to influence the course of the competition were stopped. It was because of such attacks on the Ukrainian IT infrastructure that voting was available only to users of Ukrainian networks. Some users noticed a significant number of votes from the same IP address. This is explained by the fact that the Ministry of Defense uses Cloudflare services to protect against cyber threats. Similar technologies can also be used on users' devices with enabled software tools that anonymize traffic (for example, Private Relay on macOS or iOS). As a result, the IP address 127.0.0.1 was registered in the voting logs for a number of users who voted. The identity of each user was verified through authorization through partner services BankID and Diya.Signature, and a specially appointed rapid response team monitored the transparency of the process. Special attention was paid to ensuring the possibility of voting for military personnel at the front. Thanks to access to the site through Starlink terminals and technical support, defenders were also able to participate in the elections of the anti-corruption council. The results of the online voting have been submitted to the Competition Commission for verification and will be officially released within 5 working days. As reported ArmyInform, last week 717 citizens applied to the recruiting centers of the Ukrainian army with questions about entering the military service.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/08/stalo-vidomo-skilky-ukrayincziv-progolosuvaly-za-chleniv-gromadskoyi-antykorupczijnoyi-rady/	2025-01-07T21:06:10-08:00

How to shoot down an X-101 missile: a master class from anti-aircraft gunman Andrii Panchokha	How it is to shoot down air targets from an anti-aircraft gun and from a MANPADS system, the defender of the sky told the correspondent of ArmiyaInform: -The portable anti-aircraft missile system -Igla- is a simple weapon, nothing complicated, as far as I'm concerned. You just need to -capture- the target. And given the characteristics of the weapon, understand whether you will get it. Of course, you are given a command, a colleague with an aerial situation tablet in his hands tells you from which direction the target is coming, what is the azimuth, course, range&#8230; And you are already scrolling through your head, taking everything into account. So I worked on November 17 this year. A lot of rockets were flying by the enemy at that time. The rocket enters behind. I can see her clearly. The platoon commander shouts to me: -Shoot!-. Two seconds - and my anti-aircraft missile enters the target. I'm waiting I see that I hit it. Russian cruise missile shot down and falling. And then there was the effective combat work of December 13. Our mobile fire group moved into position. We have already been informed that enemy missiles are flying in our direction. Proved course and direction information. It was seven o'clock in the morning. I see that the enemy missile is coming, and I instantly make a -stab-, that is, I activate the power battery on the MANPADS. They just gave the command that it is possible to fire from MANPADS. The target enters. I launch, knock down and she falls. It all took one minute. After searching for the wreckage and analyzing the combat work, it was established that in both of these cases, the mobile fire group shot down the Kh-101 missiles. &#8230;In order to become a MANPADS anti-aircraft gunner, I learned to use the complex on a simulator. In my opinion, it is more difficult to hit a target on a simulator than in real air combat. In total, four missiles were shot down in my combat account. We destroyed the first two with anti-aircraft guns and small arms. I joined the Air Force in 2014. Then it was time to go to the army. They left together with a friend. He came to serve in the same unit where he once served his military service, in the anti-aircraft missile regiment. Participated in the defense of Donetsk Airport as part of the -Wild Duck- unit. It was a combined unit of the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which defended the position of -Zenith-. Later, I was promoted to junior sergeant. He was the commander of the ZU-23-2 anti-aircraft installation department, the head of the radar station. Over time, he became the chief sergeant of the platoon. I'm on vacation now. When I hear about the launch of enemy missiles, I want to go on duty as soon as possible and hit some target again.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/08/yak-zbyty-raketu-h-101-majster-klas-vid-zenitnyka-andriya-panchohy/	2025-01-07T20:50:04-08:00
Heavenly punishment and a hot hunt for the invaders: -Fury- helps destroy the enemy at the front	Correspondents of ArmiyaInform visited the positions of the crew of the unmanned aerial reconnaissance and fire adjustment complex of the -Fury- artillery of the 148th separate artillery brigade of the Zhytomyr DSHV of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. By the way, the complex of Ukrainian production, which has deservedly earned the reputation of one of the most reliable and effective at the front. The positions of the boys are hidden in a Ukrainian village in the Donetsk region that was destroyed by the occupiers. The -place- is carefully disguised. Inside, there is a small room, a couch, a work table, and places to store UAVs. Let's get to know the crew: they are senior cameraman Oleksandr, pilot Mykhailo and signalman Bohdan. The guys talked about the combat capabilities of the drone, why reconnaissance of the front edge and the depth of the enemy's battle formations is important, at what distance the -Fury- can adjust the fire of our artillery on the targets of the anti-aircraft guns, and whether it really works in the mode of operation of enemy EW. The complex consists of three UAVs, three day payload modules and two night payload modules, a ground control and information processing station, an antenna and additional equipment. Oleksandr, the senior operator of the -Furia- complex, says that there is no way at the front without this UAV. Its main purpose is to conduct reconnaissance and identify the locations of the enemy: artillery installations, heavy armored vehicles, warehouses with ammunition, places of concentration of enemy infantry, etc. Plus the task of providing guidance on hitting targets and adjusting the fire of our artillery units. -Now, any movement on the front line, the approaches to it, as well as in the depth of the enemy's battle formations is almost impossible to hide. Usually, in our area of ​​responsibility, the occupiers use infantry to support tanks and artillery systems. How they mostly operate: to some point in the area, the enemy's armored vehicles deliver new -cannon fodder-, this is far from the line of contact, because they are afraid to go further. We find these places, and then our gunners destroy them. And this is just one of the typical examples of our daily work,- Oleksandr says. The paratrooper is 38 years old. He has been in the Armed Forces for almost a year and a half, mobilized, originally from the Dnipropetrovsk region. In civilian life, he was a simple electrician. -I studied like everyone else -from wheels-. The main thing is a desire to learn and constant training. I worked first on -maviks-, then switched to -wings-. Everywhere has its own peculiarities. Each technique is good in its own way. The pilot controls the UAV, the operator follows the flight, left-right, forward, control the movement. When the weather was normal, 9 flights were made. It all depends on the combat task and the circumstances,- Oleksandr shares. -Here on this section of the front, the flight range is up to 30 km. UAVs, of course, can fly even further. The flight time for this distance is up to one and a half hours. This is to fly to the destination, explore, adjust as needed and return successfully,- says pilot Mykhailo. He is 31 years old, from Ivano-Frankivsk region. Before the Great War, he worked abroad, then in Ukraine. In 2023, he enlisted in the army. He served for a short time in the 95th brigade, just when the formation of the 148th Artillery Brigade of the Russian Armed Forces began. -They said you will fly on wings, control a Furia-type UAV. Although I didn't even know what it was at that time. I said that I don't know how to drive trucks, I was then laughed at and told that it was a drone, not a car. Originally worked on the Estonian reconnaissance drone EOS. A month of training and on combat sorties. Later, he switched to -Furia-, Mykhailo recalls, smiling. Regarding other characteristics. The average speed of -Fury- is 70-80 kilometers per hour. It can fly at 120 km/h. The standard operating height is up to 1.5 km, although the -bird- can climb up to 2,500 meters. The guys say that speed is the main thing in their work, so the time to deploy the -wing- from the transport position is 5 minutes. -Furia- is able to work in semi-automatic and autonomous mode, as well as in -controlled camera- mode. It has protected digital control and data transmission channels, accurately determines the coordinates of enemy targets. Can automatically calculate corrections to adjust artillery fire on detected targets. Regarding installation of payload. These are day and night cameras for conducting reconnaissance. -Fury- works effectively under any weather conditions. Strong wind, rain, snow, frost do not harm her. We ask: is it resistant to the influence of the enemy's electronic warfare equipment. -We will not reveal our actions to the enemy. But I will say that we use some -tricks- in our work and we manage to -bypass- the means of the Electronic Security System of the Russian Federation. We carry out the combat mission in full,- Oleksandr explains. Everything is important here. You have to feel the technique. But the main thing is to navigate in the locality. For example, the pilot must constantly look at the indicators so that the board behaves -correctly-, that is, it acts correctly in the air. Day and night flights are very different. Sometimes a pilot perfectly navigates the area during the day, knows what and how, and at night the situation is completely different. It is necessary to visually remember landmarks and train. Of course, there is a program that significantly helps in piloting. It is very difficult to work when enemy EW suppresses the operation of the UAV. -Might sorties are always difficult, and even more so when suppressing the backup channel, or the video channel, or the -bird- itself. When you lose control of the video signal and so on. And you do not know any indicators, at what height the UAV is, where it is, where it was taken and, in principle, what is happening to it. This is a golden experience,- says Oleksandr. The value of using Fury at the front is obvious. The number of daily destroyed military targets of the Russian Federation in the Kurakhiv direction is a clear confirmation of this. Enemy artillery systems within the limits of counter-battery combat, armored vehicles, BMPs, tanks and even enemy air defense equipment are affected. -We work in close cooperation with all artillery units of the brigade, and sometimes we even adjust the fire of other units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which are equipped with HIMARS artillery systems. Once, during combat duty, an anti-aircraft missile complex of the Rashtites was discovered. The enemy target was located in the temporarily occupied territory of Donetsk region, more than 20 kilometers from the front line. The crew quickly recorded the coordinates of its location and handed it over to the gunners. The HIMARS calculation instantly reacted and destroyed the enemy's air defense system. In the same way, we help to -disassemble- the places where the Russians are concentrated, guns, self-propelled guns, tanks, and refueling stations. In a word, we are tracking the occupiers everywhere on our land. Once, during one sortie, -Fury- detected three -fat- racist targets: a camouflaged tank, a howitzer, and a -bekha-. This is a job we enjoy. Usually, the enemy hides equipment in forest plantations, in an urbanized area, in destroyed settlements. Masking the equipment doesn't help him much,- emphasize the guys from the crew of the -Fury- complex. But they add: they don't stay in one position for a long time, because you need to change your location often. The enemy also hunts them.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/08/kara-nebesna-ta-garyache-polyuvannya-na-okupantiv-furiya-dopomagaye-nyshhyty-protyvnyka-na-fronti/	2025-01-07T20:32:39-08:00
Three-gun monster: A European consortium is working on a new version of the continental main battle ...	According to the experts of portal Popular Mechanics, after decades of stagnation, the world of main battle tanks is heating up again thanks to the war in Ukraine, ArmyInform notes. Among several new armored vehicles presented at the Eurosatory defense exhibition in Paris was the Enhanced Main Battle Tank, Ascalon Demonstrator Turret 140 or EMBT ADT 140. The EMBT is not only equipped with a 140mm main gun – the largest of any tank – but also mounted it has 20 mm and 30 mm automatic guns. The variety of guns reflects the range of threats that modern tanks face on the battlefield: from drones to fire duels with other tanks. During the presentation in the French capital, the EMBT ADT 140 was painted in contrasting gray-olive and black colors, emphasizing its difference from previous tanks. With its sharp angles and huge gun, it stood in stark contrast to other, more familiar tanks, including the American M1A2 Abrams and even the German Leopard 2A8 on display nearby. In turn, analysts of the Dutch defense site Army Recognition believe that it was developed by a joint venture KNDS, which combines the expertise of Nexter Systems from France and Krauss-Maffei Wegmann (KMW) from Germany, EMBT aims to meet the current and future needs of European armored forces. This innovative platform embodies the continent's ambition to create a technologically advanced, autonomous defense capability. Launched in 2018, the EMBT project uses the strengths of two iconic battle tanks: the Leopard 2 and the Leclerc. By integrating the reliable and mobile Leopard 2 chassis with the Leclerc automated turret, the EMBT achieves a balance of mobility, firepower and adaptability. This hybrid design aims to redefine the standard for main battle tanks on the world stage, ensuring that they remain effective in the face of new threats. The EMBT design accommodates a crew of four, optimizing operation with two crew members in the turret (commander and gunner) and two in the hull (mechanic driver and combat operator). The tank's modular architecture ensures that it remains adaptable to future technological advances, a critical factor in the rapidly changing field of armored vehicles. The presentation of the EMBT-ADT 140 variant at Eurosatory 2024 was an important milestone. This upgraded version features the ASCALON 140mm cannon, a next-generation weapon designed to exceed current standards in range and destructive power. The developers claim that, thanks to the innovative automatic loader, the tank will be able to fire the first three rounds in 10 seconds, that is, with a record short break of 3 seconds. That being said, it is likely to be a new approach to the system using containers or rather -cassettes- for three shots, which will be fed from the ammunition stack in the aft part of the turret. The first of the secondary guns is a twin 20 mm gun mounted next to the main gun on the turret. Another, perhaps the most interesting, is the optional remote-controlled 30mm autocannon on the turret of the EMBT ADT 140. It also has a much smaller 7.62 machine gun mounted on a mini-turret that sits on the main turret. On the example of the machine, it is worth noting the growing tendency to strengthen the -anti-personnel- potential with an increase in the caliber of paired weapons, which on this machine was implemented in the form of a 20x102 mm automatic cannon with an ammunition of 300 rounds. According to release by KNDS, the tank features sensor fusion, artificial intelligence (AI), cybernetic and hybrid energy applications. However, it should be noted that what exactly it is about has not been made public. Designed with future interoperability in mind, this weapon meets the requirements of the Main Ground Combat System (MGCS), a long-term European defense initiative scheduled for deployment around 2035. To counter modern threats on the battlefield, the EMBT must incorporate modern defense technologies. They include active and passive armor, complemented by the Trophy Active Protection System (APS), which intercepts incoming projectiles before they hit. Additional features such as the E-LAWS laser warning system and GALIX smoke grenade launchers increase survivability by cloaking the tank in response to imminent threats. Multipurpose sensors provide 360-degree situational awareness, which is critical to countering challenges such as kamikaze drones and precision-guided munitions. The high-performance 1,500 horsepower EMBT engine provides an impressive range of 460 kilometers. Its adaptability to different environments, from open plains to urban environments, positions it as a versatile solution for modern warfare. Despite its technological promise, the EMBT program faces significant challenges. High development and production costs combined with system complexity may limit widespread adoption, especially among countries with limited defense budgets. The need for intensive crew training further complicates its deployment. Political and industrial differences between France and Germany also proved to be potential obstacles. Differing views on arms export policy, industrial sovereignty and the program's timeline could delay progress or require compromises that could affect the tank's ultimate capabilities. Recent trials of EMBT have demonstrated its operational relevance. The tests confirmed exceptional mobility in different terrains and proved the accuracy and power of the 140 mm ASCALON gun. The integration of advanced protection systems and sensors has proven effective against today's threats, enhancing EMBT's potential as an interim solution until the MGCS enters service. As told by /a> ArmyInform, in April 2024, German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius and his French counterpart Sebastien Lecornu distributed national responsibilities for specific technologies within the framework of the MGCS. A total of eight components were identified: a platform with a chassis and automated navigation — under the leadership of the Federal Republic of Germany; In addition to France and Germany, Belgium, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Poland are interested in the project to varying degrees. Apart from its technical achievements, the EMBT is a cornerstone of European defense cooperation. In an uncertain geopolitical climate, the project underscores the strategic value of pooling resources and expertise to meet shared security needs. Bringing Nexter and KMW together, the initiative is an example of how collaboration can overcome national differences to achieve tangible results. The EMBT program is more than a next-generation battle tank; it is a testament to the potential of joint defense efforts in Europe. Its innovation and modular design make it ideal for today's operational needs, laying the foundation for future advancements. However, the success of the program will depend on overcoming financial and political obstacles to ensure its smooth progress. As Europe seeks to strengthen its strategic autonomy, the EMBT could become a defining element in the modernization of the continent's armed forces. Its development demonstrates the power of multinational defense cooperation, setting a precedent for future initiatives aimed at ensuring Europe's collective security in a rapidly changing global environment.

Bloody Pokrovsk in the style of Hollywood: Russian screenwriters write fake action movies	Such an accusation seems so absurd that it is difficult to take it seriously. But let's figure out why exactly this fake appeared, how it is spread and what goal the Kremlin masters of disinformation are trying to achieve. We are all already well acquainted with the tactics of Russian propaganda, when events are twisted so much that they become unrecognizable. One of their favorite tricks is to accuse Ukraine of allegedly carrying out terrorist attacks or mass crimes under the guise of Russian actions. This time they chose Pokrovsk, a city that is at risk due to constant Russian shelling. The propagandists decided to declare that the Armed Forces -plan to kill the civilian population- so that later -blame it on Russia-. However, they did not explain why Ukraine, which is constantly fighting for the trust of the international community, suddenly needed such self-discrediting. - was spread through Telegram channels controlled by the Kremlin. According to the standard set of manipulative techniques they use, this time the key ones are: - Links to -anonymous sources -. As usual, the propagandists do not provide any real evidence. All allegations are based on -reports- from unknown persons. - Engagement -experts-. So-called military analysts join the propaganda, convincing viewers that -the Armed Forces are capable of everything-.. span> - Using video without context. Fake news often publishes photos or videos that have nothing to do with Pokrovsk or the Armed Forces, but are accompanied by manipulative captions. - Link to emotions. Propagandists tell gruesome thriller-style details to sow panic and fear. Pokrovsk is close to the front line, and its residents face the consequences of Russian aggression every day. The choice of this city to create a fake is not accidental: Russian propaganda is trying to undermine the trust of local residents in the Ukrainian military, which protects them from the invaders. Such statements are also part of a wider disinformation campaign aimed at creating the impression that -Ukraine is a threat to its own citizens-. The main purpose of spreading this a fake is to divert attention from one's own crimes. After all, while Kremlin propagandists paint scenarios of fictitious -crimes of the Armed Forces-, Russian troops continue to shell civilian infrastructure, kill civilians and destroy Ukrainian cities. In addition, Russia is trying to undermine the credibility of Ukraine in the international arena, showing it as a state that -poses a threat- to its own citizens.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/08/kryvavyj-pokrovsk-u-styli-gollivudu-rosijski-sczenarysty-pyshut-fejkovi-bojovyky/	2025-01-07T20:06:53-08:00

-Five kilometers... This is a marathon of courage and brotherhood- — the story of -Bear-, who carrie...	His story was told in the operational command -North-. -I remember hearing the whistling of a mortar shell, then an explosion. Opening my eyes, I saw blood dripping from my shoulder onto my body armor, and every movement caused excruciating pain, and my comrade was wounded in the legs. I put tourniquets on him and put him on my shoulders,- said the fighter. According to him, every step seemed infinitely difficult - the bulletproof vest was pressing, his hand was shaking from pain. -Five kilometers&#8230; In combat conditions, this is more than distance. This is a marathon of courage, faith and brotherhood. Time passed, each new meter seemed like the last. We fell to the ground near the evacuation point - exhausted but alive,- the man recalled. For his courage and successful performance of tasks during the battle, Serhiy was awarded an honorary badge from the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the medal -Indomitable Heroes of the Russian-Ukrainian War-. As reported by ArmyInform, a Ukrainian F-16 fighter pilot during a massive attack by Russian troops in December 2024destroyed six enemy cruise missiles in one sortie.

In the first days of the full-scale Russian invasion, he voluntarily joined the TCC, however, due to lack of military service, he was not accepted into the Armed Forces. In April 2023, Roman again volunteered and became a soldier of the 128th OGSHBr. -I got to the front line just before the counteroffensive in the summer of the 23rd, took part in the assaults, was the commander of a unit. It was hard fighting, but our company took a strip 1,200 meters wide and entrenched itself in the captured positions. the Russians have repeatedly tried to recover what was lost,- he said. According to him, he and his comrades held two points, one of which was a former Russian dugout. -And the enemy tank began to methodically -disassemble- them - in the morning, at noon and in the evening. Lupane from one position and hides, then from another position and hides again. They knew the location well,- Roman noted. During one of these attacks, a projectile hit an anti-tank mine in front of the bridge. -I was lying down and there was an explosion with a bright column of flame. Two comrades were sealed against the trench wall by the blast wave. One of them, coming to himself, shouted: -Elephant, where are you?- And then he saw my torn pants and said: -That's it, there is no Elephant-. I hear this and answer - here I am, everything is fine. I only got a concussion,- he recalled. Roman said that at night they were changed in their positions. -When we were leaving, my friend noticed two shrapnel holes in my hood. I always put a hood over my helmet, it's made of a strong, slippery fabric and it saved me - the shrapnel ricocheted instead of penetrating the helmet. I was very lucky then. And there were many such situations,- he assures. Roman has the most difficult combat memories from defending Robotyny. At that time, Ukrainian infantrymen withstood constant Russian assaults with the support of armored vehicles. -We were stormed by both pros and some homeless people or convicts without body armor and automatic weapons, with only grenades. We took many prisoners then. There were a lot of enemy corpses from past battles lying there - only bones and Russian jackets remained, no one took them away,' Roman remarked. Recently, classes with newly arrived fighters have been added to his duties. Before being sent to combat positions, everyone undergoes special training in conditions close to combat. -I immediately see how ready a person is. Sometimes, a beginner starts to get lost, he may, for example, not take the machine gun by the fuse and turn the barrel at his comrades. You have to work with them additionally. A significant part of the recruits understands where they got to, they will be useful. Although training is one thing, combat missions are another,- he remarked. Before each exit, Roman asks his group if everyone is ready. -Sometimes a fighter says he's ready, but I see he's not. Then I say wait, you will go next time. -I don't need problems at zero,- said the man. Carrying out difficult and dangerous combat missions made Roman a cold-blooded and sensible person. He treats young, healthy men who are resting and having fun in the rear without emotion. -If he doesn't want to fight, then there won't be much of him here. I personally will not take such a person to the position, because he cannot be relied on in a critical situation. I will tell you about such a case. One of our fighters successfully passed the training, but when he first got into combat positions, he couldn't do it - it didn't work for him. For some time he performed various tasks in the rear, was in another platoon, then he got to me. We talked periodically on different topics, and then I asked - are you ready to fight or not? -Ready,- he says. And he was able, he succeeded, he even became the commander of the department&#8230; Each of us has a fear, I was also afraid,- Roman emphasized. He has a comrade with the callsign -Bumper-, who was injured during a combat trip, after which he cannot fight. -Very good attack aircraft. He returned to us and is engaged in security, for which he is respected. But he will not go on combat tours due to his health. This is how one good person falls out, the other&#8230; New ones come in their place, and everyone has to find their own approach, start all over again. This is war&#8230;-, Roman summed up. As reported by ArmyInform, a Ukrainian F-16 fighter pilot during a massive attack by Russian troops in December 2024destroyed six enemy cruise missiles in one sortie. This is the first time in the history of the use of the American Fighting Falcon fighter.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/07/nas-shturmuvaly-yak-profi-tak-i-yakis-bomzhi-chy-zeky-boyecz-roman-rozpoviv-pro-oboronu-robotynogo/	2025-01-07T11:21:33-08:00

SZR: Russia predicts pressure from the US and a negotiating track -from a position of strength-	About this notifies the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. This was the forecast made by the Russian Academy of Sciences in its annual report -Russia and the World: 2025-. To implement the -victorious- scenario this year, Moscow needs significant additional resources, significant organizational efforts and favorable external conditions. Russian analysts consider two possible options for the development of events in the current year. The first is that in the second half of 2025, the administration of President Donald Trump will organize a negotiating track -from a position of strength.- U.S. pressure on Russia will include increased sanctions and increased arms supplies to Ukraine. The second option is the continuation of hostilities with gradual intensification of strikes deep into Russian territory, since Western countries do not want Ukraine to be defeated, given the investments in its support. In general, such disagreements between the official Kremlin and -scientific- circles do not affect the goal of this country - the destruction of Ukraine as a state.

In particular, units are constantly replenished with mobilized personnel to maintain a high offensive intensity. -Now, one of the largest groups on the entire front line is located in the Kurakhiv direction. Russian units consist mainly of conscripts who undergo two weeks of training and go into battle. Also, the invaders maintain a high rate of rotations in order to constantly attack.

The Ukrainian F-16 pilot set a historical record by shooting down six cruise missiles in one sortie	wrote the head of public relations service of the Air Command wrote about this Colonel Yuriy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Ignat. As Yuriy Ignat noted, the massive shelling took place on December 13, 2024. The enemy launched almost 200 drones, as well as dozens of ballistic and cruise missiles. The main target of the Ukrainian fighter was cruise missiles, the interception of which is a difficult task. The Ukrainian pilot used all four air-to-air missiles on board the F-16 to shoot down four cruise missiles. However, seeing another target, the pilot decided to use the aircraft gun. -Shooting down cruise missiles with a cannon is very risky because of the high speed of the target and the danger of detonation. But I acted as the instructors in the US taught me, and I managed to hit. As it turned out, two missiles flying next to each other were destroyed at the same time,- the pilot said. This case became unique: for the first time in history, an F-16 pilot destroyed six cruise missiles in one flight, two of them with the help of an aircraft gun. After the successful completion of the task, the pilot was greeted with applause at the airport. His success caused admiration not only among the Ukrainian military, but also in the United States. Although not the most advanced F-16 modifications were transferred to Ukraine, Ukrainian pilots demonstrate exceptional skills every day, using the available equipment to the maximum. This record is proof of their professionalism and fighting spirit. The Ukrainian Air Force expects even more modern weapons, in particular the F-35, which together with experienced pilots will become a powerful force in deterring aggression in Europe.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/07/ukrayinskyj-pilot-f-16-vstanovyv-istorychnyj-rekord-zbyvshy-shist-krylatyh-raket-za-odyn-vylit/	2025-01-07T01:48:35-08:00

Effective procurement: fuel and lubricants for the Armed Forces have become cheaper than the average...	This is reported by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. -The procedures that DOT specialists began to apply in 2024 made it possible to make the procurement process more transparent and improve its efficiency. Thanks to this, the DOT purchased PMM at prices lower than the average market, which allowed the Ministry of Defense to save significant funds,- noted the director of the Internal Audit Department, Colonel Oleksandr Tytkovskyi. In particular, it was analyzed that in 2022-2023 DRZ specialists conducted purchases without regulated and substantiated approaches to determining the size of the expected cost of fuel and lubricant materials. This indicator was determined on the basis of the provided price offers of suppliers, with whom contracts were subsequently concluded. Taking into account the absence of competitive procurement procedures, this led to an overestimation of the cost of purchased products. For its part, the DOT Ministry of Defense uses a regulated and justified approach to determining the size of the expected cost of the PMM. In addition, the -State rear operator- ensured the conduct of competitive procedures using the electronic procurement system in 97% of cases. Thanks to this, price overpricing in the purchase of fuel and lubricants has not been established. Moreover, this indicator was lower than the average market prices. And according to the results of the auctions, the actual prices were lower than the announced size of the expected value by an average of 5.4%. -The DOT's implementation of competitive procedures for the purchase of fuel and lubricants from the beginning of 2024 to September ensured budget savings in the amount of over 867 million hryvnias. At the same time, the expenses for the activities of the DOT in this direction were reduced to less than UAH 60 million,- stated Colonel Oleksandr Tytkovskyi.

However, during the three years of full-scale war, the Defense Forces learned to operate in all weathers. In adverse weather conditions, we use other means of detection and observation, so today we managed to inflict fire damage on the enemy's infantry, which was trying to accumulate and carry out shock-assault actions in the direction of Lozova and Zagryzovo,- Yuriy Fedorenko noted. Despite the enemy's activity, the Defense Forces of Ukraine are holding their positions. In particular, the units successfully blocked the attempts of the occupiers to move upstream in the direction of Kolesnikivka. And on the left bank of Kupyansk, near Kupyansk-Vuzlovoy, the enemy did not manage to realize their plans, even despite numerous assaults. -The enemy is trying to take advantage of the weather conditions to use boats to cross to the right bank of the river in the Dvorichny area. However, our units detect the enemy around the clock and inflict fire damage,- Yuriy Fedorenko said. According to him, Ukrainian forces continue to drive out the occupiers from settlements in the Kupyan region. In particular, Russian troops have completely lost control in Novomlynsk, and a blue-yellow flag is already flying over the village. -In general, the situation in the direction remains dynamic, but the enemy does not manage to implement their plans,- concluded Captain Yury Fedorenko. As reported by ArmyInform, the enemy continues to actively operate in the Vovchan direction, but his attempts u-vovchansku/->to break through the defense remain unsuccessful.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/07/syly-oborony-znyshhuyut-voroga-na-kupyanshhyni-novomlynsk-pid-syno-zhovtym-praporom/	2025-01-07T01:12:23-08:00

How the TCC crushed Russian paratroopers — the story of the Poltava Wolf from the -Odin- squad	One such example is the story of Lieutenant Dmytro Vovka from Poltava, which shared operational command -North- of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. He joined the defense of the Motherland from the first days of the full-scale Russian invasion. -On the morning of February 24, they told me to come with my things. I reported at work, went home to park the car and arrived at the TCC. I understood that the unit to which they wanted to send me was no longer relevant. Because in the first days, no one understood where the Russian troops would reach, where they could and could not pass. That's why I was enrolled in the security company of the regional TCC,- the fighter recalls. At that time, a separate combined assault unit -Odin- was formed under the Poltava district TCC and SP, as part of which Dmytro went on his first combat mission in the Bakhmut district. -At the end of June, we were already in position in the trenches, in a landing near the Vuglehirskaya thermal power plant. Then I saw war for the first time. We drive into Bakhmut — I see -mushrooms- of explosions. I think, well, it's a war, no big deal. They were in position for 7 days. There were no battles as such - the enemy shot at us, but from afar. This may have saved us, because it was the first experience for most of us,- the soldier shared. In the future, Dmytro Vovk visited various areas, including Lymanskyi, repelling enemy positions in Serebryansk Forestry. -I received the task to go in with my platoon and change the assault group in the positions where they were entrenched. We stayed there for six days. We were intensively stormed, the unit suffered losses. Unfortunately, it was not possible to collect all the dead. This is my personal pain&#8230; The soldier carrying the property and weapons of the wounded asked for help. We loaded everything into the car, and when we were leaving, for the first time in my life, I saw a KAB fly to the position,- the officer said. In general, the -Odin- detachment was in the Limansk direction for almost two months, and its opponent there turned out to be well-trained Russian paratroopers with a wide arsenal of weapons. -They used aviation, &#8220;Hradi,&#8221;, artillery, mortars against us. They simply went to the assaults, lined up in a chain. Of course, there was an understanding that either we or they. And we already had combat experience, so we managed to repel assaults. I am proud of my boys! Even then, I told them: if the Ivanivsk paratroopers knew that they were being crushed by the TCC, they would be very ashamed,- Dmytro jokes. At the same time, he expressed regret that there are still people in society who do not understand how much responsibility has fallen on the shoulders of the Ukrainian military, in particular, representatives of the TCC. -Sometimes they tell me to go and fight alone.- I answer that I fought while they lived comfortably in the rear. And the answer is -it's a bad fight if you talk.- In these people, I believe, fear speaks. They are afraid to change something in their lives, they cannot dare to act as an adult citizen. There are those who later change their minds, but not all, unfortunately. They also ask -why me?- I say, look: I went alone so that you would have these rights and freedoms. But you also have responsibilities. And no, then Russia will come, establish a totalitarian regime, and no one will even communicate with you,- explained the fighter. As reported by ArmiyaInform, with the beginning of the Russian military aggression against Ukraine, many citizens who had no relation to the army and connected their lives exclusively with civilian professions came to its defense. href=-https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/02/redaktor-perekladach-nyshhyt-vorozhu-tehniku-dobrovolecz-zsu-rozpoviv-pro-polyuvannya-na-rosijski-tanky/->among whom it turned out and an editor-translator with the call sign -Rumin-.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/07/yak-tczk-kroshylo-rosijskyh-desantnykiv-istoriya-poltavskogo-vovka-iz-zagonu-odin/	2025-01-07T00:49:57-08:00

DOT purchased dyed diesel fuel for the needs of the Armed Forces	informs about this State rear operator. In order to maintain transparency and competition, DOT insisted on the identification of at least two independent manufacturers of paint additives. This allowed bidders to choose between different partners to provide fuel painting. This approach significantly increased the competitiveness of procedures, promoting a fair fight among participants. Special attention was paid to checking the physical and chemical properties of dyes and studying their effect on fuel.

The purchase was made with additional proven financing in December 2024. The DOT team quickly prepared and executed procurement through Prozorro. Thus, it ensured the availability of transitional fuel residues at the beginning of 2025. This made it possible to ensure a continuous supply of fuel for the military to carry out missions.

The Navy of the Ukrainian Armed Forces reports on the activity of Russian ships in the Mediterranean...	This was reported by the Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. In the Black Sea, one enemy ship, which is a carrier of Kalibr cruise missiles, missiles are missing. There are no enemy ships in the Sea of ​​Azov. For a day, in the interests of the Russian Federation, passage through the Kerch Strait was carried out: The Russian Federation continues to violate the International Convention for the Protection of Human Life at Sea of ​​1974. (SOLAS) by disabling automatic identification systems. As reported by ArmyInform, the Ukrainian Navy confirmed that as a result of the recent storm protective barriers which the Russian occupiers placed around illegally of the built Kerch bridge, scattered across the strait.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/07/vms-zsu-povidomlyaye-pro-aktyvnist-rosijskyh-suden-u-seredzemnomu-mori/	2025-01-06T21:21:41-08:00
Almost 200 attacks were repulsed: Ukrainian defenders restrained the enemy in all directions	This is reported by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The invaders carried out 48 airstrikes, using 57 anti-aircraft missiles. In addition, the Russians used 837 kamikaze drones to strike and fired more than four thousand shots at the positions of our troops and populated areas. In the Kharkiv direction, our troops repelled three enemy attacks in the Vovchansk region. The invaders carried out airstrikes with anti-aircraft missiles on the regions of the settlements of Orishanka, Zolochiv and Uda, and airstrikes on Graniv, Kharkiv region, with anti-aircraft missiles. On the Kupyansk direction the enemy stormed the positions of our defenders three times in the Sinkivka, Petropavlivka and Zagryzovo regions. Ukrainian defenders repelled all attacks. Artilne suffered an airstrike by the KAB. In the Lyman direction Russian invaders attacked Ukrainian positions 13 times near Nadiya, Pershotravnevoy, Terni, Yampolivka, Zarichny and Makiivka. There are currently two battles going on. In the Seversky direction during the day the enemy made two attempts to attack the positions of our units in the Belogorivka area. There was no success. At the same time, he dropped 12 aerial bombs on Siversk. In the Kramatorsk direction, four combat clashes were recorded near Chasovoy Yar, Bila Hora and in the direction of Stupochky, all attacks were stopped. The enemy attacked Stupochki with unguided aircraft missiles. In the Toretsk direction the Russians attacked the positions of the Defense Forces eight times. The occupiers concentrated their main offensive efforts near Shcherbynivka and Toretsk. At the moment, one battle continues. The enemy carried out airstrikes with anti-aircraft missiles in the districts of Katerynivka, Toretsk, Oleksandr-Kalynovy and Oleksandr-Shultyny. In the Pokrovsky direction, the invading units tried 40 times to break through our defense near the settlements of Myrolyubivka, Promin, Sukhyi Yar, Pishchane, Kotlyne, Ukrainka, Yasenove, Novoelizavetivka, Tarasivka, Elizavetivka, Lysivka, Zelene, Novy Trud and Pokrovsk. There are 10 engagements going on so far. Oleksandropil, Tarasivka and Hrodivka suffered airstrikes in the direction. The opponent suffers significant losses - in this direction, Ukrainian soldiers neutralized 375 occupiers, 185 of them - irreversibly. Three cars, a UAV control antenna, three motorcycles, three buggies, three artillery systems were also destroyed, two units of road transport and two enemy guns were damaged. The enemy is also active in the Kurakhiv direction — 25 times attacked our positions near Slovyanka, Srybny, Andriivka, Petropavlivka, Kurakhovo and Dachny, two battles continue In the Andriivka area, the enemy dropped two anti-tank missiles. In the Vremivsk direction the invaders carried out 13 offensive actions near Konstantinopol, Yantarny, Dachny and Kostiantinopol. The two clashes are still ongoing.

In the Dnieper direction, the aggressor attacked the positions of our troops once to no avail. In the Kursk region Ukrainian defenders repelled 44 enemy attacks, 42 more clashes are still ongoing. In other areas, the situation has not undergone significant changes. The department honored the soldiers of the 108th Separate Territorial Defense Brigade and the 124th Separate Territorial Defense Brigade, who steadfastly restrained the onslaught of overwhelming enemy forces at the front. As reported by ArmyInform, from odynycz-tehniky/->total losses of the enemy during the Kursk operation of the Defense Forces of Ukraine amounted to more than 38 thousand, of which about 15 thousand — killed.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/07/vidbyto-majzhe-200-atak-ukrayinski-zahysnyky-strymuyut-voroga-na-vsih-napryamkah/	2025-01-06T21:09:56-08:00
Five months of the Kursk operation: the enemy lost more than 38,000 soldiers and hundreds of pieces ...	This was notified by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The operation of the Defense Forces of Ukraine in the Kursk region of the Russian Federation, which began on August 6, 2024, became the next stage of the resistance to Russian aggression and the struggle for the independence of our state. For the first time in 11 years of war, hostilities were transferred to the territory of Russia. The General Staff of the Armed Forces emphasized that the Kursk operation was aimed at preventing the enemy's offensive in the Sumy region and creating a -buffer zone-. The operation forced the Russian occupiers to transfer significant resources to the Kursk region, weakening their positions in other areas of the front. The invaders brought some of the most combat-ready units of the airborne troops, marines and special forces there. Also, Russia was forced to urgently ask for help from North Korea, which sent almost 12 thousand of its soldiers to the Russian Federation. About 4,000 of them have already been liquidated, and some units have lost their combat capability. During 5 months of active hostilities, the occupiers lost more than 38,000 lives, of which about 15,000 were killed. Ukrainian soldiers destroyed: During the operation, Ukrainian forces captured 860 Russian soldiers, significantly replenishing the exchange fund. This made it possible to return home hundreds of Ukrainian defenders who were in Russian prisons. More than 2,000 Ukrainian servicemen were awarded state awards for their heroism and successful actions during the Kursk operation.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/07/pyat-misyacziv-kurskoyi-operacziyi-vorog-vtratyv-ponad-38-tysyach-vijskovyh-i-sotni-odynycz-tehniky/	2025-01-06T21:01:17-08:00
Digital video signal, homing and… cruise control: FPV drones with artificial intelligence will soon ...	A platoon of engineers is required to test and, in the vast majority of cases, refine, rework, and reprogram the resulting FPVs to meet current needs and combat realities. — This is the room where we collect all the batches of drones we receive. We sort them by size, control frequencies, video signal frequencies. This is necessary to understand where what lies for further work specifically with each drone. Here are -sevens- at 5.8 GHz, here -sevens- at 1.2 GHz, here -tens- at 5.8 GHz, etc., says Oleksiy, showing one of the rooms where the engineering platoon works. 5.8 GHz and 1.2 GHz are the video transmission radio frequencies. -Seven- and -ten- is the size of FPV drones, which is measured in inches across the diagonal of the UAV. Seven-inch ones have a diagonal of almost 18 cm, ten-inch ones - a little more than 25 cm. Its carrying capacity and flight range depend on the size of the drone and the power of the engines. A larger drone can lift a heavier and more powerful battery and, accordingly, ammunition, which can weigh up to 4 kg. Almost all drones that the unit receives from various sources - both from the state and from volunteers - need to be improved. Such that the UAV can be launched immediately, just by taking it out of the box, almost does not happen. — There is almost no such thing as making the drone work out of the box. It's like when the manufacturer asks what and how we need to produce right now and we give him a detailed description. Then the drone already arrives ready, it is enough to check it, fly around it and go into battle. But it is not often possible to do this - usually we finish the FPV already here, - says the platoon commander. This does not mean that the drone is completely rebuilt - it is about installing or replacing one or two parts, such as an antenna or a video transmitter, as well as downloading a package of necessary programs. The task of the -engineer- is to give FPV pilots ready to use In another room away from the warehouse, work is boiling - several specialists are soldering, removing and installing parts, choosing antennas, programming and testing the assembled drones. The complete setup of one UAV takes about 30 minutes on average. Military personnel do everything necessary to ensure that pilots on the front lines worked with maximum efficiency and at the same time had a minimum of additional work. Each of the specialists has a strong engineering and IT background, so they pick up any new information on the fly. — We solder everything ahead of time, install everything. The pilot can only work in software. If necessary, if the drone suppresses the enemy's EW, it can directly change signal channels from the remote control, switch and fly to others, - emphasizes the platoon commander, - says Oleksiy. — Here there is an outdated frequency for control, but it is not suitable for us in combat conditions. Therefore, we install others - depending on the specific day when the FPV will go to combat work. We are also installing a program that allows the pilot right in the dugout on the front line to change frequencies - and the drone will fly to the ones that are needed - shows one of the UAVs Oleksii. This is one of the typical situations where it is necessary to change the frequency of the signal, because a batch of drones manufactured earlier is no longer relevant to the existing requirements. Also, sometimes manufacturers who work with small batches of UAVs install parts on them that cannot be used in combat conditions. — But more work needs to be done here, because video transmitters are installed on these drones, which are no longer suitable for combat conditions. Firstly, it is not powerful, and secondly, it is easier for the enemy to intercept the pilot's video with such components. That's why we take them out and put in ones that are suitable for combat work, the specialist explains. Before sending the drones to the front line, specialists must check them in the field - install -props- (propellers) and fly the drones on the training ground. This makes it possible to make sure that UAVs do not have hidden defects or to eliminate them if found. — We conduct drone stress tests — fly far, fly with weight. We check the revolutions of the motors and see where the -props- are spinning. This is very important, because it happens that something goes wrong with the speed controller - you start the drone, and the propellers spin in different directions. Then it does not take off and turn over - and God forbid that this should happen with an already installed BC, - explains Oleksiy. So, after working with drones in the workshop, we then go to the training ground to test the operation of the UAV. Usually, such test and training flights are attended by combat crews of pilots who are taken from the front line for rest. This allows at the same time to teach pilots the basic skills needed to repair or adjust a drone in a dugout environment. - Every engineer is a good pilot, and every pilot is a good engineer. Of course, everyone has to do their job, but pilots should be able to quickly fix some of the simplest problems with the drone. -We have pretty cool guys with good engineering schools, so they pick up all the information quickly,- says the platoon commander. Now there are no pilots with us, so the engineers test the UAV on their own, confidently demonstrating a high level of piloting. The drones rapidly rise into the sky and, after flying several hundred meters in a few minutes, return to the starting point. With and without weight, all FPVs tested today perform almost flawlessly. — In case of fixing problems, we hand over the drones for revision, but this happens rarely, because the guys are already in the workshop preparing them very well. Small defects that sometimes occur are -fixed- already within the framework of the flight, says the engineer. The drone experiences the greatest load during takeoff, especially with significant weight. It is at this time that the battery -sags- as much as possible. Sharp maneuvering also leads to a significant loss of charge. Therefore, to preserve the battery, the pilot should go to cruising altitude and speed and avoid excessive movements of the drone. — When the FPV has already gained momentum, it is much easier to fly and the battery discharges gradually and evenly. The pilot must monitor the charge level, because in the event of a sudden discharge of the battery, the protection may activate, it will turn off and the drone will simply fall, - explains Oleksiy. You should monitor the on-board indicators especially carefully in winter, because the battery charge is lost faster in low temperature conditions. Therefore, until the moment of going to the target, you should save the charge as much as possible, which will be needed for fast and sharp maneuvering. Another important technical detail is when the charge detonation initiation board is turned on. This should be done at the moment when the drone flies past the forward positions of the Defense Forces in order to maximally protect the Ukrainian military in the event of force majeure. In the event that a drone with an activated initiation board accidentally falls into enemy territory, the combat unit will immediately detonate and prevent the enemy from taking possession of the entire ready-to-use Ukrainian UAV and investigating it. — The general rule is that the initiation fee is reduced as soon as we fly our positions. Then, if the drone falls or is shot down, the warhead will definitely detonate, because it is in the -gray zone- and in the territory of the enemy, says the platoon commander. The next extremely significant -feature- is to take off at minimum video signal power. This does not allow the enemy to catch the signal and see the place from which the drones launch the UAV. If the drone takes off at maximum power, it will make the task easier for the enemy and put the servicemen at unnecessary risk. In addition, the safety of the pilots is guaranteed by the so-called -Curtain- - a special program that blocks the video signal during the take-off of the drone. With her help, the military, raising the UAV into the sky, -closes- the video on the screen. When the drone flies to a safe distance, the -curtain- can be removed, because the enemy will no longer be able to see and calculate the place of take-off. — This is a program of a Ukrainian developer, it is used by many units, not only us, — says Oleksiy. Finally, to increase the range of the radio horizon, repeaters are used, which are raised on a mast or installed on an auxiliary drone on the basis of an Autel quadcopter. It can rise to a height of several meters and significantly increase the range of radio signal transmission. — The maximum working height is 150 meters, but it all depends on the altitude map in a specific sector. We usually put the repeater on Autel, because it has a higher load capacity, fly a few hundred meters away from the dugout - and we can already work, says the military man. Such a simple trick greatly expands the radio horizon within which FPV drones can operate. In combat conditions, this greatly helps drones to hit the enemy in their rear at the maximum possible depth from the line of battle. Among the promising innovations that can radically change the capabilities of FPV on the battlefield, Oleksiy mentions the transition to the provision of digital video communication, the spread of automatic guidance of the drone to the target with the help of artificial intelligence, and the so-called cruise control. Digital video communications are virtually impossible to jam and absolutely impossible to intercept. Nothing needs to be changed in it, because it itself -automatically jumps frequencies at an extremely high speed.- An adversary can see that a data packet is being transmitted, but cannot interfere with it in any way or use it for his own benefit. — We have drones where several sets of video frequencies are implemented, which we will not reveal to the enemy, as well as how this is implemented. But when they think they push the video and it works, we have some trump cards that allow us to control the flight further and hit the targets. They think that they are -suppressing- our video, because their suppression works, and we fly further, because we now have a digital camera that is almost impossible to suppress, - explains Oleksiy. Another innovation that is already being used on the battlefield and will soon become more widespread is an automatic homing system based on artificial intelligence. It allows you to hit targets protected by powerful EW devices. - These are boards for the case when the target needs to be destroyed by any means - a drone with artificial intelligence and a homing system. There is a computer here, I won't say which one, a special camera, it can capture a target several hundred meters away and you can already transfer control and then it hits the target on autopilot, says the military man. The only downside to digital video communication and AI homing is the higher final cost of an FPV drone. However, these are relatively small amounts in terms of benefits from combat work. Oleksiy does not reveal all the secrets, but he reports on another innovation - the so-called cruise control, which allows the drone to fly on autopilot in a given square despite being suppressed by enemy EW means. - There will be a new release soon, where a super convenient feature for pilots is added - cruise control. This is when the coordinates are given to the drone and it goes to them in autopilot mode on its own - it flies past all the REBs, any suppression, - says the platoon commander. He predicts the mass distribution of these and a number of other innovations at the front in about 5-6 months - already at the end of spring or at the beginning of summer next year.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/07/czyfrovyj-videosygnal-donavedennya-ta-kruyiz-kontrol-fpv-drony-zi-shtuchnym-intelektom-skoro-na-peredovij/	2025-01-06T20:49:45-08:00
Bridges are not afraid of tanks: Sweden ordered a batch of amphibious bridge crossings M3	As the portal European Security &amp; The defense contract was signed by the Swedish procurement agency Försvarets Materielverk (FMV) with the amphibious systems manufacturer General Dynamics European Land Systems (GDELS) — Bridge Systems, ArmyInform reports. The deal is part of a project to deliver 25 bridges between 2025 and 2027 under a SEK 400 million ($39.2 million) contract. -It's extremely positive that we were able to take advantage of this opportunity,- said Jonas Lötsne, chief of operations at the Swedish Land Forces' Defense Materiel Administration. -This means that the combat units of the Army get a rapidly built communication system, more than for a single brigade. And it will happen much sooner than we thought possible.- The M3 amphibious bridge vehicles are used for a variety of missions, from combat to civilian, including during flooding to guide crossings or evacuation. The M3 system consists of self-propelled amphibious ferries on wheeled chassis with an integrated deployable bridge span. The M3 system has a load capacity of MLC 85 (77.11 tons) for tracked vehicles and MLC 132 (119.75 tons) for wheeled vehicles. In particular, it can support the weight of main battle tanks, including the Challenger 2, Leopard 2 and M1A2 Abrams. The M3 Amphibious Bridge and Ferry System can carry all NATO vehicles and military equipment and is capable of forming a 100m floating bridge in less than 10 minutes. On the march, the equipment works as a 4×4 wheeled vehicle with a maximum road speed of 80 km/h. The M3 self-deploys on a follow path to create a crossing. Before it is launched into the water for the amphibious operation, two large aluminum pontoons detach and deploy along the hull of their transporter. The amphibious system is operated by a crew of two. The crew exits the vehicle cab to maneuver the pontoon using controls located on the top of the transporter body. When moving through the water, the M3 is propelled and controlled by two fully movable pump nozzles at speeds of up to 14 km/h. These transport vessels will be equipped with -Arctic kits-, which will allow them to be operated in cold climatic conditions. Interestingly, the Swedish armed forces tested the M3 system 20 years ago, but due to geopolitical changes (the global war on terrorism) and the shrinking economy, the project was later postponed. FMV experience gained during these tests is now mainly implemented, reports Polish portal Military Magazine. Currently, M3 kits have also been delivered to the armed forces of Germany, Great Britain, Indonesia, Taiwan, Singapore, South Korea, Latvia and Slovakia.

Matzka hysterit: Turkish bairaktars are not friends with propaganda	Turkey, as a manufacturer of advanced unmanned aerial systems such as the Bayraktar TB2, plays an important role in strengthening Ukraine's defense capabilities. However, such cooperation causes significant irritation of the Kremlin, which in its traditional manner resorted to information attacks. The latest data indicate that Russian special services have launched a large-scale campaign aimed at discrediting the Ukrainian-Turkish partnership. The main goal is to create tension between Kyiv and Ankara, question Turkey's reliability as an ally and undermine trust in its technology. Now we propose to consider the key narratives of Russian propaganda. Propagandists are spreading fake videos with alleged -evidence- that the Bayraktar TB2 does not live up to expectations on the battlefield. These materials are actively disseminated through the Kremlin-controlled media, as well as on social networks and Telegram channels. In the information space, the perception of Turkey's -double game- is being actively created. They said that Ankara supplies drones to Ukraine, but at the same time trades with Russia in energy resources, which allegedly calls into question its sincerity. the Russian mass media manipulate facts about the financial aspects of cooperation, trying to convince that Ukraine is allegedly unable to fully pay contracts with Turkey, due to which the latter has lost trust in its partner. For the Kremlin, Ukraine is not only an enemy, but also an example of resistance that is not included in the plans of Russian imperial policy. Turkey, as an ally of Ukraine, prevents these plans by helping the Armed Forces to increase its combat capability. In addition, Turkey is developing joint projects with Ukraine in the spheres of space, shipbuilding and the production of new types of weapons, which significantly increases Ukraine's defense capabilities. The success of such a partnership undermines Russia's position in the geopolitical arena. In order to expose Russian information attacks, it is important: Russia is not only waging a war on the battlefield, but also an information war, trying to discredit everything that strengthens the defense of Ukraine. The campaign against military-technical cooperation with Turkey is another attempt to weaken our country. However, this disinformation wave only emphasizes the importance of the Ukrainian-Turkish partnership. Only by joining forces will we be able to overcome this challenge and continue the path to victory.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/07/maczkva-istyerit-tureczki-bajraktary-ne-druzhat-z-rospropagandoyu/	2025-01-06T20:21:04-08:00
-Christ is baptized- in Donetsk region: paratroopers celebrated the frontline Epiphany	ArmyInform visited the glorious 46th Brigade at the Vodokhreshche front. This year's Epiphany or Jordan - these are the traditional folk names of the holiday - the paratroopers met near the battle line in Donetsk region. Today's celebration of Jordan among paratroopers is organized with observance of not only church rites and folk traditions, but also strict military discipline. Despite the fact that we are quite far from the front, only a few people gather at the same time on the shore of a small reservoir. &nbsp; Fighters come in twos or threes to read a common prayer and chat with the chaplain, dive into a pre-cut hole in the thin ice, and quickly get dressed and warm up in a heated tent. As it should be in Vodokhreshche, it is frosty outside, so hot tea with sandwiches is very appropriate. - Today we remember how Jesus Christ came to John the Baptist and was baptized by him. For Christians, this is one of the great holidays - on this day we remember the origins of the Christian Church, because it was on this day that Christ appeared to people as the Messiah and Savior. At the same time, it is a reminder for every Christian why we were baptized, what we promised God and how we should live, explains the meaning of the holiday, military chaplain of the 46th brigade, Dmytro Semko. About ten people gather at the same time for joint prayer after a short sermon. Among them are not only military personnel, but also local residents who came to share with the paratroopers the joy of the bright holidays of the Epiphany and the Baptism of the Lord. All other volunteers have already come and will continue to come to the reservoir, which symbolizes the biblical Jordan, individually and in small groups. Despite the absence of lavish celebrations with a large gathering, the front-line Epiphany touches the warmth of the Christian and front-line unity of people in their faith with the Lord and among themselves. Today, in the midst of the terrible tragedy of war, stern, fire-hardened and iron-tested paratroopers smile and joke kindly, as if following Christ's command to become like children. -Christ is baptizing!-, we remember the traditional Ukrainian folk greeting at the Epiphany. -In the Jordan River!- - we hear the answer. Today, in Ukraine, every consecrated body of water is a symbolic Jordan. The paratroopers of the 46th separate airmobile brigade of the Russian Air Force, who celebrated Epiphany in 2025 at the front, also have their own Jordan.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/06/hrystos-hreshhayetsya-na-donechchyni-frontove-vodohreshhe-vidznachyly-desantnyky/	2025-01-06T12:02:47-08:00

I am grateful to all the brigades, to each of our soldiers, who are right there right now. The Army needs more internal, systemic changes to make people management effective at all levels in the Defense Forces. There were also today detailed reports of the responsible commanders regarding the formation and training of our brigades,- the Head of State emphasized. Volodymyr Zelenskyi also stated that today is exactly 5 months since the start of the Kursk operation, where Ukraine continues to maintain a buffer zone on the territory of Russia. -Since the beginning of the Kursk operation, the enemy has lost more than 38,000 of his soldiers, and about 15,000 of them are irreversible. the Russians transferred their strong units there, used soldiers from North Korea. It is important that the occupiers cannot direct all this force to other directions of our front. I thank all the soldiers who are bringing her home to Russia,- he said. In addition, the President held a meeting with international experts, during which meetings and negotiations were planned for January. -We are speeding up the supply of weapons to Ukraine and working for new, longer-term relations with partners. We are preparing good diplomatic news for Ukraine,- added Volodymyr Zelenskyi.

Due to the war, the Russian economy has already lost 1.5 to 1.7 million able-bodied citizens	About this notifies the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. The forecast for the development of the situation on the labor market in the Russian Federation in the long term is also negative - by 2045, the employment market in the Russian Federation will decrease by 7–10 million people from the current 76 million employed citizens. The deterioration of the situation on the labor market leads to the deepening of stagflation processes in the Russian economy - an increase in the level of inflation due to an increase in wages, a decrease in the level of production, and bankruptcies of a number of enterprises. The deficit of the working-age population of the Russian Federation is also one of the factors that prevent the Russian authorities from announcing a new wave of mobilization.

The council will include 15 candidates who will receive the most votes. The results will be published on the information resources of the Ministry of Defense within five working days. Over the next two years, members of the Anti-Corruption Council will help assess corruption risks in the Ministry of Defense and will contribute to the formation of relevant anti-corruption measures. It is the votes of the citizens of Ukraine that will determine which of the represented persons will join the council. Therefore, the Ministry of Defense calls on citizens to participate in voting. All citizens of Ukraine on the territory of Ukraine are invited to participate. Authentication will take place using the BankID or Action.Signature service. Taking into account the enemy's constant attacks on the Ukrainian IT infrastructure, you can vote only from the territory of Ukraine. Each member can vote only once. Up to 15 representatives can be elected from 40 candidates. Candidates for participation in the contest were submitted by public associations whose statutory activities are related to the prevention and combating of corruption. Only NGOs whose state registration took place at least two years before the announcement of the competition were admitted. The list was approved by the Commission for ensuring the holding of the competition, created by order of the Ministry of Defense. The composition of the Commission included representatives of the Public Anti-Corruption Council itself, NGOs and advisory bodies. Representatives of the Ministry of Defense do not have the right to vote in the meetings of the commission. All NGOs provided a public report on their activities, indicating the sources of funding for the last year. All candidates are checked for compliance with the qualification criteria defined in the Regulations on the Public Anti-Corruption Council under the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. 42 candidacies were submitted to the competition. Among them, one candidate refused to participate, another was not admitted to the competition due to the submission of documents from a non-public association. Last time, during the voting, there were significant technical failures /a> in particular, the unstable operation of the site, as well as authorization errors through partner services BankID and Diya.Signature. Therefore, the results were annulled, and the voting was scheduled for a new date. The Ministry of Defense is taking all necessary measures to eliminate technical problems and to ensure the stable operation of the system throughout the voting process. For the new vote, the Ministry's team developed software for high load readiness, conducted thorough functional and load testing, and developed human-oriented scenarios for solving emergency situations. In addition, on the day of the vote, a rapid response team of three administrators has been appointed to monitor the transparency and democracy of the process. All digital systems of the Ministry of Defense are protected according to state and international cyber security standards. All sensitive data in the voting process are securely encrypted and processed in a secure data center for official electronic resources of the Ministry. If your chosen bank or Diya.Signature has technical problems, this may be due to a large number of simultaneous requests to these services and their bandwidth. The Ministry of Defense has no influence on the functioning of partner systems. However, you can still vote by choosing a different login method (Bank or Action.Signature) or try logging in later. This means that the server could not authenticate the request. This limitation occurs in secure web systems that strictly control the security of requests.

A Russian jailer who tortured Ukrainian soldiers came under suspicion	The Security Service of Ukraine reported this on January 6. We are talking about a citizen of the Russian Federation, Oleksiy Khavetsky, the deputy head of the -correctional colony No. 7-, which is located in the Volodymyr region of Russia. According to the case file, at least from the end of May 2023 to February 2024, the official personally participated in the torture of captured Ukrainian soldiers who were imprisoned in a Russian prison. In the cells, the victims were tortured with electric currents and sentry dogs, which were used by the Rashists to guard the perimeter of the regime facility, were pointed at them. Also, on the instructions of Havetskyi, his subordinates regularly beat prisoners, and then left them for a long time without food, water, and medical care. Another common way of abusing the victims was to keep them without warm clothes in frozen cells without heating or at low temperatures in the open air. Using torture, the jailer tried to -extract- from the victims the -confessions- needed by the occupiers in pre-fabricated cases against Ukrainian defenders. In addition, he used physical violence and psychological pressure on prisoners in order to force them to cooperate for the benefit of the Russian Federation in the war against our state. On the basis of the collected evidence, the investigators of the Security Service informed Khavetsky in absentia about the suspicion under part. 2 Art. 28, ch. 1 Art. 438 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (war crimes committed by a group of persons based on a prior conspiracy).

-Wholesale- destruction of occupiers, city battles, hiding places of Russians: the Defense Forces sp...	On January 6, the spokesperson told about this on the broadcast of -Society News- Major Viktor Tregubov of the strategic group of troops -Khortytsia-. -They are really trying to break through the city center, while the Ukrainian troops stop them and destroy them. Heavy urban battles have been going on for more than a week. The city itself, from which the population had already been evacuated, turned into one big arena. And it caused damage to buildings and infrastructure,- Viktor Tregubov said. In the Pokrovsky direction, the enemy carries out the most offensive actions, in particular in the areas of Elizavetivka, Vozdvizhenka, Myrolyubivka, Promin, Lysivka, Pishchane, Solone and Novovasylivka settlements. -This is most likely south of the city, although the enemy would not mind going west of it. Everything is logical here, he does not want to interfere in direct battles in the city of Pokrovsk itself. This is a sufficiently large and protected city, so he is trying to bypass it, cover it from the same western side,- he said. According to him, Ukrainian defenders are trying to slow down the enemy and stop his advance. He noted that the enemy is more actively using armored vehicles in the Vremivsk direction, as there are fewer buildings there. -Actually, there are villages there, not a city, so the enemy is trying to advance more actively there and will launch combat operations more dynamically,- noted the spokesman of the -Khortytsia- OSU. However, he assured that the Defense Forces are destroying a sufficiently large number of enemy personnel and armored vehicles there. -Because when they're advancing in more open terrain, when some of the equipment that's advancing is just blown up on minefields or hit by FPV drones, it's, I would say, such wholesale destruction,- he explained. The enemy is also trying to cross the Oskil and reach its right bank. -It is north of Kupyansk. He tries to infiltrate in small groups there, tries to concentrate them in landings, so that later, when a certain amount is accumulated, he can advance further and take another landing. The intensity is much lower there, but there are certain threats,- Viktor Tregubov emphasized. As reported by ArmyInform, on Vremivsk, Kurakhivsk and other directions, the enemy -v-taktyczi-voroga-na-riznyh-napryamkah/->changes tactics, trying to adapt to the situation. However, even such attempts as attacks with manual mines do not bring the desired results.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/06/optovi-znyshhennya-okupantiv-miski-boyi-hovanky-rosiyan-u-sylah-oborony-rozpovily-pro-sytuacziyu-na-shodi/	2025-01-06T06:17:04-08:00

And for those people, shops are still open here and there, several pharmacies are open, specialists from our territorial center are working, a small number of them are persuading the elderly who are still staying to evacuate after all,- the official said. He also emphasized that the city is constantly under attack by various means of attack, including artillery, guided aerial bombs and drones. According to the head of the MBA, currently only 15% of Pokrovsk remains inaccessible to them, while in the rest of the city, Russian operators are organizing a real hunt for civilians. -There is one small area, they don't fly there yet, let's put it that way. But it's a matter of time,- Serhiy Dobryak noted. However, despite the difficult situation, recently the Pokrovsk community managed to restore the stele at the entrance to the city, destroyed by the occupiers last week. As reported by ArmyInform, on January 5 in the Pokrovsky direction our defenders stopped 51 assault and offensive actions of the aggressor in populated areas points Elizavetivka, Vozdvizhenka, Myrolyubivka, Promin, Lysivka, Novy Trud, Pischane, Solone, Novovasylivka, Novoelizavetivka and Yasenove.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/06/u-pokrovsku-zalyshayutsya-ponad-7-tysyach-lyudej-vorozhi-drony-distayut-do-bilshosti-rajoniv-mista/	2025-01-06T06:08:01-08:00
the Russians brought electricians from Chuvashia to TOT	This is reported by Center of national resistance. In 2022, the Russians liberated part of the south from civilization, economy and freedom. As a result of inefficient management by self-appointed individuals from the ROA, there are constant blackouts in the south, despite the absence of attacks on generation facilities. The reason is the inability of the Russians to maintain the energy infrastructure. Due to the lack of personnel, the Russians import energy workers from various regions of the Russian Federation on a rotational basis. In particular, this time from Chuvashia. The inability to recruit personnel for the TOT due to the departure of Ukrainians and unwillingness to cooperate with the enemy is an eloquent testimony to the real indicator of the -popularity- of the occupiers in the region. As reported by ArmyInform, in one of the industrial districts of Lysychansk, near the old mine, the occupiers set up a military training ground.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/06/rosiyany-zavezly-na-tot-elektrykiv-z-chuvashiyi/	2025-01-06T05:56:12-08:00

According to DeepState, the Russians tied their hands and shot them in the back of the head. -We are once again witnessing atrocities that show the true face of the aggressor state. Despite the fact that, according to the Geneva Conventions, prisoners of war are under special protection, and no country has the right to torture, abuse or take their lives, Russia shows disregard for international norms,- ​​the ombudsman said. Dmytro Lubinets said that he immediately appealed to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the United Nations. -These organizations should condemn this crime and put pressure on the Russian side to stop such acts. Ukraine maintains its commitment to observe humanitarian law even in times of war, but we will not allow Russia to turn the world into a territory of lawlessness.

According to him, the enemy is currently trying to find any opportunity to restore the damaged buildings. -Of course, the period of storms is quite long in the Black Sea, in the Kerch Strait. Also, the weather is quite stormy. In this sense, it makes adjustments to the plans of the Russian occupiers. But, of course, they take maximum measures to protect this building. And so far, there are no trends to decrease their activity,- said Dmytro Pletenchuk. He also noted that the Kerch bridge remains a strategically important object for the enemy. -You see that they saturated this facility with echeloned air defense systems as much as possible&#8230; The number of fuel tankers has increased. This is also not a coincidence. This is also a consequence of the use of the so-called Kerch bridge for fuel supply. Because you see the ferries are no longer running. It was the main tool. Accordingly, they should use more cities,- added the representative of the Armed Forces Navy. As reported by ArmyInform, in December 2024 the number of protective barges near the Kerch bridge reduced to 18 units due to storms.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/06/pogoda-dovoli-burhlyva-shtorm-rozkydav-zahysni-sporudy-bilya-kerchenskogo-mostu/	2025-01-06T05:17:59-08:00

According to him, the enemy began to use armored vehicles less. -The weather is such that it is difficult to use armored vehicles. They try, but where we work with our FPV drones, it's objectively very difficult to do. Because everything that goes, it burns: we destroy it quite effectively,- Mykola Volokhov explained. He noted that the Russian invaders continue to actively advance with infantry. -They decided it was more efficient to go on foot now. Of course, they don't lose a hundred people every day, but they can afford to launch up to a hundred people on assaults. They come wave after wave,- Mykola Volokhov said. In his opinion, the purpose of such assaults is to deplete the defense of the Ukrainians and reduce the amount of munitions. As reported by ArmyInform, in the Kharkiv region, the Russian infantry continues daily assault operations, even if it does not have the support of its drones and other types of weapons.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/06/vony-jdut-hvylya-za-hvyleyu-na-harkivshhyni-vorog-shhodenno-vidpravlyaye-na-shturmy-po-100-pihotyncziv/	2025-01-06T05:02:17-08:00

the Kremlin is using the energy crisis in Moldova against Ukraine	About reports the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. At the same time, the country's government is working on diversification of gas and electricity supply sources. In January, the Moldovan government plans to cover 62% of electricity needs through imports from Romania, about 30% will be provided by thermal power plants and local producers of energy from renewable sources. Moldova received the right to increase the electricity import quota from the EU from 315 MW to 600 MW, if it is not used by other importers. Currently, the total quota for Moldova and Ukraine is 2,100 MW, of which 315 MW belongs to Moldova. Prime Minister of Moldova D. Rechan stated that the energy crisis provoked by Russia is aimed at using the Moldovan crisis against Ukraine in particular. In the Transnistrian region, the situation in the energy sector remains extremely difficult. At the same time, the so-called -leader- of the region in Krasnoselsky called the situation -under control- and called on residents to -warm themselves with firewood.- For its part, the management of JSC -Moldovagaz- offered JSC -Tiraspoltransgaz- assistance in purchasing gas through European platforms at market prices. However, the Transnistrian -leadership- rejected the proposal and hopes for the restoration of gas supplies by the Russian -Gazprom-. Most likely, Russia will use the deepening of the energy crisis to restore gas transit to Europe through the territory of Ukraine and bring pro-Russian forces to power in Moldova. In this way, the Kremlin hopes to use the situation with the supply of gas in the Transnistrian region to further blackmail European countries. How to ->reported ArmyInform, Ukrainian fighters conducted an operation to clear a building captured by the Russians in Toretsk, Donetsk region, during which they managed to take alive one of the invaders.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/06/kreml-vykorystovuye-energetychnu-kryzu-v-moldovi-proty-ukrayiny/	2025-01-06T03:31:35-08:00

To blow up our military - the enemy was going to turn a 16-year-old Ukrainian into a suicide terrori...	The Security Service of Ukraine reported this on January 6. 4 members of the Russian intelligence network were detained, who were preparing to detonate explosives at the entrance to the building where one of the units of the Defense Forces is stationed. According to the investigation materials, the improvised explosive device was in a tactical backpack, which was to be delivered to the regime facility by a minor agent of the Russian special services, dressed in a Ukrainian-style military uniform. The enemy tracked his movements online and planned to detonate explosives as soon as the young man entered the premises. At the same time, the agent himself, who was supposed to be blown up, did not know that a fatal end was being prepared for him. He thought that the SVP would be detonated after he left the building. Counter-intelligence of the SBU detected the enemy's plans in advance and took a series of measures to prevent a terrorist attack. As a result, a minor terrorist and 3 other agents involved in planning this crime were detained. As the investigation established, with this terrorist attack, the Russian special services wanted to destabilize the socio-political situation in Ukraine and create the appearance of a conflict within the Defense Forces, when one -military- detonates others as a sign of protest. According to the investigation materials, all four involved acted separately from each other, but had a common curator from the Russian Federation. One of the agents turned out to be a 16-year-old student from the Kirovohrad region. He received the coordinates of the cache from the occupiers, in which he took explosives and a military uniform. Another member of the network is a 19-year-old young man who, according to preliminary data, transported explosives and military uniforms from the -initial hiding place- to a cache, where they were taken by a 16-year-old agent. The -initial cache- itself was arranged by 2 residents of the Vinnytsia region. According to video instructions from a representative of the Russian special services, they made an explosive device and hid it in a designated place. During the searches, mobile phones with evidence of their cooperation with the aggressor were seized from the detainees. Also, 1.5 kg of an explosive mixture for the manufacture of a home-made weapon was seized from one of the agents. Investigators of the SBU informed the defendants of the suspicion of crimes committed under two articles of the Criminal Code of Ukraine: Detainees are in custody without the right to bail. They face life imprisonment with confiscation of property. As reported by ArmiyaInform, according to SBU materials, 15 years in prison received by a traitor who corrected Russian missile strikes on Bukovina and publicly praised rushed	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/06/pidirvaty-nashyh-vijskovyh-vorog-zbyravsya-zrobyty-z-16-richnogo-ukrayinczya-terorysta-samogubczyu/	2025-01-06T01:13:29-08:00

In the first battle, he did not know how to reload the machine gun, but now he is an experienced ins...	The man was convinced by his own experience that patriotism and fighting spirit are not enough to participate in combat operations - serious military training is required. Therefore, after training and participating in combat operations, he became an instructor and teaches new arrivals to the brigade of fighters to survive and destroy enemies on the front lines. On February 24, 2022, Vladyslav joined the ranks of one of the famous Kharkiv volunteer units and took part in repelling attempts by the Russians to break through to Kharkiv. Then the occupiers tried to infiltrate the city in small groups using light armored vehicles. — At the end of February 2022, I picked up a weapon for the first time in my life, because I was ready to defend my native city and Ukraine. However, already in the first battle, when the bullets ran out, he did not know how to reload the machine gun at all and started shouting loudly for my comrades to help me, - says Vladyslav. Thus the volunteer realized that patriotism and fighting spirit are not enough - you need serious military training. Therefore, after the first skirmishes with the enemy, I went to the TCC in order to join the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and undergo appropriate training. - Already after the first battle, I realized that in order to fight well, it is necessary to learn how to use weapons professionally and decided to go study. Chaos reigned in the city, the TCC moved due to the danger of shelling. -We had to look for him by phone number,- Tamik recalls. During this search, Vladyslav joined forces with three more volunteers, so in the end, four of them came to the TCC. It was not possible to mobilize right away - we had to wait for about two weeks. - They talked to us, found out what kind of education we had, and promised to direct us to the place where we would be most useful. Then they collected data and told to wait for a call - as they say, -be on the bag.- They called after two weeks - and we went to the -training school-, - says the man. Vladislav recalls that during the training in the spring of 2022, time dragged on for an unbearably long time. Training seemed to go on endlessly, while reinforcements were desperately needed at the front. Everyone was following the news and wanted to finish training as soon as possible and go into battle. - They studied for two months - first basic military training, then professional training. I was sent to study as a signalman, because I am a programmer by education and I work well with computers, - says the military man. After training, he participated in battles in the area of ​​the Donetsk airport near Piskami in the Pokrovsky district of the Donetsk region. where for the first time I experienced firsthand how terrible modern war is. - Everything shown on TV or told by friends is one thing. And it's completely different when you yourself have been in a real hell, and everything wants to kill you - aviation, barrel artillery, mortars. It cannot be compared to an ordinary shooting battle, - recalls Vladyslav. There, starting with the battles in the summer of 2022, the soldier gained real combat experience, knowledge and skills, which now allow him to train new arrivals to the brigade of fighters for the front line. who have just passed the BZVP. - As a Kharkiv resident, of course I wanted to defend my hometown. But it turned out that I have been defending Donetsk region for the third year already - and I am very proud of it. Here, it seems to me, is the most difficult - I call it -Donbas 3.0-, - says the fighter. He became an instructor of -Tamik- a year ago - in January 2024. This was facilitated by the habit of constantly learning, learning something new, and improving one's skills and abilities, acquired even in civilian life. - Aitivites are the laziest people in the world. They will always find a million ways to make everything easier, they will never complicate things. To achieve the result, they will develop the simplest algorithm - and they will get what they want, - the military man jokes. This is what helped Vladyslav not only become one of the best communicators in the brigade, but also effectively help and teach others. When the qualities of a fighter were noticed by the command, the offer to take up the position of instructor became inevitable. - At one point, when I was the commander of the department and later the sergeant of the communications platoon, I was invited to try myself as an instructor. There aren't really that many intelligent communicators, and even fewer who can teach others. Therefore, my main task became to train signalmen, - says the instructor. Working with fellow instructors, the soldier also improved his knowledge in other areas of military science. So now you can help your fellows by assisting them or replacing them when working out simpler basic points. - Now there is no such thing as being a programmer or a communicator - that's all. It is necessary to be a universalist, to know one thing deeply — and at the same time to know the basics of everything else. Therefore, now I am engaged in both topography and tactics. I may not know the intricacies as deeply as some of my peers, but I can always help other instructors, - explains the senior sergeant. Now there are tremendous opportunities for development and self-improvement, Vladyslav is sure. Every instructor is obliged to do this and every fighter can, with the help of more experienced comrades. — YouTube is very helpful, our sergeants provide literature. The main thing is that there is a desire, and it is always possible to find the necessary useful information, there is an opportunity to constantly develop. Even just asking and listening to an explanation is already good, the instructor is convinced. After -Tamik- became an instructor, his main motive - to defend Ukraine from Russian invaders - underwent a transformation and addition. Now his motivation is not only to become a professional fighter, but also to teach everything he knows to others. - When you teach people and then the news comes that one of them is -300- or even -200- , then you always start to think that you didn't teach something, neglected something. You begin to think where exactly you need to work better so that there are as few dead and wounded as possible, - says the instructor. He is sure that it is under the condition of high-quality training and training of soldiers that losses can be reduced, giving soldiers maximum knowledge and skills for to maximize their chances of surviving the battle. Now and in the near future everyone fit for military service will have to undergo basic military training, because even provided that the hot phase of the war ends, hostile Russia will not disappear anywhere and will always hang over the border of Ukraine. - It seems to me that Ukraine as a state will be extremely militarized from now on and for a very long time. Even when this war ends in victory, we must be ready for action, because we have an inadequate neighbor, Vladyslav is convinced.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/06/u-pershomu-boyu-ne-znav-yak-perezaryadyty-avtomat-a-nyni-instruktor-z-dosvidom-transformacziya-ajtivczya-z-harkova/	2025-01-05T20:40:48-08:00
- It is reported that he is heavy, but he is smoking a cigarette bandaged and smiling: how does the ...	The head of the medical center, senior lieutenant of the medical service, Yuriy Faustus, told ArmyInform about how the medical center of the 21st separate special battalion of the Separate Presidential Brigade named after Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytskyi works. To organize a medical center, you need a good knowledge of medicine, equipment and premises. It can be placed anywhere - in a well-furnished dugout, basement, house and even an apartment. Near the front line, of course, priority is given to protected underground structures. — Everything depends on your fiction and the conditions you have in fact. Ideally, the medical center should have at least three rooms. In one of them there will be a medicine warehouse, where you can place everything you need. The second room is a waiting room for examining patients. In the third, we carry out the necessary procedures, Yuriy explains. All rooms must be large enough to accommodate a significant number of medicines and drugs - a battalion needs quite a few - and to receive at least a few people in need at a time. Among the basic necessary conditions are water supply and sewerage, electricity supply, and heating in the cold season. Without them, the medical center can work, but its work becomes much more difficult. — When there is water supply, it is generally considered super conditions. Water is brought mainly to the front. It is also very cool when there is electricity - mainly it is a generator or EcoFlow batteries, you are lucky to have stationary power supply less often, says the doctor. For heating, UFO infrared heaters are often used, which allow you to direct heat directly to the patient. And if you are lucky, there may be not only solid fuel, but also gas heating. Despite the common perception that the medical center is intended primarily or even exclusively for the care of the wounded, in fact the doctors there provide assistance to servicemen for any health problems. — The medical center does everything possible. It's helping the wounded, it's treating illness, it's keeping records and referring people to other treatment. If a person came to us or was admitted, we must solve problems with his health, the doctor explains. However, the injury is really in the first place, and in the case of delivery to the medical center of a wounded soldier, all other cases and patients are postponed and the doctors deal exclusively with the wounded. The wounded are transported to the medical center by special evacuation teams, which include soldiers who are well-versed and have completed specialized courses in tactical medicine. Special positions are not provided for this. - It can be a shooter or a lawyer who knows medical technology and is not afraid of blood, can competently and skillfully provide first aid. If we see that he can prove himself well in the evacuation team, he will be directed there, says Yuriy. There are a total of three evacuation teams in the battalion medical center. Depending on the intensity of hostilities, the doctors of the medical center may also leave for evacuation, but they usually have to stay at the medical center. From -ground zero- the injured person is taken on foot to the evacuation point, from where he is picked up by transport. This is usually a car on which soldiers were brought to the front line. At this time, thanks to the report on the walkie-talkie, the medical center already knows about the wounded person and is ready to receive him. - Our medical center is the middle link between -zero- and the stabilization point of the brigade. This is the first moment when a wounded person is guaranteed to be in the hands of professionals, although it can happen earlier. But it is guaranteed - it is with us, says the officer. Sometimes the injured person is taken immediately to the medical center, but more often a transport leaves the medical center to meet and pick him up. Then specialists provide the necessary medical assistance immediately after the soldier is accepted into the evacuation team. — This is not always the case when you need to drive fast just to deliver. We can stop, examine him normally, start infusion therapy for blood loss. And even after that we take him to the stabilization point of the brigade, says Yuriy. So the doctors of the medical center can work on the road, rescuing the wounded immediately after taking them from the front line. By the time a wounded person is admitted, thanks to a radio report, they already know about the nature of the wound, the previously provided help and the condition of the soldier. — During the report, all this is recorded in the combat log, and we also learn about all this at the same time. And already knowing all this, we can prepare in advance for what kind of help we will provide, the doctor explains. It happens when we pick up an evacuation fighter, he seems to be doing well, talks nicely, asks for a cigarette. And at this time he has a fragment of a mine in his lungs. Such cases are very dangerous. That is why at the stage of medical evacuation, fighters are examined from head to toe. There are also cases when, during the report, fighters exaggerate the level of threat to the life and health of the wounded, reporting that he is in an extremely serious condition. — We are arriving — the guys are leaving, smoking cigarettes. -We were told you were 'heavy'!- - we say. And he replies: -I don't know who said that, I have this,- and shows something completely immortal. Such cases happen more often when it is reported that he is -heavy-, and he smokes a cigarette bandaged and smiles, glad to be alive. he says. In addition to wounds, the doctors of the medical center treat all possible diseases of soldiers. The most common are lumbago - lower back pain due to heavy physical exertion, gastritis due to an unbalanced diet and, depending on the season, SARS - acute respiratory viral infections. — Now there is an extreme shortage of neurologists, because many people with back problems come to us. And gastritis is mainly due to food. And one thing, when fighters are at -zero- - there really are no conditions. And it is completely different when they return from the front line and spoil their stomachs with dry spicy food. If there is an ability to monitor nutrition, then it is necessary to do it, the doctor emphasizes. This completes the basic list of typical diseases. Of course, some chronic diseases may worsen, which happens quite often, or specific cases may occur. A significant part of the work of the headquarters is the preparation of relevant documentation, including the formation of injury certificates, on the basis of which fighters receive appropriate payments. — First, the information is recorded in the log of combat operations, then the companies have to prepare certificates, reports on injuries. There should also be a short report and an extensive report on the fighter's injuries, which describes what injuries the fighter received and what he lost, says the officer. In order to receive the proper payments without any problems, it is necessary to check all the documents in detail so that all the diagnoses on the basis of which the head of the medical service issues the appropriate certificate match exactly. At the same time, the wounded fighter must send all the documentation about himself from the hospital where he is staying to the doctor or clerk. — Sometimes it happens that one diagnosis is written in form 100, and another diagnosis is written in the statement. Then the head of the medical service has to collect all these documents and a simplified investigation is carried out for each wound, which allows us to find out all the nuances, - explains Yuriy. This is necessary because the research and analyzes in the hospital can be carried out much more qualitatively, because there are available resources and specialists that are absent in the initial stages of evacuation. Thanks to a better examination and research, the diagnosis can be clarified and it should be in all documents. — It is enough for the fighter to send an extract and medical documentation so that the medic or clerk in the unit can make the appropriate certificate. You just need to send documents on time and don't be afraid to call. We often send documents by mail, and by other means of document circulation, appendix 5 - a certificate on the circumstances of injury. It is done for 10 days and given to the fighter, the head of the medical center explains. Usually there are no problems - it is enough to collect and store all the documents, as well as maintain contact with the party. Then everything will be fine and all documents will be prepared and given to the injured. — If a fighter is constantly in contact with his commander, will provide timely medical documentation that appears in his possession, and will report on his whereabouts, then he will never have problems with payments. In our battalion, everything is just like that, Yuriy Faustus assures.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/06/dopovidayut-shho-tyazhkyj-a-vin-czygarku-kuryt-zabyntovanyj-i-posmihayetsya-yak-praczyuye-bataljonnyj-medpunkt/	2025-01-05T20:28:06-08:00
Russia is sowing panic and fear: a fake about the forced evacuation from Kherson	Let's analyze this fake point by point and reveal the true motives of the Russian manipulators. Propaganda media claim that Ukrainian authorities are allegedly forcing residents of Kherson to leave the city through forced evacuation. According to them: These statements are accompanied by videos and photos intended to create the illusion of mass chaos, although often they are either old footage or staged. Evacuation is rescue, not coercion. The Ukrainian authorities, in particular the Ministry of Reintegration and the local administration of Kherson, are indeed organizing the evacuation of residents who have found themselves in the zone of increased danger due to constant shelling from the Russian army. However, evacuation is offered only to those who wish to leave. It is aimed at protecting people's lives, especially children, the elderly and people with disabilities. Also, these activities take place under full transparency of the process. Ukrainian authorities provide clear explanations of evacuation measures, and also provide transportation, temporary housing, food, and humanitarian aid for evacuees. The process excludes coercion, and the decision to leave home is voluntary. The biggest threat to the lives of the residents of Kherson is not the actions of the Ukrainian authorities, but regular shelling by the Russian military. It is because of these attacks that people are forced to leave their homes to save their lives. Russian propaganda often uses staged videos or old recordings made during the occupation to create the illusion of a -forced evacuation-. In reality, evacuation convoys are organized with the consent of citizens and at their request. The main reason for such fakes is the desire of the Russians to sow panic among the population. Propagandists are trying to intimidate the residents of Kherson in order to destroy trust in the Ukrainian authorities. This is part of an information war aimed at demoralizing the liberated territories. The occupiers are also trying to discredit Ukraine in the international arena. the Kremlin is trying to portray Ukraine as a state that -disdains the rights of its citizens.- This is an attempt to spoil the image of our country and to reduce the support of the international community. In addition, this is how the occupiers try to hide their own crimes. The invaders continue to shell the civilian infrastructure of Kherson, killing civilians. Accusations of -forced evacuation- divert attention from these crimes. The fake about the forced evacuation from Kherson is another attempt by Russian propaganda to distort reality. While Ukraine is protecting its citizens by organizing a safe exit from high-danger zones, Russia continues to shell the liberated territories, threatening the lives of thousands of people. Residents of Kherson have already seen the difference between Russian occupation and Ukrainian liberation. The lies of the Kremlin will not be able to convince those who have felt for themselves what real concern for human life is.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/06/rosiya-siye-paniku-ta-strah-fejk-pro-prymusovu-evakuacziyu-z-hersona/	2025-01-05T20:11:52-08:00

The occupiers have stopped repairing warships in Crimea, fearing damage	About this on the air of the telethon -The only news- said the spokesman of the Naval Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, captain 3rd rank Dmytro Pletenchuk. -The main forces of the Russians remained in Crimea. But we have already proven in practice that using repair bases for the Black Sea fleet of the Russians will no longer work. In order to restore ships, they must first be brought there. And now no one will do it,- said Dmytro Pletenchuk. He recalled the examples of the destruction of the small missile ship -Zyklon-, which guarded the Sevastopol Bay, the destruction of the submarine -Rostov-on-Don-, which was already damaged for the second time, the destruction of the MRK -Askold- in Kerch. -These cases suggest to the Russians that, after all, using Crimea for repairs is not possible in principle. Novorossiysk also has repair capabilities, but they are not comparable to the capabilities that the Russians have left in the occupied Ukrainian Crimea,- the spokesman said. Dmytro Pletenchuk also said that the Russians have the opportunity to build small missile ships in Zelenodolsk in Tatarstan, but at the moment it is impractical for them. -The last two ships from the Karakurt project - Askold and Zyklon, two of the five were forced to leave the Azov-Black Sea region. Now they are in the Caspian Sea,- he said. As reported by ArmyInform, only a Russian submarine, but it performs the task of protecting the base point. The rest of the patrol operations are conducted by enemy aircraft.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/05/okupanty-perestaly-remontuvaty-vijskovi-korabli-v-krymu-boyatsya-urazhen/	2025-01-05T11:08:28-08:00
The Russians control the Black Sea with aviation: after two downed helicopters, this may change	This was said on the telethon -Edyny Novyny- the spokesman of the Naval Dmytro Pletenchuk, captain of the 3rd rank of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. -That is, he is there not because he is a missile carrier, but because he is a submarine. He has a better chance of surviving after such a patrol. That's why the Russians have been using submarines for this for a long time,- Dmytro Pletenchuk said. He added that the Russians have been using aviation for a long time to protect the waters of the Black Sea due to the threat to their ships from the Defense Forces of Ukraine. -It cannot be said that the situation has fundamentally changed. They both used aviation and continue to do so. However, aviation became the answer to the impossibility of using the fleet to perform current tasks,- the spokesman said. Dmytro Pletenchuk added that the recent GUR operation, during which our naval drone shot down two Russian helicopters, could have a positive effect on the further actions of the Defense Forces of Ukraine. -The Russians control the airspace and only because of this they control the water area around Crimea and near their shores. I hope this situation can change a little in our favor,- he said.

This was told on the air of the telethon -Edyny Novyvi- the spokesman of the Naval Dmytro Pletenchuk, captain of the 3rd rank of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. -Whenever it is completed, they will not be able to use it as a base that can either significantly affect the ability to safely accommodate Russian ships, or as a tool that will solve these problems in the future,- Dmytro Pletenchuk said. He explained that this base, in principle, is not designed for those units of the fleet that are in service with the Russians. This base was previously used for the coast guard. -The very parameters of the harbor will not allow to place any significant resources, serious combat units there. Therefore, this base should not be taken into account as an influential factor in the development of Russian activities in the Black Sea,- the spokesman added. The Russian Navy was forced to transfer most of its ships to Novorossiysk after the Defense Forces of Ukraine destroyed a number of enemy combat units in the temporarily occupied Crimea. As reported by ArmyInform, only a Russian submarine, but it performs the task of protecting the base point.

Behind may be BMP, MT-LB with assault infantry, 5-7 people on each vehicle. The enemy's task is to approach the skirmish line as quickly as possible, cover the rushing infantry with firepower. -But due to coordinated work, the enemy crumbles. The last assault involving armored vehicles was repulsed yesterday in the direction of Zagryzovy . The enemy tried to widen the wedge near Kruglyakivka,- Yuriy Fedorenko emphasized. He added that where the enemy does not succeed with technology, the enemy tries to act with manpower. In some places, the enemy has to overcome up to 10 km on foot in order to get to the LBZ, regroup and carry out assault actions. -Out of 10 infantrymen who go out, 2-3 arrive. Takes a position — one. So they accumulate little by little and try to advance further.

The spokesman gave an example when individual enemy fighters try to use outdated practices, for example, manually carrying TM mines to throw them at the positions of the Ukrainian military. -Some actions look like scenes from a movie: people carry two TM mines by hand and try to throw them in the direction of Ukrainian positions. It is ineffective, but the enemy is betting on the mass of such attacks,- Viktor Tregubov said.

The German instructors were surprised at our speed - the anti-aircraft gun Volodymyr switched from -...	On January 5, the Air Command -West- told about the fighter. -It was a Russian -drone- that was conducting reconnaissance of the positions of our infantry. And then we started shooting down Russian planes and helicopters. In March 2022, Russian bombers felt unpunished in the skies over Kharkiv Oblast. They boldly crossed the combat line and dropped one and a half ton bombs on the positions of our troops. Being hit by such a blow is worse than being under artillery fire. We set ourselves the goal of protecting the infantry from aerial bombs. Therefore, they took positions as close as possible to the front-line units. This made it possible to shoot down Russian bombers earlier and at the same time made us extremely vulnerable to enemy attacks. But we still went forward. Infantry, tankers needed our cover from air strikes. The very fact that the -Buk- was standing nearby reassured the soldiers. We were very respected. They said: -It's good that you are here. We will have a little rest from the airstrikes.- They thanked us,- recalls Volodymyr. Anti-aircraft guns in that area discouraged the Russians from flying close to the line of battle and dropping unguided aerial bombs. In March 2022, four Russian front-line bombers and one helicopter were shot down by the combat service of Volodymyr Linnik in the Kharkiv region. In total, they destroyed 27 enemy targets in four months of operation in the area. After combat work in the Kharkiv region, the unit went abroad to master new weapons — the modern German anti-aircraft missile complex IRIS-T, which demonstrates impressive efficiency in destroying air targets. -The German instructors were surprised at the high speed with which we learned new weapons. We had one answer for them: time means people's lives saved, important objects protected,- says Volodymyr Linnik. Now Chief Sergeant Volodymyr Linnik is the head of maintenance of the IRIS-T air defense system launcher. -Our task is to transfer the launcher to the combat position and connect it to the command post. After the completion of the combat work, transfer the installation to the transport position and leave the position in time,- says Volodymyr Linnik. The combat record of the unit in which Volodymyr Linnik is currently serving is no less impressive than the previous one: anti-aircraft guns from IRIS-T destroyed 49 enemy targets. For his heroism and saved lives, chief sergeant Volodymyr Linnik was awarded the orders -For Courage- of the first, second and third degrees and the medal -For Military Service-. -I am ready to work for both Buk and IRIS-T. These two complexes are suitable for us to destroy the invaders and their missiles. Of course, IRIS-T is many times more perfect and effective. It's like the Mercedes of the car world. But the well-known truth remains unchanged. It is not the complexes, no matter how modern they are, that destroy the enemy, but the people who work for them. And I am glad that I was and am a part of strong collectives that bravely, professionally and loyally beat the aggressors. It happened that I shared one can of -stew- a day with the combat service. They risked their lives. They lost combat friends. A lot has already been passed. And we will go through a lot to take revenge for everyone and win,- assured Volodymyr Linnik. As reported by ArmyInform, Germany handed over to Ukraine another IRIS-T air defense system.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/05/nimeczki-instruktory-dyvuvalysya-nashij-shvydkosti-zenitnyk-volodymyr-perejshov-z-buka-na-iris/	2025-01-05T02:38:00-08:00

Self-flooding in Russian: the occupiers destroy watercraft in order not to go into battle	Serhiy Bratchuk, the spokesman of the Ukrainian Volunteer Army -South-, stated this on streamArmiiyTV. -In Lazurny, on the left bank of the Kherson region, there are cases where the Russian military deliberately breaks their boats or makes them unusable as a way to avoid an assault on the Dnieper islands. Today, our partisan movement is distributing instructions to the occupiers on how to do it so that it looks like a factory defect, and not deliberate sabotage,- said Serhiy Bratchuk. Although these cases are not yet widespread, it is already noticeable that they are not isolated and are becoming a trend among the Russian military. According to Bratchuk, the occupiers are looking for any way to avoid dangerous tasks, because storming positions on the Dnipro is actually a -one-way ticket.- As ArmiyaInform reported, in the Dnieper direction, Russian invaders attacked our positions three times. They were strongly repulsed and suffered losses in the areas of Zabych and Kozatskyi islands. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/05/samozatoplennya-po-rosijsky-okupanty-nyshhat-plavzasoby-shhob-ne-jty-v-bij/	2025-01-05T01:23:13-08:00

The enemy has increased the share of attack UAVs with a fiber-optic control channel, which pose a threat to military equipment during its movement. However, we are not standing still and have also started to use FPV drones on fiber optics, which expands the possibilities for defeating and destroying Russian military equipment and personnel,- noted Oleksandr Syrskyi.

Who was the first in the Armed Forces to hit a flying target using FPV: the story of -Ajax- and -Kry...	-Ajax- is balanced, careful, attentive to details, obviously likes systematicity and clear organization of processes. -Krysha- is tenacious, energetic, proactive, a locomotive of new things, ready to take risks and experiment. Probably, in non-military life, they would not have had any chance to cross paths. -Ajax- held an administrative position in production, -Krysha- managed business in the field of dentistry. Different cities, professions, social circles. However, the war changed their destinies and life plans. -Ajax- and -Krysha- got into the same unit and are currently a super-efficient and well-coordinated FPV crew in the 126th Separate Aviation Brigade of the 30th Marine Corps. Their tandem can boast of a huge number of successful sorties and even a successful -invention-, because they were the first in the Armed Forces of Ukraine to hit a flying target with the help of FPV. The following is a joint story by -Ajax- and -Krysha- for ArmiyaInform about how they started working with unmanned systems, which targets were most memorable, why failures are a valuable experience, why they nailed the Russian reconnaissance drone -Zala- to the ceiling and what it's like to be emotionally synchronized over several years enough to speak the same phrases. Ajax: When the full-scale invasion of Russia began, it was clear that the first priority was to keep the family safe. Civil cases were taken away for about two weeks, at that time I had already made up my mind that I would take part in hostilities and defend my country. -Krysha-:I also took my wife and child to a safe place, closed the business with my friends and went to the Military Commissariat. Everyone got to one department. He was a machine gunner, a gunner, a combat medic. Kim just wasn't (laughs). -Ajax-: At the beginning of March, recruitment was announced for the newly created 126th brigade, I went there on March 9, learned the necessary information, and on the 10th I already arrived at the brigade with things and a shaved head. At first he was a shooter. Then there was a need for platoon combat medics. It turned out that I became a combat medic in my platoon, and -Krysha- in mine. And we passed the first rotation in these positions. -Roof-: At one time, I worked a little with the guys who flew Maviks - I was in the cover group, accompanied them to -zero-. I watched how they worked, it was very interesting. Then numerous videos of FPV drone crashes began to appear. I started to get our company commander, saying let's do the drones. In the end, I was able to convince him and I was sent to study as an unmanned aerial vehicle operator. -Ajax-:And I already followed -Krysha-. Even then it was clear that unmanned systems are a very promising direction. As they like to say, a game changer in war. At that time, there were a large number of units using drones, and it was obvious that we could not be rear-ended, at least within our unit. In fact, we succeeded. -Ajax-:One training smoothly flowed into another, because the direction is very capacious, a lot of information. And if as of a year and a half ago it was quite static, then it began to rapidly improve and change. It's a constant race now. The enemy is progressing, we are progressing - who outplays who. Boring never happens. Our main direction is FPV, but it is combined, let's say, with the application of other types of UAVs. Because, as they say, one in the field is not a warrior. Given that the quality of the camera and video communication does not allow conducting reconnaissance, for example, or searching for a target in free flight. Therefore, in any case, our work is related to the work of scouts, because the -mavik- has a better picture, which allows you to search for targets and film the results of the damage accordingly. -Roof-: Even if you work with FPV, in order to perform the task as efficiently as possible, you need to understand not only these systems, but also the work of reconnaissance Mavics, EW, PEP. Must know what the enemy uses and how to counter it, what frequencies it flies on, how to intercept video or control frequencies. It is also important for general awareness - where you are, at what point, what are its features, whether something threatens you or not. Many nuances. -Ajax-: Even after the first training, we joked that FPV is a direction in which there is only one answer to any question - you have to try. That is, no one will usually give you a specific answer, and you really should not be afraid to experiment. We started the FPV direction with bombers. FPV-kamikaze began to be used in half a year. The first application, I remember, was exciting, but not with the desired result. The solutions weren't always effective, but at a certain point we reached a level where our unit's efficiency in using FPV kamikaze reached somewhere around 80 percent. -Krysha-: I will add that we could not immediately dive into the work with the FPV-kamikaze, because we did not know how to work with ammunition. That is, it took us about half a year to acquire and improve knowledge in this area. -Ajax-: Yes, given that we are civilians, before the war we did not have professional knowledge in engineering and mining, work with explosives. But we had a great desire to work and it pushed us forward. -Ajax-:The operation on the left bank of the Dnieper had several stages, accordingly, there was different intensity, different units were involved. When you understand that the person with whom you had coffee yesterday is now on the left bank, and your task is to cover it with all available means, motivation increases many times. At the first stage, we worked in resets. -Roof-: It was different&#8230; Both misses and misses. Then we were gaining experience. -Ajax-: Speaking of Krynyk, we managed to take part in the active phase of this operation. We worked from the front and on the enemy's infantry and on the equipment that was still actively used by the enemy at that time. They worked on tanks, BMPs, guns. -Roof-: By mortars. -Ajax-: For all the means of defeat, which did not allow our brothers to advance. Once in Krynyk, scouts from a neighboring unit discovered the 120th mortar, which caused many problems for the infantry. We managed to disable it, it did not work for about a week. And it was a really nice result. In general, the intensity of work was quite high. In addition, there was a large concentration of neighbors - our FPV colleagues - in the direction. It was interesting because everyone has their own style, experience. And there was an opportunity to meet, correspond, exchange knowledge. At the same time, I must say, even negative work experience had value. -Roof-: Do you remember the dance? Ajax: Yes! This is one such example. The enemy planned an assault with infantry and two tanks. One distracted, the other performed the main task. Our task was to figure out which tank was the main one, and therefore the priority to hit, which was not easy because both were chaotically circling the streets. At that time, we were working as bombers with ammunition not equipped by us. From a professional point of view, it was not quite right, because you have to work with what you are sure will work. But then we did not yet know how to equip ourselves with ammunition. In the end, we determined which tank to hit first, flew with a reset, hit. However, the result was not seen - there was no gap. Dropped the second ammo, same story. -The Roof-: It was such a disappointment&#8230; But it helped us to draw the right conclusion: we need to learn to prepare ammunition ourselves or to interact with the sappers of our battalion. Ajax:This experience showed that a bad result can also be useful. It allows you to analyze the error and develop further. If you don't make mistakes, you don't grow professionally. -Ajax-: If we recall the first experience of hitting flying targets&#8230; It was an impact wing in February 2024. Before that, in the history of war, there were no cases of hitting a flying target with the help of FPV-kamikaze. At the beginning of 2024, the enemy began to use attack wings. And at that moment, thanks to our neighbors, we had the opportunity to track their routes. At a certain point, we realized that we had to try. If you don't try, you won't be able to understand whether this is your goal or not. We had some ideas about how to do it, but there was no certainty that it would work. But already the first flight was effective. We caught a wing flying in our direction. Then -Krysha- said&#8230; -Roof-: Well, let's try the board? The commanders replied: -Well, let's try!- Tried and managed to hit the enemy wing. Ajax: It was, of course, a free target, because it is effectively a wing made of primitive means. Despite this, it was dangerous for our brothers and something had to be done with it. Then the second and third wings were shot down. The understanding came that it is necessary to somehow scale this experience, to share it. They met with various departments, consulted - everything worked out in them too. And it was very nice to realize that you are the first, but not the only one, who can share knowledge and skills. Instead, colleagues shared their experiences. This is called synergy. Well, then they moved on to more valuable goals - -Zala-, -Superkami-, -Orlany-. Given the nature of our work, we have almost no opportunity to seek out the targets we hit. Somehow, our comrades presented us with an enemy reconnaissance UAV -Zala-, found in our area of ​​responsibility. We nailed it to the ceiling(points up - ed.), every morning I wake up, show the -fak- to the Hall and remind myself why we have to keep fighting. Setting myself up for a working day (laughs - ed.). -Roof-: In addition, this is a reminder that you should not be afraid to do something extraordinary. Ajax: Yes. I am thankful to -Krish-. He often pushes me to do something new. By nature, I am very cautious, I often play it safe, I prefer the usual, already proven format of work. And -Roof- is the opposite. And it often works. I love that we complement each other. That's cool. -Roof-:Our team is already like a family - we understand each other, we -read- each other's words. -Ajax-: To be honest, it's getting ridiculous. Sometimes it happens that we finish the phrases one by one. A kind of synchronization. And it's really cool. If it were otherwise, it probably wouldn't be my person. And we wouldn't be able to work together. In the beginning it was just the two of us. Over time, they began to recruit people into the team, already understanding on what principles we will build it. Staff safety, professionalism, mutual respect, mutual assistance and support. Our task is to share our experience and give people the opportunity to learn. Because, well, let's be honest, nobody knows what tomorrow will bring. Some of us may die. And if you build a team in such a way that each person is irreplaceable, then the loss of even one will make the unit unviable. We can't afford that. -Roof-: Has the war changed us? We should probably ask our loved ones about this. -Ajax-: Stop using my words already! I changed, and I personally would like to think that it is for the better. Priorities have changed. Material things took a back seat. The time that can be spent with relatives has become the most valuable - something that I did not pay attention to before, because it was mostly enough. Lost the value of words, instead gained - actions. There was an understanding of who your real friends are. People you met already in the army are a powerful motivation not to give up, to continue fighting, no matter how tired you are. -Roof-:We hold each other. Because if, for example, I leave, then I will constantly think about how Ajax is here, like the guys. I will not feel safe in the rear because my brothers are here. -Ajax-:If you have already taken up this matter, then you need to move on. The choice is made and it is the right one! Nobody is ironclad. No one said it was easy, that you don't want to go home. -Roof-: Really want it. Ajax: However, I have never regretted my decision to go and defend my country. And I sincerely believe that every person should honestly admit to himself whether he is just an observer or an active participant in something really important and powerful. No matter how difficult it is, the fight for freedom is worth it. -Roof-: I support! Now you said it in my words (smiles - ed.).

How to save life at zero: a report from the takmed school of the DSHV about the fight against combat...	Oleksandr became a combat medic in 2023, also graduated from the same School of Tactical Medicine. After graduation, he was sent with his instructor to the 79th separate Tavrian Assault Brigade to help wounded soldiers at the front. -I remember once I even had to help my mentor. We worked in the forward positions, 200 meters from the contact line, a fierce battle was going on. The enemy was hitting with artillery, the infantry and drones were advancing. My instructor, as a combat medic helping our wounded paratroopers, was himself seriously wounded. Fortunately, it was possible to quickly evacuate him and the other boys to a stabilization point. The instructor and the boys survived. And this means that he prepared me well,- Oleksandr says. Vitaly comes from Sviatohirsk, Donetsk region. He was a combat medic in the 80th Separate Airborne Assault Brigade of the Galician Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. He took part in battles in the Kherson region, in the Sviatohirsk region, twice near Bakhmut and in a counteroffensive in the Kharkiv region. Wounded twice.-The most difficult was near Bakhmut. Opposite us were the Pskov paratroopers of the Russian Federation and the -Wagner- PVK. It was very tough, the intensity of hostilities simply went off the scale. Very often during intense shelling, when it is not possible to approach, crawl up and do everything yourself, when the wounded person has not yet managed to help himself, the combat medic from a distance must analyze his condition and, if he is conscious, control the process by voice, indicating what to do. As soon as the situation became relatively more or less safe, we immediately crawled to our wounded guys and worked according to the protocol given the circumstances. In such difficult conditions, they mostly worked under Bakhmut,- says the sergeant-instructor. Vitaly explains: under no circumstances should a combat medic be in a stupor, because he will not provide help to his comrades in time and may die himself. -At the School of Tactical Medicine, training is carried out in two directions - the training of combat medics and the training of paramedics. The main idea of ​​training courses is to teach cadets all the necessary skills that they will need on the battlefield to preserve the life and health of soldiers, sergeants and officers. The training programs necessarily take into account the experience of conducting combat operations. Look, we probably won't tell you a big secret, but a combat medic is not a doctor, as many people think in society. The main task of a combat medic is to save life and maintain the condition of the wounded until the moment when he gets to the doctor, in -hospital- conditions. Another interesting point: as the experience of the large-scale invasion of the Russian Federation demonstrates, it is easier to train a person from scratch than, for example, to retrain a person with extensive medical experience to become an effective combat medic. Tactical medicine is very different from conventional medicine in its protocols. Both the protocols and the circumstances in which combat medics work differ from those in which ordinary medics work. Combat medics work with what they have. What you took with you to the front, what you specifically have at hand. With this, you save the life of a comrade on the battlefield. Evacuation is very difficult on the front line, when our defenders are constantly under fire from the enemy, under the attack of FPV drones. Here, as it is written in the book, it will not work. Evacuation is carried out mostly by luck, at one or another moment of hostilities. And it depends on whether the car can reach at least some point in the area where it is already possible to evacuate more or less safely. Combat medics are trained according to the generally accepted MARCH algorithm. This is an abbreviation for the sequence of actions in the provision of pre-medical and medical care in combat conditions. Taking into account who is wounded and according to this algorithm, the instructors teach the cadets the actions they need to take in order for the wounded to survive. How the MARCH algorithm is built: the sooner death can come, the sooner you need to act. Therefore, the first letter M in the algorithm is massive bleeding. It is necessary to act immediately. The next A is patency of the upper respiratory tract, from which a person dies in about 5-6 minutes without assistance. Next, R is trauma (injury) to the chest. These are what we call the three -most dangerous letters-. Then there is work with injuries, let's say, which do not bring quick death. These are problems with blood circulation (with the loss of a large volume of blood) and problems with hypothermia and head injuries. In these cases, the main thing is to evacuate to the stabilization point as soon as possible. What do we focus on during classes? Using our own examples, we tell the boys that they should prepare for the most difficult. In battle, it is very difficult, shelling, constant danger, and a combat medic must be -with a cool head- and work under any circumstances, even in conditions of complete chaos and uncertainty. The training of combat medics at the School of Tactical Medicine is divided into conditional zones of the battlefield: red (in the firing zone), yellow (providing assistance on the battlefield when there is no fire, or in the shelter zone) and green (the place where the evacuation of the wounded takes place). Instructors work alongside the cadets. All of them went through combat operations. So they have experience working in extreme conditions. The first training block is an initial medical examination and stopping of critical bleeding. Close by is restoring patency of the upper respiratory tract and providing care for chest injuries. At other training sites, combat medics train to overcome stress, provide care to the wounded with brain injuries and hypothermia, and learn to work with fractures. A separate tent for ligation of body parts. Here, they also master the skills of helping with burns and other injuries, teach how to numb wounds. Another important training block is triage of the wounded. The duties of a combat medic also include instructing soldiers on how to act during shelling or direct combat. It is very important to work on the front lines, when there is a mass application of FPV drones, this should also be taken into account in the training of cadets. The guys emphasize: hand motility and memory are extremely important in battle. The combat medic himself must work out his own -algorithm of actions- with his own hands, he must -feel- the moment, what, how and for what. Cadets are trained to work with soldiers who have psychological problems. There are actionable algorithms, what should be done in a stressful situation, when a military man has suffered some kind of psychological trauma, what to do with him, how to properly get him out of this state? During hostilities, we use the ICOVER protocol, which consists of 6 simple steps: Probably one of the few areas in this war, where the Ukrainian army is head and shoulders above the Katsap army, this is, of course, tactical medicine. The daily level of losses of raschits is a clear confirmation of this. The occupiers do not take away their wounded on the battlefield, do not provide first aid. The Russians do not have turnstiles like ours, which work very efficiently. How many people have we seen captured, killed, they don't even have first aid kits. Instead there are Esmarch harnesses. It's rubber that stretches, cracks due to the heat. Such a turnstile simply kills a person. The occupiers do not care about the lives of their soldiers, for them they are just -cannon fodder. Oleksandr says: -from my experience, I saw only one time, when the soldiers pulled out a wounded officer from among the torn corpses of infantry groups. Wounded and destroyed bodies, the occupiers simply threw them into a pit so that they would not be seen by the next assault groups, which were thrown back into the offensive.- the Russians are inferior to us in medical supply and training of combat medics. All our servicemen undergo a course of tactical medicine before being sent to a combat zone, because they know that their lives and the lives of their comrades in the trenches are the most important. Instead, wounded Rashists, who act according to the prescriptions of Soviet textbooks, die.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/05/yak-zberegty-zhyttya-na-nuli-reportazh-zi-shkoly-takmedu-dshv-pro-borotbu-z-bojovym-stresom/	2025-01-04T20:23:34-08:00
-Psychological terrorism- at ZANP: propaganda again turns reality into absurdity	One of the latest -creations- of the occupiers is the allegation of alleged -psychological terrorism- that Kyiv is directing against the workers of the Zaporizhia NPP (ZAEP). This fake needs detailed analysis, because it not only distorts the facts, but also tries to hide the real crimes of the occupiers at the station. According to Russian narratives, the Ukrainian authorities systematically exert -psychological pressure- on ZNPP employees, in particular through alleged -threats, blackmail and intimidation of families.- This campaign, according to the propagandists, is designed to destabilize the work of the station and disrupt its -normal functioning.- But as with most Russian fakes, the narratives are based on an absolute lack of evidence and a brazen disregard for context. The Zaporizhzhia NPP has been under Russian occupation since March 2022. The station has been turned into a military base: the Russian military has placed equipment and ammunition on its territory, and the workers are actually kept under control. The Ukrainian side does not have physical access to the station, and any statements about Kyiv's direct influence are absurd in view of reality. Propagandists, accusing Ukraine of -psychological terror-, do not provide any confirmation. There are no recordings of the conversations, nor the testimony of the employees themselves, which could testify to the reality of such actions. Instead, there is ample evidence of Russia's crimes at the ZANP, including the testimony of Ukrainian workers who managed to escape the occupation. The occupation administration systematically intimidates the station's employees, forcing them to sign contracts with Russia's Rosatom. Workers are in a state of constant stress due to threats of arrest, torture and even family violence. Such methods are a common practice of the occupiers. russia has already used the nuclear power plant for nuclear blackmail on several occasions, including shelling the plant and creating risks of a large-scale accident. Narratives about -psychological pressure- from Ukraine divert attention from these actions and are designed to create a false impression of the aggressor. Russian disinformation about the ZANP is aimed not only at discrediting Ukraine, but also at creating informational noise that hides the crimes of the occupiers. At the same time, such fakes are aimed at an international audience, which may not be sufficiently familiar with the context and perceive these fabrications as part of the -objective- picture. Kyiv's fake -psychological terrorism- is another example of how Russia distorts reality to justify its crimes. Instead, the real source of terror at the station is the occupiers, who endanger not only ZNPP workers, but also millions of people in Ukraine and abroad. In addition, the Russians damaged and stolen hundreds of computers, software, 1,500 dosimetry devices and fire-fighting equipment. And this is real, not fictional terror. Ukraine continues to make every effort to de-occupy the station and ensure its safety. The world community should clearly understand who the aggressor really is and not succumb to the provocations with which the Kremlin tries to hide its crimes.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/05/psyhologichnyj-teroryzm-na-zaes-rospropaganda-znov-peretvoryuye-realnist-na-absurd/	2025-01-04T20:08:20-08:00
They were scared with grenades - two of our paratroopers captured 14 occupiers	The video of the combat work was made public on January 4 on the brigade's channel. An assault group of paratroopers approached one of the Russian positions. Before that, the pilots of the attack drones successfully worked against the enemy. After an intense and long raid, the invaders hid in a tight dugout and did not stick their noses out. At this time, two paratroopers managed to get close. They threw grenades right at the entrance to the enemy dugout. The frightened occupiers immediately shouted that they were ready to lay down their arms. The paratroopers had no idea that as many as 14 occupiers were crammed into the dugout. -They chose life, not death - and our paratroopers did not refuse them. In the unique footage from night drones, we can see how two of our paratroopers are actually taking Russian soldiers into captivity in formation. Brilliant and heroic work,- the team commented on the video. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the 79th Tavrian Assault Brigade repelled a powerful assault occupiers and destroyed a large amount of equipment.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/04/nalyakaly-granatamy-dvoye-nashyh-desantnykiv-vzyaly-u-polon-14-okupantiv/	2025-01-04T11:51:03-08:00
The Russians left the foresters at the TOT of Ukraine without salaries	This is reported by a> Center of national resistance. Local collaborators appropriated at least 55 million Russian rubles, which were supposed to be paid to foresters. This is not the only reason for non-payment. the Kremlin is no longer able to fully subsidize the Ukrainian regions it occupied and practically destroyed. Therefore, this is far from an isolated case when employees are left with empty pockets. This is the situation among railway workers, miners, and utility workers. As reported > ArmyInform, since the beginning of the new year, massive police raids have been taking place on the highways of the TOT of Ukraine, which are allegedly aimed at identifying drivers without Russian motor vehicle	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/04/rosiyany-zalyshyly-bez-zarplat-lisnykiv-na-tot-ukrayiny/	2025-01-04T10:57:34-08:00

President: Life needs protection here and now in Ukraine, and air defense systems must work for this	He reported this in his evening address. There are dozens of partner countries, and among them there are those who can increase Ukraine's capabilities not only in defense against missiles, but also in defense against guided bombs and Russian aircraft. -We will talk about it with them, we will convince them. Life needs protection here and now in Ukraine, and air defense systems must work for this. I want to thank all partners who understand this and help us with the development of the air shield,- the Head of State emphasized. The president said that rescue operations are ongoing in Sves, in Sumy Oblast, where the enemy targeted his bombs. -The entrance to the building was destroyed, from the first to the fifth floor. Neighboring houses were also damaged. This is another hostile blow to people's lives. Today there were airstrikes on other settlements of Sumy region and Kharkiv region. All victims are being assisted. Search and rescue operations in Chernihiv were completed today after an enemy missile attack. It was there that more than 40 houses and buildings were destroyed and damaged. Unfortunately, there is a victim in Chernihiv, my condolences,- said Volodymyr Zelenskyi. He also added that the Russian Federation had lost up to a battalion of North Korean soldiers and marines in the Kursk region over the past two days. -The commander-in-chief also reported on the situation in the Kursk region. In particular, in the battles today and yesterday only in the area of ​​one village of Makhnovka in Kurshchyna, the Russian army lost up to an infantry battalion of North Korean soldiers and Russian paratroopers. And you can feel it,- he added. How ArmyInform reported, the situation at the front remains difficult and tense.

Moscow spreads its propaganda abroad through higher education	About this notifies the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. The federal project -Export of Education- is used to increase the number of foreign students. Often, the education of foreigners is financed by large state corporations, such as Rosatom or RUSAL. That is, foreign students study at the expense of the Russian state. The Russian Federation seeks to create a -single educational space with Africa.- The Russian-African Network University and the People's Friendship University of Russia (RUDN) are working on this. The goal of the Russian Federation is to educate foreigners who are loyal and dependent on it. After completing their education, graduates of Russian universities open -cultural centers- in their countries and launch other -Russian cooperation- projects. In fact, such projects are just a cover for information operations and the promotion of ru-propaganda in other countries. As reported by ArmyInform, at the end of 2024 the Russian economy showed a number of negative indicators: the acceleration of inflation growth to double-digit values ​​in annual terms, the fall of the ruble exchange rate, the reduction of the balance balance of payments.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/04/moskva-poshyryuye-svoyu-propagandu-za-kordonom-cherez-vyshhu-osvitu/	2025-01-04T10:11:00-08:00

Prohibited tactics of rashists: the enemy drops tear gas on the positions of our military	How does the enemy attack the positions of our defenders in the Lymano-Kupyan direction and what tactics does it use in on the air the press officer of the brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine told the -Yedini Novyni- telethon -Rubizh- Maxim Taran. -The enemy does not stop trying to break through our defense line. He is trying to destroy our positions by all available means: airstrikes, drops from -maviks- and strikes from FPV drones. For example, enemy infantry in the amount of 5-10 people is coming, we start to destroy them and thereby unmask our positions. The enemy sees this and then begins to attack us with drops from Maviks, use artillery, as well as kamikaze drones,- &#8211; the officer said. According to the press officer, the enemy's infantry is created only to -light up- our positions and die. -Also, the enemy has recently increased the number of tear gas discharges. the Rashists seek to -smoke- us out of our positions. But the personnel of our brigade has all necessary means of protection,- said Maksym Taran. the Russians in this direction began to use -maviks- more, since they are not as sensitive to the EW system as, for example, a simple FPV drone. -The enemy has also started using fiber-optic FPV drones. This allows it to avoid the operation of our EW tools. The best way to destroy these drones is with a shotgun,- he said. At the same time, in the area of ​​responsibility of the -Rubizh- brigade, there is slightly less use of enemy armored vehicles with weapons. -Even earlier, there were attempts to break through our defense line with the help of heavy equipment, but thanks to the effective actions of our artillery support units and anti-tank units, the enemy suffered heavy losses,- the press officer added. As reported by ArmyInform , in the Vremiv direction, the main task of the Russian troops remains the cutting of logistical routes units of the Defense Forces of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/04/zaboroneni-pryjomy-rashystiv-vorog-skyduye-slozoginnyj-gaz-na-pozycziyi-nashyh-vijskovyh/	2025-01-04T08:49:58-08:00
-Chain of life-: Guardsman -Dentist- about the evacuation of the wounded in the Pokrovsky direction	The story of the fighter published by the National Guard of Ukraine. The medic says that the -chain of life- for wounded comrades at the front has three basic elements: -case-evac-, -med-evac- and -stabilization point-. -Dentist- and his colleagues work on medical evacuation. — There are several stages of evacuation. Case-evac works from the positions of our comrades where the injury occurred - they are taken to us by armored vehicles. We stabilize the wounded, provide him with all the necessary medical assistance and transport him to the stabilization point as soon as possible. We have several duty stations. If we receive a signal about the wounded, we try to find out as much as possible about the condition of the fighters - light, medium, heavy, as well as about the nature of the wound. We make decisions according to the situation. At the same time, they should be accepted quickly, - explains -Dantist-. During a medical evacuation, speed is very important, but the professionalism and coordinated work of the evacuation team are no less important. Injuries are different. The boys say that, in contrast to the Zaporozhye direction, near Pokrovsk the number of gunshot wounds from small arms has increased. The enemy is also actively using poisonous gases. All this makes adjustments to the work of doctors. One of the principles that the evacuation team tries to follow is constant communication with wounded soldiers. — We maintain not only visual, but also auditory contact: we communicate, we say that the fighter should not relax. Usually, when an injured person gets into our car, the brain thinks: -I'm safe, now they'll save me.- It relaxes a person. We encourage her, tell her not to sleep, ask questions. We leave her in consciousness, - says the guardsman. -Dentist- admits that the hardest thing is when you have to save a loved one. In this case, it is important to keep a cool head and not let emotions get the better of you. There are no easy evacuations, but if this is your brother with whom you shared a piece of bread yesterday, then it is really more difficult. But you have to approach it with a cold mind and understand that his life depends on your actions, so we go beyond these emotional details and work with a cold mind, says the doctor. One day, the guardsman received news of the death of his brother, with whom he had been side by side since the first days of the full-scale invasion. - It was very traumatic for me. In the evening, we received information that we had a seriously wounded person. We drove to the evacuation point and it turned out to be my brother, whom I thought was dead. He was in a very difficult condition, but he was alive, and it already depended on us whether he would live in the future. We made decisions very quickly, did everything possible. He survived. This motivates to work in this direction and to treat one's work responsibly, - the -Dentist- shares his memories. As reported ArmyInform, fighters of the 71st Hunter Brigade of the Airborne Assault Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine destroyed 2 Russian attack aircraft with one blow, and then burned several units of equipment.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/04/lanczyuzhok-zhyttya-gvardiyecz-dantyst-pro-evakuacziyu-poranenyh-na-pokrovskomu-napryamku/	2025-01-04T08:27:41-08:00
the Russian economy in 2025 awaits -import inflation-	About this reports the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. Despite the efforts of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, these factors are a reflection of the unbalanced growth model of the Russian wartime economy. At the same time, the monetary policy of Russia demonstrates the transition to the -mode of manual management-. This is confirmed by the regulator's decision not to raise the discount rate in December in exchange for the government's promise to limit preferential lending programs. Further strengthening of Western sanctions and a decrease in the price of oil will have a noticeable negative impact on the economy of the Russian Federation. Challenges that will affect the Russian economy in 2025: - a possible resumption of -trade wars- between leading countries. This can complicate global logistics and limit the production of goods, which will negatively affect the demand for Russian export products; — increase in production and export of oil in countries that are not part of the OPEC+ agreement and, accordingly, a noticeable decrease in world oil prices. Brazil, Canada and the USA can provide an additional 1.5 million barrels per day. In addition, from the II quarter of 2025, an agreed increase in production is also possible in OPEC+ countries, which do not want to give up market shares; — strengthening of sanctions restrictions and control over trade transactions and payments of Russian companies; — a reduction in the harvest of agricultural crops in 2025 due to unfavorable natural conditions in 2024 will weaken Russia's position on world agricultural markets. The combination of the above factors will create the effect of -inflation import-, in which the increase in the prices of goods in the world due to trade and currency wars, the lengthening of delivery routes and the increase of transport tariffs will lead to an increase in prices, which does not depend on domestic economic policy. As reported ArmyInform, People The Bank of China (NBC) announced plans to reform the country's monetary policy in 2025.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/04/rosijsku-ekonomiku-u-2025-roczi-chekaye-import-inflyacziyi/	2025-01-04T08:11:57-08:00
Tanks clear the village, a Russian man's leg was torn off, drones in the north of the Russian Federa...	The task was completed despite the fact that already on the way to the destination, the enemy began to work on the tanks, pelting them with MLRS, FPV drones and -lancets-. Drones attacked the port near St. Petersburg. A video from social networks shows explosions at the fuel terminals of the port of Ust-Luga, the second largest port in Russia. The ban on take-off and landing of passenger planes continued all morning at the nearest airports. -Arrivals- were also recorded in Smolensk Region. The probable target of the strike could be the company JSC -Avangard-, which is part of the Russian military industry. Products made of fiberglass and plastics are made on it. In particular, transport and launch containers and engine housings of solid-fuel rockets, elements of armor and anti-radiation protection for armored vehicles.

-Advancing by corpses-: what are the tactics of the enemy near Velika Novosilka	The head of the communications department 48 told about this in the broadcast telethon -Edyny Novyny- Bohdan Petrenko of the separate artillery brigade. -The situation in Vremivsk direction is really difficult. The enemy is trying to capture territories and advance. In addition, the enemy wants to control the supply routes to Velika Novosilka and the route that goes to Kurakhovo. But the Defense Forces are putting up quite a powerful resistance to the enemy's intentions and are not allowing him to realize these intentions, the officer said. Bohdan Petrenko reported that the enemy's tactics in this direction are unchanged. -This is the application of small tactical groups. In some places, mechanized equipment is also used to transport the rakes. How it happens: The infantry enters the gray areas and tries to advance towards our positions. But at all stages of their movement, they are monitored from the air and fire damage is carried out in a timely manner,- he emphasized. According to him, the enemy will suffer heavy losses, but at the same time, he will not stop trying to advance further. -Russians do not spare people, unlike military equipment. Detection and destruction of the enemy takes place practically 24/7.

China is reforming its monetary policy, focusing on international standards	About this notifies the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. The main instrument of regulation will be the seven-day reverse repo rate. In this way, the regulator will abandon the traditional practice of setting -quantitative targets- for credit volumes and will reduce the use of a large number of different interest rates currently applied in the country's financial system. The changes are aimed at reducing the level of the discount rate, which is currently 1.5%. The reform will reduce the risks associated with overcapacity, when businesses produce more goods than the market needs, leading to lower prices and losses, problems in the real estate market due to excessive vacancies and financial instability due to high debts construction companies and inefficient use of loans, which are often provided for unprofitable or excessively risky projects. In addition, the NBK purchased government bonds on the open market for the first time in twenty years, which made it possible to introduce additional liquidity into the financial system. The success of the reform may bring China's monetary policy closer to international standards. Transitioning to a more transparent and efficient system based on international standards will enable the PRC to attract more foreign investment, increase confidence in the financial system and contribute to a more predictable economic environment. As reported ArmyInform, the Russians are actively preparing for another illegal election in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine during a single voting day.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/04/kytaj-reformuye-svoyu-monetarnu-polityku-oriyentuyuchys-na-mizhnarodni-standarty/	2025-01-04T06:11:33-08:00

The spokesman of the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, captain 3rd rank Dmytro Pletenchuk. -Fighting the enemy is a constant search for counteracting its influence on Ukraine's actions at sea. the Russians, like us, are looking for different options for using their forces at sea. We all remember how the appearance of manned naval systems began to significantly affect the presence of Russian warships in various parts of the Black Sea and Crimea. And at some point the rules of the game were changed. the Russians were actually forced to suspend their permanent activities in the open Black Sea,- said Dmytro Pletenchuk. The enemy was also looking for ways to counter our naval drones. -And for them, aviation became this solution. But now Ukrainian naval drones are not only hunting for Russian ships, but also for enemy helicopters. And I hope that similar tactics will be used on a much larger scale in the future.

The EU seeks to localize defense production	This is reported by Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. Such a decision will help strengthen the defense capability of the region and create new partnerships between European manufacturers. An example is the German company -Hensoldt-, which benefited from the growth of defense investments in Germany - the company's shares have almost tripled since 2022, and the order book in 2024 has reached a record 6.5 billion euros. European manufacturers expect that even after the end of the Russian-Ukrainian war, defense spending will remain high due to the need to contain Russia's military potential. NATO member countries' plans to increase defense spending from 2% to 3% of GDP will contribute to the development of the EU's defense sector. In this context, EU member states are already discussing the creation of a joint fund worth 500 billion euros for defense projects and arms purchases.

Surround Pokrovsk and cut logistics: The enemy's plans were reported to OSUV - Khortytsia	Viktor, the spokesman of the Khortytsia operational-strategic group of troops, told about this in Edyny Novyni marathon air Tregubov -The plan of the enemy &#8211; this is the encirclement of Pokrovsk and the entry of Russian troops there. They are trying, first of all, to interrupt the communications and logistics chains that the Ukrainian army currently has. In order to do this, they try to stick together in small groups in settlements south of Pokrovsk. According to the principle, a small group first got involved, got a foothold, and the next one approached. That is, simply promotion with impregnation. Of course, at the same time, they do not climb directly into the city, because these are heavy urban battles. And Pokrovsk is unlikely to be too much for them. Especially since they have already engaged in urban battles in a number of other settlements,- &#8211; says Viktor Tregubov. The Ukrainian Defense Forces are trying to prevent them from doing this (cut communications - author) and strike at the enemy, including with drones and other weapons. According to him, the enemy is no longer using anti-aircraft missiles as actively as it was, for example, a year ago. -It should be understood that this weapon is very inaccurate, but causes serious destruction. The best way to counter KABs &#8211; this is the destruction of enemy airfields, the planes of the Russian Federation, even before they took off, and the destruction of the stocks of aerial bombs themselves,- &#8211; he added. As ArmyInform reported, over the past day the enemy attacked 40 times in the Pokrovsky direction. &nbsp; &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/04/otochyty-pokrovsk-i-pererizaty-logistyku-u-osuv-hortyczya-povidomyly-plany-voroga/	2025-01-04T01:23:15-08:00
-Baba Yaga- stole the wounded man! — the Russians are so afraid of our bomber drones that they inven...	About the fighter his brigade told on January 4. -Oak- and his boys are sponsors of the night terrors of the enemy. The occupiers shudderingly call the -Vampire- bombers -Baba Yaga-. Among the enemies, there is even a legend that once -Baba Yaga- kidnapped their wounded soldier. But this, as -Duba- says, is folklore. -Of course, the -Vampire- can raise a person, but it will not carry him far. I know there are already drones that can lift up to several hundred kilograms, but we don't have them yet. And they cost a lot of money,- notes -Duba-. -Constructively, the Vampire is an ordinary agricultural drone, equipped and improved to perform combat tasks. It is large and very loud, so it is impossible to fly to enemy positions on it during the day - it will be shot down immediately. But at night it's a different matter,- says -Duba-. The volume of the drone is its advantage. -When the -Vampire- flies, the sound of the engine can be heard from a kilometer away. It is audible, but the drone itself is not visible. The sound seems to be approaching from all sides, and the enemy simply does not understand where in the sky to look for it. That's why he starts shooting in different directions, chaotically. And we fly there and do our work,- says -Duba-. -Vampire- can perform many tasks. The guys from the unit say that two crews are enough to -open- even a well-protected enemy dugout. In addition, often with the help of heavy drones, pilots deliver parcels to the positions of our infantry: they drop food, medicine, batteries for walkie-talkies, fuel for generators. The capacity of the -Vampire- is impressive. According to -Duba-, all its pilots are professionals, versatile specialists. -There are no unmotivated, random people here. The peculiarity of our work is that, in order to be successful, a person must be a hunter at heart. That's why I'm turning to civilians who are currently choosing a specialty in the army: if you want to fight fun, with excitement, with courage, welcome to us. Neither gender nor age is a limitation. The main thing is motivation and desire, and we will teach you how to throw a 9-kilogram bomb into a small crack in an enemy shelter,- -Duba- assures. As reported by ArmyInform, the tankers of the 58th motorized infantry brigade named after Hetman Ivan Vyhovsky managed to reach the position of the Russians under enemy fire and close to shoot her.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/04/baba-yaga-vkrala-poranenogo-rosiyany-tak-boyatsya-nashyh-droniv-bomberiv-shho-vygaduyut-pro-nogo-legendy/	2025-01-04T01:04:04-08:00

All the reserves, all the reinforcements from Russia, everything that is recruited and trained, everything goes in two directions: this is the Kursk region and the south of the Donetsk region. Some experts say that Russia has a deadline of January 20 to liberate Kurshchyna from us, and the Rashists are working very actively on this. But I won't say that they have great success, because we keep the defense and our art works very tightly and repels the enemy,- said Kyrylo Sazonov. The defense forces in Kurshchyna are in active defense and are successfully counterattacking. -You see how the artillery destroys the locations of the 810th brigade of the Russian marines, the headquarters and communication nodes. Our rocketmen, gunners, mortarmen, it's all the same who is there. North Korean, Buryat, Yakut or Russian. Our artillery works squarely and destroys the enemy,- said Kyrylo Sazonov. According to Kyril Sazonov, the enemy uses the same tactics as in Donbas. -The enemy is trying to advance to our positions in small assault groups, gather there and then attack further. They also use any technique to quickly break through to our positions. They use light cars, motorcycles, buggies and even scooters. We call this area the -buffer zone of death.- But we destroy them,- said Kyrylo Sazonov. As reported by ArmyInform, the aerial scouts of the 41st mechanized brigade showed footage of the defeat of a column of Russian armored vehicles and a bunch of loaded enemy vehicles.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/04/vybyty-do-20-sichnya-rosijskomu-komanduvannyu-vstanovyly-dedlajn-na-kurshhyni/	2025-01-04T00:41:58-08:00

Like a mammoth, our pilots drove the enemy tank into a ravine	The combat video was released on January 4. The occupiers' tank with anti-drone protection pushed towards our positions. The first arrival of our kamikaze drone forced the Russians to slow down. After the second approach, the enemy tankers finally hesitated. Either they were disoriented, or they decided not to wait for the third arrival, but directed their tank directly into the ravine from their own KAB. The tank drove into a ravine, after which the Russian tankers left their car and ran to their positions with a clear conscience. ArmyInform told how crews of FPV drones work companies of strike unmanned aircraft complexes consolidated unit of the 153rd separate mechanized brigade.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/04/nache-mamonta-nashi-piloty-zagnaly-vorozhyj-tank-u-provallya/	2025-01-03T22:31:55-08:00

Released from captivity: what the military is entitled to	ArmyInform tells what other rights and opportunities those who went through captivity have. Servicemen released from captivity may resign from service. This provides for Art. 26 of the Law of Ukraine -On Military Duty and Military Service-, amendments to which entered into force on May 18 of this year. At the same time, it does not matter when exactly the serviceman was released from captivity. If a serviceman decides to use the right to discharge, he can also count on one-time assistance upon dismissal. It is 50 percent of the monthly allowance for each full calendar year of service. If a serviceman who has returned from captivity wishes to continue his service, he has the right to 90 days holidays. Such leave is not divided into parts, and during it the allowance continues to be accrued. Such leave can be revoked only with the consent of the serviceman. Those released from captivity are entitled to one-time assistance of 100,000 hryvnias. This applies to both civilians and military personnel. It also provides for the payment of anannualfinancial aid for those who were in captivity. This is 100,000 hryvnias for each year of stay in places of detention. How to get? In order to calculate such payments, it is necessary to establish the fact of deprivation of liberty as a result of armed aggression against Ukraine. The establishment of this fact is handled by a special commission under the Ministry of Reintegration of Temporarily Occupied Territories. One of the mandatory documents that must be provided to the commission is a certificate of imprisonment. It can be obtained from the National Information Bureau. The request should be sent to the bureau's e-mail address: info@nib.gov.ua, or fill out the form on the site. Citizens released from captivity have the right to legal aid. And given all the bureaucratic factors that exist in our country, such help will definitely not be superfluous.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/04/zvilneni-z-polonu-na-shho-mayut-pravo-vijskovi-2/	2025-01-03T21:07:15-08:00
Eleven birthdays of Anastasia Shevchenko: direct involvement from the occupation, storming of the TC...	When she talks about how she got into the army, how she -stormed- the military commissariat in the spring of 2022, how she likes to work in positions with soldiers - there is fire in her eyes. She joined the army from civilian journalism. Since 2016, she has worked in newspapers and on television. She taught college students, has a master's degree in journalism. Immediately before the large-scale invasion, she was a journalist for -Suspilne Zaporizhzhia-. Behind her are several weeks of life in the occupation, stubbornly -standing- under the Military Commissariat, receiving the rank of officer and building the work of the communications department of the newly created brigade from scratch. Anastasia is sincerely proud of this success. The ArmyInform correspondent met with the officer at a time when the brigade was taken away for recovery. We asked the servicewoman about mobilization and motivation, fear and death, injury and the front, and more. Anastasia recalls that around February 23, 2022, she already understood that there would be a large-scale invasion: she had just arrived to visit her parents in Zaporizhzhia and stayed the night with them. — In the evening, when the meeting of the State Duma of the Russian Federation was broadcast, and later - a video of the Russians entering our territory, I once again understood that the Russians are brazenly, no longer hybridly, violating our state sovereignty. In the morning, she woke up to the fact that there were the first flights in her hometown, at the airport, the windows were shaking. It was difficult to understand the questioning: whether it was a dream or whether it was all real life, she says. On the same day, she went to the local military commissar, but returned - because she was officially in the hospital. Therefore, they went with their family to one of the settlements where Anastasia's grandparents lived, to help with the household, etc. But in a few days, the Russians occupied this settlement. — I went to the window, it was not clear what was happening. You won't be able to get into the city, because there is continuous intense shelling&#8230; It was not clear what to do - and this is the first such experience. They watched the marathon almost around the clock. In the window they saw people in military uniform with white bandages on their hands. And once a tank with the letter Z drove by, — Anastasiya analyzes her memories. Then there was life under occupation — and live phone calls for Ukrainian television about Russian war crimes, round-the-clock shelling of civilian infrastructure, etc. I saw everything with my own eyes. - There was no gas, electricity, or water in the house. We went to the basement. Sometimes they sat there around the clock. But: they ate lard, it's good that grandparents sealed it in three-liter cans&#8230; Then some humanitarian aid began to arrive. We went to get bread with my mother, at our own peril and risk. Because it was not clear how they react to men on the streets, for example, says Anastasia. They went to the territory controlled by Ukraine at the beginning of March. After returning, says Anastasia, she decided to go to the RTCC. — Because even before the start of the full-scale invasion, I told my parents that I wanted to be as useful as possible to my country — but already in pixels. No one believed that someone would call me, so small and fragile, but it was important for me: to be part of the team that would liberate the occupied territories; part of a team that stands with weapons in hand and has a clear motivation, says Anastasia. However, he adds that the Military Commissariat -boiled- for a long time and did not want to call up. - The application was accepted back in March with words like -I have a daughter your age, I don't really want to call you up, but you have the right to do so.- Yes, they saw that I was, of course, not Johnnick, not Rambo, but I was serious. That's why they said to wait. And they also say: -Well, look, you have such an education that we recruit journalists as lieutenants immediately to officer positions. Currently, all vacant positions of press officers are filled, there are no vacancies in public relations services, please wait.- But I didn't need an officer's rank, I just wanted to be useful, I wanted to go to study. The wait lasted for two weeks. In the end, they called and said to arrive at 8:00 with the things. Among the crowd of men there were only two girls - two Anastasias. Recruits were selected for the gunner training center. No matter how much the two Anastasias raised their hands, they seemed not to be noticed. Then the soldier said, -Girls, there are artillery pieces the size of you. Maybe harder. This is not for you, wait.- The wait continued for several more weeks. Then there was a selection for the -study- of signalmen. — And again we stood in the first row. In the eyes of the soldier, a silent -well, where did they get my head?- was read. And he said to come next time. I was already irritated, I thought that the wrong one was attacked! I approach and say: -Mr. Major! I understand everything! We are girls! But give us the opportunity to go to this -tutorial-. It's not artillery anymore, it's communications!- He asked if we were ready to haul coils of wire or if the satellite dishes were large. We answered that if necessary, then yes. He understood that we will not let go of him. And that this scenario will repeat itself tomorrow morning. He went to the head of the TCC. I left - and we went by bus to the training center in the Lviv region, - Anastasia says in one breath and with excitement. And he adds: - We were happy. We understood that this is a new stage of our life. One of my motivations for joining the Defense Forces was the occupied settlement where I grew up. Where did she visit her grandparents for the holidays, where did she eat the most delicious dumplings, where did she break more than one knee while riding a bicycle. These are childhood memories that are poisoned by the fact that the Russians are there now. The educational center had theory, practice, and physical training. After the training center, he was assigned to the 5th separate communications regiment in the Chernihiv region. There she worked with document management. But the desire to become a part of the combat brigade did not fade. In the end, after a year of such service, Anastasia did fulfill, as she says, her dream: she was transferred to the 44th separate mechanized, newly created combat brigade. It was in June 2023. Anastasia had the rank of senior soldier. - It was just a new life! A radically different lifestyle! Coordination, photo reports, interviews. We developed an archive, then there was no Facebook page, YouTube channel, - says Anastasia, and again with fire in her eyes. In July 2023, Anastasia went to officer courses - and in August she already received a rank. And immediately to the Kupyansko-Svativ direction. At first it was in the communications department of the brigade itself, but now they have expanded. Working on the front lines, in the Kharkiv region, says Anastasia, is -one solid pleasure-: — &#8230; When you don't sit still, but go around the units every day, you communicate with servicemen. Well, it is also support for them. Yes, most of all I like to work on positions with boys. We have incredibly motivated people in our team. There are older soldiers, there are those with six concussions. And they say: -I'm here until the end.- These people return even when they can leave the army. But they understand that if they do not stop the enemy there now, then the enemy will have to be stopped here, on peaceful territory. Anastasia says that in April 2024, she fell asleep for the first time precisely at the positions of the mortars. - I have never slept so soundly as there. It was very cozy. I heard how the dancer was working nearby, I heard that the RSZV was flying in, cassettes&#8230; And you are so cool and cozy that you are next to these people&#8230; Although there was an awareness of danger and risks, there was no fear. But once an enemy shell exploded very close - Anastasia got a concussion. It was in the place where they spent the night on May 27, 2024. - If it happened in the positions, it would not be so offensive. Emergency services said the next morning that it was either a Hurricane or a Tornado. The rocket fell 10 meters from my window. I remember very clearly this sound, the flames, how the plaster fell. I have a total of 11 birthdays since the start of the large-scale invasion. For example, an S-300 flew 50 meters from me, and I was working with documents at the window. And it flew across the road, but the projectile got stuck in the sewer and did not explode. Anastasia works with both Ukrainian and foreign media. He says that everyone is in good faith. — But still, my personal opinion is that our Ukrainian journalists adhere more to the standards. But among the foreign audience there are both fixers and journalists chasing sensation. Ukrainians, on the other hand, understand that it is necessary to adhere to standards, not to ask too much, because this is, first of all, the safety of our servicemen. It is comfortable for Anastasia to work in the communications of the military unit due to the fact that both the brigade command and the units directly understand the importance of popularizing the military unit in the context of information warfare and information confrontation with the enemy. Further plans for the development of communications are to create a film about the servicemen of the brigade. — We are currently shooting documentaries, 20-minute films, shooting from the positions. But we want, of course, more content, more stories from the front lines. Yes, they understand that artillery, mortar or FPV may come, but they still go and do their duty. I remember very well the phrase of one soldier, an infantryman in the Kupyansk direction: -I will not kneel before the enemy. But I will stand only in two cases: in case of victory - to kiss the ground. And in front of my mother.- Press officers have different approaches, says Anastasia, but her priority is work in combat positions, moral support of the military: - It is important that they understand that we are not sitting somewhere in the rear. Because there is a contrast between 17 km from zero and 2 km from zero. You know, when you drive into a front-line village, it's as if death reigns there: there isn't a single whole house or surviving tree; the air there seems to be permeated with death. And everyone, as if by an invisible signal, quiets down in the car, as if crossing some kind of portal to another world. And this is felt even when we drive into such settlements at night. These are very elusive and unexplained things, but they are there. From the distance of time, remembering how she -stormed- the TCC, Anastasia claims that she was not disappointed in her choice. — I understand that I am in my place. Although I understand that at the moment I do not see myself in civilian life, in the sense of work. So today demobilization — and what tomorrow? Build your life from scratch? Yes, sometimes there is a desire to stay in the army - and then you see fragments of civilian life - and so you want this well-being, a family nest and for the war to stop, - the servicewoman shares. Now the military unit is under reconstruction. I wonder what civilian joys Anastasia allowed herself the first time the brigade left the war zone. - Marigolds. And dyed her hair. Because there is no time for that at all. Gulka-style — and left — smiling coquettishly, she says. We ask a military servicewoman what she would advise civilians who have not yet joined the ranks of the Defense Forces of Ukraine, in particular, because of fear. Here is what Anastasia Shevchenko answers: - No matter how strong the Defense Forces are, they are not in a position to take everyone by force. It should be a conscious choice. Previously, there was no such visible gap between the civilian and military worlds, everyone worked together against the enemy. Now, unfortunately, this gap is already being felt. I can't say it's bad. We are there so that civilians can live peacefully here. And it's great that this life continues - despite shelling, missile strikes and the fact that, unfortunately, the front is advancing. Therefore&#8230; What is my advice to civilians? Try. Yes, now everyone is tired of the war - both civilians and military. But if they cannot be stopped there now, then they will have to be stopped here. — What will be the end of the war for you? — At least the announcement of a cease-fire regime&#8230; But for me personally, the war will end only when my native region and not only is freed from enemy occupation. And the return of territories and restoration of borders is not a matter of one day, not even a month.

In addition, Turkey implemented the Pulat APS program on an entire battalion of modernized M60T tanks under the Fırat project, completed in 2020 . Pulat has countermeasure modules, a control panel and a power distribution unit, which is a transitional stage in the active protection capabilities of Turkey's production. modern operational requirements, while increasing the defense independence of Turkey. It is equipped with a 120 mm smoothbore gun that is highly accurate against moving targets, a twin 7.62 mm machine gun, and a remote-controlled battle station for either 7.62 mm or 12.7 mm machine guns. Its an advanced fire control system combines a thermal imager, a laser range finder for target tracking and stabilized optics for high accuracy. Powered by a locally produced Batu V12 BMC Power 1,500 horsepower engine, the Altay has a top speed of 65 km/h with a range of 500 km, making it highly adaptable to various terrains. The tank's protection includes modular composite armour, developed by Roketsan, enhanced by Akkor APS, which intercepts threats in real time. It also includes CBRN (Chemical, Biological, Radioactive and Nuclear) protection, fire suppression systems and 360-degree situational awareness capabilities, etc. These systems work together to significantly increase Altai's survivability in combat scenarios. In addition to integration into the Altai MBT, the Akkor equipment will also be installed on the Turkish Defense Forces' Leopard 2A4 tanks and Korhan light armored vehicles, reflecting its modularity and adaptability to various platforms. The Akkor deployment follows wider efforts to strengthen Turkey's military capabilities caused by recent military conflicts where anti-tank weapons have posed significant challenges. Modernization of Leopard 2A4 tanks began in 2023, and the first deliveries of Akkor-equipped tanks are expected by the end of 2024. Having signed an initial contract for the production of 250 Altay units and plans to increase their number to 1,000, Turkey is positioning Altay MBT as the cornerstone of its capabilities in terms of armored vehicles.

Pseudo rallies in Europe -against Ukraine-: another illusion of the Russian Federation	Let's analyze this fake in detail. Russian media and social networks are actively spreading information about alleged mass protests in various European countries, which, according to propagandists, demonstrate citizens' disagreement with Ukraine's support. It is claimed that Europeans took to the streets because of the -economic crisis caused by the war- and -human rights violations by Ukraine-. Such statements are especially actively accompanied by photos and videos, which, at first glance, seem convincing. Propagandists add fictitious quotes from -eyewitnesses- and lengthy articles that misrepresent the mood in Europe. I want to explain why the truth is based on the fact that it is all a lie. Most of the images and videos distributed by Russia have nothing to do with anti-war or anti-support actions. For example: Russian special services are known for organizing pseudo-rallies. Extras are hired to hold placards with anti-war slogans, playing into the hands of Kremlin propaganda. These actions are filmed and presented as -real citizen reactions-. Propagandists actively use fake profiles in social networks, where posts about support for these rallies are distributed on behalf of the -people of Europe-. However, a detailed analysis of these accounts reveals that most of them were created recently and have signs of bots. No authoritative European publication confirms large-scale actions -against Ukraine-. On the contrary, there are numerous materials about actions to support our country. In real life, most Europeans support Ukraine, understanding that Russia is the aggressor. Firstly, public opinion in Ukraine can be manipulated in this way. Propagandists are trying to lower the level of morale of Ukrainians, convincing them that their struggle allegedly does not have international support. Secondly, the Russian propaganda machine is trying to influence Europeans. the Kremlin seeks to sow doubts among EU citizens about the expediency of supporting Ukraine, hoping for a change of heart in European governments. Third, again, this is a distraction. The spread of fakes about -anti-Ukrainian rallies- is designed to divert attention from real problems, such as Russian aggression, war and economic sanctions against Russia.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/04/psevdomityngy-v-yevropi-proty-ukrayiny-chergova-ilyuziya-rf/	2025-01-03T20:02:40-08:00

The commander of the Armed Forces Navy told how the enemy made it difficult to use the base in Sevas...	About this he wrote 3 January. -During the past year, units of missile launchers and maritime unmanned systems of the Navy carried out dozens of successful strikes on about 50 military objects of the enemy, including in the temporarily occupied Crimea. These were military airfields, storage warehouses for ammunition, fuel and other military property, storage and production sites for -Shakheds-, objects of air defense and surveillance systems, logistics hubs and military enterprises of the Russian military industry,- said Oleksiy Neizhpapa. According to him, the actions of the Navy made it much more difficult for Russia to use its main naval base in the temporarily occupied Crimea, Sevastopol. -the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation was forced to withdraw most of its warships, including all carriers of Kalibr missiles, to Novorossiysk. Our defenders stopped the free maneuvering of Russian ships in the Sea of ​​Azov, forcing them to withdraw to bases in the Krasnodar Territory,- noted Oleksiy Neizhpapa. Separately, he heard a report on the use of air reconnaissance. -Over the course of a year, our scouts flew almost 700 hours, during which they discovered about 400 enemy targets. It was their data that became the basis for planning military operations. This underscores the importance of introducing new technologies and expanding the use of unmanned systems for both reconnaissance and strike missions. At the same time, a significant increase in the number of trained UAV pilots — 7 times compared to last year — allows us to implement these opportunities more effectively,- noted the Commander of the Armed Forces Navy. Another achievement he called ensuring the functioning of the sea corridor and the stable movement of ships, which made it possible to export millions of tons of Ukrainian grain, support our economy and strengthen food security in the world. -I determined the relevant tasks for this year. One of the key directions is ensuring quality training of our servicemen, this is an important condition for saving their lives. Also, the priority task remains the search and destruction of enemy objects. Our goal is to weaken the enemy's combat potential as much as possible. Thanks to all our soldiers for their resilience.

About this in an interview with ArmiyaInform said the head of the Secretariat of the Coordination Staff for the Treatment of Prisoners of War Bohdan Okhrimenko. The Main Directorate of Intelligence, the Security Service, the Armed Forces, the National Guard, etc., are involved in the project. -We give the Russians the opportunity to familiarize themselves with information on how they can surrender. We have organized chatbots in which they can contact and describe the situation, indicate which direction they are in. We simulate the process of their crossing the contact line without harming them,- said Bohdan Okhrimenko. He recalled the successful special operations when, thanks to this project, the Russians went over to our side even with weapons or even entire platoons, with tanks, with helicopters, with equipment. -In total, if we take all of them together, then probably even more than a battalion has already surrendered,- the Coordinating Staff said. Bohdan Okhrimenko noted that those who transfer are divided into two categories. The first category: they do not want their story to become media and want to return to Russia on the terms of exchange. But, apparently, they don't understand that upon their return they will be interrogated, possibly jailed. If not prison, then again sent to the front. And this is one hundred percent, especially if he has two whole arms and two legs. -And there are servicemen of the Russian Federation who were forcibly mobilized and who transferred to us under this program, surrendered as prisoners, and, for example, do not want to return. This is their right: until the end of hostilities or before the change of power in Russia. And Ukraine guarantees this,- the Coordinating Staff emphasized.

In the video, our defenders demonstrate a common practice when, instead of surrendering, the occupiers press for pity and ask them to be spared. -Prayer is a force that supports in difficult moments! However, it works when you are at home, and not on foreign land to kill, rape, loot and torture. You have a weapon in your hands - you are an enemy. And there will never be any faith in the Russians, because they will return again,- the fighters commented. As reported by ArmyInform, the pilots of the 425th assault battalion -Rock- staged a ferocious rampage near Pokrovsk: destroyed an armored personnel carrier, a car with a BK and some enemy infantry.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/03/molytva-ne-dopomozhe-yakshho-ruky-v-krovi-okupant-otrymav-po-zasluzi-na-lymanskomu-napryamku/	2025-01-03T01:24:21-08:00
In Zhytomyr Oblast, a man is suspected of stealing money from the mother of a missing soldier of the...	The Office of the Prosecutor General of Ukraine informs about this. According to the investigation, a 19-year-old boy, previously convicted of purchasing narcotics, stole money from the mother of a missing serviceman of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The woman rented a house from the suspect. In July 2024, she asked for help in sorting out the bank account to which the state cash assistance for her missing son was supposed to go. The young man, taking advantage of the victim's trust, installed a mobile application on his phone to manage the account through Internet banking. In this way, he gained access to the card where the payment was received. Almost 20 facts of withdrawal of funds from the woman's card in the amount of almost 100 thousand hryvnias have been established. The suspect spent the received money on his own needs. Under the procedural leadership of the Chudniv District Prosecutor's Office of the Zhytomyr region, a local resident was notified of suspicion based on the facts of theft, legalization of property obtained through crime, as well as unauthorized interference in the operation of information systems (Part 4 of Article 185, Part 1 of Article 209, Part 1 Article 361 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine). As reported by ArmyInform, an agent who is in Pokrovsk will appear before the court /->searched for the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation for the location of personnel of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/03/na-zhytomyrshhyni-cholovika-pidozryuyut-u-vykradenni-koshtiv-u-materi-znyklogo-soldata-zsu/	2025-01-03T01:03:05-08:00

The Armed Forces spoke about the enemy's use of fiber-optic drones in the Toretsk direction	The press officer of the 28th Yevhen Alkhimov of the separate mechanized brigade named after the Knights of the Winter Campaign, commenting on the situation in this direction. According to him, the enemy continues to use the tactics of small attack groups, which include two to 20 people, but the biggest -headache- is currently created by drones controlled by fiber optic cable, because they cannot be silenced by means of radio electronic warfare. -This creates some problems because this drone can only be shot down with small arms. And also they constantly improve them and try to increase the range of work. The advantage of such drones is that it is essentially an anti-tank missile, but which can be stopped in the air, and can be changed at any time. And it is not affected by electronic devices. Therefore, this is a serious advantage,- emphasized Yevhen Alkhimov. He also added that the fiber optic coil itself is not so expensive, and thanks to it, the enemy drone is able to cover a distance of more than 10 kilometers. As reported by ArmyInform, as part of the programs for the implementation of innovations and development of the army, the Main Department of Defense Innovations of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine conducted presentation testing of domestic FPV drones controlled via fiber-optic cable, a number of which are in the final stage of codification and will soon be delivered to the needs of the Defense Forces.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/03/u-zsu-rozpovily-pro-vykorystannya-vorogom-optovolokonnyh-droniv-na-toreczkomu-napryamku/	2025-01-03T00:29:51-08:00
Ukraine received requests from the Russians regarding 50,000 missing persons — Koordshtab	About this in an interview with ArmiyaInform said the head of the Secretariat of the Koordshtab Bohdan Okhrimenko. -We allocated a telephone line for this first, and then we realized that this is a separate project, and it is quite large-scale. Today, we can state that the number of missing persons for whom we have received inquiries is more than 50,000 Russians. And these are only those who are not afraid to contact us,- said Bohdan Okhrimenko. He added that recently, at a closed meeting in the State Duma, a Russian politician disclosed the figures of 48,000 missing Russians. And whoever was conducting that hearing said not to give that information to anyone else. -According to our calculations, the Russians have a total of more than 100,000 missing persons, and this does not include those who we already know have died. Many missing Russians are scattered in our fields, their remains are scattered by dogs. Their identification is not interesting for the Russian Federation,- Bohdan Okhrimenko explained. According to him, thanks to the -I want to find- project, it is now possible to show the world community in numbers how exactly the work in the Russian Federation with the citizens of their country is organized, that they are not interested in recognizing them as dead in order to pay the appropriate monetary support for their population. -It is profitable for them to consider the missing soldiers as missing. Commanders continue to receive financial support for them. The family receives nothing,- he added.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/03/ukrayina-otrymala-vid-rosiyan-zapyty-shhodo-50-tysyach-znyklyh-bezvisty-koordshtab/	2025-01-03T00:18:49-08:00

According to Yuriy Fedorenko, after the failed attempts to capture Kupyansk-Vuzlovoi before November 1, the Russians suffered significant losses in manpower and equipment. Taking this into account, the command of the occupying forces postponed the date of capture to January 1. -As you remember, the enemy had the task of reaching Kupyansk-Vuzlovy before November 1. The enemy, despite the fact that he spent an insane amount of resources, lost equipment and a large number of personnel, which is difficult to count, did not complete this task. Then the deadlines were postponed. Russian occupying generals were coming, and they were enlisting everyone involved in rear support, with the aim of increasing combat capabilities. But the New Year passed, and the enemy still did not complete the task,- Yuriy Fedorenko noted.

He emphasized that these attempts have been going on for quite a long period of time, and this shows that the Defense Forces are putting up serious resistance to the occupiers. -But the Russians do not stop trying, sometimes the Russian infantry simply steps over the remains of their predecessors. And they actually become predecessors for those who will follow them. That is, there is a rather strong fire influence from our side,- the spokesman added. Bohdan Petrenko said that one of the traditional tactics of the Russians is small tactical groups.

How are our people being returned from captivity and how many Russians are in the -I want to live- p...	Specialists of the Coordinating Staff are engaged in the search for servicemen who were captured and civilians who were forcibly detained by the Russian occupation authorities. How does the Coordinating Staff return our citizens from captivity? How many Russians surrender and replenish the exchange fund? How many bodies of the missing occupiers lie in the Ukrainian fields? All these questions were answered by Bohdan Okhrimenko, head of the Secretariat of the Coordinating Staff on the Treatment of Prisoners of War. — How is the system for notifying relatives, in which a loved one will return from captivity, for example, built? How does this happen? — First, we verify citizens who wish to open a personal account in our Information System. Through the Ministry of Digitization portal -Diya- verification of the citizen and confirmation of kinship takes place. Because we comply with the law and act in the manner prescribed by law. This is primarily a law on the protection of personal data. Therefore, we can only share information with those who fall within the scope of the Personal Data Protection Act. A relative, drawing up a personal account, indicates who is in charge (to the prisoner. — Ed.), submits supporting documents. We verify and understand that we are communicating with a real relative. After negotiations, exchanges, we confirm that the Russian side really handed over the people it previously spoke about. We are taking everyone, but we have developed such a mechanism: we do not tell anyone about our relatives in advance, because there have been cases when Russia either did not bring a certain number of prisoners that it promised to return, or brought the wrong people that it promised to bring back. After the exchange and verification of the personnel of the returned servicemen and civilians, a command is given to our analysts and employees accompanying the Information System about SMS notifications. And relatives receive a notification in the -Action- application. If a citizen does not have the -Action- application, he receives a simple SMS notification to his phone. And within half an hour, employees of our counseling centers will call each family personally and provide the necessary information. — How is the work of conducting personal meetings with relatives? Especially in the regions, if a person is not able to come to Kyiv. — I would like to note that our media platforms are functioning: Telegram channel, YouTube page, Facebook page, site. All the necessary information can be found there. And our reception is done on an individual basis. Group meetings are available. This takes place in our reception rooms located in the city of Kyiv. There are regional offices -South-, -Center-, -West- and -East-, which cover the entire territory of Ukraine. -West- is the city of Lviv, and, accordingly, all the regions closest to Lviv. -Center- is Vinnytsia, -East- is Kharkiv, -South- is Mykolaiv. Our website has absolutely all contact information. Admission is by prior appointment. Why? Because the person must come, and the counselor must already know their story. A person can choose any convenient day and hour, come to any convenient counseling center. There is a road map, counselors help the family walk it together, provide clarification. There is information on sample applications for relatives to complete. The consultant will also help to transfer all the necessary information that is in the family to the personal account, especially if the person, for example, does not have the technical ability due to the lack of a smartphone. We record this data from relatives, add it to the card of a serviceman or a civilian and take it into account when forming a negotiating position carried out by our specialists. Analysts, who then process this information, give it the appropriate rank: for example, reliable or unreliable. Because there are cases when, for example, a mother and a wife voice completely different information. In any case, we record the information, and our experts, whenever possible, check it. After our citizens - both civilians and military - return from captivity, we spend some time with them: we clarify who they saw, in which places of detention they were, with whom they communicated, whether they saw this or that person. In this way, we are trying to search for the missing persons, because the Russian Federation does not, unfortunately, confirm to international organizations the fact that our people are being held captive for many of our citizens. After a certain time, the guys sometimes call our employees, with whom they communicated after the release, even at night. Well, suddenly they remembered something. Therefore, we can say that work continues around the clock. The information we receive is diverse. Our Information System allows you to do any analysis based on the number of prisoners, places of detention, religion, and place of birth. On a weekly basis, we receive information from the Armed Forces about missing persons and those who have been captured. But, unfortunately, we receive it only in this form: military rank, surname, first name, patronymic, position, military unit number, date of birth. All. And we need more to work with. Therefore, as we receive information about a serviceman, we create his card in the Information System. If relatives join the Information System through the site, they open a personal account, and this card is linked there. Unfortunately or fortunately, I state that not all the information contained in the card is available to his relatives. Because there can be both sensitive and unverified information, for example, about a death. But if there is no body, we continue until we either find and return the body, or until we return a living warrior. Unfortunately, there is also such a status that no one likes, it is -personal search-. The situation is that we do not have any information about this person. That is, there is a recorded fact according to the report of the commander of the military unit that the specified person is missing. And that's it, there is no more information about him. The situation with the missing persons is so dramatic that we understand the condition of the relatives of these people: both military and civilian. Unfortunately, there is still a -deceased- status. After the repatriation of the bodies or remains of our heroes, after conducting all laboratory tests and DNA tests, we establish the identity of the person. Because usually the Russian Federation gives us a certain number of bodies or remains without specifying surnames or anything: there is simply -neizvestny muschina-, -neizvestnaya zhenschina-. And then the difficult path of identification begins. As soon as we identify, it is synchronized with our database accordingly, and if this person had the status of -missing-, we display the information that the death is confirmed. Until this happens, all missing persons belong to the -search for person- category. I also have to say about the problem, which we have already reported several times to the Prosecutor General's Office and the Ministry of Internal Affairs. So, there is a principle of territorial jurisdiction. What is it? This is when a family lives in Khmelnytskyi region, files a missing person report in Donetsk region, and a criminal case is opened in Khmelnytskyi. The investigator communicates, takes DNA samples from the family, and then through the Office of the Attorney General, this criminal case is transferred to the place of the crime, that is, the place where the person disappeared. And so it turns out that in the Donetsk region, for example, in the city of Kramatorsk, one investigator can have a large number of criminal proceedings related to missing persons. And the issue of communication between investigators and families is complicated by the fact that there is a large amount of work for one person. But I hope that this problem will be solved in the near future. We at the Koordshtab have created the -single window- principle. We have representatives from the Main Investigative Department of the National Police of Ukraine, there are representatives of the SBU, types, branches of the military. That is, if communication with a military unit is required, then the consultant calls a representative, for example, TrO, if the serviceman served there. The TrO representative provides advice, contacts the military unit, clarifies this or that information, helps with writing an application for receiving a military serviceman's financial support for family support, because there is a corresponding regulatory approval. — Tell us a little about the special projects of the Coordinating Staff. What areas do they cover? — We launched the People of the Future project. It is aimed at social support of family members: mainly children, younger brothers, sisters of military personnel. Today, we have cured more than 2,500 children in different parts of the world. It was Bulgaria, Great Britain, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey. Currently, we also have many programs for 2025 within the country: in the Carpathians, in Prykarpattia, children's entertainment camps are planned for the summer. All information about it is available on our media resources. I would like to emphasize that all services provided to citizens are provided absolutely free of charge: legal, psychological or any other consultation and support. In fact, the state does not provide for us at all. Although we are an auxiliary temporary body under the Cabinet of Ministers. Organizational, informational, material and technical support of the activities of the Coordination Headquarters is entrusted, in accordance with the resolution, to the Main Directorate of Intelligence. Yes, when patrons find out about such initiatives of ours (children's recreation. — Ed.), they can also help. — The Coordinating Staff has other projects. Perhaps the most famous -I want to live- - ​​this project was created to encourage Russians who did not want to go to war, who did not want to commit war crimes, who did not want to kill - to surrender and save own life That is why it is called -I want to live-. It is very complex in its organization, its certain stages are hidden from public view. Many are involved in this process: the Central Intelligence Agency, the Security Service, the Armed Forces, the National Guard, etc. We provide the Russians with information on how they can surrender to captivity. We have organized chatbots in which they can contact and describe the situation, indicate which direction they are in. We simulate the process of them crossing the contact line without harming them. You have probably heard about such special operations, when, thanks to this project, they were transferred to our side even with weapons or even entire platoons. With tanks, with helicopters, with equipment. In total, if you take all of them together, probably even more than a battalion has already surrendered. Accordingly, we honor everyone who agreed to join our side for such a project. Those who transfer fall into two categories. The first category: they do not want their story to become media and want to return to Russia on the terms of exchange. But, apparently, they do not understand that upon their return they will be interrogated, possibly in prison. If not prison, then sending to the front again. And this is one hundred percent, especially if he has two whole arms and two legs. And there are military personnel of the Russian Federation who were forcibly mobilized and who transferred to us under this program, surrendered as prisoners, and, for example, do not want to return. This is their right: until the end of hostilities or before the change of power in Russia. And Ukraine guarantees this. There is also the -I want to find- project. We encountered the fact that relatives of missing Russian soldiers began contacting our phone line for the -I want to live- project: they wanted to find out the fate of a loved one. And we first allocated a telephone line for this, and then we realized that this is a separate project, and it is quite large. Today we can state that the number of missing persons for whom we have received requests is more than 50,000 Russians. And these are only those who are not afraid to contact us. Recently, at a closed meeting in the Derzhduma, a Russian politician disclosed the figures of 48,000 missing Russians. And whoever conducted that hearing said not to give that information to anyone else. By our count, the Russians have a total of over 100,000 missing, and that's not including those we already know have died. Many missing Russians are scattered across our fields, their remains are scattered by dogs. Their identification for the Russian Federation is uninteresting. Thanks to the -I want to find- project, it is now possible to show the world community in numbers how the work in the Russian Federation with the citizens of their country is organized, that they are not interested in recognizing them as dead in order to pay the appropriate monetary support for their population. It is profitable for them to consider the military missing as missing. Commanders continue to receive financial support for them. The family receives nothing. And the third project -I want to my own-. Many expressed certain fears about him, that, they say, he limits the rights of Ukrainian citizens in one way or another. But I will emphasize right away: this project was developed jointly with the Verkhovna Rada Commissioner for Human Rights. First of all, when forming the main approaches of this project, we consulted with the ombudsman, where we had to comply with both international and domestic norms. This project aims, firstly, to identify collaborators who cooperate with the enemy. These citizens are identified and brought to justice. And the question arises, what to do with them next? The state does not need such citizens, because they are traitors. We do not have the death penalty, we are a civilized country. If they so wanted the arrival of the -Russian peace-, we asked the question: yes, maybe you will go to Russia then? And we offered the Russian side: if you say that you will not abandon your own, then we will give you such citizens and hand them over. The second goal is to shut down these collaborators. We give the opportunity to go to, so to speak, a deal with the conscience. Stop this activity to avoid further damage. Therefore, law enforcement agencies will be more lenient towards such citizens. Well, and the third point - if our other citizens who are responsible and see that someone is committing a crime, they can report it. Accordingly, all this information is sent to the Security Service, law enforcement agencies. That is, a person does not contact us directly at the Coordinating Headquarters, he goes to a law enforcement agency. Appropriate measures are taken there, collaborators are detained if everything is confirmed. Many citizens have already stopped cooperating with the enemy, giving information that they were targeted, forced to provide some intelligence or, for example, plant explosive devices. And people who understood the consequences of their illegal activities turned to this project and stopped cooperating with the enemy, received support from the Security Service, from law enforcement agencies. In this way, we identified employees of the FSB or special structures of our enemy. Among those convicted today, we already have a case of his transfer. He is the first one so far. We offered to the Russian side, and there they agreed to take the said person. We handed it over. Instead, the Russian side released our civilian. It is already on the territory of our state. He is provided with appropriate medical care and rehabilitation. — Digitalization of many processes is actively underway in Ukraine. What has been done in this regard at the Coordination Headquarters? To what extent have you gone -digital- and does it really facilitate work processes? — In May 2022, after certain successful special operations of the Main Directorate of Intelligence, the higher military-political leadership of the state decided to transfer the chairmanship of the Coordination Staff from the Vice Prime Minister minister, at that time Iryna Vereshchuk, to the head of the Ministry of Education and Culture of Ukraine Kyryl Budanov The first thing we wanted to do was to establish communication with the families. And the first records were kept in Excel tables. We realized that without some quality software, without some digitalization of this process, we will not be able to process or use the received materials. Therefore, Kyrylo Budanov set the task of creating a digital product that would have the ability to keep records, do analytics, compare information, save videos, photos. According to the contract concluded by the Main Directorate of Intelligence, the IT company developed an Information System for us. And then, due to the decision of the Cabinet of Ministers, it was recognized as state. It is filled with various resources, such as: the register of the National Information Bureau, the register of persons missing under special circumstances, the registers of the Ministry of Justice, the records of the Joint Center under the SBU and many others. A separate issue is the accounting of enemy prisoners of war held by Ukraine. The camps are open today, in accordance with the Geneva Conventions and international humanitarian law. All international organizations, such as the UN Monitoring Mission, the International Committee of the Red Cross, are admitted to these camps. And Ukraine in this context is very open to its allies, to the entire civilized world. We give the opportunity to visit the mercenaries of those countries from which they joined the army of the Russian Federation.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/03/yak-povertayut-nashyh-z-polonu-i-skilky-rosiyan-u-proyekti-hochu-zhyt-intervyu-z-predstavnykom-koordshtabu/	2025-01-02T21:11:15-08:00
The Navy of the Ukrainian Armed Forces reported the number of enemy ships in the Black Sea	This was reported by the Naval Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. There are no enemy ships in the Sea of ​​Azov. There are 8 enemy ships in the Mediterranean Sea, three of which are carriers of Kalibr cruise missiles with a total salvo of up to 26 missiles. During the day, in the interests of the Russian Federation, 5 ships passed through the Kerch Strait to the Black Sea, two of which continued their movement in the direction of the Bosphorus Strait. Four ships were heading to the Sea of ​​Azov, none of them moving from the Bosphorus Strait. -the Russian Federation continues to violate the International Convention for the Protection of Life at Sea of ​​1974.

Weapons of Victory: what is known about the updated variant of the Oncilla armored car	Currently, the fleet of specialized special vehicles of the Defense Forces of Ukraine includes armored vehicles of both foreign and domestic production. The history of the creation of one of them - the Dozor BBM family was discussed in the first part of our conversation with a researcher of military equipment and armaments, Doctor of Historical Sciences, Professor of the Department of Humanities of the National Academy of Land Forces named after Hetman Petro Sahaidachny Andriy Kharuk. Today is the continuation of the interview. — Professor, our agency notifiedo that recently the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine codified and allowed an updated version of the Oncilla armored personnel carrier is in service. And how was this machine created? - In 2013, a modernized version of -Dozor-B- was produced in Kharkiv, which attracted the interest of the Polish company Mista. The latter bought one copy manufactured at the Kyiv Armored Plant, which was displayed under the name Oncilla at the MSPO-2013 exhibition in Kielce. For production in Poland, Oncilla was significantly redesigned. The German engine was replaced with an Italian Iveco NEF 4 with a capacity of 210 hp. Unlike the -tractor- low-revving Deutz engine, the Italian engine is a high-revving car engine. Thanks to this, the dynamic characteristics of the car, in particular, acceleration, improved. In addition, Iveco NEF 4 turned out to be cheaper than the German engine. The transmission was radically redesigned, and instead of a five-speed automatic transmission, a six-speed one was installed. Ballistic protection corresponds to level 3 of STANAG 4569 (circular protection against armor-piercing bullets of caliber 7.62 mm and fragments of shells of caliber 152-155 mm when detonated at a distance of up to 60 m). Mine protection corresponds to level 2. Theoretically, level 3 could also be provided, but this was rejected, because the weight of the car would then increase too much. — What other design features did Polish gunsmiths add? — The Oncilla armored car is equipped with a Polish FONET radio station. Armament consists of a 12.7-mm NSVT-12.7 machine gun on a manually operated turret. The machine gunner is protected by armored shields with mounted armored windows - as on the HMMWV. As a result of the modernization, Oncilla acquired better operational properties compared to the basic Dozor-B. However, the armored car did not achieve significant commercial success. Six copies were sold to Senegal in 2016 or early 2017. In addition, Oncilla was also supplied to Ukraine. I would like to add that with the beginning of the large-scale invasion of Russia on February 24, 2022, Dozor-B and Oncilla armored vehicles as part of units of the Airborne Assault Troops are participating in battles against the invaders. In particular, in the second half of May 2022, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine announced the successful operation of Oncilla armored vehicles by the Ukrainian military. However, no details were reported. In March 2023, information appeared about the transfer to the units of the Main Intelligence Directorate of a new batch of Oncilla armored vehicles, purchased by Polish entrepreneurs. Further refinement of the Oncilla design is carried out by the Ukrainian Design Bureau -Beryl- together with the Polish company Mista. At the Egypt Defense Expo in 2022, the Oncilla Mk 2 project was presented in various variants, including one armed with a 90 mm cannon. - What can you say about the updated Oncilla armored personnel carrier? - The Ministry of Defense has put into service a new variant - Oncilla-Shturm. The armored car received a new remote-controlled module with a large-caliber machine gun, as well as, in my opinion, a rather strangely located 7.62 mm machine gun. I believe that the decision to supplement the BBM with a second machine gun looks quite logical. - Well, let's return to the -Dozor- family again. - In the Armed Forces of Ukraine, -Dozor-B- is classified as a tactical wheeled combat vehicle (TBCM), since it does not fall under the classic definition of an armored personnel carrier. Prototypes of the armored car were manufactured in the research workshop of the KhKBM. In July 2013, one of them was transferred to the Military Academy in Odessa. This institution, among other specialties, also trains military motorists, so it was considered the best place for operational tests of Dozor-B. However, -Dozor-B- really interested the military only after the Russian annexation of Crimea and the beginning of aggression in Donbass in 2014. At that time, the Ukrainian army did not have modern light armored vehicles, with the exception of the outdated BRDM-2. The need for machines of this class during the Anti-terrorist operation was felt extremely acutely. The head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs announced the possibility of purchasing -Dozoriv-B- for the National Guard of Ukraine, and a little later the Acting President of Ukraine Oleksandr Turchynov announced his intention to purchase 200 such armored vehicles. However, for this, the issue of mass production had to be resolved. — And how was it implemented? — They decided to establish the production of -Dozoriv-B- at the State Enterprise -Lviv Armored Plant- (LBTZ). In September 2014, the production of armored car bodies began here, but there were problems with the supply of engines - the German side did not give permission for a long time. However, even after the engines arrived, assembly of armored vehicles slowed down. Due to the inability to solve the problem, in June 2015, the director of LBTZ was fired, and after that the case moved from a deadlock. The first Dozor-B from the ordered batch of 10 units were ready in August 2015. On December 5, 2015, on the eve of the Day of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, five serial -Dozorov-B- were presented in Kyiv. - And what were the first assessments of these machines from the operators? - In August-November 2015, -Dozor-B- underwent state tests, during which a number of shortcomings were revealed: insufficient specific power (due to the increase in total mass machines from the calculated 7150 to the actual 8560 kg), problems with driving and using the regular weapons, malfunctions of the brake system, fire protection system, wheel gearboxes, poor ergonomics, etc. It was possible to eliminate some of the shortcomings, and on July 20, 2016, the installation batch of ten -Dozor-B- TBCM was handed over to the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Due to the poor quality, the question of transferring -Dozorov-B- not to the line units, but to the training centers in Odesa and Lviv was raised. However, in the end, all ten armored vehicles were transferred to the 95th separate amphibious assault brigade (Zhytomyr). - That is, the first -pancake- in the form of serial BBMs turned out to be lousy&#8230; - Plans to manufacture 50 serial -Dozor-B- in 2015 and another 100 in 2016 went into oblivion. But the Armed Forces and the Ukroboronprom State Company did not lose hope of bringing the armored car to mass production. Since LBTZ was unable to solve this task, they tried to establish production at another enterprise of Ukroboronprom, the Kyiv Armored Plant. In August 2016, the first instance of -Dozor-B- (with the -Viy- module) manufactured at this enterprise was demonstrated. However, the case did not go further. - So the -surveillance- story could end on this minor note? - In order to bring -Dozor-B- to a condition suitable for use in combat units, we decided to turn to foreign partners. On December 17, 2015, Ukroboronprom signed a memorandum of cooperation with the Czech state company VOP CZ s.p., within the framework of which it was planned to bring Dozor-B to NATO standards and certify the armored vehicle in European countries. But nothing was reported about any practical results of this agreement. Instead, the Polish clone attracted the attention of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. In July 2017, there were reports of the start of testing of the Oncilla armored car in Ukraine. They were successful, and the state defense order for 2020 included the purchase of 24 armored vehicles of this type (according to some reports, funds for the purchase of Oncilla armored vehicles were also included in the budgets of the Ministry of Defense in 2018 and 2019). — That is, history brings us back to Oncilla&#8230; — The first two Oncilla armored vehicles were handed over to the Armed Forces of Ukraine on August 23, 2020. In the future, such machines consisted of units of Polish production at the enterprise of the Scientific and Production Company -VK Sistema- in the city of Vasylkiv. On May 12, 2021, the last batch of nine copies was transferred. As well as -Dozor-B-, Oncilla are supplied to the Airborne Assault Troops of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. According to the Military Balance guide, as of the beginning of 2022, units of the Airborne Assault Forces had 10 Dozor-B armored vehicles and more than 27 Oncillas. - And in general, how did our military evaluate the -Dozors- after their use in combat conditions? - Isn't the first evidence of the use of -Dozor-B- in the area of ​​the Anti-Terrorist Operation dated to December 2016. Then, one armored car of this type was spotted in a convoy escorting the Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine Oleksandr Turchynov, who arrived with an inspection to the front during the escalation of fighting on the Svitlodar arc. In January 2017, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine reported the first results of the vehicle's use: -Dozor-B- has proven itself as a reliable combat vehicle, and in general, the armored vehicle meets the requirements of the Ukrainian army. The ministry noted that the car has -childhood- diseases. And in November 2017, the magazine -Army of Ukraine- published an article about the experience of using machines in the area of ​​the Anti-Terrorist Operation. Among the advantages were named high cross-country ability, good armor protection, and a large power reserve. The operation of -Dozor-B- in combat conditions also showed a slight imperfection of the turret installation and the inconvenience that this causes for the shooter. There were also complaints about loud noise in the undercarriage. In addition, the braking system also turned out to be imperfect. As of September 2018, the experimental operation of -Dozor-B- was completed. These cars averaged 15,000 to 20,000 miles. km In July 2020 TBKM -Dozor-B- was officially adopted by the Armed Forces of Ukraine. —The defects you indicated, recorded in the first periods of operation, could only be corrected through further modernization work. What did they consist of? — Engineers took measures to eliminate the identified shortcomings, as well as to expand the combat capabilities of the armored car. In particular, in 2020, information appeared about the research and development work of -Tournir-, which provided for increasing the capabilities of -Dozor-B- to overcome water obstacles. And even earlier, in January 2016, a full-scale model of the Hort armored car was demonstrated - a further development of Dozor-B with a wheelbase increased by 300 mm (up to 3400 mm).	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/03/zbroya-peremogy-shho-vidomo-pro-onovlenyj-variant-broneavtomobilya-oncilla/	2025-01-02T20:51:54-08:00
-Fatal mala-: Taurian paratroopers showed how to destroy the enemy with the L119 gun. ArmyInform rep...	The latter is very important, since the guns need to stay close to the line of battle. ArmiyaInform correspondents visited the position of one of the calculations and saw combat work. In order to get to the gunners' positions, we left during the night, in the morning at a designated point we met with the escort - cheerful and nimble paratroopers - and rushed off-road, under the cover of EWs, to the positions. They had to make it before dawn. The fighters were happy about the fog and mist, because they were supposed to interfere with enemy drones. But they are still being watched. So we hide the car under nuts and run to the cellar. In order to survive, it is better to stay underground here. We go downstairs and get ready at the threshold, because ahead is not dampness, the smell of mice and darkness, but the bright lights of New Year's garlands and the pleasant aroma of air freshener. And the cheerful smiles of calculation are inspiring. The boys offer tea or coffee. Many joke, they say that it is difficult to survive without humor, especially if you work alongside the enemy all the time. -Nearby- is not a figure of speech - the enemy is already in the neighboring village. Shelling and assaults are constantly being conducted from there. The guys hold on bravely, they pile on the katsapam nicely in response. They are proud of their cannon and a well-coordinated unit. Four men of different ages and personalities, two from the East, two from the West, but it is felt that they understand each other not even with half a word, but with one look. Together, they are a powerful fist that beats the enemy well and not only. The guys are fighting on a British L119 gun that rolled off the assembly line in 1989. The caliber of 105 mm seems small, but the guys say that you should not underestimate this -small-. The firing range depends on the projectiles, there are different types. The ones that are used now fly to a distance of 11.4 km. And there are active-reactive projectiles that can be fired at a range of up to 19 kilometers. A fairly modest range of fire forces the guys to stay close to the line of battle. And here the L119 dimensions become a trump card. It is light, small and mobile, so it is easy to hide from enemy drones. And there is no flash of fire at the exit of the projectile from the barrel, only a small smoke. Because of this, it is difficult for the enemy observing our positions to calculate where our L119 is hiding. And she conducts her fire work, moreover, quite accurately. When you need to change the firing position, you don't need a truck or a tractor, just an ordinary Hummer, which easily pulls a two-ton howitzer. In general, the L119 was developed for air transport, in particular on the external suspension of helicopters. But in our war L119 do not fly. At least for now. Regarding the accuracy of the L119, the guys say that this spring they first hit an enemy tractor and then a tank. There were even cases of hitting moving targets — quad bikes and motorcycles of the Russians. Accuracy is very dependent on ammunition. On new high-quality shells, the L119 works like a sniper rifle. But when they bring -boars- from 1945-55, then it is difficult to work accurately. But the guys say that they don't learn about every hit they make. Only the enemy, whom L119 really bothers, knows about something. The gunner, who now acts as the commander, is a fighter with the call sign -Lithuania-. He is 35 years old and comes from the Rivne region. I was very worried when I found out that they were taking the VAT. But when I got to the brigade, I quickly got used to it, and it became much easier. — I am such a person that I will worry before something, but after I get into the team, I quickly get used to it - and already the mood is completely different. Or maybe it's because of confidence in siblings, or maybe it's self-confidence that appears. And this plays an important role if you have reliable brothers and sisters near you, you know them, you know that they can cover your back, and you theirs. This confidence is very influential. -Lithuania- is very calm, smiles gently and shyly. Considers each answer. When asked about civilian life, he says that he never intended to be a soldier. Before the full-scale war, he went to Poland to earn money, then worked in a private company. But the war forced him to master a new profession, first as a rifleman in a training center, then as a gunner. — I was already learning to work with a gun in a brigade. They just entered the calculation. They learned quickly, not just quickly, but very quickly. As it turned out, it is not so difficult to learn it, the main thing is to have the desire to do your job well. A few weeks to study TTX, features of weapons, and most importantly — practice during combat work. -Lithuania- says that they like the service, the team is like a family. But there are also difficult moments. - They don't like to roll over. Rollover is when you need to change the firing position. Even if the front line doesn't change, we have to move so we don't get tracked. This is the third time in the last month. And every downfall is a great gloom. First, it is necessary to arrange a position for the gun, to disguise it. Secondly, you need to arrange a home for yourself. Mostly, these are basements. And they, to put it mildly, are not very adapted for life. Look, it was an ordinary cellar, a cellar where vegetables were stored. It was full of mice. — But now they have arranged everything in such a way that it looks like a good place to live. We try to quickly bring everything to order, to the minimum comfort and convenience. They even hung a garland, somehow it became pleasant and cozy. You see, war, especially in a combat unit that is constantly on the front line of defense, is very hard both morally and physically. Therefore, we try to support each other, to create human conditions. As a commander, I simply say to the boys: -The boys are gathered, everything will be fine.- And we joke a lot, because jokes are a very important thing, they encourage and support fighting spirit. Mother and brother are waiting for -Lithuania- at home. - I am single, not married yet. -Sometimes it's difficult, but you pull yourself together with the thought that you need to go to the end so as not to lose the country,- says the soldier. The chief sergeant of the platoon, call sign -Kros-, is from Mykolaiv, he is 44 years old. Greets us, constantly jokes. — At one time, I served in the border troops. In civilian life, he worked in Mykolaiv port, had armor. When the invasion began, I went to the Military Commissariat, I thought they would be taken to the border guards, but my unit had already left, so they were taken to the State Security Service. Ten days of -training-, which took place very intensively: shooting and training every day. It gave me good survival skills. When I got to DSHV, there was a feeling of some kind of intrigue, something new every day. Especially since I got into combat almost immediately. What I saw only on TV, then I saw in reality: terrible arrivals, broken equipment. Then we go to the villages, and you get goosebumps when you see what happened in the territories where the enemy was. People run out to meet, pray, cry that they are finally freed. And I also had the opportunity to meet military guys who understood military affairs, kept up with them, learned from them. - And how did they get to the cannon? - But how! They gave a tablet, showed how it works, practiced, if they see, a person succeeds, a person goes to the gun. Accordingly, so with everyone, let's see who can do what better. The initiative must come from the person himself, there is a big difference — when a man has a desire to do something or when he does not. — And what do you not like about your job? — But I like everything, except for rolling. And you have to do everything quickly, very quickly. Because it's still a -cannon-, it's not a mortar for you. The equipment must arrive here, it must be prepared. And FPV, constant shelling, we still need to organize the work of EW. And the KABs are flying in, because we are priority targets for the enemy. - Does it get scary? - Of course! But the fear passes very quickly, because you think that you have to do the work. You see, the body is already so hardened that it can not sleep or eat for 2-3 days, in such a mode, it adapts itself, the instinct of self-preservation is activated. Everyone can be afraid, but fear should not cloud the mind. So I talked to the -evader-. I say, it's your turn, we're tired, we need to be replaced. And he says: I'm afraid. And I tell him that if the Muscovites come, they will not ask you whether you are afraid or not, but will send you to the penalty box, they will drive you into an attack at gunpoint. Do you want it to be? What are you waiting for? That's how I explain to them. My wife and son are waiting for me at home. Friends worry and help. This is very supportive, because I know who I am fighting for, it gives me the strength to hold on to victory, because there is no other way out. We have one country, we defend it.

Fakes of the Russian Federation about -Azov-: from myths to heroes	After the creation of -Azov- in 2014, it immediately became a bone in the throat of the Russian authorities. His military achievements, patriotism and motivation did not fit into the narrative about a weak Ukraine, which is allegedly -under the control of the West.- In response, the Kremlin began to fabricate myths about Azov: first about its members, and then about their ideology. In 2015, the Russian media began to mass-distribute stories about -neo-Nazis-, basing it on symbols and isolated statements of individual representatives of the unit. In the West, these myths found a response among certain groups that did not understand the real situation in Ukraine. The discrediting of -Azov- has become a separate front of the information war. In 2022, during the heroic defense of Mariupol, the Russian mass media repeatedly tried to convince the world that the Azov people allegedly -hid behind civilians.- Instead, the world saw something else: the fortitude, humanity, and indomitability of the fighters who defended the Azovstal plant to the last. These attacks reached a special peak after the mass murder of Ukrainian prisoners in Olenivka. Russian propaganda tried to justify this act of terror, claiming that it was -the work of the Ukrainians themselves.- Recently, the occupiers again tried to play their favorite card. The first thing they invented was an absurd fake about the alleged -recruiting campaign- of -Azov- in France. Interestingly, even the details in this fake show haste and lack of logic: the contact details on the fake website do not lead to France, but to Germany. But do they need logic? They need a sensation so that at least someone believes in this fairy tale. The second maneuver is a classic of the genre: -&#8221;Azov&#8221; is hiding behind the backs of the civilian population.- This is their old trick that has long since become a pattern. This time they were -hiding- in the shopping center of Kharkiv, where one of the battalions of the brigade supposedly had a military base. But in this way, by launching rocket attacks on shopping centers, as a result of which there are numerous victims among the civilian population, Russia is once again trying to cover up its war crimes with the same rhetoric: -there was a base of neo-Nazis, that's all.- Every time we hear these accusations, we see one thing: it's not Azov hiding, it's them being afraid. They are afraid to admit that behind every freed meter of our land is not propaganda, but the real courage of Ukrainian soldiers. These fakes are like paper castles: loud, bright, but washed away by the first rain of truth. Russian propaganda fights with words, because it cannot cope with reality. But the truth is that the Azov regiment remains steadfast. And this is a fact that they will never be able to rewrite. -Azov- is not just a subdivision. It is a symbol. A symbol of indomitability, strength and devotion to the fight for freedom. And it is symbols that are always the targets of tyranny. Russian authorities are not afraid of weapons in the hands of Ukrainian defenders as much as they are afraid of their inspiring idea. Despite all the Kremlin's attempts to denigrate Azov, the world is gradually beginning to see the truth. From international investigations to recognition of the unit as part of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the truth breaks through the veil of disinformation. This is not just a story about information warfare. This is a lesson for all of us: even the biggest lie cannot destroy someone who fights for truth and freedom.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/03/fejky-rf-pro-azov-vid-mifiv-do-geroyiv/	2025-01-02T20:10:23-08:00

Many KAB parishes, especially in the rear units. There was a case when our Bradley infantry fighting vehicle was returning from a combat mission, and in front of it, somewhere a hundred meters away, a KAB flew. The enemy uses them en masse. -Bradley went around the ravine from under the KABU and drove on,- Eneis said. According to him, the Russians are also actively using drones. -These are both ordinary drones and fiber-optic drones. The enemy uses them en masse, because he has a huge number. Enemy drones constantly fly over our positions. Those that are on the fiber optic are mostly used against our equipment and on our logistics routes,- said -Enea-. According to him, the Russians are constantly attacking, but the intensity of these attacks decreases after our strikes on headquarters and communication centers. As reported by ArmyInform, the fighters of the 47th mechanized brigade -Magura- conducted a heavy operation with rescue of a wounded soldier.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/02/chuzhyj-proty-hyzhaka-na-kurshhyni-rosiyany-namagalysya-urazyty-bradley-kabom/	2025-01-02T10:51:31-08:00

Five myths about sniping - the fighter -Roxy- tells how snipers fight now	The conversation with the soldier was published on January 2 on the brigade's channel. In particular, -Roxy- refuted several myths about snipers. Myth No. 1: A sniper must have 100% vision. Vision does not matter here at all. This is just a Soviet stereotype, because the PSO (sniper optical sight), which was developed in 1963 specifically for the Dragunov rifle, did not have a diopter. All modern optics have it - adjust it as you need. Myth #2: The main thing for a sniper is to shoot accurately. You need to be able to navigate the terrain, camouflage yourself, understand the essence of ballistics, read the wind, and observe at all levels of the distance. Pulling the trigger is the easiest, the tip of the iceberg. Myth #3. A sniper must freeze for hours. It is impossible to lie down and look into the optics for 8 hours, because after 40 minutes the eye will -swim-. But we can look at the tablet as much as we need. You have a long-range surveillance system, a thermal imaging camera, and there are rifles nearby. Something has moved - you go out and work. Myth #4. Snipers are lonely Another stereotype of the cinema. A pair works - the first and second numbers. But they will not leave without the escort of shooters, machine gunners, those who will mine, cover, observe. Now snipers must have a drone for reconnaissance. Myth #5. Equipment and weapons are incredibly expensive. It's true, but every member of our newly created team will receive everything for free, including state-of-the-art rifles and training in a special training center. You don't need to buy anything. On the page of the brigade, everyone is invited to join the sniper platoon. As reported by ArmyInform, the other day the tank crew of the 63rd mechanized brigade almost i-tochno-znyshhyly-vorozhi-pozyczyiy/->close shot the positions of the Russian invaders in Serebryan Forestry. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/02/pyat-mifiv-pro-snajping-boyecz-roksi-rozpovidaye-yak-zaraz-voyuyut-snajpery/	2025-01-02T10:17:51-08:00
They disguised themselves with a pickaxe and a shovel - the dodgers were detained at the border	This was reported by the State Border Service on January 2. According to border guards, such a railway route was organized by shippers. After arriving at the border town of Velikiy Berezny, the violators then set off in the direction of the forest, pretending to check the condition of the rails. However, the plan failed: the -railway workers- were detained by the border guards, and later their guides, near the barrier fence. The violators were brought to administrative responsibility, and the smugglers were taken into custody. The investigation is ongoing.

At the same time, according to Orest Drymalovskyi, the enemy is constantly raising reserves, throwing in new units, often these are fresh contract workers, former civilians who sign contracts for money. -And after two weeks of training, they are thrown into advanced positions. And the occupiers have almost no chance to survive in this circle of death. The occupiers' losses in equipment are so great that they are unable to use it in the same quantity as it was in October or November,- concluded the representative of the 79th ODSHBr.

Some sources indicate that this is an attack on the 810th brigade of Russian marines. Ukrainian Su-25 attack aircraft drop French AASM-250 Hammer guided air bombs on the Russians. Launches are conducted relatively close to the front line — one of the locations 15 kilometers from the LBZ. Bombs are dropped in the zone of low effectiveness of Russian air defense, which does not have time to detect and shoot down Ukrainian planes. On the Lymanskyi direction, the Russians are shooting at themselves in order not to go into an assault. Aerial scouts of the 66th OMBr filmed how two occupiers wanted to be sidetracked from the battle, so one of them shot the arm of the other to simulate being wounded in battle.

MOU: Thanks to competitive bidding, more than UAH 2 million was saved on the purchase of lubricants ...	About this notified in the MOU. Savings of 14.3% of the announced cost became possible thanks to an effective procurement strategy, early announcement of tender procedures and active participation of suppliers. The first announced purchases included: The total cost of purchases amounted to UAH 13.52 million instead of the planned UAH 15.78 million. The average number of participants in DOT procurement was 4.17. This is higher than the average market indicators (2.6 participants) in the field of public procurement of the lubricants market. -The results of the work of the DOT show that thanks to transparent and effective procedures, we can not only meet the needs of the Armed Forces, but also achieve significant savings of public funds. More than four participants in the tender is not just a statistic, but an indicator of business confidence in the Ministry of Defense,- said Deputy Defense Minister of Ukraine Dmytro Klimenkov. Involvement of a wide range of participants at each stage of procurement allows DOT to ensure the best ratio of price and product quality. This approach is particularly important for providing the Armed Forces of Ukraine with critically needed resources, in particular lubricants for various types of equipment. DOT continues to actively attract companies to participate in public procurement. For this, a series of educational materials -Tangent. How a business can become a supplier of military equipment-, available on the Diya.Osvita platform and the Diya.Business portal.

No money: Russia sells uranium business in Kazakhstan to China	About this reports Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. The share of -Kazatomprom- (Kazakhstan) in JSC -JSC -Zarechnoye- has not changed and is 49.979%. In addition, -Uranium One Group- JSC plans to sell 30% of the shares of the Kazakh companies -JV -Khorasan-U- and -Kyzylkum- to the benefit of -China Uranium Development Company Limited-. -Kazatomprom- will keep its shares in these enterprises at the level of 50%. One of the reasons for Russia's decision was the negative impact of sanctions due to the war against Ukraine and reduced profits. Moscow's decision to sell its share of uranium deposits in Kazakhstan to China is a consequence of the impact of Western economic sanctions and limited resources for further investment in the development of these projects. Such a decision strengthens the influence of the PRC in the Central Asian region and changes regional politics in the energy sector: Beijing's control over uranium supplies is a strategic loss for Russia in the future. We remind you, 1 In January, the resolution of the Government of the Russian Federation came into force, canceling a one-time monetary payment to prisoners for signing a contract with the Russian Federation to participate in the war against of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/02/nemaye-groshej-rosiya-prodaye-kytayu-uranovyj-biznes-u-kazahstani/	2025-01-02T05:09:57-08:00

Training of F-16 pilots, digitalization of VLK and -Package of the wounded-: interview of Serhiy Mel...	In his busy schedule, he found time to talk with ArmyInform correspondents. What did Serhiy Melnyk remember about the defense of Kharkiv in 2022, in which he took a direct part? What radical changes have taken place in the army? How many Ukrainians visited recruiting centers last year? Read the answers to these and other questions in our interview. —You took a direct part in the defense of Kharkiv. What made it possible to defend a regional center important for the country at the beginning of a large-scale invasion? - Kharkiv survived thanks to the incredible courage, determination and self-sacrifice of our military, volunteers and ordinary residents of the city. From the first hours of the large-scale invasion, everyone was united around one goal: to stop the enemy. Residents of Kharkiv massively joined the defense: they helped at checkpoints, provided the military with food and necessary things, and worked under constant fire. The clear organization of the city's defense system also played an important role. The enemy advanced from all directions, carried out massive attacks on key infrastructure facilities, tried to destroy the air defense system and the command posts of our units. We operationally divided the city into seven defense sectors, and each sector had clear tasks and coordinates for defense. The first morning of the war was indicative. At 9:30 a.m. on February 24, enemy tanks had already appeared on the outskirts of Kharkiv, but at 9:43 a.m. they were destroyed by our forces. The enemy suffered heavy losses and was unable to advance further. Over the next few days, Russian sabotage and intelligence groups tried to enter the city in stolen civilian cars. They were in ordinary clothes and attempted to establish themselves in residential quarters before the approach of the main forces. However, this plan failed. Our mobile fire teams effectively identified and destroyed saboteurs. In the first five days alone, there were dozens of combat clashes between our units and Russian forces. Each fighter, each officer and each volunteer understood that not only the fate of the city, but also the future of the entire country depended on his actions. It was thanks to this unity, determination and effective organization of defense that Kharkiv held out and did not allow the enemy to achieve their goals. — Many military observers spoke about the moral superiority of our soldiers at the beginning of the large-scale invasion of the Russian Federation. And what other advantages did our army have in February and March 2022 - technological, tactical, etc.? - The main advantage of our forces was that we fought on our soil. This is not just a territory - it is our home, every corner of which is familiar to the smallest detail. Our military protected every patch of land, every street, every house. And in each of these houses, the enemy could be met not only by a military man, but also by a civilian, ready to resist. The second important factor was non-standard, bold and proactive decisions of Ukrainian commanders. They acted in advance, used maneuverable tactics, struck at the enemy's vulnerable points, not allowing him to gain a foothold in important positions. Another advantage is the high level of cohesion of Ukrainian society. In the first weeks of the war, the country united in a way that rarely happens in history. This was felt by the military on the front lines, it gave them the strength to stand to the last. Every Ukrainian, regardless of their status, played an important role in the common cause. Special mention should be made of volunteer assistance, which came almost from the first days of the war. Volunteers provided the military with medicines, necessary equipment, means of communication, transport and equipment. International aid also began to flow in very quickly, and this became an important factor in strengthening our defense capabilities. The combination of these factors—motivation, flexible tactical decisions, public support, the volunteer movement, and international assistance—became the basis of our resilience in the most difficult first months of the war. — Today there is an opinion that our Western partners are not helping our army enough or are doing it too slowly. But still, to what extent did the help of partners contribute to the fact that Ukraine is holding on, that our state did not fall under the blows of the aggressor? - International aid was and remains critically important for our struggle. Yes, we always want faster delivery and higher volumes. But without the support of our Western partners, especially in the form of modern weapons, air defense equipment, intelligence and technological equipment, holding the front line would be much more difficult. Western weapons saved tens, and possibly hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian lives. Modern anti-aircraft systems, artillery, armored vehicles, long-range missiles and drones allowed us to effectively oppose much larger enemy forces. But partner support isn't just a weapon. Financial stability, humanitarian aid for war victims, as well as political support in the international arena are important. The world continues to show that Ukraine is not alone in its struggle for freedom. Every tranche of financial aid, every package of military support, every diplomatic statement is an investment not only in Ukrainian victory, but also in global security. The entire democratic world understands that the success of Ukraine is the success of the entire civilized world. And we are grateful to each partner for this support, continuing to work on strengthening and accelerating it. —Ukraine has been holding out for the third year since the start of a large-scale invasion. But we cannot discard the war period before it. What can be recorded in the achievements of the Armed Forces of Ukraine during this period? - During this time, radical changes took place in the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which fundamentally transformed the army. It was not only overcoming Soviet stereotypes, but also building the foundations of a modern army. An innovative, flexible personnel training system was introduced, personnel selection and recruitment processes were improved, a transparent system of career growth was created, as well as opportunities for self-realization of servicemen. It is important to emphasize that these changes are based on the experience of the world's leading armies and NATO standards. This brought the Armed Forces of Ukraine closer to achieving a high level of interoperability with the Alliance forces, which is an important factor in joint operations and strategic partnership. Experience gained in the years before a large-scale invasion became decisive in February 2022. The Ukrainian army already had battle-hardened commanders, trained fighters and experience of effective defense, which made it possible to stop numerous attacks by superior enemy forces. In addition, these years helped to mobilize defense resources and organize an effective resistance to the army, which had a significant numerical advantage. The first months of the war became a vivid example of how hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians — military and civilian — were able to unite for a common goal. It was not only a military, but also a spiritual and national union. It was at these moments that Ukrainians realized their identity, national uniqueness and the right to be masters of their land. This unity has been the foundation of resilience and continues to inspire us to fight on. - Moving to a new position in your case is not only about scaling, but also about a significant transformation of the scope of authority and responsibilities. Are there any successful practices or developments that were useful and effective in your previous places of service and you plan to implement them in your new position? - My competence in the Ministry of Defense includes strategically important areas: military education and science, rights protection military personnel, recruiting, training, physical education, humanitarian support and social support. In fact, it is almost every aspect related to the support and provision of our military. The experience of organizing the defense of Kharkiv gave me an understanding of how the Defense Forces should work effectively in critical conditions. This experience allows me to better see the real needs of the military and to orient the ministry's work to solving specific tasks. One of the key principles that I have always emphasized and continue to implement at the state level is quality training. Not only the success of individual operations depends on professional training, but also the effectiveness of the army as a whole. A systematic approach to training, modern training methods and an individual approach to each serviceman are what we are actively developing. It is important that military personnel, veterans and new recruits feel the constant support of the state, both during and after their service. Among the specific examples of such support is the-Wounded Package-, which will begin to be issued to military personnel already next year. We are also working on the development of adaptive clothing for wounded servicemen and specialized clothing for military womenthat will provide comfort and functionality. Another important direction is the improvement of the food system and the introduction of additional financial incentives for the military, which will increase motivation and improve service conditions. These initiatives are only part of the systemic changes we plan to implement. They are designed not only to support our military today, but also to create the basis for their protection, development and a secure future. —During communication with many military personnel, we hear the following thesis: in the spring of 2022, we were constantly and a lot more creative and reported less. The initiative and the ability not to coordinate every step paid off then. But then the state began to demand that every step be coordinated. How to combine initiative and output with accountability and responsibility? - In the early days of a full-scale invasion, initiative, flexibility, and speed of decision-making were key factors in stopping the enemy advance. Then each commander, each unit acted as autonomously as possible, relying on their own experience and the situation on the ground. But warfare has changed—it now requires clear coordination, coordinated solutions, and integrated approaches. This does not mean that the initiative should be completely limited. On the contrary, the main challenge today is to find the right balance between freedom of action, accountability and accountability. It is important that commanders have the ability to quickly respond to challenges and make decisions, but at the same time be able to ensure transparency and accountability of their actions. To achieve this balance, we are actively implementing digitalization of processes and electronic document management. These tools not only reduce bureaucratic pressure, but also allow better control and optimization of processes. In particular, the -Reserve+- platform has already demonstrated its effectiveness. It greatly eased the administrative burden for both the military and civilians. Now updating data, extending deferrals for certain categories of citizens can be done directly in a mobile phone, without the need to visit territorial collection centers. The Army+ application is also constantly being improved. Now servicemen can submit reports for transfer, as well as order train tickets from the special reserve through a mobile application. In 2025, large-scale digitization of the process of military medical examination is planned. Both Reserve+ tools and general bases of the healthcare system will be applied here. This will not only reduce the burden on doctors, but also significantly simplify procedures for military personnel and citizens. The goal of these reforms is to create an effective, transparent and flexible management system, where initiative and responsibility do not conflict with each other, but work together for Ukraine's victory. —The recruiting process is gaining momentum in Ukraine. What interim results are already available today in this direction? What difficulties do we face? And can we announce the number of open recruiting centers? - We continue to improve the system of staffing the Armed Forces and the Defense Forces with motivated and trained personnel. Today, recruiting activities are carried out in two main directions. The first direction is the civilian component. As of now, 47 recruiting centers of the Ukrainian army have already been opened in Ukraine. This is just the beginning, and this network will continue to expand in the coming year. These centers are an innovative form of interaction between state structures with local self-government and the Ministry of Defense. Our goal is to create an extensive network of recruiting centers in different regions of the country, which will make it possible to maximize the opportunities for voluntary involvement of citizens in the ranks of the Armed Forces. An important feature of these centers is their location at TsNAPs, which ensures a comfortable and transparent process for citizens. They are not related to the territorial centers of recruitment and social support (TCC and SP). Qualified civilian specialists provide comprehensive information about military service, help choose a specialty and place of service, and also accompany the candidate at all stages of document preparation. For 10 months of operation, these centers have consulted more than 32 thousand citizens, and every fourth of them is already being selected for military service. An important indicator is that 20% of candidates are women. The main advantage of admission through the recruiting center is the opportunity to choose a specialty that corresponds to the candidate's abilities and desires, as well as to receive an extended package of benefits and social guarantees, which also apply to family members of a serviceman. The second direction is the recruiting centers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Currently, 5 specialized recruiting centers have been established in different types of Armed Forces: Ground Forces, Naval Forces, Airborne Assault Forces, Special Operations Forces and Territorial Defense Forces. Another center is being formed in the Unmanned Systems Forces. These structures are actively acquiring the necessary capabilities and are staffed with qualified specialists. In the near future, we will see their effective work in practice. In addition, the capabilities of commanders of combat units were expanded to independently select candidates for military service. Separate combat units already have their own recruiting units, which demonstrate effectiveness in attracting motivated military personnel. At the level of the Ministry of Defense and the General Staff, appropriate structural units have been created to coordinate and direct recruiting activities throughout the country. These steps allow Ukraine to systematically approach the Armed Forces recruitment process, ensuring quality, transparency and flexibility at all levels of recruiting. Military education in Ukraine should be implemented according to NATO standards. To what extent is our military education already compatible with the Alliance? What areas are being most actively reformed? — Military education in Ukraine is currently undergoing a large-scale transformation in order to achieve maximum interoperability with NATO standards. But this process is not simply copying Western approaches. We adapt NATO standards to our own realities, combat experience and current needs of the Ukrainian military. These changes are not only about tactical or technical aspects - they are also about changing the culture of thinking, strategic planning and training new military leaders. One of the key tools of transformation is the NATO DEEP (Defence Education Enhancement Program), which has been operating in Ukraine for more than 10 years. Thanks to this program, Ukrainian military educational institutions gained access to advanced Western methods and educational technologies. Main achievements in this area: Special attention is paid to the training of military pilots. The process of obtaining private pilot certificates by cadets has been optimized, which allows to reduce the training time of F-16 pilots by almost three months. This provides an important operational advantage in the air. However, the war demonstrated that victory is ensured not only by modern weapons, but also by strong leadership. Therefore, one of the main goals of military education is to educate a new generation of military leaders who are able to make effective decisions in the most difficult conditions and lead their units to victory. This approach especially applies to officers and non-commissioned officers, who are a key link in the Armed Forces. The concept of transformation of military education of Ukraine is a strategic plan until 2032. It includes a systematic approach to training, implementation of best global practices and close cooperation with other government agencies and international partners. This reform is not just an update of standards, it is an investment in the future of the Ukrainian army, which will be able to effectively respond to modern challenges and ensure national security.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/02/pidgotovka-pilotiv-f-16-czyfrovizacziya-vlk-ta-pakunok-poranenogo-intervyu-sergiya-melnyka/	2025-01-01T21:10:32-08:00
How a combatant -Hetman- and his soldiers retook positions in Krynk and captured a scout from Moscow	-When I entered the military school, I was not yet 17. I dreamed that I would serve 25 years, keep bees&#8230; But here it is already 31 years of service, and I'm still in the army and somehow not into beekeeping,- -Hetman- laughs. In 1996, Oleksandr Getmachenko graduated from the Kharkiv Higher Command Tank School. Then there were the steps of the army career: from the commander of a tank platoon to the chief of staff of a tank battalion. Rotation in Iraq as a rifle platoon leader, serving in the 27th and 28th Separate Mechanized Brigades. 10 years of work in law enforcement agencies, returning to the army in 2016, three rotations in ATO/OOS. The next step would probably have been to fulfill the dream of a quiet life as a beekeeper, but a great war had begun. In March 2022, the officer had to form a territorial defense battalion from scratch: there was a huge queue at the military commissariat in Yuzhny, so the unit was formed in literally three days. The battalion performed tasks in Odesa region, Mykolaiv region, and since the end of 2022 has been holding defenses on the right bank of Kherson region. The commander of battalion 126 told ArmyInform about the rescue of civilians after the Russians blew up the Kakhovskaya HPP, the work on the left bank of the Dnieper, the specifics of the enemy's actions in the South, the destroyed settlements on the coast, as well as the decision to personally lead the operation to repel enemy positions and the -combat moped- of a separate brigade TrO of the 30th Marine Corps: -November 22 of this year marked two years as a battalion here in Kherson region. Constantly on the front edge of the defense. During the liberation of the Right Bank in the positions left by the enemy, we managed to take a large number of trophy weapons and ammunition, which came in handy when we deployed the defense line. Opposite us stood an -unbeaten- military unit of the occupiers, which had not previously participated in active hostilities. At that time, they also equipped positions and built fortifications on the left bank - brazenly, especially without hiding. But we quickly corrected it, forced them to calm down, hit the enemy with everything we had - both trophy weapons, our own, and weapons provided by foreign partners. In the intercepts, it was constantly heard: -They are working with this Biden crap again!- They worked with ATGMs, LNG, then connected 120 mortars. We did everything possible so that the Russians could not freely and calmly equip positions. I always told my guys this: everything should work against the enemy. It doesn't matter whether the weapon is old, whether it is modern, whether it is ours, whether it is Western. Even stones will agree if there is nothing else left. The enemy must not be at rest for even a second. I vividly remember the day when the Russians blew up the Kakhovskaya HPP. The water rose before our eyes, carrying with it mountains of garbage. Cars, animals, trees, pieces of buildings - everything. Heavy water blocked almost all roads. There was only one road left at that time, along which my guys evacuated civilians, helped them transport pets, things. At that time, I was very worried that the battalion would not be cut off by water from the only logistical artery at that time, because at the peak moment the height of the water rise reached 8 meters. Fortunately, everything worked out. From the intercepts, we learned that the Russians, who were then sitting on the Dnipro Islands, drowned. That is, the enemy did not even warn his own about the detonation of the HPP. In the summer of 2023, our brigade began an operation on the left bank of the Dnipro River. First, the assault units came in, and the units of my battalion were already supposed to start holding positions. During the third rotation, already in September, I myself went to the left bank. We were given the task of recapturing the lost positions and getting a foothold there, I decided that I should go with the guys. Well, I could not set a task for the staff, draw something on the map without visualizing it. We went there very nicely, quietly. Fortified, inflicted fire damage on the enemy. Two were killed, one was taken prisoner - a mother of such a scout from Moscow. In total, we managed to recover 750 meters of land during that exit. They were supposed to take 800 meters of the area, but 50 meters could not be taken. A total of ten came in. The same number came out - and this is the greatest happiness for me as a commander. Only one fighter was lightly wounded. The experience of going to the left bank later helped me a lot when planning combat missions and making decisions. I already know the specifics of the terrain, the specifics of movement, camouflage, and combat, where it is possible to gain a foothold and where it is not possible. To be honest, the operation on the left bank, on the islands, in Krynyky was difficult for me. I commanded a rifle platoon in Iraq for half a year, I did not have any losses, there were wounded in the anti-terrorist operation, but no one died. And here I was losing guys. And this is my biggest pain. In general, when my fighters go out, all the forces and means of the battalion work for them - drones, mortars, rocket launchers. And I still worry about people every time. I actually know all of them. Here, for example, a group of 8 people went to one of the extreme exits to the islands - very strong fighters, half - experienced scouts, my personal guard, as I call them. One of them is a young guy, a cool fighter, who recently returned from training in Germany. So, at that time, his fourth child was to be born. I did not force him to go, on the eve of leaving I asked if he was sure that he was ready to go on the task. Said he was sure. The boys stayed there for three weeks - due to difficult weather conditions, we could not get them out earlier. Of course, they had no contact with their relatives. Therefore, we relayed the news about the birth of a son to the soldier by radio. Well, the wife was also informed that the young father is alive and well. When the group left, I gave this warrior leave so that he could go to the family, see the youngest. Look, he could have already been released, this is already the fourth child, all minors, but he does not abandon his siblings, performs difficult tasks. I really respect and appreciate such people. Sometimes, you know, I'm surprised how unpredictably people show themselves in extreme situations. Those you don't expect suddenly do incredible things on the battlefield, and others you hope for -blow off-. Strange human psychology, you won't guess. We have a fighter nicknamed -Cunning-. All the time he was so quiet, an unremarkable, mediocre soldier. And he showed himself heroically in Krynyk. He pulled out the wounded, led the battle, encouraged, motivated. We took a close look at -Cunning-, made him a squad leader, then a platoon sergeant major. He copes with the tasks, it is nice that we were not mistaken. The war has changed dramatically in the two years that we have been in Kherson region. Now it is dominated by unmanned aerial systems - drones, FPV. They are actively used both by us and by the Russians. It's kind of, you know, a constant race. The enemy cannot be underestimated or considered weak. The Russians are improving, changing frequencies so that we can't hit them or suppress them with our EW. Recently, the enemy has begun to use dense mining, especially on the roads where we travel. Scatter -petals-, spikes. The rubber is punctured, as soon as the car stops to change a tire, the mavics with resets start working. In this way, the enemy is trying to destroy our logistics. Also, in the last few months, the enemy began to use aviation more, in particular, helicopters. They do not cause special damage, but morally, of course, they pressure. It is not pleasant when two -pinwheels- come out at you and launch 28 rockets each. FPV is not the most annoying. At the same time, the Russians do not care who to hit - civilians or military. A woman is walking, in ordinary clothes, in rubber boots, and an FPV is flying behind her. It's good that she managed to fall under a tree and the explosion hit the branches, it saved her. The enemy is constantly terrorizing the civilian population, enemy FPVs are chasing civilians, destroying their vehicles, houses. It pains me to watch how the Russians turn once rich coastal villages into an apocalyptic wasteland. When we just drove into Kherson region, I was in for a pleasant shock. Wealthy, beautiful villages, where people were mainly engaged in agriculture, earning a penny with their work. I have never seen fields like here in my life, although I myself come from sunny Bessarabia. Peach, pear, apple, cherry orchards, hectares of strawberries, raspberries, grapes, all under irrigation. How much human labor and money is invested here! It was all destroyed because of the Russians. Villages and towns along the Dnieper look like something out of a horror movie. Everything is burnt, broken. They simply methodically destroy street after street, house after house for two years. It is no longer possible to move during the day. Any car becomes a target. Man is the same. It got to the point that I had to take the moped from Yuzhny and drive it around the positions at night with a headlamp. There is no other way to move through a large area of ​​responsibility. It's normal - I ride, check the positions, familiarize myself with the situation, talk to the guys, ask what help is needed, what problems there are. If at the beginning of a full-scale war I had a lot of people and few weapons, now the situation is completely different. There are weapons, not enough people. It's no secret that very few motivated and, most importantly, completely healthy people who are able to fight come to the army, in particular, to my unit. You understand, to fight is to wear a bulletproof vest, a helmet, some kind of weapon, equipment. You have to have some health to lift it all. And when 55+ men come along, well, they can't physically be effective even if they want to. I speak personally with everyone who comes to the battalion. I ask what he did in civilian life, I try to find a position that would take into account a person's knowledge and skills. If you know about technology, like to turn nuts - here is the position of a repairman, please. A gamer - I have a boyfriend, a European champion in computer games - let's take it to drones. A fitness trainer means you can be a doctor. There is a great need for a personnel - now I will say rudely - with eggs. Who can not only sit in the trenches or in the basements, but also go out, move forward, inflict fire damage on the enemy. It's okay to be afraid. It's scary sometimes, to be honest. I want to live, I want to see my grandchildren. But there is a task to be done. It is necessary to save the country, so fear must be overcome. People are also needed because those guys who have experience and have been fighting for a long time are very tired, very tired. However, they do not give up their arms and weapons. I have an extremely good team - battalion management, company commanders, sergeants, sailors. Despite the fatigue, they work, they say: -Combat, we are with you.- They believe me, I believe them too. We cover each other's backs and continue the fight.

It is a center-fire cartridge with a bottle-shaped case, without a protrusion at the edges, designed for military snipers for effective shooting at long distances. The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq proved its effectiveness in practice and contributed to its significant spread. .338 Lapua has a dual purpose: combating enemy manpower and equipment. But the possibilities of combating equipment are limited by the lower kinetic energy of the bullet, especially compared to .50 BMG. The diameter of the flange is 14.93 mm, and the total length of the bullet is 93.5 mm. The bullet is able to penetrate better than standard body armor at a distance of up to 1000 m, and the maximum effective distance of fire reaches 1750 m. The initial speed of the bullet depends on the temperature and composition of the gunpowder and varies from 880 m/c to 915 m/c for a civilian bullet weighing 16.2 g, and the initial energy of the bullet is about 6525 J. In general, long-range sniper the HLR338 rifle combines incredible functionality and impressive accuracy. It has an ergonomic design and modular construction. That is, it can be easily and quickly adapted to a specific task. Exhibition presentation of long-range sniper rifle Haenel HLR 338.

Leopard and -Santa Barbara-: how the -Shaggy- NATO tank protects tankers	The crew of the Leopard 2A4 tank with the call sign -Lokhmaty- of the 33rd separate mechanized brigade told ArmyInform about all this. The commander of the tank -White-, the driver-mechanic -Tokmak-, the gunner -Paly- and the loader -Chechen-. Not so long ago, they all had civilian professions, but with the beginning of a large-scale invasion, they joined the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and mastered a formidable combat vehicle - the Leopard 2A4. This crew is fully interchangeable - each member can fill in for another in an emergency. At the basic level, this was taught during training in Spain, and then tankers independently improved their skills after returning to Ukraine. — Here, Ruslan has already fought as a gunner, and as a loader, and as a driver-mechanic—whatever he was. And he worked as a commander. Someone who, for example, was a charger from the beginning, can become both a mechvod and a gunner, if it is necessary in combat conditions, says -White-. It is not difficult to learn to fulfill the responsibilities of a brother, they assure. Of course, the one who fights as a gunner or mechvod longer will be more skillful, but everyone should know the basics and it is unnecessary to relearn for a long time. - There is nothing complicated, the main thing is to understand. The crew should be interchangeable, because if, God forbid, something happens, then the loader takes control, the gunner takes control. -Everybody rides our tanks, and they know everything about charging and guidance,- the tank commander assures. Tankers remember training in Spain with gratitude and, smiling, say that they would gladly go to study more. Two of them came from the infantry, two more, including the tank commander, transferred to the Leopard from the T-64. — Did you go on -Zhiguly-? And then they switched to a foreign car - a BMW or a Volkswagen? So it's the same as changing from a bogie to a normal car - here everything is made for people: handles, footboards, -sandpapers- on the armor so that the feet don't slip and the nose doesn't get stuffed, -White- points to the special coating on the tank's armor. However, the T-64, on which he served conscript service and fought in 2022 in the 4th separate tank brigade, is fondly remembered. It was on this Soviet tank that he took part in the Slobozhan offensive operation, when the Russians were hastily fleeing from the Kharkiv region. — They tarred the Russians so much that their fur coats turned upside down. Kupyansk, Tabaivka - we then chased them and beat them so much that if we had given the order, we would have reached Belgorod, but we crossed the border - and they are standing! That's how we didn't enter Russia then, - the tanker driver is happy and sad at the same time. Now fighting on the Leopard, he and his brothers note that the 64 does not stand a chance compared to him and is only suitable for shooting from closed positions as ersatz artillery. And in this, they add, the T-64 can be quite effective, because its gun provides a significant range and accuracy of shots. — If 40 years ago the Soviet Union and NATO had -bited down-, then Soviet tanks with -Leopard- would not have stood nearby. -Leopards- are very good, they are good now, but they were made back in the 1980s and they were good in the 1990s. And now drones have changed everything, -White- is convinced. However, even now -Leopard- has significant advantages over obsolete Soviet tanks already 40 years ago. It is not only noticeably larger and significantly heavier, but also significantly more powerful, faster, more maneuverable, more spacious. And also, despite more than 60 tons of weight and a 1,500-horsepower engine, it is quieter. Already 50-70 meters away in the forest, the hum of a tank engine can be heard as the work of a large, but quite calm agricultural mechanism. When the tank is 120-150 meters away, you need to listen carefully to hear it. And no wild roar at start-up or crazy growl while driving. It is almost impossible to audibly detect the Leopard on the battlefield among other numerous noises, shots and explosions. And with the simplest masking, it becomes inconspicuous visually. The tank shown to us is covered with camouflage -kikimora- and it becomes inconspicuous already at a distance of 30-40 meters. - We call him -Shaggy- because he has such a disguise. It has already broken off in some places, so the armor is visible. But when we attach everything back, it is almost not visible, says -Tokmak-, who is in the combined crew as a mechvod, but was also a gunner. For a war machine of this size, the Shaggy Leopard's camouflage looks really amazing. When the tank that was standing on the lawn drives deep into the forest, we see its dark silhouette only because we know its location. — This particular tank was standing on a mowed field of yellow color, covered in the same way as this net, — shows -Tokmak- on the -kikimora- on the -Leopard-. — And it's not even visible if you don't know it's there. And he stands and works on the enemy, he is especially not even disguised, he stands and just works. And one hundred percent that the people who saw the video of his work did not even understand that he was shooting like that. Before driving back into the forest, the Leopard rotates the turret with the barrel of the gun in the direction of the stern. This is a transport position, the tankers explain, this is how the tank moves on the march, how it is driven onto railway platforms or trawlers. Therefore, an uninformed civilian should not approach the tank from any side - the direction of the gun barrel does not at all indicate that the mechvod sees you. — There were incidents when cars were left a few meters behind the tank, believing that the direction of the gun barrel pointed to its front. While everything was quite the opposite - it was the stern, -Tokmak- explains. In general, everything is thought out - the tank even has rear-view mirrors, side and stop lights. Thanks to this and rubber pads on the tracks of the tracks, the Leopard can easily drive around the city, fitting into traffic flows and not damaging the asphalt. In the set of equipment provided with the tank, there is even a special flashing beacon, which is used to mark large-sized equipment when driving on public highways. — The rear-view mirrors were not made of glass, but of metal, polished -stainless steel- so that you can see plus or minus like a mirror. Not super clear, but enough to see what's behind, says -White.- He speaks favorably of how the Leopard is adapted for transportation on trawls or by rail in EU countries. The German armored car clearly stands on the platform, while the Soviet tanks have half of the tracks hanging on both sides during rail transport. - It will run 80 kilometers on the dirt road - just like that! And on the asphalt, the -hundred- will go for a sweet soul. If all the components work perfectly, then this is a great car. 40 years ago it was basically a tank - fire! - enthusiastically says about the -Leopard- of the -White- tank commander. Mehvod adds that the automatic transmission allows you to -not worry- about gear changes. -Sat down, -started- and drove away- - the tank does not need any warm-up and long acceleration time to gain speed. Also, the -Leopard- is extremely maneuverable, and the steering wheel of the armored vehicle can be controlled with one hand. Mobility gives the tank important, often decisive, advantages on the battlefield when time is counted in fractions of a second. - We are always moving - through lowlands, forest strips. There were cases when the enemy was approached at close range - at a distance of several hundred meters. We stick the barrel into the enemy's dugout and shoot, - laughs the tank commander. The tank easily goes off-road - mud, mud, dry sand. The only problem for him can be wet sand, on which during a turn the Leopard can -take off his shoes-, losing the track - it slips off the tracks. However, returning the -goose- to its place is not a problem - it does not require significant effort and time. Tankers call the main threat to a tank in battle barrage ammunition such as -Lancet- and FPV-kamikaze. ATGMs and mines are also a significant threat, but much less so than drones. — If it weren't for these -efpivishkas-, we would have already broken the -star- from the Kremlin with the -Leopard-. Mines, dumps, grenade launchers - everything that can be survived, escaped or maneuvered. And when the FPV is -hugging- at 180 kilometers per hour - how can you escape from it? says the commander of the -White- tank. -Tokmak- emphasizes that one cannot underestimate the enemy and consider him stupid and weak. Everything is dangerous on the battlefield, but Lancet calls it the most dangerous. - It's even cooler than FPV - it's like ten FPV flying into you. As soon as the weather is good, the sun will shine - right in the Supercam sky, and the Lancet can fly. The enemy cannot be underestimated, because he knows a lot and learns well, there are many of them, they have a lot of resources, he notes. Tankers recall the devastating effects of Lancets and FPV hits on armored vehicles and show the places where the cumulative jet was hit - the -skin- of this -Leopard- already has some scars. Instead, the mines, they say, do not pose a danger to the lives of the crew. - It holds mines like peanuts. The crew just climbs out like a plague, the light flashes. Contused, but alive and whole. We have those here who have been blown up several times. It feels like the head was stuck in the bell and the bell was hit with a sledgehammer. My ears are ringing, but 80% of our staff here are already a bit contused, so this is a normal thing, says -White-. Tankers are critical of -sheds-, -barbecues-, protective nets and gratings. It is said that any extra structures greatly impair the tank's maneuverability. They are difficult to install so that they do not interfere with the rotation of the turret, and they also prevent the crew from quickly leaving the armored vehicle in case of need. — She only gets in the way. Well, you can plaster, weld this grill. But if you boil otaku halabuda on top, then this is also a disadvantage in terms of masking - especially since you cannot hide it. We covered the engine compartment, put it in the front, but it all doesn't hold well - it's enough to drive into the landing and it will be demolished. This is such a tank that the grill just gets in the way, explains the commander of the -Shaggy-. On the other hand, tankers respond favorably to the dynamic protection blocks installed on the armor, recognizing their feasibility. Even a thick rubber collar on one of the tank's vulnerable spots is useful because it dampens the cumulative jet. -Leopards-, they say, came from Germany -naked-, so they had to install a dynamic defense already in Ukraine. Unlike protective grills, these additional -accessories- in no way affect the advantages of the tank in battle, such as speed and maneuverability, do not expose it and do not endanger the lives of the crew in the event of an emergency exit of the combat vehicle. Recognizing the importance of EW devices, which are also installed on tanks, tankers still rely more on the tank's mobility, camouflage and smoke, shooting which -Leopard- can so -fog- the battlefield that it itself makes its way almost by touch. Fighters consider the so-called -Santa Barbara- to be one of the biggest advantages of the -Leopard- over old Soviet tanks - a special compartment of the tower, which houses an ammunition kit of 15 shells, which are stored in special tube drawers. The name of this part of the tank tower comes from the legend of Saint Barbara, a great Christian martyr who is considered the patron saint of gunners, sappers, military engineers and rocket launchers. It is she who, according to established tradition, provides protection against death due to explosions, thunder and lightning. In Spanish, French and Italian, the word -Santa Barbara- means an artillery cellar or a place for storing gunpowder and ammunition on a warship or in a fortress. Previously, statues of the saint were placed near them as a talisman against the explosion. In the -Leopard-, the -Santa Barbara- is arranged in such a way that it is completely separated from the main part of the turret, and in the event of an ammunition explosion, the blast wave and debris are directed and scattered outside, not inside the tank. This is what allows you to save the lives of tankers. — Even in the event of an ammunition explosion, the crew will definitely survive and the tank itself will survive and remain on the move. You have definitely seen on the video how Soviet tanks explode from the inside, how the tower is torn off. This can never happen on the Leopard if the ammunition is placed only in the Santa Barbara, says the tank commander. The last clarification is important, because the tank also has a magazine rack, on which you can store additional shells, increasing the tank's ammunition to 42 rounds. However, now tankers do not do this, because then the danger of detonation due to hitting enemy ammunition is too high. — It is bad that there are few bullets, only 15 pieces. But we don't put shells in the BC rack, because it's too dangerous. same Now they cannot be used under any circumstances, except to store stew or something else, because additional space appears inside the tank, - explains -White-. In addition to -Santa Barbara-, Leopard has a few more -chips- that help save the lives of tankers. One of them is the ability to continue driving in a special emergency mode even if the engine compartment is hit by enemy ammunition. - To survive, it has many functions. For example, when the FPV engine is flying, the crew switches it to emergency mode and can continue to drive for some time. Another 5 or even 7 kilometers can be driven until everything leaks out of the engine and it burns out completely, says -White-. In addition, excess pressure is created in the closed body of the tank, which allows you to protect the crew from harmful penetration from the outside - a chemical, biological or even nuclear threat. It also allows the -Leopard- to -swim- well - more precisely, overcome water obstacles by wading. Tankers note that the main thing is that the bottom is hard enough and the tank does not get sucked into the mud. — You check all the nodes completely so that everything works. One click lever and everything is completely hermetically sealed. You turn on the drainage pumps, bilge pumps. You turn on the ford crossing system, the driver-mechanic has a pressure gauge that shows whether the pressure is maintained, whether the system is working - and forward, says the tank commander. Unlike Soviet tanks, which need to be caulked for a long time before diving, everything is done automatically in the Leopard. The armored -predator- can easily overcome a water obstacle up to three meters deep. Enemy dugouts and fortifications, infantry and armored vehicles - Leopard crews had to work on a wide variety of targets. Tankers tell about the destruction of a column of enemy armored vehicles from 8 units and a skirmish with a Russian tank, which ended in a shameful defeat for the enemy. — With one -Leopard- the guys from our company -dismantled- this entire moving column. And it is this -Leopard- - you can find a video on the Internet - clearly put a -crow- in the stern of a Russian tank, which we encountered in one of the villages in Donetsk region, and it ran away from us. -He was turned around after being hit,- says -Tokmak-. Tankers call an armor-piercing projectile a -scrap-. Thanks to the laser rangefinder and clear aiming, this accurate shot was made at a distance of 3 km 200 m. However, then the rangefinder failed, and the enemy tank began to maneuver and leave the affected area. — Of course, we released the entire BC on it. It fell next to him, fell in front of him, fell behind him, but without accurately measuring the distance it became very difficult to hit. But then we asked him kindly, says the tanker. -Leopard-, he emphasizes, is a great fighting machine, but, like any other equipment, only if all nodes, units and devices work flawlessly. In case of breakdowns, the quality of the tank's combat performance drops. However, in any case, it remains much better than the old Soviet tanks on which the Russians are fighting.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/02/leopard-i-santa-barbara-yak-lohmatyj-tank-nato-berezhe-tankistiv/	2025-01-01T20:15:40-08:00
A new masterpiece of Russian disinformation: the fake that Ukraine is -destroying- its own GTS	Let's imagine for a minute that Ukraine decided to destroy its own GTS. It is like a farmer burning his crops to salt his neighbor. After all, the GTS is not just pipes, but also a strategic asset that brings income from gas transit. The destruction of this infrastructure would cause harm, first of all, to Ukraine itself. The purpose of spreading such fakes is to discredit Ukraine in the eyes of European partners, to sow doubts about its reliability as a transit point, and to justify Russia's own actions. After all, if you believe this nonsense, it turns out that Ukraine is depriving itself of income and undermining Europe's energy security. The Ukrainian side has repeatedly denied similar statements, emphasizing its commitment to obligations to European consumers and its desire for energy cooperation. However, it seems that Russian propaganda does not tire of inventing new ways of discrediting. The fake about Ukraine's -destruction- of its own GTS is another example of how the Russian disinformation machine tries to manipulate facts and mislead the international community. However, as practice shows, the truth always comes to the surface, and such attempts only undermine the credibility of the very sources of disinformation.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/02/novyj-shedevr-rosijskoyi-dezinformacziyi-fejk-pro-te-shho-ukrayina-znyshhuye-vlasnu-gts/	2025-01-01T20:04:16-08:00
The marines repelled the enemy assault: the Russians did not have time to fire a single shot	The video of the successful operation was published on the brigade's Facebook page. One of the unsuccessful assaults of the Russian troops on the position of the Black Sea Marines resulted in the enemy losing an entire infantry division and three units of armored vehicles. In the footage, you can see how our aerial scouts recorded the movement of the enemy's equipment. One of the armored vehicles blew up on the mine barriers, but the infantry managed to hurry. Later, another enemy armored vehicle blew up on a mine. These vehicles and infantry became targets for our drone operators. -The occupiers did not have time to fire a single shot, as they were already sent to meet their predecessors in hell,- the post reads.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/01/morpihy-vidbyly-vorozhyj-shturm-rosiyany-ne-vstygly-zrobyty-zhodnogo-postrilu/	2025-01-01T11:43:11-08:00

President: Stopping transit of Russian gas is one of Moscow's biggest defeats	This is stated in the statement of the head of state in the telegram channel. -When Putin was given power in Russia more than 25 years ago, the annual gas pumping through the territory of Ukraine to Europe amounted to 130+ billion cubic meters. Today, the transit of Russian gas is 0. This is one of Moscow's biggest defeats,- the President said. The transformation of energy carriers into weapons and cynical energy blackmail of partners is what deprived Russia of the most attractive and geographically accessible market for Russia, added Volodymyr Zelenskyy. -Considering the circumstances, the absolute majority of European countries have successfully adapted to such changes. Today, our joint task is to support Moldova in the period of energy transformation. We also have to withstand the hysteria of some European politicians who prefer mafia schemes with Moscow instead of a transparent energy policy,- the head of state said. Volodymyr Zelenskyi also expressed hope for an increase in the supply of American gas to Europe, which was already mentioned by US President Donald Trump. Cooperation and maximum offers from partners on the market will make it possible to make prices more comfortable. -The more gas there is on the market from Europe's true partners, the sooner the last negative consequences of European energy dependence on Russia will be overcome,- concluded the President.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/01/prezydent-zupynka-tranzytu-rosijskogo-gazu-odna-z-najbilshyh-porazok-moskvy/	2025-01-01T08:14:55-08:00
Olga Reshetylova spoke about the primary tasks of the military ombudsman	The interview was broadcast by the telethon -The only news-. Olga Reshetylova explained that she is currently performing a coordinating role, as Ukraine has not yet adopted the legislation on the military ombudsman. -Therefore, the first task is the adoption of the draft law on the military ombudsman. We worked on it before, I was part of the working group, and it is almost finalized. I think that in the coming days the final version will be presented to the President and I hope that we will be able to submit it to the parliament,- she said. The second task is to solve the most pressing issues. -Immediately after the appointment, I received a huge number of complaints that need to be responded to and we are already doing it. There are complaints of an individual nature and there are more general problems that require a systemic solution,- said Olga Reshetylova. She gave an example of a system for collecting DNA analysis during military service. There are relevant regulations, but this work is not systematically established. -I want to emphasize that both now and after the adoption of the law, we are talking exclusively about active servicemen. And about everything related to passing the service. And this is important, because when entering the service, military personnel voluntarily give up some of their rights and freedoms, and in return do not receive any protection. This applies to issues of social, legal protection, etc.,- emphasized Olga Reshetylova. As reported by ArmyInform, on December 30, 2024, Volodymyr Zelensky appointed Olga Reshetilova for the post of military ombudsman.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/01/olga-reshetylova-rozpovila-pro-pershochergovi-zavdannya-na-posadi-vijskovogo-ombudsmena/	2025-01-01T07:57:26-08:00
The Defense Forces explained what goals the enemy is pursuing when storming Vovchansk	The head of the interaction group with Mass media of the -Hart- brigade Oleksandr Danylenko. -In the Vovchansk region, the enemy is conducting assaults, shelling our positions, dropping anti-aircraft missiles. Subversive and intelligence groups are also trying to take action. But we warn against all these attempts, we do not allow the enemy to advance,- Oleksandr Danylenko said. According to him, the enemy is trying to capture Vovchansk for further advancement in the Kharkiv Region. -First, to create a buffer zone in the city itself.

Received Russian documents regarding the plane crash in Baku	This is reported by Center of National Resistance. It shows the degradation of the Russian regime, total mendacity, and rapid loss of foreign policy influence. It is also quite likely that the Russian dictator will not punish his faithful vassal Kadyrov or anyone from the Chechen administration in general, and will appoint someone completely insignificant as the culprit. The so-called head of the Chechen Kadyrov has an extensive network of representatives throughout the Russian Federation. The document, which will be discussed further, was developed and sent on behalf of the representative of the head of the Chechen Republic in the Ural Federal District, Turpal Akhmedovich Ilyasov. The source that handed over Ilyasov's letter to the CNS received it from the mail of Ilyasov's son, Adam, who also works at this representative office, is the head of the secretariat and is responsible for interaction with the media. The document itself is a kind of -darkroom- with instructions on what should or should not be commented. As it follows from the text, it reflects the position of Kadyrov and the head of his administration, Galas Taymaskhanov. In particular, in the letter you can see how in Russia language becomes a tool for building a parallel reality. For example, it is suggested to ignore any mention of a plane being shot down. Instead, it is recommended to call it a tragic incident - because that is what Russian dictator Putin called it in his address. However, the letter further contains interesting details of the behind-the-scenes intrigues of the Russian ruling elite. For example, it is claimed that the Russian Federation will never admit its guilt and this is a clear position of Putin. So this is just a tragic accident that happened in the -airspace of Russia-. The letter also shows that Putin depends on the loyalty of his Chechen vassals and oprichniks. Putin's official apology, which he expressed to President Aliyev, was of a general nature and demonstrates how dependent the Russian Federation is on maintaining relations both with Azerbaijan and its partners in the region. In fact, Putin is in a weak position to ignore this incident. If earlier, as in the case of the downed Malaysian flight MH-17, Russia could afford to ignore and silence the facts for years, to overload the information space with mutually exclusive false versions, then in the case of the Baku-Grozny flight, no matter how much Putin wanted to, he had to apologize. Of course, this was a -half- apology - because Russia still does not want to admit its guilt. And that's why they play -newbie- with -tragic incidents-. However, such an apology does not suit the Azerbaijani side. The latter requires finding the culprits and bringing them to justice. Here it is worth mentioning that on December 24, Khamzat, the secretary of the Chechen Security Council and Kadyrov's nephew, announced on Instagram that all drones in the sky over Chechnya had been destroyed. He became practically the only official who confirmed that Chechnya was attacked by drones. -The information that the drones hit some object is not true, everything has been shot down!- - he wrote in a comment to the video of the destruction of one of the drones. The next day, when it became known about the downing of the Azerbaijani plane, Kadyrov awarded his nephew the medal -For services to the Chechen Republic.- Obviously, this gave rise to versions about the involvement of Kadyrov's relatives in instructing controllers to divert the plane so that it would crash into the sea, thereby hiding all evidence of the crime. It is also worth mentioning here the fact that Chechnya and the Kadyrovs are a kind of Putin's henchmen. Moscow does not touch the Caucasus, Chechnya has one of the lowest rates of involvement in the Russian occupation army, as well as the level of casualties. Other, more distant regions (such as Bashkiria or Tatarstan) bear disproportionately greater human losses. So, in this situation, when Putin is tied to the loyalty of the Caucasus, but has to find those responsible for the downing of the plane, he will most likely choose the traditional option of appointing a scapegoat. And from the letter it becomes clear that it will be the dispatchers, not the Chechen administration. Therefore, Kadyrov's nephew can receive a dozen more orders named after Kadyrov and not worry about the consequences. The temnik sent by Turpalov clearly shows the rapid degradation of the Russian Federation. After all, a regime built on lies and crimes cannot give the world anything but the suffering of innocent people. We remind you, at the end of December, seven teenagers blew themselves up with an explosive device in Lysychansk.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/01/otrymano-rosijski-temnyky-shhodo-katastrofy-litaka-u-baku/	2025-01-01T01:43:16-08:00
Caloric content, assortment and quality: the Ministry of Education explained how food is organized i...	This is reported by January 1 Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. Products are purchased according to the approved Catalog, which includes 360 items. This makes it possible to form a balanced and varied menu for Ukrainian defenders. Meal kits for military personnel are purchased by the Ministry of Defense agency -State Rear Operator- according to the Product Catalog. Their number is formed by the Command of the Logistics Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which submits a generalized application to the Procurement Policy Department of the MoU. According to the purchase results, the price and calorie content of each product name are indicated. The cost of one set of products is also displayed. Personnel take food in stationary canteens of military units or in temporary food stations. Three meals a day includes breakfast, lunch and dinner. Also, a second dinner is additionally prepared for the servicemen who are on guard. Some categories of military personnel receive four meals a day. This applies to the crews of surface ships, support vessels, personnel of the coastal units of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the administrations of associations, lyceums and flight crews. Food in canteens of military units is prepared in accordance with the approved food layout. It is compiled by the head of the food service of the military unit, taking into account the daily ration and calorie content. The minimum energy value of a serviceman's diet per day should be at least 3,500 kcal. The layout of products is made taking into account: According to the decision of the commander of the military unit, a menu with at least two options of first courses, side dishes, meat and fish dishes is planned. The planning takes into account the wishes of the staff, cooking conditions, technical capabilities of the kitchen, and food storage conditions. In field conditions, depending on the nature of training and combat tasks, an enhanced meat and (or) fish dish with a side dish can be prepared instead of the first course. This decision is also made by the commander of the military unit. If it is not possible to cook hot food, servicemen are issued individual rations (IRH), so-called -dry rations-. There are two types of rations available in the ZSU: Each ration is designed for three meals during the day. PNSP ration (Norm No. 10) is issued to military personnel when it is not possible to prepare a hot meal from products according to the basic norm. Also, this set is included in the emergency stock of ships of the Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. PNSP can be issued not only during hostilities. The diet has an assortment of dishes, which consists of meat and meat-vegetable preserves, ready for continuous consumption for up to three days. Its energy value is 1,250 kcal per day. DPNP ration (norm No. 15) is also issued to military personnel in case it is impossible to prepare hot meals from products according to the basic ration. However, this applies to those military personnel who are in the field, on training, participating in the implementation of measures to ensure national security and defense, repelling armed aggression of the Russian Federation, and while on their way to their destinations. The DPNP diet includes ready-to-eat first, second and meat dishes in retort packaging. The energy value of the diet is at least 3,500 kcal per day. As reported by ArmiyaInform, the procurement agency of the Ministry of Defense -State rear operator- announced tenders komplektiv-suhpajkiv-na-2025-rik/->for the purchase of 1.7 million sets of daily field kits products (DPNP) No. 15 for the entire next year. The expected cost is over UAH 485 million.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/01/kalorijnist-asortyment-i-yakist-u-mou-poyasnyly-yak-organizovano-harchuvannya-u-zsu/	2025-01-01T01:02:04-08:00

Energy security of the world: TOP-25 forecasts for 2025	-In 2024, the global energy map of the world has undergone significant changes. At the same time, before identifying the main factors of influence, it is worth first of all to outline the very concept of energy security, which is a sufficient amount of energy resources that are transported through a stable infrastructure to transparent markets, to which a paying consumer has equal access. The global portfolio of energy resources, in the part of oil, can be considered practically balanced, because the global level of consumption of 102.8 million barrels per day is covered by the production of 102.6 million barrels. Such an indicator indicates the balance of the market, despite military tensions in the Arabian Peninsula and the Middle East. In this context, it is appropriate to mention that in the third quarter of the current year, Iran repeatedly resorted to public statements of various nature, expecting, in particular, changes in the global oil market. In fact, the supply and demand situation has been balanced by the increase in oil production in the United States and the decrease in demand from Chinese consumers. Thus, for the second year in a row, the American oil industry demonstrated a record increase in black gold production by 2% to 13.2 million barrels per day. At the same time, China reduced its oil consumption by 10%, which made it possible to reduce the growth rate of global demand to 1%, compared to the previous year. In addition, the Chinese market reduced its consumption of Russian oil by 7%, replacing it with black gold from Saudi Arabia. This trend occurred due to the increase in the cost of delivery of Russian raw materials against the background of sanctions, which are not enough to bleed the aggressor's economy, which mostly sells its black gold on the markets of China and India. Unfortunately, during 2024, the aggressor managed to export about 4.8 million barrels of oil worth $320 million. Taking into account the current level of activity on the oil market, in 2025 we should expect a further increase in the production of black gold to 104.5 million barrels per day. Taking into account such a forecast, it is possible that there will be a surplus of oil supply in the global dimension next year. At the same time, it is worth paying attention to the indicators of the enemy's oil production industry and not to allow violations of international law, in particular, UN Resolution No. 2375 of September 11, 2017, which imposes a ban on the supply of oil and petroleum products to North Korea. Global demand for natural gas grew by 2.4% during 2024 and returned to pre-pandemic levels. At the same time, the driving force behind growth was the Asia-Pacific region and liquefied natural gas, the market share of which increased to 40%. Notably, Qatar, the United States, and Australia remain the leaders in the supply of liquefied natural gas, while the EU and Asia remain key sales markets. At the same time, there is a rather dangerous tendency for the aggressor to increase gas production, by more than 9%, compared to the indicators of the previous year. At the same time, in the next year, the aggressor may increase the production of liquefied natural gas to 40 million tons, which once again indicates the urgent need to introduce new sanctions. This trend is connected with Russia's attempt to increase natural gas supplies to China. At the same time, total Russian gas exports to the EU by all routes rose to 32 billion cubic meters, down from 28.3 billion cubic meters in 2023, falling to the lowest level since the 1970s. Despite this growth, the volume of Russian gas supplies to Europe remains significantly lower than in previous years. For comparison, in 2018-2019, the annual flow of gas to Europe reached 175 to 180 billion cubic meters. The global coal market in 2024 was characterized by stable supply and demand, but consumption remained at the level of the previous year, amounting to approximately 8.7 billion tons, which contributed to a record increase in street carbon dioxide emissions to the level of 41.6 billion metric tones. At the same time, the Russian coal industry faced serious financial difficulties in 2024, which was reflected in its main indicators. First of all, the aggressor reduced the volume of coal production by 4.4% in annual terms, which determined the decrease in export supplies and the loss of sales markets. For example, one of the largest importers of Russian coal in Taiwan, Taiwan Cement Corporation (TCC), completely stopped cooperation with the aggressor. Overall, the income of the Russian coal industry fell by 97%, and the vast majority of mining companies suffered losses. Concluding the resources section, it is worth paying attention to the mining of uranium and the production of nuclear fuel from the overview of the development of low-carbon energy sources. In the current year, there was a 3% increase in the volume of uranium mining to the level of 50,000. tons Despite the fact that Kazakhstan is the largest producer of uranium, the aggressor continues to control more than 40% of the world's uranium enrichment. In the next year, Russia's share in this segment may decrease due to the development of its own capacities in the USA and the EU, as well as the attraction of investments in fields in Canada and Namibia. In the past year, many significant infrastructure projects in the energy sector were implemented, which affected global energy and contributed to the development of sustainable energy systems in the world, in particular: 1. Projects in the field of low-carbon, renewable and hydrogen energy. 2. Network integration and infrastructure of liquefied natural gas 3. Energy storage and reduction of carbon dioxide emissions As we can see, in 2024, the implementation of large-scale energy projects around the world demonstrated the growing interest in sustainable, integrated and decarbonized energy. These initiatives have significantly strengthened the position of renewable energy sources, liquefied natural gas, hydrogen and innovative technologies in the global energy system. Speaking of quotations on the global oil market, during 2024 there was a tendency for the price to decrease, for example, at the beginning of January one barrel of Brent was sold for $76.3, and at the end of December it was 3% less. Taking into account the forecast for the growth of oil production in 2025, it is possible to assume a further decrease in quotations to the level of 65 dollars per barrel. The opposite is the case with natural gas prices. In 2024, natural gas prices in Asia and North America have risen by nearly 50% and look set to continue rising in the first quarter of next year due to active storage depletion. At the same time, the level of liquefied gas price growth will be determined by seasonal demand and storage capacity. In 2024, coal prices remained relatively stable. For example, in Australia, prices remained at the level of about $203 per ton. The price situation on the global market of primary energy carriers led to the fact that during the current year the electricity market in the European Union underwent the following changes. First, after significant price volatility in the previous two years, electricity prices have declined in 2024 due to stable gas supplies, full gas storage facilities and favorable weather conditions. Thus, in Germany, France, Italy and Spain, average electricity prices were 30-40% lower than in 2023. This trend, in particular, was influenced by the slowdown in the economic growth of the EU, for example, the demand for electricity decreased by 5%. Second, the share of renewable energy sources (wind, solar, hydro and bioenergy) has exceeded 50% in many EU countries, including Germany, Spain and Denmark. This was also facilitated by a new investment-attractive pricing model for energy produced from alternative sources. This approach has created the conditions under which the European Union has completed large-scale investment projects in solar energy, providing more than 50% of electricity generation from RES in many member states. Actually, such changes affected the fact that the average price of electricity in the EU for household consumers during the current year was about 12.67 hryvnias/kWh, which is equivalent to approximately 0.29 euros/kWh at the exchange rate of 43.85 hryvnias for 1 euro . Despite the development of network infrastructure and the decentralization of power systems, blackouts have occurred in various parts of the world this year. The most common cause is natural disasters, in particular In the United States, powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico region caused damage to energy infrastructure, especially in the states of Louisiana and Texas. At the same time, in Southeast Asia, typhoons caused power outages in the Philippines and Vietnam. The stability of energy supply this year has been affected by extreme heat, for example in the EU and Asia, abnormal heat waves led to an increase in electricity consumption for air conditioning, which caused local blackouts in Italy, France and India. Secondly, the short-term disconnection of consumers from electricity was caused by cyber-attacks, for example in the USA there were outages due to external influences on the IT infrastructure of electricity grid operators. Third, technical failure and wear and tear of networks. For example, the Republic of South Africa continued to suffer from large-scale blackouts due to the failure of the state-owned energy company Eskom to ensure stable grid operation. Periodic -load-shedding- (planned outages) have become part of everyday life. A similar situation took place in Pakistan, in early 2024, a large-scale failure in the national power grid left more than 200 million people without electricity. The stability of energy networks was also affected by the sufficiency of primary energy carriers, for example, in Cuba there was an energy crisis due to a lack of fuel and wear and tear of thermal power plant nodes. Fourth, military conflicts. One such example, the escalation of conflicts in the Middle East region has affected the power systems of Syria, Lebanon and, in part, Israel, causing power outages. Fifth, high demand and unpreparedness for a full energy transition from fossil to renewable energy sources. In the first quarter of 2024, cold weather and delays in renewable energy sources (such as insufficient wind for wind farms) caused short-term blackouts in selected regions such as Germany and Poland. In the past year, Russia has continued to commit war crimes, having carried out 13 massive attacks on energy infrastructure facilities in Ukraine. According to various calculations, the enemy used more than 1,200 rockets to carry out these crimes alone, causing damages of $56.2 billion. One of the largest attacks occurred on August 26, 2024, when the aggressor used 236 drones and missiles. In general, the Kremlin's war crimes against the energy infrastructure of Ukraine were aimed at creating a humanitarian crisis, undermining the economy and reducing the defense capability of our state. Despite these actions, thanks to international support, the prompt restoration of damaged facilities and the resilience of fellow citizens, Ukraine's energy system continues to function even in the face of large-scale challenges. Russian war crimes must be condemned both at the international (International Criminal Court, UN International Court of Justice, European Court of Human Rights) and national levels. In the next year, the sanctions pressure on the aggressor should be significantly increased for several reasons. First of all, the aggressor is the biggest threat to global energy security, as in particular it actively uses sophisticated schemes of transshipment of oil at sea, -shadow flotillas- and hides the final destination of cargoes to avoid sanctions. However, unfortunately, not all countries or companies comply with the sanctions due to difficulties in verifying supply chains and a lack of strict controls. Along with this, China, India, Turkey and other countries of the Global South have not joined the sanctions regime and are taking advantage of reduced prices for Russian resources, providing the aggressor with financial opportunities for a war against the democratic world. It is clear that there is insufficient pressure associated with Russia's adaptation to sanctions and the lack of a unified global approach to countering its energy expansion. Increased control and the establishment of secondary measures of influence on companies and countries that help the aggressor to circumvent restrictions can increase the effectiveness of sanctions. In addition, in the next year, the role of the aggressor in the energy security of the world should be reduced, in particular by imposing sanctions and introducing new political restrictions on the nuclear fuel market. Energy security in 2025 will remain a multidimensional challenge and will depend on geopolitical stability, adaptation to climate change and the pace of innovation. Countries investing in the diversification of energy sources, decarbonization and strengthening of infrastructure will have an advantage in ensuring the stability of energy supply. 1. Reducing dependence on fossil fuels, increasing the role of nuclear energy. 2. Intensification of competition for resources 3. Diversification of energy supply and infrastructure development. 4. Digitization of the energy industry. 5. Environmental policy.

- Occupant cutter - near Kurakhov: ArmyInform report from the position of one unit of drones	Correspondents of ArmiyaInform managed to get to the positions of one of the units of FPV drones of the 148th separate artillery brigade of the Zhytomyr DSHV of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and record one day of heavy combat work of our drones. Get to the positions in the Kurakhovo district &#8211; it is always risky and dangerous. Night, the moon in the sky is breaking through the clouds, our car is moving towards the front line, the rumble of explosions is getting louder. We leave the car in the -hideout- and get into the unit's pickup, which is equipped with a REBU device. It has begun to dawn a little, the traditional -sirak- is the safest time to leave. We drive on broken roads. The paratrooper-driver begins to turn on the red switches one by one. This is REB, because where we are going, there is, unfortunately, a lot of enemy deadly debris flying. A settlement can be seen on the horizon. We drive closer, the picture is depressing: everywhere destroyed houses, torn down fences, cut with splinters of wood, in a word all around -complete desolation-. Let's go further. We stop near the plantation, the car leaves us while it is still dark, and we quickly go to the dugout, which is well camouflaged from the outside. A few steps underground, then the door, and the positions of our drones are hidden there. From here, it is only a few kilometers to reach the Katsap troops. In the dugout, everything is arranged so that our guys have work as comfortably as possible. Excavated room 3 by 4 m: operator area (pilot and gunner), place of miner who charges drones with ammunition and place for coffee break. There is a narrow passage between the self-made work table and the couch, there is also a small bench, and the ammunition boxes are used as chests. In general, everything here is very practical and ascetic. There are no extra things, only things that will definitely come in handy for the boys. -The days when you could drive a car along the -front- are long gone. Now the drones are hunting a single rashist and he cannot evade, &#8211; says Yuriy, the commander of the FPV-drone unit with the call sign -Sparta-. &#8211; Look here (Yuri shows a video on a smartphone - author): this is video evidence from the front, where our crew attacks the invaders in the middle of the field, under trees, in houses, now you can get the enemy almost everywhere. The occupiers will not hide anywhere from us. On the right in the dugout we see already charged drones standing ready. The boys prepare them in advance. The military uses FPV drones as a kamikaze drone with various combat parts and to drop ammunition on the enemy with the subsequent return of the drone. For each target there is a drop: there are shrapnel (grenades or other explosive surprises) for enemy manpower , -cumulatives-, incendiary ammunition and -bombs- for enemy equipment and defensive fortifications. Weather conditions significantly affect the operation of drones: cold, rain or strong wind make flights difficult. The duty of the UAV operator is to be ready for such tests. Regarding the tactics of the Russian Federation in the Kurakhiv direction. The enemy attacks both in small infantry groups, and in some places uses BMP, armored personnel carriers, motorcycles, buggies. The guys say: armored vehicles are mostly used at a considerable distance from the battle line, for logistics or rotations. The enemy is trying to quickly drop the landing party and escape from the affected area. But our drones get the Rashists there too. Each meter of the enemy's advance is very expensive. Usually ordinary Russian infantrymen go on assaults. This is the tactic of -bloody collective suicides.- Using the topography of the area, the invaders advance in small groups of 5-8 people. Armed only with assault rifles, another group of Rashists is already 50-60 meters behind them. They carry BC, some have machine guns, they are accompanied by drones. So, the first group of -suicides- lands on Ukrainian soil almost immediately. Our FPV drones instantly destroy the bodies of Muscovites. Then other rashists climb over their corpses. The picture is almost the same, the occupiers are also destroyed. Some try to escape from our drones, but they don't succeed for long. Small enemy assault groups especially try to infiltrate in the morning &#8211; -gray- when the weather is foggy. That's when our reconnaissance drones can't always work effectively. -Sometimes one gets the impression that the occupiers are high. They do not pay attention to our resets, move chaotically, but continue to break through to our positions. There are days when the enemy moves without stopping and suffers simply incredible losses. Once we destroyed up to 80 rashists in one full day of combat work. Perhaps there were more of them, of course, no one counted them. The human resource of the Russian Federation is unlimited. People are just meat for the Kremlin and there is no such price that the Russian people would not pay for the destruction of Ukraine. Rashists will continue to climb, and we have to stop them,- &#8211; says the commander of the unit Yuriy. Yuriy from Volyn, former commander of the BM-21 -Grad-. Since the beginning of the large-scale invasion, the Russian Federation mobilized the 95th separate assault-assault Polish brigade. He was the commander of an airborne assault unit, he was seriously wounded in battle. It happened in the Izyum direction in the village of Dovgenke during an enemy assault. The shrapnel tore the back and arm, severed the nerves in the arm and the arm did not work normally. He underwent treatment and rehabilitation, according to the conclusion of the VLK, he could receive a disability group. But he refused to undergo MSEK. The man says: -I will beat the occupiers until Victory.- He was an instructor in the 95th brigade, then transferred to the rocket artillery unit of the 148th artillery brigade. They carried out combat missions in the Zaporozhye direction. Somehow, for almost a week, the -Grad- of paratroopers did not go into combat, then Yuriy was asked to become the driver of the UAV unit for that time. -. I tried it, it went in and started working on -maviks-. He studied on the go, -on combat-. There was reconnaissance all the time in Zaporozhye, we worked without resets, there were quite intense actions, storming of enemy positions, there were a lot of flights in a day. And when they moved to the Donetsk direction, they began to work against the enemy already with discounts. Then switched to an FPV drone and never regretted it. There is more emotion and drive here,- &#8211; says Yuri -Sparta-. ...Finally dawn, combat work begins. The boys are told by walkie-talkie that the Russian infantry is advancing, supported by tanks and armored vehicles. Commander Yuri commands -before the battle.- Everyone takes their position. -Sparta- works as an operator, takes the control panel, puts on glasses, and the gunner -Tarantino- instantly fills in the coordinates of the target on the tablet, displays the video broadcast on the monitor, makes a report on readiness for departure. Miner Yevgeny on the call sign -Johnny - with a drone, which is equipped with ammunition, comes out of the shelter, puts the -bird- in position. He removes the fuse, and not a few minutes pass as the drone flies into the sky to bring justice to the occupiers. By the way, -Johnny- worked as a driver of the Kyiv subway until February 24, 2022. On the first day of the invasion, I took the minibus to work from Vasylkovo to Kyiv as usual. The metro has been working since 2010. It is very interesting to watch the work of the crew, they act as one mechanism, guide the drone to the target. After a few minutes, we can already see the plantation. An enemy tank was lurking 7-8 kilometers away, and it is the goal of the operation. As it turned out, the EW works on it, this is a problem, the connection is lost for a few seconds, the screen flickers, the video from the drone has disappeared. for afforestation. The guys managed to set up the broadcast quickly. The barely noticeable movements of the pilot's fingers are conjuring over the drone control panel, the tension on Sparta's face is clear, we can see the next maneuver to defeat. -Fpvishka- flies to the tank. Boom! The video has disappeared, and we are all overjoyed. The commander gives the command - -launch the next drone.- It is necessary to check whether the enemy tank is on fire. A few minutes later, on video, we see the Katsap tank on fire. And this means that the work was carried out meticulously. -We were lucky today. Usually, we spend more time and drones on such a -fat- target as a tank,- &#8211; says -Sparta-. We ask: how many attacks by drones on the enemy can usually be made in a working day? -It depends on the actions of the enemy. If there are assaults, we can make up to 20 sorties. The other day, during the Russian offensive, there were 19 sorties in one day. When needed, drones are brought to us additionally, there is no such thing as a lack of drones, we always have enough and that makes me happy. After defeating the equipment, we can burn one unit of the enemy's combat equipment in one day of work, sometimes we manage to destroy 3-5 units. It depends primarily on the work of their REB. And it is possible not to impress anything in terms of technique. Then we work in small assault groups,- &#8211; notes the gunner of the FPV drone -Tarantino-. Russians actively use EW tools to suppress the operation of our drones. We do the same. The -combat of frequencies- occurs constantly. During flights, we try to quickly switch to other frequencies when we see that the enemy is suppressing our -video picture-. Of course, there are -own chips- that the enemy does not know about. This helps us a lot in destroying racist targets. In general, shooting down an FPV drone with small arms is extremely unlikely, it is very maneuverable. It is also important not to -burn- your positions. Drone crew for the occupiers &#8211; priority goal. He is constantly looking for our location. As we are theirs. Somehow, one of our points was -burned- by the Rashisti, and we were then covered with artillery for more than 5 hours. They started around 11:30 a.m. and finished around 5:00 p.m. They fired cannons, covered with mortar fire, even the tank was working. Fortunately, the shells landed next to the dugout. Survived We waited until it got a little dark, collected all the things, the car arrived and we quickly left the position,- &#8211; the guys say. We ask: how often do you have to change positions? -During this month, we moved a lot. It all also depends on the intensity of the enemy's assault actions. In autumn, for example, we worked at one point for more than a month,- &#8211; says -Tarantino-. … Evening. We say goodbye to the boys and leave the positions of our drones -in the dark- in cars. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/01/okupantoriz-pid-kurahovym-reportazh-armiyainform-z-pozycziyi-odnogo-pidrozdilu-dronariv/	2024-12-31T20:55:18-08:00
Armored vehicle of a united Europe: what is known about the project of a joint system of armored veh...	As reported by portal of German broadcaster Deutsche Welle (DW), four EU member states - Finland, Latvia, Sweden and Germany, will implement the project on the common system of armored vehicles (Common Armored Vehicle System, CAVS) - the purchase of modern armored personnel carriers for the protected transportation of troops, ArmiyaInform reports. In general, as DW reporters note, the purchase of new armored personnel carriers for the armies of the above-mentioned EU countries is part of a large defense project implemented within the framework of the European Instrument for Strengthening the Defense Industry through Joint Procurement (EDIRPA). The EDIRPA program is a short-term instrument adopted after the start of Russia's aggression against Ukraine and designed for the period until 2025 with the aim of stimulating cooperation in the field of the most urgent defense goods, the EU emphasizes. -The program supports the purchase of defense equipment by the armed forces of EU member states and Norway. The EDIRPA budget does not pay for defense products, but compensates member states for additional administrative costs associated with joint procurement,- stated in the notification of the European Commission. As for the direct implementation of the armored vehicle project within the CAVS (Common Armored Vehicle System), according to the experts of the defense site Army Recognition it is aimed at supporting the joint acquisition of modern 6x6 armored vehicles as part of a multinational program for the development, procurement and life cycle management of modern armored vehicles. This project builds on the similar capacity needs of participating states, thus creating a basis for enhanced cooperation and added value. The CAVS program has already activated serial production of 6×6 wheeled armored vehicles in Europe and continues to build production capacity on the continent. The project is directly supported by four organizations from EU member states: the Defense Forces of Finland, the Ministry of Defense of Latvia, the Swedish Defense Assets Administration and the German Bundeswehr. The initiative receives a maximum EU contribution of €60 million under the EDIRPA instrument for 2024. The main goal of the CAVS project is to develop and produce a common armored vehicle optimized for protected troop transport that meets the diverse operational needs of participating nations. This machine will integrate advanced technologies to provide reliable protection against ballistic threats, mines and improvised explosive devices (IEDs). Its modular design will allow the vehicle to be adapted for various tasks, such as troop transport, medical evacuation, logistical support, reconnaissance and combat operations. In addition, its high mobility, which is ensured by a design adapted to difficult terrains and optimized off-road capabilities, will ensure high autonomy of the BBM in difficult conditions. The CAVS project also aims to promote a standardization approach that will reduce the current fragmentation of military equipment in the European Union. By opting for a shared vehicle, participating states will benefit from economies of scale through centralized production and coordinated maintenance. This standardization will also contribute to increased interoperability between the armed forces of different countries, facilitating joint operations and materiel exchange. In addition, the project will support the European defense industry by promoting the development and production of the vehicle in the EU, thus contributing to the strengthening of Europe's autonomy in this strategic area. The development of CAVS is also consistent with the broader context of strengthening European strategic sovereignty, particularly highlighted by geopolitical tensions related to Russia's aggression against Ukraine. This large-scale invasion highlighted the need to modernize the EU's military capabilities and reduce its dependence on external suppliers. It is within this dynamic that the EU has decided to invest heavily in projects such as CAVS, symbolizing a commitment to strengthening collective defense capabilities while defending sovereignty in the face of external challenges. Once developed and deployed, the CAVS armored vehicle will not only enhance the operational capabilities of the four member states, but will also create a common standard for future cooperation between EU member states. This project is a key step towards a more integrated and sustainable European defense capable of addressing current and future strategic challenges in a coherent and coordinated manner. As part of the international Common Armored Vehicles System (CAVS) program, the Finnish defense company Patria, about whose armored wheeled products our editors repeatedly told in its materials, will be the main contractor if Germany decides to buy machines from this manufacturer. Patria will lead the design and development of the system, while DSL in Freizen and FFG at its units in Flensburg (FFG) and Kirchen (JWT) will provide local design, manufacturing and life cycle support in Germany. Along with the start of more detailed preparations for localization, the production team will also involve other German companies to work on the program. It is interesting that the machine developed under the CAVS project can be based on a proven platform such as Patria 6×6, which is already used by several European armies. This armored vehicle, produced by the Finnish company Patria, is known for its reliability, modularity and ability to perform a wide range of tasks, making it the ideal basis for a European standardization project. The Patria 6×6 provides excellent protection against ballistic threats and mines, while being able to overcome difficult terrain thanks to its independent suspension and high off-road mobility. In addition, its modularity allows the vehicle to be easily adapted for different tasks, such as troop transport, armored ambulance, or even configurations for command or reconnaissance missions. By choosing an already proven and widely used platform, the EU could accelerate CAVS development using existing technology and materiel, thus easing the transition to a common armored vehicle for its armed forces. The goal of the CAVS program is to develop a 6×6 armored system to meet the needs of participating nations. Sweden joined the CAVS program in 2022, followed by Germany in 2023. Finland has ordered 164 armored personnel carriers (APCs) under the project, and also signed an agreement on vehicles HAPC (Heavy Armored Personnel Carrier), intended for crisis management situations Latvia, which has participated in the program since its inception, has ordered more than 200 APCs and recently signed a contract for 56 C2 vehicles (Patria 6×6 command-and-control). Last spring, Sweden signed an agreement to supply a total of 321 CAVS armored vehicles. Patria 6×6 stands out for its modularity, which allows it to be adapted to various military and security tasks. It can be configured for troop transport, designed to accommodate 10 fully equipped soldiers, or for medical evacuation via an ambulance module equipped with stretchers and patient stabilization equipment. The BBM can also serve as a mobile command post, combining advanced communications systems and workstations for strategic operations. Performing the role of logistical support, it can transport up to 8.5 thousand kg of equipment with the possibility of integrating a transport crane. To perform combat missions, it can be equipped with a remotely controlled turret, anti-tank missiles or air defense systems. Its reconnaissance capabilities include optical and infrared sensors, surveillance radars and even airborne tactical drones. Finally, technical support configurations allow for maintenance and towing of damaged vehicles. This versatility makes the Patria 6×6 an essential platform to meet the diverse needs of European armed forces while increasing interoperability and effectiveness.

Autocivilka for UBD: what will change in 2025	If previously combatants were exempted from mandatory civil liability insurance, then from now on you need to issue a civil liability insurance. In particular, Article 13 of the Law suffered certain changes. And now there are no categories of citizens who are exempt from compulsory insurance. In return, combatants will receive a discount. In particular, for them, -the amount of the insurance premium under the domestic insurance contract is reduced by 50 percent.- But there are also certain nuances. The discount is provided for a vehicle that has an engine displacement of up to 2500 cubic centimeters or an electric motor power of up to and including 100 kilowatts and is owned by a combatant /strong>, provided that such vehicle is driven exclusively by the insured or by a person who also owns to preferential categories, and using a vehicle without the purpose of providing paid services for the transportation of passengers and/or cargo. Another important nuance — the amendments to the Law indicate that the reduction of the insurance premium can be applied simultaneously only regarding one vehicle of the insured.

Liquidation of MSEK: How a serviceman can get the status of a person with a disability in 2025	In Ukraine, there are no more medical and social expert commissions (MSEK) that established disability statuses. In their place, expert teams will work to assess the daily functioning of a person, created at health care institutions. The Ministry of Health notes that the path to disability status will be much easier for a person, as most processes will be shortened and digitized. And all evaluation stages will be recorded in the electronic system. And what will change for the military? ArmyInform tells what military personnel must do to obtain the status of a person with a disability. And also who needs to be re-evaluated. If an injury or illness significantly limits the functioning of a serviceman, he may be referred to a facility with expert teams to assess daily functioning, clarifies the Ministry of Health. This can be done by the attending physician or the head of the VLK. At the same time, there is no need to wait 120 days from the moment of injury. After stabilization of the serviceman's state of health, the head of the VLK has the opportunity to immediately form an electronic referral for the assessment of daily functioning. The evaluation is carried out by an expert team of doctors who specialize in determining the degree of limitation of a person's functioning due to injuries or diseases. The expert team works on the basis of multidisciplinary healthcare institutions. The doctor and the serviceman can choose a medical facility together from the list available in the electronic system for daily functioning assessment. The choice depends on the serviceman's place of stay, as well as the chosen form of evaluation: The evaluation of daily functioning must be carried out within up to 30 days from the moment of submission of the electronic referral by the head of the VLK. The administrator of the health care facility where the expert team works must review the submitted case within 5 days from the moment of receiving the referral to either put the case in the queue and the system will determine the date and time of the evaluation, or return the case for revision due to inaccuracies. If the case is added to the queue, the serviceman will receive a notification via e-mail (his or a representative's e-mail) about the form, time and place of the assessment. If there is no e-mail, the information will be sent by registered mail to the military serviceman's physical address. The expert team analyzes the documents, and in the case of face-to-face, remote or on-site assessment, conducts an additional review or examination. Attention is paid to the degree of functional impairment, the impact of the injury or disease on daily activities, as well as the need for social support or rehabilitation. Based on the obtained results, the expert team must make a decision on the establishment of disability, determine the terms of re-evaluation (if necessary), and must provide recommendations for rehabilitation. The decision will be entered into the electronic system, and the serviceman will receive a copy of it by e-mail or, if necessary, in printed form. The document will also be available in the electronic office of the referring physician for evaluation. All data will be transferred to social security authorities responsible for further assistance. On the basis of the adopted decision, the serviceman may: The serviceman may appeal the decision of the expert team. To do this, you need to submit a complaint to the Center for Assessing the Functional State of a Person. Considering the large number of fakes of enemy propaganda, in particular, that from January 1, people with disabilities will be mobilized due to the fact that MSEKs were liquidated, and instead special commissions will cancel previously received statuses, the Ministry of Health emphasizes: -all people who have the status of disability continue to receive benefits, services, assistance and, in particular, deferment from mobilization, on the basis of the conclusion of the SCEC during its period of validity-. The Ministry of Health also clarified who and when should undergo repeated examinations: 1) all those who have limitations in daily functioning, i.e. legal grounds for the status of disability, will be evaluated by an expert team of medical practitioners within the prescribed period; 2) if the disability is established indefinitely, it is not necessary to pass the assessment, only at your own request: all benefits, guarantees and payments remain in force; 3) if a person during the years 2022-2024 had to undergo a re-examination, but could not undergo it for good reasons and in accordance with the exceptions provided for in the legislation during the martial law, then it will be necessary to undergo it: men aged 25-60 from 2 or 3 by the disability group - until November 1, 2025; to all other patients by April 1, 2026. Exceptions are the impossibility of re-examination for the following reasons: people are in hostilities or temporarily occupied territories; patients with severe disorders of body functions (do not have a limb or any of the paired organs, cannot hear or see, have an oncological or mental illness); active servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and other military formations - for them, the disability status remains valid during the period of military service and within 60 days from the date of discharge from service.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/01/likvidacziya-msek-yak-vijskovosluzhbovczyu-otrymaty-status-lyudyny-z-invalidnistyu-v-2025-roczi/	2024-12-31T20:12:46-08:00
Propagandists cry about the flow of refugees from Ukraine: the border guards reassure	The border guards reassure: there is no outflow from Ukraine, the usual Christmas and New Year traffic. The border service of Poland recorded the traditional increase in traffic, which occurs every year during the New Year holidays, said the spokesman of the -Richka Bug- border unit Dariusz Senicki, who quotes edition PAP. The highest traffic on the Polish-Ukrainian border is usually recorded in the summer, when Ukrainians travel through Poland on vacation, and also during Christmas, when many Ukrainians return to their families in Ukraine. Since December 20, longer queues than usual began to form at the border with Ukraine, but traffic is evenly distributed in both directions, with a predominance of departures from Poland. The peak day was December 22, when almost 89,000 Ukrainian citizens crossed the Polish-Ukrainian border, but most of them, almost 49,000, left Poland. The spokesman emphasizes that the figure of 150,000 citizens of Ukraine, who allegedly want to enter Poland, has not been recorded at the border for a single day. So the report about the so-called -escape of Ukrainians- is a deliberate misinformation of the Kremlin, which serves to incite panic in Ukraine and anti-Ukrainian sentiment among Poles.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2025/01/01/propagandysty-volayut-pro-potik-bizhencziv-z-ukrayiny-prykordonnyky-zaspokoyuyut/	2024-12-31T20:00:04-08:00
Rustem Umyerov: 2024 was full of challenges, but at the same time it showed how strong we are	ArmyInform provides the full text of the greeting. -Dear Ukrainians! 2024 was full of challenges, but at the same time it showed how strong we are. Together we have come a long way and achieved significant success. We have moved the hostilities to the territory of the enemy, and the long-range operations of Ukrainian drones reach the most distant points of the aggressor country. We have prepared a Victory Plan and have a clear understanding of what needs to be done together with our partners to achieve success. This year, Ukraine laid the foundation for the creation of the army of the future — Future Force. In cooperation with partners, we have built 8 coalitions of capabilities to support our state. This format of working with allies this year ensured a significant strengthening of our army, in particular, in aviation. F16s in Ukrainian skies are already successfully attacking the enemy and repelling enemy missiles. The next step is the French Mirage in Ukraine. We have moved to long-term planning for years ahead to strengthen our power on land, sea and air. It is important that working in coalitions strengthens Ukraine's compatibility with NATO and brings us closer to membership in the Alliance. We launched the process of digitalization of the Defense Forces, so that our army would be even more effective, and state structures would be faster and more transparent. Army+, Reserve+, our Ukrainian Delta have already become revolutionary products in the world. Ukraine attracted record financing for its own defense production - more than 5 billion dollars. The result of the rapid development of domestic industry is drones and missiles that are already hitting targets thousands of kilometers from our border. We have produced and delivered more than 1.5 million drones to our soldiers. Through joint efforts with our allies, we have systematically strengthened our defense capabilities. We attracted 10 countries to finance the Ukrainian defense industry, now it is more than 2.6 billion dollars for 2024 and 2025. And this number is constantly growing, and the number of partners is increasing. In the state budget for defense in 2025, the government laid down a whopping 2.23 trillion hryvnias. These funds will be fully directed to the support of our soldiers and the development of the Defense Forces. We will spend UAH 739 billion on the purchase of weapons and military equipment, and another UAH 55 billion on the modernization of Ukrainian industry. We aim to make the budget for next year a budget for changes on the battlefield. I sincerely thank our military, volunteers, medics, engineers - everyone who is working to defeat the Russian invaders. Eternal memory to the heroes who paid the highest price for the freedom of Ukraine. We do not forget those who meet the new year in occupation and in captivity. We will make every effort to free everyone from Russian oppression. May the new year be bright for all of Ukraine.

The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces congratulated the soldiers on the New Year: Thanks to you...	ArmyInform provides the full text of the greeting. -Dear brothers-in-arms and sisters-in-arms! Happy New Year 2025! Thank you for this year of fierce and uncompromising struggle! And thank you for the independence of Ukraine, which we preserve thanks to your strength. The eleventh year of Russian aggression against Ukraine is coming to an end. And for the third year, Russian troops tried to -take Kyiv in three days-, and some already wanted to see Ukraine erased from the political map of the world, and our people - destroyed. All of them underestimated the strength of Ukrainians — our heroic people, of whom one can only be proud. In 2024, we managed to stop the enemy's offensive in Kharkiv Oblast and protect Sumy Oblast from capture. The enemy wanted to create his -buffer zone- on our land, but we prevented this and began to return the war to where it came from - to Russian territory. I want to especially mention all our units, all our soldiers who perform combat tasks in Kurshchyna: guys, thank you! Thank you to everyone who fights in the most brutal areas of Donetsk region, to everyone who defends Zaporizhzhia and Kherson region. Thank you to each of our soldiers who destroys the occupier and chooses life for Ukraine. This year, the Russians paid the highest price for the war against Ukraine, because our army and all our Defense and Security Forces of Ukraine destroyed more enemy equipment and manpower than in any of the previous years of the war. We defend our state. Ukraine must preserve its life and independence. And win an honest peace for yourself. What Ukraine definitely deserves. We will never forget all our boys, all girls, each and every one who gave his life for the sake of Ukraine. I bow my head, honoring every warrior, every fallen hero. War dictates its difficult realities. But YOU, Ukrainian soldiers, YOUR bravery and resilience inspire all our Ukrainian people and fill the hearts of Ukrainians with faith. We have to win. We must preserve Ukraine and independence. Let 2025 be the time to realize our goal. I wish all our soldiers and their relatives health, warmth, comfort and a quick meeting — at home, with victory and in peace. Happy New Year! Glory to Ukraine!-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/31/golovnokomanduvach-zsu-pryvitav-voyiniv-z-novym-rokom-zavdyaky-vashij-syli-zberigayemo-nezalezhnist-ukrayiny/	2024-12-31T11:28:23-08:00

This was reported by /a> Deputy Minister of Defense for Digitization Kateryna Chernogorenko In this way, she commented on the changes, which provide for the simplification of the mechanism of obtaining officer ranks for soldiers and sergeants with combat experience.

Many strong specialists were mobilized to the army. After vast experience in management positions. After dozens of implemented projects. Previously, without an officer's education, they could only hold soldier positions. We must replenish the army with professional personnel and give managers with great experience all the opportunities for development.

Colombian-style action: a report from Donetsk region about the training of foreign volunteers	ArmyInform visited the training of foreign volunteers in one of the front-line cities in Donetsk region. What we see in the empty dilapidated building, which was once a multi-story building, resembles the shooting of an action episode of an expensive Hollywood blockbuster about special forces. Silhouettes of fighters with weapons at the ready emerge from the empty window openings of the building, which is divided into numerous rooms and corridors. Shouts in Spanish and simulated gunshots are heard. From time to time, the soldiers, at the command of the instructor, stop and listen to the remarks. After that, they change roles and return to their starting positions to play the scene, that is, to practice the exercise again. Instructor -Hulk- acts like an experienced director, repeating the same scene take after take to get it as close as possible to the ideal. The movements of the fighting actors are precise and lightning-fast, but he notices flaws and demands perfection. — We work out the approach to the house, cleaning the building, moving, -cutting- corners with a change of hands. That is, we go to the right corner, to the left corner and enter so that the enemy does not notice you, but you see him first, he explains. Moving through the building, the fighters seem to -fence- with automatic weapons, covering corners and quickly changing hands on the pistol grip and forend. Those waiting for them in the next room do not see the threat until a conditional shot is fired. This means that the enemy is destroyed before he had time to react in any way to the coordinated actions of the fighters. After that, the -actors- change roles and -play the scene- again - the repetition continues several times. — When you approach one corner and are comfortable from the left, the machine shifts to the left shoulder. When we need to clear another corner, we transfer the machine gun to the right shoulder, -Hulk- explains the essence of the exercise. He praises the foreign fighters, saying that they are motivated and responsible, ready to learn and want to do it, always listen carefully to the instructor and conscientiously do what is required. - Some of them have experience of military service and participation in hostilities, but for modern warfare, they are not enough, so they are constantly studying. There has never been such a war and no one has such experience, the military officer explains. The weapons of the volunteers from Colombia, who practice storming and clearing the building, are still unfamiliar to the Ukrainian eye. This is a CZ BREN 2 assault rifle, which has already proven itself as a reliable machine gun. Working with BREN 2 from Česká zbrojovka is easier and more convenient than with the usual AK-74. A high degree of modularity allows you to quickly adjust the machine to a specific fighter and task. - BREN 2 is a very good machine gun. It has been with us in the Legion since 2024 and has already proven itself to be extremely reliable and accurate. Compared to the AK-74, it is like the Mercedes of 2020 versus the Zhiguli of the 1970s. There were never any problems with it - no delays, no sticking - the instructor praises the weapon. Some of the fighters have additional front handles, sights, silencers installed. The BREN 2 makes it easy to do this, making the assault rifle even more convenient and versatile. Among the advantages of BREN 2, one can also count the caliber 5.56 × 45 mm for the standard service rifle cartridge for NATO forces. The instructor says that in a little more than a year, infantry tactics on the battlefield in urban areas have changed very significantly due to the proliferation of drop-bomber drones and kamikaze FPV drones. - They are like flies everywhere now. Therefore, the tactics of approaching the buildings, accumulating strength before the assault, have changed. If earlier it was possible to storm in eights or fours, now we act only in twos. Because where more than two fighters gather at the same time, something is guaranteed to fly, -Hulk- explains. Now, when smaller forces have to fight a more numerous, well-prepared and well-secured enemy, the level of training of fighters plays an important role. — We need to defeat a strong opponent with smaller forces. And whoever says that the Russians are stupid and do not know anything, do not understand anything, is deeply mistaken. We are fighting a very skilled enemy who learns quickly, he says. Therefore, now, he is convinced, it is necessary to learn faster and better than the enemy, to pay as much attention as possible to training. It is for this reason that when leaving their positions for rest, the fighters of the 2nd International Legion are always training, improving their skills and learning new techniques. -Hulk- tells about new methods of combating enemy drones, which have begun to be implemented in the unit and have already proven their high efficiency. — We practice working with 12-gauge, that is, with smooth-bore rifles that shoot shot. -Through trial and research, we have selected the numbers of meal that are the most effective,- says the instructor. In most cases, destroying an enemy UAV at such a distance is safe for the fighter, even if the drone explodes in the air. Therefore, the main task is to spot the enemy aircraft in time. In view of this, one of the skills that fighters practice is observing the airspace of the battlefield. — I started doing this when I was in the Serebrian Forest last winter. When a real influx of enemy drones began, something had to be done urgently about it, and there were very few anti-drone guns. Smoothbore rifles with shot became a good solution, recalls the soldier. Now he implements this experience also in the 2nd International Legion, and Colombians and other foreigners are happy to learn it. After all, constant training, training and innovation on the battlefield is the way not only to survival, but also to victory over the enemy.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/31/ekshn-po-kolumbijsky-reportazh-z-donechchyny-pro-pidgotovku-inozemnyh-dobrovolcziv/	2024-12-30T20:48:42-08:00
They will deal with it without a person: French engineers have created an unmanned all-terrain vehic...	As informs the Zone Militaire portal, the HE 441 is a small all-terrain vehicle of the Fardier/mule type (Fardier /mule, Fardier is an old French military term for a wheelbarrow used to transport heavy artillery, but this designation was later adopted in France and for all-terrain vehicles, ed.), designed according to the 4×4 scheme, which can be remotely controlled and/or move autonomously, ArmyInform notes. The key -feature- of the new machine of the company Soframe is not its high maneuverability and modular design, but the HELNA-P laser installation from Cilas, capable of shooting down fast-flying drones. In turn, the experts of the defense portal Army Recognition, who investigated the new product, claim that the HE441 off-road robot was created for the army work on various and difficult terrains, has a light but strong construction that allows it to move over uneven areas and off-road at high speeds. This mobility, combined with an open cockpit, allows the self-driving vehicle to function as a multi-purpose platform suitable for rapid deployment in high-stakes combat scenarios. The open cab layout provides flexibility, allowing operators to load the vehicle with special equipment, including weapons systems, communications or sensor arrays. With such modular upgrades, the HE441 all-terrain vehicle can be adapted to meet a wide range of defense mission requirements, from reconnaissance and troop transport to convoy protection and direct armed support. An important aspect of JNI's demonstration of the HE441 was its integration with the HELMA-P laser weapon system, an advanced anti-drone technology developed by Cilas. This laser-based anti-drone solution reflects the growing need for advanced countermeasures against the use of UAVs for surveillance, reconnaissance and even offensive attacks. Thanks to the HELMA-P system, the HE441 ground unmanned vehicle is capable of providing precise non-kinetic engagement of enemy drones, using high-energy laser beams to disable or destroy critical drone components. This allows ground forces to respond quickly to air threats without the use of conventional munitions, making the system cost-effective and sustainable for long-term operations. Thanks to the high-energy HELMA-P device, the ground robot HE441 turns into a mobile defense vehicle that moves. This mobility is critical because it allows infantry units to carry anti-drone equipment wherever they go, rather than relying on fixed or stationary air defense systems. Traditional anti-aircraft measures may be limited against small, fast-moving drones. And HELMA-P's fast laser targeting closes this gap, neutralizing drones silently and with minimal collateral damage. This silent strike capability is especially valuable for infantry and reconnaissance teams operating in sensitive areas where stealth is essential. The peculiar symbiosis of the HE441 unmanned mobile platform and the high-energy HELMA-P system represents a significant advance in modern combat readiness. Their combination offers a tailored solution to the rapidly changing threats faced by military forces, especially as drones become increasingly common in combat arsenals. For infantry units, the ability to move with a mobile anti-drone solution increases both security and operational flexibility, as they can respond to enemy UAVs in real-time without the delays or limitations of traditional stationary defenses. This combination is also economical. Unlike projectile-based anti-drone systems, which can incur significant costs due to ammunition consumption, the laser-based HELMA-P can neutralize multiple kamikaze drone threats with minimal resource expenditure. This system is designed not only for current needs on the battlefield, but also to adapt to the rapidly changing demands of modern warfare. HE441 tactical all-terrain drone.

The enemy is manipulating the numbers again: only the estimates are Chinese	Yes, at least since April 2024, seemingly Chinese estimates of the losses of the Armed Forces have been roaming the Internet. The figure is estimated to be more than 1.8 million dead. However, in open sources there are no and there have never been any official comments of the PRC regarding the losses of the Defense Forces. This is an outright fake, because according to official data, the total number of military casualties of Ukraine is many times less than claimed in Russian channels. Since the first days of the war, the Kremlin has been manipulating numbers — significantly reducing its own losses and significantly exaggerating Ukraine's losses. However, no one in the world believes in any Russian statistics. That is why, in order to convince someone, Russians from time to time refer to fictitious sources from other countries.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/31/vorog-znovu-manipulyuye-czyframy-tilky-oczinky-vzhe-kytajski/	2024-12-30T20:18:21-08:00

A new wave of confiscation of civilian cars for personal use has been recorded at TOT	About this reports Center of National Resistance. Officially, cars are confiscated from offenders for their own needs. However, the enemy is actually looking for a reason to confiscate, because the road inspectorate has a plan that it is trying to carry out.

They captured eight occupiers and freed captured Ukrainians: how the Rangers stormed the Russians	informs the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine about this. -A morning that started with tension. The enemy broke through to our positions, occupied the dugout and began to entrench. The task was clear and urgent: to destroy the enemy or force him to surrender,- the statement said. The fighters, together with the platoon commander, quickly assessed the situation, determined the route and developed an assault plan. The main problem is the unknown: how many of them, what kind of weapons, are they led by drones? Therefore, they decided to act decisively and in the most coordinated manner. Scouts set off to land. Drones closely monitored the situation, and commanders adjusted actions in real time. On the approach to the dugout, the group split: the machine gunner and his partner remained in cover, the others bypassed the position from the flank. Heavy fire and grenades did their job - the enemy began to retreat in confusion. The order from the commander sounded clear: to offer the Russians to surrender. -It's always more difficult than just destroying. It is necessary to convince the enemy that surrender is the only reasonable solution,- says the platoon commander with the call sign -Groundhog-. And they gave up. However, in a moment it turned out that there were Ukrainian prisoners among them. -There was no information about who they are and how many there are. -Rangers- acted clearly: they forced the enemy to leave one by one, without weapons and armor. They counted 10 people, including ours. This created a new problem: there was not enough space in the -box- for everyone,- said the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Some of the prisoners with an escort were sent immediately, the rest were left under the guard of two soldiers. The irony of fate: I had to hide from Russian artillery fire in the same dugout that was stormed a few hours ago. The General Staff of the Armed Forces noted that the operation was completed successfully. Not one wounded among our people, two freed Ukrainians and a priceless chance to exchange prisoners. -The main thing is to save the lives of loved ones and to return home those who are waiting for freedom. At such moments, you understand that every battle is not only a struggle for positions, but also for people's destinies,- Babak concluded.

Russia's new strategy for countering extremism should divert attention from domestic problems	About this informs the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. The strategy states that threats from -radical neo-Nazi formations- are supported by external forces. The -Ukrainian crisis- is being used by -unfriendly states to launch hybrid wars against the Russian Federation and inflame aggressive Russophobic sentiments in the world.- It was determined that the elimination of threats originating from the territory of Ukraine is one of the main goals of the strategy. For the first time, the term -Russophobia- is introduced, which is defined as -an unfriendly, prejudiced, hostile attitude towards the citizens of Russia, towards the Russian language and culture-. Discriminatory actions by the authorities of -unfriendly- countries are also considered Russophobia. Among the factors of destabilization are uncoordinated protest actions that -deliberately- turn into mass riots, as well as the illegal activities of migrants and the destructive work of international non-governmental organizations. The strategy provides for prosecution of persons engaged in extremist activities (without the possibility of avoiding punishment), and keeping records of all those who travel outside Russia to participate in extremist organizations or to undergo training in -centers of unfriendly states.- As part of preventive measures, the document suggests developing migrant adaptation programs, creating patriotic social advertising for young people, publishing the consequences of violent crimes on extremist grounds, implementing the capabilities of -artificial intelligence- technology to deanonymize extremists, and also organizing -Saturdays- at the graves of World War II veterans. -svo-, the Afghan war and the war in Syria.

-I like how it burns-: arsonists who worked for FSB were arrested	notifies the Security Service of Ukraine. Thus, the occupiers remotely recruited a 22-year-old local military contractor to commit arson in the capital region. He involved two of his unemployed acquaintances in subversive activities, who hoped for quick earnings in exchange for cooperation with the aggressor. It was established that intruders set fire to two relay cabinets on railway lines that regulate the movement of trains through Kyiv region. To commit the crimes, the perpetrators purchased a flammable mixture and a screwdriver, which they used to break the doors of power plants, and then doused their technological parts with gasoline. Two more attackers were detained in Volyn when they set fire to a service car of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which was undergoing maintenance in the region after completing combat missions at the front. The detainees were an 18-year-old student of the local vocational school and his 15-year-old accomplice. During the searches, mobile phones with evidence of correspondence with the enemy and clothes in which they committed the arson were seized from the suspects. Currently, the detainees have been notified of suspicion (according to the crimes committed) under several articles of the Criminal Code of Ukraine: Criminals face from 10 years in prison to life imprisonment with confiscation of property.

The spokesman of the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, captain 3rd rank, told about this on the air of the Edyny Novyny telethon Dmytro Pletenchuk. Currently, Russian planes patrol the Black Sea and coastal waters instead of ships and boats. -Russian aviation remains active, a fairly large part of the functionality has actually been transferred to it, including from the ship and boat fleet. Airplanes patrol both the water area and the coastal zone, these issues mostly depend on aviation now,- he said. According to Dmytro Pletenchuk, such changes were caused by the destruction of several ships near the occupied Crimea during the year. As a result, the Russians were forced to leave their bases in Crimea and focus on preserving the remnants of their naval fleet.

Liquidation of MSEK: How a serviceman can get the status of a person with a disability in 2025	In their place, expert teams will work to assess the daily functioning of a person, which will be created at health care institutions. The Ministry of Health notes that the path to disability status will become much easier for a person, as most processes will be shortened and digitized. And all evaluation stages will be recorded in the electronic system. And what will change for the military? ArmyInform tells what military personnel must do to obtain the status of a person with a disability. If an injury or illness significantly limits a serviceman's functioning, he may be referred to a facility with expert teams for daily functioning assessment, explains the Ministry of Health. This can be done by the attending physician or the head of the VLK. At the same time, there is no need to wait 120 days from the moment of injury. After stabilization of the serviceman's state of health, the head of the VLK has the opportunity to immediately form an electronic referral for the assessment of daily functioning. The evaluation is carried out by an expert team of doctors who specialize in determining the degree of limitation of a person's functioning due to injuries or diseases. The expert team works on the basis of multidisciplinary healthcare facilities. The doctor and the serviceman can choose a medical facility together from the list available in the electronic system for daily functioning assessment. The choice depends on the serviceman's place of stay, as well as the chosen form of evaluation: The evaluation of daily functioning must be carried out within up to 30 days from the moment of submission of the electronic referral by the head of the VLK. The administrator of the health care facility where the expert team works must review the submitted case within 5 days from the moment of receiving the referral to either put the case in the queue and the system will determine the date and time of the evaluation, or return the case for revision due to inaccuracies. If the case is added to the queue, the serviceman will receive a notification via e-mail (his or a representative's e-mail) about the form, time and place of the assessment. If there is no e-mail, the information will be sent by registered mail to the military serviceman's physical address. The expert team analyzes the documents, and in the case of face-to-face, remote or on-site assessment, conducts an additional review or examination. Attention is paid to the degree of functional impairment, the impact of the injury or disease on daily activities, as well as the need for social support or rehabilitation. Based on the obtained results, the expert team must make a decision on the establishment of disability, determine the terms of re-evaluation (if necessary), and must provide recommendations for rehabilitation. The decision will be entered into the electronic system, and the serviceman will receive a copy of it by e-mail or, if necessary, in printed form. The document will also be available in the electronic office of the referring physician for evaluation. All data will be transferred to social security authorities responsible for further assistance. On the basis of the adopted decision, the serviceman may: The serviceman may appeal the decision of the expert team. To do this, you need to submit a complaint to the Center for Assessing the Functional State of a Person.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/30/likvidacziya-msek-yak-vijskovosluzhbovczyu-otrymaty-status-lyudyny-z-invalidnistyu-v-2025-roczi/	2024-12-29T20:53:46-08:00
300 combat and salvo to repulse the assault: the shooting intensive at Interflex continues until the...	The correspondent of ArmyInform tells about the training repulse of an enemy assault, which completes rifle training during the BZVP within the limits of the Interflex multinational training mission on the territory of Great Britain. Marksmanship training with live ammunition is the final stage of intensive training and daily intensive training during basic military training within the Interflex mission. In our case, it lasts nine days. Shootings take place in a number of locations - on a specially equipped shooting range, on a range with structures for practicing shooting from awkward positions, and in several places in the middle of forest plantations, which we would call forest plantations. In a few days, we go from conducting fire at the shooting range exclusively from stationary positions under the strict control of instructors to simulating fire contact with the enemy while patrolling and moving across the field or in wooded areas. We shoot a lot, without regretting and without counting cartridges - there are plenty of them. It is the norm, not the exception, to shoot several dozen or even more than a hundred shots in a school day. In recent days, especially active enthusiasts are allowed to shoot even more. However, the biggest daily attack will come on the last day of training, when we no longer work in twos or fours, but act simultaneously in two divisions. On this day, everyone fires at least 300 live rounds. Having entered the positions, we will hold the defense until the last cartridge - until all magazines and all zincs with cardboard boxes for storing cartridges are completely emptied. The instructors are interested in us shooting everything -to zero-. Our task is to repel a conditional enemy assault and hold positions in two nearby trenches. The greatest responsibility rests with the department commanders who organize the defense and coordinate the opening and cessation of fire. It all begins with an imitation of artillery shelling, during which instructors scatter explosive charges--firecrackers- literally a few meters from the chances. In terms of volume, it is similar to mortar fire, but unfired fighters need to start small. We are already familiar with such explosions, because during the previous classes on throwing grenades in trenches and defending positions, instructors used such charges. But now the simulated artillery fire is particularly intense, with several dozen explosions near both trenches. During the -artillery fire- we literally squeeze into the smallest gaps of chance, and after it in pairs we check weapons, equipment and ourselves for possible injuries. Instructors monitor how we communicate with each other and follow the algorithm. Thanks to previous training, such checks have already been brought to automaticity. The fighter with the call sign -Italian- with whom I work in a pair does it almost twice as fast as me - due diligence and previous experience. After completing the check, we send a signal of readiness to the unit commander and take a waiting position. The commander or a fighter designated by him conducts observation and maintains contact with an observer from a neighboring trench. Established and well-practiced communication within the department and between departments is perhaps the most important key to the successful completion of a combat mission. It is given no less attention than the rules for handling weapons. At the beginning, we were literally forced to shout loudly to each other, duplicate commands and inform the commander and comrades about what was discovered. By the last day of training, this is already a firmly learned habit. Foreign instructors do not understand what we are saying to each other, but they hear the communication and see the correct actions. This is enough to see that we are saying the right things. Only occasionally do they ask for the help of translators. Having noticed the appearance of the enemy, the observer reports to the commander. Having quickly received a signal of readiness from each of the fighters of the unit and coordinating actions with his comrades, he orders to open fire. It is necessary for all shooters to do this at the same time in order to cover the enemy with the first shots and force him to lie down or retreat. A joint volley of 16 machine guns of both divisions and rapid fire after that gives the impression of the fire superiority of the defenders of the positions. It will be possible to achieve the desired effect of simultaneity only with the second attempt - coordinating the actions of such a large number of shooters from two departments in neighboring chances turns out to be a difficult task. However, then we easily repeat it several times in a row. When conducting fire, we change positions after every 3-5 shots. Targets repeatedly rise and fall rapidly, hit by well-aimed shots. Everyone covers their sector, firing first at the nearest and then at the distant targets. The instructors are happy with our communication - working in pairs during reloading, checking weapons and equipment is firmly in place. Accuracy does not suffer either - the targets fall one after another, proving a hit. The brothers with the call sign -Grandfather- show special effectiveness, knocking out distant targets with the first shot. I'm left to shoot my neighbors and cover my neighbors while they reload. During the day, we manage to repulse an enemy assault six or seven times, alternating our actions with other units. Fortunately, the weather cooperates - in the midst of constant rain, Misty Albion is unexpectedly warm and sunny today. Our ears are ringing with explosions and shots, and our arms and legs are tired, but we are ready to go on when it turns out that there are no more cartridges left - we have fired everything, firing at least three hundred rounds each. Thousands of shell casings crunch underfoot in the trenches and sparkle in the evening sun next to the trenches. It takes more than an hour to collect them, but we are already almost stretching the pleasure, looking for bright cylinders even 10 meters from the positions. The last day of training at Interflex ends earlier than planned and we return to the camp even more enviable. This is perhaps the first case during the entire training period, because usually classes and training lasted until late in the evening.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/30/300-bojovyh-i-zalp-dlya-vidbyttya-shturmu-strileczkyj-intensyv-na-interflex-tryvaye-do-ostannogo-patrona/	2024-12-29T20:39:35-08:00
Karma will catch up with the enemy: a well-known German manufacturer of AI-based solutions in Ukrain...	According to the Army Recognition (AR) defense team, the HX-2 Karma is a new generation of ammunition, designed for high accuracy and adaptability in difficult combat conditions, ArmiyaInform reports. AR experts reported that according to Helsing GmbH, which has been operating in Munich since 2021, a drone equipped with state-of-the-art features, including the ability to navigate and perform missions even in areas where global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) are jammed or unavailable, solving critical problem of modern electronic warfare. With Helsing's Altra Recce-Strike software, multiple HX-2 drones can operate simultaneously in coordinated missions, using swarm tactics to overwhelm enemy defenses. Integrated artificial intelligence allows autonomous identification and hitting of targets with an accuracy of up to 50 centimeters. This capability minimizes collateral damage and maximizes mission effectiveness. However, according to experts of site IKK Defense Express (DE), information about these drones is extremely limited. It is only noted that they have developed -artificial intelligence- for autonomously hitting targets and ignoring EW, have a range four times greater than Ukrainian kamikaze drones and are cheaper than the American Switchblade or the Russian Lancet. -The latter directly indicates that the drone itself is a barrage munition for hitting targets at a range of 40-60 km,- DE stated. In turn, the authors portal of the German broadcaster Deutsche Welle indicate that Helsing drones work on the basis of software, which makes them virtually invulnerable to electronic warfare. A defense expert familiar with the situation told the German publication Bild that this drone is capable of -learning by itself terrain- and recognize from thousands of landmarks where it is, thus helping the operator stay on course even in adverse weather conditions or in bombed-out areas. -After the target has been found and the operator has given him instructions, the drone flies to it by itself,- the publication quotes. Bild's interlocutor's words. According to Bild, we are not talking about ordinary kamikaze drones controlled by operators, but about high-tech aircraft controlled by artificial intelligence, which are also called -mini-Taurus-. However, the latest claim of some kind of technological kinship with the -Taurus- has already caused critical statements. In particular, the Ministry of Defense of the Federal Republic of Germany disagreed with the journalistic comparison of German drones with AI elements to long-range missiles. This was said by the representative of the Ministry of Defense Natalie Jenning at a briefing in Berlin, Ukrinform reports. The spokeswoman noted that these are -tactical drones with a limited range.- She criticized the fact that the drones were called mini-Taurus and said that these drones cannot be compared to Taurus missiles. At the same time, Jenning refused to provide specific technical details regarding the drones. The position of the German Defense Ministry and DE experts are supported, citing the fact that a barrage munition with the ability to hit targets at a range of 40-60 km cannot be compared to a powerful cruise missile. -Already on the basis of this, it is possible to immediately understand that these drones are not talking about any -mini-Taurus- or at least a fraction of the capabilities of Taurus. Because the task of this German cruise missile is to destroy highly protected objects with the help of a 480-kg warhead at a range of more than 500 km. And any drone, even if it has a similar range, cannot physically destroy similar targets with the help of a warhead weighing several tens of kilograms,- Defense Express emphasized. However, as Western military experts emphasize, the use of unmanned munitions with the capabilities attributed to the HX-2 Karma reflects a broader trend in modern military operations, where unmanned systems and technologies controlled by artificial intelligence are becoming indispensable. The ability of the drone to operate in conditions where GNSS is not available and to use swarm tactics is aimed at solving two of the most important tasks: defeating electronic warfare and countering massive enemy forces or equipment. It should be noted how reported ArmyInform, at the beginning of May this year, Deputy Minister of Defense Kateryna Chernogorenko met with representatives of the Helsing company, which is engaged in integration of artificial intelligence in defense technologies. Together with the CEO and co-founder of Helsing Gundbert Scherf, they discussed the possibilities of integrating solutions with the use of artificial intelligence into the existing software of the Ukrainian army. In turn, in February of this year, the heads of the Ministry of Strategic Industries of Ukraine and Helsing GmbH signed a Memorandum of Understanding on cooperation in the field of security and defense. The purpose of signing the memorandum is to strengthen Ukrainian defense technologies. It is about the implementation of artificial intelligence technologies in drones, in particular UAVs, manufactured in Ukraine. Presentation of HX-2 UAV capabilities.

Propagandists again took up -reflection-: a photo fake about the theft of a washing machine	This is another example of a typical Russian propaganda tactic called -reflection-. Propagandists regularly make the same accusations against Ukraine that we once made against Russia. In this particular case, we are dealing with a photo fake. The screenshot of the original post of the charitable foundation has been edited. The original publication talks about Kharkiv Oblast, not Kursk Oblast. And the military received a washing machine from a family of volunteers. In a real post, the military thanked the volunteers for their help. The time of publication also indicates a forgery. The original post was shared on December 4, 2024 at 01:04, and the fake one at 02:04 on December 4. Such inaccuracy is obviously caused by different time zones in Ukraine and the Russian Federation. That is, the fake was created from the territory of Russia.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/30/propagandysty-znovu-vzyalysya-za-viddzerkalennya-fotofejk-pro-vykradennya-pralnoyi-mashyny/	2024-12-29T20:11:00-08:00

Russia supports the Taliban against the backdrop of the Afghan-Pakistani conflict	About this notifies the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. The Taliban announced the beginning of a military operation to seize several areas in Pakistan. Fighting is taking place in the border strip from the Dand Wa Patan district of the Afghan Paktia province and the Pakistani North Waziristan province, as well as in the border strip from the Alishir district of the Afghan Khost province and the Pakistani Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. The Taliban claim that the reason for the conflict is a Pakistani airstrike earlier this week on four districts in Barmal district in eastern Paktika province. Taliban representative I. Khorezmi said that he does not consider Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province to be part of Pakistan's territory. The transfer of armored vehicles by the Taliban to the border with Pakistan is recorded, which turns an armed conflict into a low-intensity confrontation. As reported by ArmyInform, from December 27, the Central Bank of the Russian Federation changed the procedure for setting official exchange rates (foreign exchange rate to the ruble will be established on the basis of combined data of exchange and non-exchange segments of the foreign exchange market).	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/29/rf-pidtrymuye-talibiv-na-foni-afgano-pakystanskogo-konfliktu/	2024-12-29T10:38:42-08:00

On December 29, a representative of the 110th mechanized brigade named after General Khorunzhoi stated this on the air of the -Edyni Novyni- telethon Marka Bezruchka Serhii Volkov. -Mechanized columns regularly march to positions and are destroyed by all means: artillery, drones, remote and other mining. The Russians have a tank with REBs going forward, sewn up as much as possible so that our FPV drones don't hit them, but it doesn't save them. Sometimes it happens that 5-7 hits plus mines don't help,- said Serhiy Volkov. According to him, the enemy's advantage in personnel remains the biggest problem. -If the enemy's infantry is not destroyed, they run around the landings, and then it's a lot of trouble to knock them out. Therefore, the enemy is now trying to cut off the logistical routes to Velika Novosilka, and this is one of the very difficult directions,- said Serhiy Volkov, whose brigade is fighting hard and is even trying to counterattack. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the 110th unmanned systems battalion of the mechanized brigade named after Colonel General Mark Bezruchka destroyed a column of Russian equipment. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/29/kolonamy-bronetehniky-ta-natovpamy-pihoty-okupanty-namagayutsya-prorvatysya-do-kordoniv-dniprovshhyny/	2024-12-29T10:17:48-08:00

But there are quite expected changes to these barrier systems that they have been building so enthusiastically for almost the entire warm period. As of now, it is likely that quite a large number of these barriers are not functional. Storm season isn't over yet. For another 2-3 months, rather harsh weather at sea will continue. And I hope that soon we will see even more results of the intervention of -General Storm-, who mostly helps us,- noted Dmytro Pletenchuk. According to him, the Kerch Strait has always been quite dynamic. And the enemy tried to take this into account, building various structures and fences, as well as flooding endless defense elements.

Due to the price regulation of TOT, there was a shortage of products	This is reported by a> Center of national resistance. Such a price policy leads to logical consequences, namely a shortage of products. This is primarily about oil, because the fixing of its price has led to the fact that it is now being sold from the -showcase-, because the fixed price does not correspond to the market price. Russia is synonymous with the word deficit. Therefore, the result of the reign of each king is necessarily the disappearance of goods from the shop windows. Currently, the Russians are trying to impose cash registers on sellers, which will become mandatory from February 1, 2025, and this will only increase fines, and the goods on the shelves will not be returned.

But it was even more difficult for the Russians in the Azov-Black Sea region. And now they perfectly understand that even the eastern coast of the Sea of ​​Azov, even the Krasnodar Territory are no longer safe zones for them. And we proved it. And they have to deal with it. This gives us the opportunity to plan our actions based on these achievements,- Dmytro Pletenchuk emphasized. For example, there have been no enemy ships in the Sea of ​​Azov for a long time. Absent due to the fact that the enemy understands that he is in the affected area. As for the Black Sea, there is currently one submarine. It performs the task of guarding the -Novorossiysk- base point. -The enemy is present only in the eastern part of the Black Sea. In other parts, we do not observe Russians.

Russia recognized the collapse of the economy	This is reported by the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. The main change is that the exchange rate of the yuan is now determined both by the results of trading on the Moscow Stock Exchange and by taking into account the agreements made on the over-the-counter market. Since June 2024, the exchange rate of the dollar and the euro has been determined on the basis of over-the-counter data due to US sanctions, while the exchange rate of the Chinese currency is based only on the results of trading on the Moscow Stock Exchange. This decision of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation indicates the transition to manual regulation of the currency market and the growing role of the political component in the activity of the regulator.

In Russia, there is a growing shortage of personnel	This is reported by Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. In 2022-2024, the number of labor force decreased by 1 million and today it is about 76.3 million people. A particularly rapid reduction is observed in the groups that are most in demand on the labor market - persons aged 19 to 40 years. Only during July-September 2024, employers posted 3.3 million vacancies. By the end of the third quarter, the ratio of open vacancies to unemployed Russians was 5 to 1. Throughout 2024, the largest shortage of personnel was observed in the field of retail trade and the IT sector. In the construction industry, the deficit in general can reach more than 400,000. persons By 2030, the shortage of personnel may increase to 4 million people. Given the Kremlin's intentions to continue the Russian-Ukrainian war, it will not be possible to solve the personnel problem in Russia thanks to internal reserves. Improvement of the situation on the labor market at the expense of foreigners is unlikely given the strengthening of the migration policy and double standards for labor migrants.

-The gun -Bogdany- is our 155-caliber sniper rifle-: the Russian locust is fired by the -Artist- fro...	Currently, -Artist- serves in the 48th separate artillery brigade of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the position of service number of the self-propelled artillery installation -Bohdan-. — Served, as theatergoers say, 20 years. Retired, had another civilian profession. And then he was mobilized and went to this damned war. Since then, I have been in the army for the second time, says Yuriy. This is not Yuriy's first time in the army - he served in the military at the end of the 1990s. Even then, he was recognized as visually impaired, so based on this and his acting talent, he served a year and a half in the Song and Dance Ensemble of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, performed on the same stage with many Ukrainian celebrities. — However, now I feel that it is suitable, because it is necessary for the defense of Ukraine. Therefore, when the summons was served, he left without hesitation. He was mobilized on March 1, 2024, trained in the Poltava region, says the soldier. Having the right not to serve on account of his health, he decided not to use it and willingly went into service as soon as the need arose. After all, he says, when the war is going on, everyone who is ready to defend the country is healthy and fit. — Everything was polite, cultured. They served a summons and the next day I arrived at the TCC, filled out the documents, went through everything and went to the training center, says Yuriy. - Before that, I volunteered - this is also an important job, because it is necessary to hold the rear and provide for the army. He was engaged in the delivery of food to the military and volunteers, helped his wife, who was weaving camouflage nets with her friends, he recalls how the first two years of the large-scale invasion passed. Yury fondly recalls how he once came across a video recorded by the military, in which they thanked for the products transferred from the company in Cherkasy, where he worked. — They recorded tiktok and it had our brand, our company! The guys ate exactly our products - this greatly inspired everyone at the time, because it showed that we are doing an important, necessary thing - the artist does not hide his emotions. After the war, he seeks to return to the friendly team from which he was forced to go to the army because of the war. Yuriy is sure that they are waiting for him there, because over the years of joint work and volunteering, his colleagues have become a single family. -We need a strong rear, but there are not enough hands in the army, so when I was called, I immediately left,- he says firmly. — In the -textbook- we were called -validators-. The youngest was 40 years old, the oldest was 58. Of course, compared to the younger guys, it was difficult for us, - he says about the training center. However, they were taught qualitatively - in a month, the -Artist- learned significantly more about military affairs and in a much better quality than he had once during a year and a half of military service. — So what happened before? Overcoat, -hem-, edging, boots - and to make everything rub and shine. We painted more squares and painted curbs than we shot and learned to fight, he says. Now they teach the practical things that are really needed in the war, and they do it not for formal reporting, but to prepare the soldier for combat operations. - -Training- was a great experience. There were experienced instructors, qualified, who had already gone through the war themselves and knew what we would really need. It was necessary to be with them like a sponge - to soak up everything they gave, what they taught, -Artist- notes. When the -buyers- came for the graduates from BZVP, Yuriy was selected as an artilleryman. A motivated responsible soldier was selected after a short interview and was sent to study a profession. — The colonel who came after us was primarily looking for those who had a technical education. But when I found out that I was a ballet dancer, I became interested and invited him to join the artillery. I agreed because they promised to work on a combat vehicle, -Artist- recalls. The second stage of training was less physically exhausting, but extremely responsible, because it was necessary to master subjects completely unknown to the former theater actor. However, persistence and responsibility quickly yielded the desired result. — At first you don't know from which side to approach this technique. But the main thing is to start and not be afraid. When a harmonious crew is formed, everything will go as it should. Because in combat conditions, the main thing is coordination — for the machine to arrive, for us to quickly -decompose- it, prepare it for battle and shoot accurately, says the soldier. After training in a specialty from May to today, Yuriy serves as a maintenance officer of the -Bohdana- ACS. - There are a lot of combat sequences, but this is just work. The most important thing in the war is my brothers, my crew, the guys I work with. People are always the most important thing. When we are confident in each other, everything always works out even in combat, says -Artist-. He by no means wants to leave combat work at the SAU for another position, because he is sure that this is where his place is during this war and this is where he can be of the greatest benefit. Yuriy does not consider the inability to see as an obstacle, because he is not a sniper and he has to shoot with a completely different -rifle- - the 155th! — caliber. - We shoot from the cannon exactly at the target. Our gun is our sniper rifle. The acuity of my vision does not affect this. If the Komgar (gun commander - ed.) orders, then we will make our doll, and we will bang, hit, and burn that Russian locust! — a confident gunner. Yuriy says that the main motive for him is not ostentatious patriotism, to which he is skeptical, but responsibility for his family, brothers, and country. — I have responsibility from my father. And my family motivates me. Because the family is the motherland. My mother-in-law lives in the Dnipropetrovsk region. So where should I go next? She is part of my family and I have to protect her, he explains. In the same way, he is convinced, everyone should think about taking responsibility for themselves and protecting their family, country, Ukrainian people and the state of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/29/garmata-bogdany-nasha-snajperska-gvyntivka-155-kalibru-rosijsku-saranu-vypalyuye-artyst-z-baletu/	2024-12-28T20:50:37-08:00
A new addition to the cat family: the Bundeswehr received a new version of the Leopard 2 tank	The German defense company KNDS Deutschland presented the Leopard 2A7A1 main battle tank equipped with an Israeli active defense system Trophy (APS). The prototype was presented at the company's plant in Munich during a demonstration attended by representatives of the German Bundeswehr and an Israeli delegation, ArmyInform reports. According to the information shared by the defense resource Defense Industry Europe, we are talking about equipping the serial tank of the latter, for this time, modifications with the active protection complex (KAZ) Trophy, from the Israeli companies Rafael and IAI. Previously, the Leopard 2 was equipped with Trophy armor only on research and demonstration models, but now the Bundeswehr has become the first customer of this version. This system, according to the experts of site Army Recognition, provides reliable protection against anti-tank missiles and rocket launchers, detecting and neutralizing incoming threats before they hit the tank. The Trophy system includes radar antennas and launch platforms externally, while internally it includes a control unit and power supply integrated into the turret and chassis. According to the Defense Industry Europe portal, the Leopard 2 A7A1, intended for active service starting in 2025, will strengthen Germany's 203rd Armored Battalion. It is planned to deploy this unit in the German combat brigade stationed in Lithuania. The German Defense Procurement Agency (BAAINBw) has confirmed that the tank will soon begin testing, with final approval expected by the summer of 2025, after which the first units will go directly to the troops. Integrated with the Leopard on-board computer and battlefield management systems, the Trophy system includes an advanced targeting locator. This system identifies the source of incoming threats, transmitting precise coordinates to the tank control system for rapid automated countermeasures, significantly improving defense response times. In 2021, the Bundeswehr agreed with Krauss-Maffei Wegmann (now KNDS Deutschland) to produce 17 Leopard 2A7A1 tanks and a test vehicle, deliveries of which will begin in 2024. A simultaneous contract was also signed with Israel for Trophy components, munitions and special equipment, part of a €120 million program jointly funded by Germany and Israel. The new KNDS Leopard 2 chassis meets the power requirements of the Trophy system with modifications including a 20 kW power supply and improved cooling for the updated MTU Friedrichshafen engine, ensuring optimal mobility despite increasing the tank's weight to 70 tons. The Leopard 2A7A1 is expected to be an interim solution until the more advanced Leopard 2A8 enters service in 2025. Incorporating an improved, lighter Trophy system optimized for drone protection, the A8 represents the next evolution of the Leopard series with the Trophy fully integrated into its turret, contrasting with the optional A7A1 system setup. Currently, Trophy in the Leopard 2A7A1 version is not designed to combat kamikaze drones, but Israeli engineers plan that this function will appear in future models. In October, Rafael announced the successful completion of development, which gives the ability of the Trophy complex to protect against modern threats, including FPV drones. These drones pose a serious threat that exceeds the risks from ATGMs and anti-tank grenade launchers, which the Trophy was originally designed to combat. Currently, only two countries in the world have serial tanks with KAZ - these are Israel and the USA. The US military equipped its Abrams MBT with the Trophy system as early as 2021, following a contract signed in 2018. Trophy® APS tank protection system. Video: RAFAEL Advanced Defense Systems Ltd.

There are fewer KABs, more Shaheds - in the Lyman direction, the enemy has changed its attack tactic...	Maksym Bilousov, the head of the communications department of the 60th Ingulets mechanized brigade, told on the ArmyTV stream about this. -According to my feeling, there have been fewer CABs. At least, from what I saw in our chats, when there is a warning about the operation of KABs, I haven't seen such active use of KABs for quite some time, as it was before. That is, even a month ago, messages -Reset KAB, reset KAB, reset KAB- were constantly coming. It happened every day and 3-4 times a day. There is no such thing now, but reports of the enemy's use of UAVs have increased... That is, -Shahedy- came to replace the UAVs,- said Maksym Bilousov.

The prisoners are over: the Defense Forces talked about interesting trends regarding the composition...	The spokesman of the Khortytsya OSU told about this on the air of the telethon -Edyny Novyvi- - Major Viktor Tregubov. -There were 52 combat clashes in the Pokrovsky direction yesterday. For comparison, 18 clashes took place in the Kurakhivskyi direction, which is next in intensity, and 17 in the Vremivskyi direction,- Viktor Tregubov said. In the Vremivsk direction, in recent weeks, the enemy has been pressing in the area of ​​Rozlyv, Kostyantynopolsky, and Novy Komar, that is, trying to advance further north. -Pokrovsk remains one of the enemy's targets, but it is there that our troops destroy the largest number of enemy personnel, because the enemy does not count on losses,- the spokesman added. According to him, in general, the enemy has concentrated about 150,000 troops on these directions, and if we talk about all 9 directions that are part of the Khortytsya Air Force Base, then we are talking about the figure of approximately 360,000 occupiers. This is more than half of the 600,000 Russians who are in all the occupied territories, including the temporarily occupied Crimea. -If we talk about the quality of the occupying forces, there are certain interesting trends. Half a year ago there were many newly mobilized, conscripts and a lot of convicts, now mostly contract workers. The prison terms have ended, and many of the mobilized have been given a contract,- Viktor Tregubov said. As reported by ArmyInform, the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces reported that from the beginning of 2024, the total losses of the occupiers involved in the offensive have already -u-2024-roczi/->exceeded 421 thousand people killed and wounded.

This was announced by the President of Ukraine on December 28. -We noted the heroism of the pilots and the entire crew of the plane. A key priority now is a thorough investigation that will answer all the questions about what really happened. Russia must provide clear explanations and stop spreading disinformation. In the photo and video, damage to the plane's fuselage is clearly visible, in particular holes and dents, which are very reminiscent of an air defense missile strike,- Volodymyr Zelenskyi said.

Mirage 2000 fighters have already shot down the Shahed-136. But not yet in Ukraine...	ArmyInform wrote about possible tasks -Mirage- in Ukraine, but did not mention that in 2024 these aircraft had already successfully shot down two enemy Kamikaze UAV Shahed-136 in combat conditions. However, not in Ukraine. Since the transfer to Ukraine, the F-16 Fighting Falcon multi-purpose fighters have convincingly demonstrated their -bojovi-sokoly-pid-chas-neshhodavnogo-obstrilu-ukrayiny/->efficiency as a means Air defense, shooting down dozens of Russian cruise missiles and kamikaze drones during massive combined air and missile strikes on the Ukrainian energy infrastructure. -Fighting Falcons- began to -learn- to shoot down -Shakhed- - more precisely, small-sized unmanned aerial vehicles at low altitude - at the end of 2019, when the USA and other NATO countries realized the threat from the Russian Federation and Iran due to their active use of cruise missiles and kamikaze drones. French Mirage 2000 multirole fighters are also capable of shooting down UAVs and cruise missiles. At the same time, unlike the F-16, they proved it not only during tests, but also in combat conditions even before they appeared in the Ukrainian skies. They had to act not against training targets, but against Iranian-made Shahed-136 combat UAVs. This happened during the Prosperity Guardian operation, which the coalition of states led by the United States is conducting from the end of 2023 to the beginning of 2024 with the aim of restoring the safety of shipping in the Red Sea. The operation is directed against the pirate actions of the Houthi paramilitary group, which operates from the territory of Yemen. Despite the fact that France has refused to participate in Operation Prosperity Guardian, its armed forces take part in patrolling the waters of the Red Sea as part of the European Union Operation Shield (EUNAVFOR Aspides) and interact with the US-led Prosperity Guardian coalition forces. Acting together with allies within the limits of both operations, French warships and aircraft patrol the waters of the Red Sea, repulse Houthi attacks on civilian vessels, and also provide the necessary self-defense in the event of a threat from enemy weapons at sea and in the air. On the morning of March 9, 2024, the Houthis launched four Shahed-136 kamikaze drones against the Barbados-flagged commercial vessel True Confidence. Their route lay in close proximity to and posed a threat to the French Navy's Aquitaine-type multipurpose frigate -Alsace- (FS Alsace, D656). Acting in self-defense and protecting a civilian vessel, the French armed forces opened fire on air targets and shot down four enemy UAVs. Two Shaheds shot down the frigate's 76 mm cannon, the others destroyed two Mirage 2000-5F fighters patrolling the airspace between the ship and the coast. Overall, during a Houthi airstrike on March 9, 2024, the armed forces of France, Great Britain and the United States jointly shot down 15 enemy UAVs. The significant contribution of Mirages has convincingly demonstrated their ability to effectively shoot down small air targets, such as drones and cruise missiles, at low altitudes in combat conditions. This allows us to believe that French fighters can become no less effective means of air defense in the defense of Ukrainian skies than the F-16.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/28/vynyshhuvachi-mirage-2000-vzhe-zbyvaly-shahed-136-ale-shhe-ne-v-ukrayini/	2024-12-27T20:57:01-08:00
117 brigade -gained weight-: what tanks are capable of on the modern battlefield	Spoiler alert: From point-blank fire to an evacuation vehicle, tanks can do just about anything. The chief of staff of the 117th separate heavy mechanized brigade of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Colonel Oleksandr Shaptala, told ArmiyaInform about the role of tanks in modern warfare and the unique tank operation to evacuate soldiers from positions half-surrounded by the enemy. Tanks, as a means of maneuvering combat and powerful fire damage to the enemy, have shown high efficiency during modern warfare. In interaction with mechanized units, they are used both during offensive actions and in defense. — We have widely used tanks where the enemy is conducting offensive actions in the direction we are in. It was thanks to the tank units that we effectively restrained the enemy's offensive and inflicted maximum damage on him with the help of tanks, going into direct fire, Oleksandr Shaptala says. The military is convinced that, despite the development of anti-tank weapons that damage tanks, heavy tracked gun armored personnel carriers have not lost their importance and can and should continue to be used on the battlefield, as they provide effective and tangible support for infantry who are on the offensive or on the defensive. . - During defensive operations, they are used as a general military reserve, as armored groups that go to the border for direct fire and deter the enemy, reducing the pace of his offensive actions and completely stopping his advance - explains the main role of tanks on the modern battlefield. This led to the reformation of the 117th brigade into a heavy mechanized one with an increase in the weight of the tank component in the compound. At the same time, it is not just about a simple increase in the number of tanks, but also about new approaches to the use of armored fighting vehicles on a tracked chassis based on the challenges of the modern battlefield. Tanks are mainly used for direct fire after a quick and unexpected exit to the line of fire by the enemy. Instead, they try to resort to fire from closed firing positions less often. — We don't have as much ammunition to fire tanks as we do artillery. That's why we try to use tanks for direct fire as much as possible, because it gives a hundred percent hit, - explains Oleksandr Shaptala. Shooting from closed fire positions is also possible, as it provides a level of damage to targets commensurate with high-precision artillery fire. However, taking into account the resource of the crew, the gun barrel and the amount of ammunition, it is more profitable to use the tank not as a substitute for artillery, but for the direct purpose of an armored vehicle. - Using a tank for direct fire is much more effective than from closed fire positions. So, if possible, when the enemy already discovers our routes of advance for direct fire, we try to use tanks to fire from closed firing positions. But direct fire remains the most effective, the officer emphasizes. At the same time, the chief of staff notes, it is important not only to perform a combat mission, but also to preserve military equipment and, especially, the crew. Therefore, when planning operations, they try to take into account all hazards and avoid excessive risks. Among the main threats to tanks, the military mentions UAVs, barrage munitions and anti-tank guided missiles. The biggest problem of all is kamikaze FPV drones. You can effectively protect tanks from them by installing powerful EW devices that cover a wide range of frequencies and protective grids. — The tank saves, first of all, the -scalds- that the repair and restoration units of the regiments, our repair and restoration battalion, do on their own. It is very effective. First, it is necessary to cover the engine compartment, and secondly, to cover the space between the body of the machine and the tower, the military calls the most vulnerable places of the armored vehicle. However, at the same time, he emphasizes, one should not lose such advantages of the tank as speed, maneuverability and the ability to fire in any direction due to the rotation of the turret. Therefore, it is absolutely impossible to abuse -burning- by building real -sheds-, -barbecues- or -garages- on the tank, like the Russians. — If it is done correctly, and not as the butchers do it. They will wind around the tank there so that the tank can just drive straight and shoot straight. And our equipment is so -boiled- that the tank moves and the tank turret rotates 360 degrees, it can fire in any direction. The enemy doesn't do that, the officer explains. Currently, the enemy uses tanks primarily as a vehicle to deliver infantry as close as possible to the battle line during assault operations. This makes enemy armored vehicles ineffective and vulnerable on the battlefield. The officer reminds that protective grilles are by no means the latest invention for the protection of armored vehicles. Installation of them on armored vehicles was resorted to already in the days of ATO/OOS, but then they were intended to counter rocket-propelled grenade launchers. — This appeared for the first time, probably back in 2014, when armored personnel carriers and BMPs were -boiled- with these -barbecues-, let's call them that, so that when the enemy's grenade launchers inflicted fire damage with RPG cumulative shells, the cumulative would work earlier. That's why it started back in the 14th year, says Oleksandr Shaptala. With the proliferation of FPV drones, protective grids have also proven effective against a new weapon. After 2022, when kamikaze aerial drones and UAVs with dropouts first appeared, and then became widespread, the well-known -boiling- of armored vehicles was the first response that the military resorted to. — But it must be done so intelligently so that the equipment does not lose its combat capabilities, so that even in this form it can be used for its original purpose, the officer emphasizes. The Ukrainians succeed, he continues, but the Russians have reached a dead end in this regard. Their solutions to protect mostly obsolete armored vehicles are not effective on the battlefield, as they fail to protect armored vehicles and at the same time deprive it of important advantages in maneuverability and greatly limit its capabilities as a means of infantry fire support. However, the military officer notes, it is not necessary to underestimate the enemy, because in other spheres the occupiers manage to achieve an advantage, not so much thanks to innovative development, but due to the scaling and building up of ideas and solutions that they have spied on and borrowed from the Ukrainians. — All the products that were made by Ukrainians, inventions, innovative technologies - everything is completely picked up by the enemy and built up in itself. At the beginning of a full-scale invasion, he had the advantage in shells, the advantage in people. He still has an advantage in shells and people. But he realized that at the rate he was losing it, he needed to catch up with our innovations, the military man explains. At the beginning of a large-scale invasion, the enemy had practically none of the inventions that are now common on the battlefield - FPV drones, UAV-bombers with drops, electronic warfare equipment to protect equipment, etc. Now the Russians have made significant progress and have even begun to overtake the Ukrainians in certain issues. This applies, for example, to the appearance and mass distribution of FPV drones on fiber optics, against which EW devices are powerless. — The problem with optical fibers is that they do not work from a radio signal, and EW does not affect this. The signal is transmitted through an optical fiber and the drone flies as far as the coil can reach. It can be up to 6-10 kilometers, says the soldier. The already mentioned protective grids are capable of protecting against kamikaze drones on fiber optics. The Ukrainian military is also beginning to actively implement this innovation, so the enemy is quickly losing its advantage in this means of defeat. Returning to the topic of tanks, the officer tells about a unique evacuation operation, during which tankers broke through to the semi-circled positions of the Ukrainian military and rescued four soldiers, including a wounded company commander. — The tank, driving into the settlement, evacuated four people, including the company commander, who had a bullet wound. They effectively drove in, took people, left, covered themselves with smoke, provided help with artillery so that the enemy's artillery was also suppressed, - says the Chief of Staff. Therefore, Ukrainian tankers not only hit the enemy with direct fire in maneuver defense and offensive, but also can, if necessary, carry out evacuation measures and rescue fighters on the front line. - Our tank crews, I believe, are real rexes. They are going to the end and they have a lot of experience in the Zaporizhzhia direction, in the Pokrovsky direction, Oleksandr Shaptala notes. — So when was the decision made to evacuate by tank. The tank entered the firing line, inflicted fire damage on the enemy, drove right up to our guys, the guys picked up the company commander and three men directly on the tank, on the armor and left under the smoke. The evacuation took place at night under conditions of limited visibility and intense fire contact with the enemy, but thanks to careful planning and the extraordinary courage and skill of the tank crew, it was successful. Because in the hands of experienced professionals and under competent command, tanks can do almost anything on the battlefield.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/28/117-brygada-nabrala-vagy-na-shho-spromozhni-tanky-na-suchasnomu-poli-boyu/	2024-12-27T20:48:42-08:00
MLRS is a priority: what are the latest missile systems ordered by the Republic of Korea army	As state the authors of the South Korean portal DealSite, the local defense corporation Hanwha Aerospace signed a contract for 342.3 billion won (approximately $245 million) with the Defense Acquisition Program Administration of the Republic of Korea (DAPA) for the third stage of mass production of the K239 Chunmoo missile complex, reports ArmyInform. The contract represents 3.7% of Hanwha's annual sales for the previous year and runs through 2026. This phase involves the production of Chunmoo launchers and ammunition vehicles to replace aging systems in the South Korean military, such as the American M270 MLRS delivered to Seoul in 1998, which are nearing the end of their service life. The K239 Chunmoo, designed to replace the K136 Guryong, is a self-propelled multiple rocket launcher, capable, as at one time noted our editorial, fire with different types of ammunition. Among them are 230 mm unguided missiles with a range of 45 kilometers and 239 mm guided missiles with a range of 80 kilometers. The system can also use larger missiles, such as a 400 mm model with a range of 200 kilometers and a 600 mm missile called the CTM290 capable of reaching targets 290 kilometers away. Guided munitions include cluster warheads for 300 bombs and high-explosive fragmentation warheads designed to penetrate bunkers. These functions provide flexibility in the operational use of projectiles. The Chunmoo launcher is mounted on an 8×8 wheeled chassis designed by Doosan Infracore. The vehicle has a 450 horsepower engine, Run-Flat tires and digital fire control systems. The combat platform is designed for mobility, allowing it to engage targets and quickly redeploy to avoid counter-battery fire. Reloading is facilitated by interchangeable missile blocks, which allows for a firing configuration of up to 12 missiles per launcher. The ammunition transport vehicle, which uses a single chassis, can carry up to four missile units, which simplifies logistics operations. The Ministry of Defense has not disclosed the exact number of K239 Chunmoo MLRS installed under the contract by South Korea. However, according to analysts of the defense portal Army Recognition, it is expected that 218 to 367 units will be purchased. As of 2024, South Korea's multiple rocket launcher (MSR) fleet includes approximately 40 K136 Guryongs equipped with 130 mm rockets, 58 M270 MLRS systems using 227 mm rockets (48 standard M270 units and 10 upgraded M270A1 ), and approximately 200 systems K239 Chunmoo configured for 239 mm rockets. The system has been in service with South Korea's military since 2015 and is part of its efforts to modernize its artillery capabilities. Each battalion operating Chunmoo systems has 18 launchers. The platform is integrated into South Korea's Kill Chain pre-emptive strike defense scheme, which is designed to counter potential threats. The Chunmoo fire control system includes GPS-assisted INS guidance, which provides a 15-meter circular error probability for guided missiles. Chunmoo is also exported. 12 systems and vehicles were delivered to the United Arab Emirates under a confidential agreement. Saudi Arabia also acquired the system, deploying it during Yemen's civil war, reportedly against Houthi positions. According to the 2022 agreement, Poland is to receive 290 systems localized as Homar-K, which combine Polish command systems and domestic chassis. These complexes are equipped with Korean guided missiles and tactical ballistic missiles. Development of the K-239 Chunmoo began in 2009, and the system entered service in 2015. It was developed as a replacement for the K136 Kooryong and incorporates technological advances such as electric cylinders for rapid response and reloading. The Chunmoo has been continuously upgraded, including extended-range guided missiles and tactical ballistic missiles aimed at further increasing range and versatility. This third production phase reflects ongoing efforts to modernize artillery units in South Korea and meet changing operational requirements. It also highlights Chunmoo's role in regional security and its growing presence in international defense markets. K239 Chunmoo MLRS installation.

In Russia, anti-aircraft fire shoots down Santa and an Azerbaijani plane: it seems that the propagan...	After that, the racist Santa Claus comments on this: -we don't need anything foreign.- The essence of this -masterpiece-, bordering on schizophrenia, is -let's hit damned Western values ​​(it's the same Santa Claus) with an anti-aircraft missile.- Although maybe it's not just about values? By a very strange coincidence, the appearance of the video coincided with the downing by Russian anti-aircraft defense of the Azerbaijan Airlines plane, which the Russians wanted to sink in the Caspian Sea, not giving permission for an emergency landing after the incident. Rosavia cynically stated that the plane was unable to land in Grozny due to fog, and the pilot allegedly refused to land at other nearby airports and allegedly made an independent decision to fly to Kazakhstan. And the users of Russian publics are frankly happy about what has happened: -less churk is more of a good thing-&#8230; Meanwhile, propaganda launched a version about the downing of the plane allegedly by a -Ukrainian drone-, trying to shift the responsibility for the actions of the Russian air defense to Ukraine. But while the Kremlin propaganda machine tries with all its might to justify itself with the help of -alternative facts- and pseudo-analytics, the world understands everything correctly. The Azerbaijani airline, whose plane failed to land in Grozny and crashed in Kazakhstan's Aktau, announced the suspension of flights to seven Russian cities from December 28: Mineralnye Vody, Sochi, Volgograd, Ufa, Samara, Grozny and Makhachkala. It also became known about the cancellation of the Qazaq Air flight on the Astana-Yekaterinburg route until the end of January 2025 for security reasons, and about the suspension of flights to Moscow by the Israeli airline El Al. It is difficult to think of a better advertisement for refusing to fly to Russia.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/28/u-rosiyi-ppo-zbyvaye-santu-i-azerbajdzhanskyj-litak-zdayetsya-propagandysty-perestaralysya/	2024-12-27T20:12:55-08:00
6 tanks and BMP each — the defeat of a powerful assault by the Russians in the Klishchiivka area	The video of the battle was released on December 27 on the brigade's channel. Kholodnoyartsi, together with neighboring units, repelled one of the most large-scale assaults in recent times in the Bakhmut direction. One and a half dozen heavy vehicles and up to three platoons of attack aircraft - that's how the Russian occupiers went to the brigade's position in the area of ​​the village of Klishchiivka. The forces of the Cold War soldiers, in cooperation with their comrades from neighboring units, succeeded in defeating the enemy and holding their positions. The offensive took place in two directions at once. From heavy equipment, the enemy used BMP-2 and T-72 tanks. However, with the joint efforts of the crews of the Black Raven unmanned systems battalion, the 2nd and 3rd mechanized battalions, supported by artillery, the enemy was completely defeated. The result of the brilliant work of the Cold War soldiers, which lasted about four hours, was the destruction of 6 T-72 tanks and 6 BMP-2 tanks. Another tank was damaged. Enemy manpower losses are being refined. As reported by ArmyInform, the pilots of the Black Raven 93 unit of the mechanized brigade -Cold Ravine- hit the occupiers, who were going to our positions.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/27/po-6-tankiv-ta-bmp-rozgrom-potuzhnogo-shturmu-rosiyan-v-rajoni-klishhiyivky/	2024-12-27T11:57:06-08:00

There may be several reasons for this. First, they tried to launch classic attacks: in columns, they created armored -fists-. They lost a lot of equipment, a lot. And after that, we don't see the technique anymore. Maybe they don't have it left, or maybe they realized that it's not worth attacking like that anymore,- said Serhiy Dibrov.

The Ministry of Defense explained how coalitions of partner states strengthen the Defense Forces of ...	About this reported on December 27 by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. In September 2023, the format of providing international aid to Ukraine was transformed into the so-called -Ramstein 2.0-. This means that Ukraine's allies move to providing military aid mainly not on a bilateral basis, but in the activities of the respective coalitions. Their goal is to strengthen coordination, systematization and, as a result, increase the volume of international military aid. All needs of the Defense Forces of Ukraine in weapons, military equipment and personnel training are divided into 8 directions of coalitions:• aviation capabilities;• sea capabilities;• integrated air and missile defense;• artillery;• armored vehicles and maneuverability;• drones;• mining;• IT. Each coalition was headed by the leader countries that coordinate their work. At the same time, some allies assumed leading commitments in several coalitions at once. For example, the United States is the leader of the Air Capability Coalition and the Artillery Coalition, France - the Integrated Air Defense and Missile Defense Coalition and the Artillery Coalition, Germany - the Armored and Maneuverable Coalition and the Integrated Missile Defense and Missile Defense Coalition, Great Britain - the Maritime Capability Coalition and the Drone Coalition. Also, the leading countries in various coalitions became: Denmark, Estonia, Italy, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway and Poland. Priorities remain: The Drone Coalition has involved 16 countries working in the field of unmanned systems. The IT coalition, which provides communication tools, software solutions and computer equipment, has united 14 countries. The Demining Coalition has 21 countries that focus on military and humanitarian demining. Efforts to attract new countries to participate in coalitions are ongoing. France, in addition to chairing the aforementioned coalitions, joined 5 more initiatives. The Czech Republic and Spain also became members of 6 coalitions, in particular the Coalition of Integrated Air Defense and ABM. Denmark, Belgium and Sweden joined 5 coalitions, including the Air Capability Coalition. The ultimate goal of all coalitions is to provide the fighters of the defense forces of Ukraine on the front line with Western equipment and weapons. In addition, working in coalitions involves strengthening interoperability with NATO, which brings us closer to membership in the Alliance. As reported by ArmyInform, the IT coalition for Ukraine accumulated 482 million euros in 2024.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/27/u-minoborony-poyasnyly-yak-koalicziyi-derzhav-partneriv-posylyuyut-syly-oborony-ukrayiny/	2024-12-27T04:03:41-08:00

Homemade -shoes-, fake birdhouses and sawing $100,000. — detained Russian railway saboteurs	The Security Service of Ukraine reported this on December 27. Thanks to anticipatory work, it was possible to detain an enemy agent who was preparing to derail the first train. In order to commit sabotage, the person involved was preparing a self-made brake -shoe-, which was supposed to cause the echelon with ammunition of the Armed Forces to derail. In order to record this crime on video, the agent placed several cameras around the railroad track, which were disguised as bird nests and were supposed to record the sabotage in real time. According to the case file, the recruited figure turned out to be a resident of Rivne, who worked for the 316 intelligence center of the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces (better known as the game), located in Crimea. The agent acted as part of a network that included two more traitors currently hiding on the temporarily occupied peninsula. The organizer of the network was 43-year-old Roman Yakymchuk, and the -liaison- who sought out and assigned tasks to the agent was Oleksandr Ignatiev, a former employee of the law enforcement agencies of Ukraine, who was fired in 2014 for corruption and drunkenness. To work with an agent in Kyiv, Yakymchuk and Ignatiev made a request to the Russian Federation for $100,000. At the same time, they promised only 40% of this amount directly to the agent in the capital of Ukraine. Yakymchuk and Ignatiev planned to distribute the rest of the funds among themselves, hiding this fact from the leadership of the Russian military intelligence. SBU counter-intelligence exposed the aggressor's plans in advance, detained the enemy agent and documented his handlers. Investigators of the Security Service notified all three persons involved of the suspicion of crimes committed under several articles of the Criminal Code of Ukraine: h. 2 Art. 111 (treason committed under martial law); h. 1 Art. 14, ch. 4 Art. 27, ch. 2 Art. 113 (preparation and incitement to sabotage under martial law); h. 1 Art. 263 (illegal handling of weapons, ammunition or explosives). Yakymchuk and Ignatiev were charged in absentia. The detained agent is in custody. He faces life imprisonment with confiscation of property.

Understanding with foreign instructors and the teaching level is at a high level, the interlocutor states and adds: - Before that, we traveled on the -72s-. And when they switched to Leopard, it was as if they switched to a foreign car! I liked it. Better in operation. Worked comfortably. There was nothing complicated. After training in Germany, immediately to the area of ​​combat missions, to the Kupyan direction, it was September 2023. The most difficult thing, Stepan recalls, was when the positions were shelled with a 120-caliber mortar: - We went to work, we worked. Only the dugouts were approached - and they began to cover us. Not far away, two meters away, there were 20 parishes. You are sitting, your heart is pounding, the dugout is shaking. Stepan continues to share his memories: — Once, when we were leaving for the position, we were heavily covered. It was in the summer of 2024. We exchanged -Nadyukha- in the Kupyansk direction. Mostly they worked from closed positions. The sky was almost clear. But as soon as they left, -Lancet- immediately arrived. Everything worked out. But from half past five in the morning to 4:30 p.m., we crawled along the landing. A total of 12 hours, - says Stepan about one of the difficult departures. And the most delicious practice against the enemy was on November 7, 2024 - they repelled an enemy counterattack. — From 5:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m., six units worked, one after the other. We didn't even have time to serve the -zucchini-. But they fought back. And they did not go further. Then, during two weeks, the total consumption of ammunition was 222 shells. It is a lot, very much&#8230; Fortunately, there were no losses to the crew of the tank with which Stepan works. I ask what is the secret of such survivability of the crew. The military man answers succinctly: - We understand each other, we work harmoniously. Or maybe it's just flattered&#8230; After a year and two months of rotation in the area of ​​combat missions, the brigade is on a well-deserved rest, assigned to recovery. Stepan calls it succinctly: -you are going to fresh land.- The military man managed to spend a few days at home, in his native Cherkasy region. — Most of all during the war, I wanted to see my family&#8230; My youngest child turns four on January 3. Daughter Ulya, - Stepan says warmly. Meanwhile, I realize that this man joined the Defense Forces when the child was only a year old. Stepan is the father of three children. He has two sons — 28-year-old Volodymyr and 13-year-old Oleksandr. -And there's Alina, I'm already a grandfather,- the serviceman smiles. Traditionally, we ask what a serviceman would advise civilians who, for various reasons, did not join the ranks of the Defense Forces. He answers as follows: -If everyone left now, as we left then, instead of hiding in bars, then we would have already won this war,- the army man says with sadness in his voice, but states that the army needs both people and equipment . In the end, the military man recalls the most difficult and the most frightening sortie, his first sortie in the Svativ region: - The order came to work out the enemy's position, which was in the shape of the letter Z. They dug in there - we had to cover them. They drove in, covered up, drove back. And then it was very scary. I can't stand it and ask: - And what helped you fight, in the end, with this fear? — -Our Father.- I read the prayer and drove on. - he says with a smile.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/27/peresiv-z-traktora-na-tank-nadyuha-yak-mehanik-vodij-yakyj-vyroshhuvav-shampinjony-pryruchyv-leopard/	2024-12-26T20:55:56-08:00
The weapon of victory. What is known about BBM -Dozor-: about the evolution of domestic armored vehi...	Currently, the fleet of specialized special vehicles of the Defense Forces of Ukraine includes armored vehicles of both foreign and domestic production. About the history of the creation of two of them - the Dozor BBM family and the updated version of the Oncilla armored personnel carrier, which was recently codified and put into operation by the Ministry of Defense, about which reported ArmyInform, the correspondent asked a researcher of military equipment and weapons, doctor of historical sciences, professor of the department of humanitarian sciences of the National Academy of Ground Forces named after Hetman Petro Sahaidachny Andrii Haruk. — Indeed, Andrii Ivanovich, it seems paradoxical to a certain extent, but while producing powerful tanks and the world's largest aircraft, the Ukrainian SSR could not boast of mass production of wheeled vehicles for the Soviet army. Well, we can only recall the LuAZ-967M amphibious vehicles manufactured at the Lutsk Automobile Plant, a kind of relatives of the civilian -Volyn girls-, which in the Soviet army witty jokers called -BMW- - -Volyn combat vehicles-. - The situation began to change after the collapse of the USSR and the restoration of Ukraine's independence. Already in the 90s, using the technical documentation of the BTR-80 wheeled armored personnel carrier, improved BTR-94 and BTR-3 armored personnel carriers were created. But the development of light wheeled armored vehicles had to be started from scratch. The state of affairs was simplified by the presence of a powerful design center in Ukraine — the Kharkiv Design Bureau of Mechanical Engineering named after O.O. Morozova (HKBM). Here, in the early 2000s, the design of a family of special-purpose vehicles for both the military and civilian sectors began. At the same time, two options were created: a multi-purpose non-armored vehicle for dual purposes for civilian and military use (-Dozor-A-) and a military armored vehicle (-Dozor-B-). — And how much time passed from the design idea to the presentation of the prototype? How original were they? — The first demonstration samples of Dozor-A and Dozor-B were first demonstrated in Kyiv at the exhibition -Weapons and Security - 2004- in October 2004. Parts of the BTR-80 suspension were used in their design, but in all other respects the machines were completely original. -Dozor-A- was demonstrated as a pick-up truck with a four-door cabin designed for 5 people and a cargo platform that could carry 2 tons of cargo or 6 people. In the roof of the cabin there was a hatch on which a machine gun could be installed. The curb weight of the equipped car was 3.5 tons. Three engine options were offered — diesels with a power of 122, 136 and 197 hp. The maximum speed of the four-wheel drive car reached 120 km/h. On the Dozor-A base, it was proposed to create a whole series of special purpose vehicles - police, collector, sanitary, technical assistance vehicle, etc., as well as trucks with a carrying capacity from 2 to 6 tons. But Dozor-A never found buyers. But -Dozor-B- developed further, and its evolution before the start of production lasted 10 years. — And in what, Professor, did it consist? Reveal the details. — From a technical point of view, Dozor-B is a two-axle all-wheel drive armored car with a hood layout. Its body is divided into two compartments: engine and transmission and crew. The motor-transmission compartment is located in the front part of the case. It houses the engine with its service systems, the transmission, the main steering elements, the braking system, as well as elements of the air conditioning and heating systems of the crew compartment. The crew compartment occupies the central and aft parts of the hull. In front of it are the driver's and commander's workplaces, behind them - the gunner's workplace, and in the stern - a landing compartment designed for 6 people. The hull has two side doors (for the driver and commander. — Ed.) and one aft door (for the landing party. — Ed.). In the front wall of the hull there are windows made of armored glass, and in the sides of the landing compartment there are six embrasures for firing from small arms. Airborne soldiers have periscopes to observe the battlefield. - And how did the designers take care of the protection of the crew and paratroopers? - The Dozoru-B hull is made of Polish-made Armstall 500 armor steel. It protects against armor-piercing small arms bullets fired from a distance of 30 m, as well as fragments of a 152-mm high-explosive projectile from a distance of 50 m. From the inside, the armored case is additionally reinforced with several layers of Kevlar. Armored window glass provides the same level of protection as the body. The bottom of the case has a rounded shape, which increases protection in the event of a mine detonation. However, in general, the level of anti-mine protection of -Dozor-B- does not fully meet modern requirements. The armored car is equipped with a filter ventilation unit, air conditioning and a heating system. - Now it's logical to move on to the propulsion system. What engine is installed on this BBM? - The engine is a four-stroke four-cylinder liquid-cooled Deutz BF 4M 1013 FC 190 hp diesel. The gearbox is a hydromechanical five-speed automatic Allison LCT 1000. Problems with the supply of engines from the German company Deutz led to the search for alternative options for the power plant. Five engine options were considered, but in the end, all manufactured Dozor-B armored cars were equipped with Deutz diesels. The armored car was equipped with a R-173M radio station, an AVSK-1 intercom, and SN-3003 -Basalt- satellite navigation equipment. — You already mentioned above that the evolution of these transport platforms continued for a decade. What did it consist of? - The first version of Dozor-B, known as the -B1320 package-, appeared in 2004. In 2007, it was displayed at the IDEX-2007 exhibition in Abu Dhabi. The armored car was actively offered for export, but no buyers were found. In 2014-2015, -Dozor-B- was created in the second version - -B1320-1/B1320А assembly-. It is distinguished by a rearranged landing compartment (the capacity of the machine has increased from 9 to 10 people), a more powerful winch (6800 kg instead of 4100 kg), the presence of boxes for tools, spare parts and personal belongings of the crew on the sides of the body, increased from 146 to 180 l fuel tank capacity , the presence of a smoke curtain installation system, an automatic fire extinguishing system, an updated satellite system CH-3003M navigation system, Polish-made radio station and other improvements. —A combat vehicle cannot be unarmed. What options were offered to potential customers? — For Dozor-B, about ten weapon options were offered, some of which were actually tested, and some of which existed only on paper. The variant with a remote-controlled installation with a 12.7-mm NSVT-12.7 machine gun (or its Ukrainian -clone- KT-12.7), created on the basis of the commander's turret of the T-64A tank, was considered basic. The device has a PZU-7 periscopic monocular sight. The range of vertical aiming angles of the machine gun is from −3 to 68°. The ammunition includes 450 bullets (three tapes of 150 bullets). A simpler alternative was the installation of a 30-mm automatic grenade launcher KBA-117 (Ukrainian copy of AGS-17) on the turret. Two variants of remote-controlled Blik modules were tested on Dozor-B. At the ADEX-2014 exhibition, which took place in September 2014 in Baku, an armored car with the Blik-2 module armed with a 12.7-mm machine gun, a 30-mm automatic grenade launcher and 81-mm smoke grenade launchers was demonstrated. And in the spring of 2016, at the SOFEX-2016 exhibition in Amman, Dozor-B was shown with the Blik-2M module, which, in addition to the machine gun and automatic grenade launcher, also has the Korsar ATGM launcher. Another version of the remote-controlled module was the Cyborg ABM with a 12.7-mm machine gun and a 40-mm UAG-40 automatic grenade launcher. — As far as I know, the developers of these machines offered quite interesting and original solutions for their weapons. What did they consist of? — A rather interesting weapon option proposed for Dozor-B was the Viy module with a 23-mm twin-barreled GSH-23L aviation cannon (ammunition set of 250 shells) and an optical television sight OTS- 20.01. In February 2021, there were reports of the design of a tank destroyer based on the -Dozoru-B- base. It was supposed to be armed with the -Bar'er- ATGM (unified by the RK-2S and RK-2OF missiles with the portable -Stugna- ATGM). The ammunition of ten missiles was located in two drums. The drums were recharged through hatches in the sides of the machine. The two-charge launcher in the firing position was placed inside the hull, and in the combat position it was raised through a hatch in the roof. As far as is known, this tank destroyer did not leave the project stage. Instead, another missile system based on Dozor-B was embodied in metal. In the summer of 2021, a prototype of the -Speka- light jet flamethrower system was demonstrated. It uses rockets with a thermobaric warhead, and the principle of operation is similar to the Russian -Buratino- and -Solntsepek- systems, but it is much lighter than them. RS-122TB projectiles were created by the State Joint Stock Holding Company -Artem-. This 122 mm caliber projectile is 1450 mm long, has a starting mass of 28.5 kg (the warhead weighs 11.5 kg) and a firing range of 7 km. The State Enterprise -Shepetiv Repair Plant- became the integrator of the system. In the -Dozoru-B- building, which has no roof, a swivel cabinet with a package of guides for 10 RS-122TB shells was installed. A large hatch was made in the rear wall of the case, through which rockets are loaded and powder gases are released during firing. Under the aft part of the hull, two outriggers are added, which ensure the stability of the machine in the firing position. Potentially, the Dozoru-B chassis could also be used for other special purpose vehicles. In particular, in 2021, it was considered as a base for placing elements of the Obolon-A artillery battery (division) automated control complex.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/27/zbroya-peremogy-shho-vidomo-pro-bbm-dozor-pro-evolyucziyu-vitchyznyanyh-avtopanczernykiv/	2024-12-26T20:38:39-08:00
Destroys historical monuments, but blames Ukraine: a fake Russian video from UNESCO is circulating o...	However, UNESCO did not publish such a video on its official resources. And Mehtilda Ressler, who is no longer the director of the World Heritage Center, has never made such a statement. As it turned out, the video was created from content from open sources, which tells about something completely different. In addition, the acting governor of the Kursk region Khinshtein said that on December 22, as a result of rocket attacks in Rylsk, 17 objects of cultural heritage were damaged, accusing the Armed Forces of Ukraine. However, the extent of the damage that Hinstein says is actually minimal, and the circumstances of its occurrence remain unconfirmed. Contrary to these statements, Russia is actively destroying Ukrainian cultural heritage. As of December 2024, 1,222 damaged monuments in 18 regions were recorded in Ukraine. In November, Russia carried out 43 new attacks on historical and cultural monuments, in particular in Zaporizhzhia, Odesa and Khmelnytskyi regions. In the Kharkiv region, for example, the enemy damaged 322 such objects, in the Kyiv region and the city of Kyiv — 81. The most recent case was the shelling of the Mykolaiv Church in Kyiv on December 20. Ukraine insists on an international investigation of these acts of cultural vandalism, which is a violation of international law. Russia spreads this kind of misinformation for several reasons. First, in this way, the aggressor country is trying to shift the focus from the destruction it is causing to Ukrainian cultural heritage, to blaming Ukraine. This helps create the illusion of moral equality between the aggressor and the victim. Hostile propaganda appeals to emotions, using themes of cultural and spiritual heritage to mobilize support among its own population. Such disinformation justifies Russia's aggressive actions as -protection- of its historical and spiritual heritage. With such messages, Agitprop also wants to raise doubts in the international community about the credibility of Ukrainian accusations of war crimes.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/27/rujnuye-pamyatky-istoriyi-ale-zvynuvachuye-ukrayinu-v-merezhi-gulyaye-rosijske-fejkove-video-vid-yunesko/	2024-12-26T20:19:18-08:00

The enemy is planning a propaganda campaign on the anniversary of the Yalta Conference	This is reported by a> Center of national resistance. For this purpose, the Russians plan to involve their agents of influence in the world, who, by their presence at these actions, should shape the image of the Russian Federation as a country that is the main fighter against Nazism. In such a narrative, the current fascist Russian Federation itself can determine who is a -Nazi- in the world, and this allegedly gives it the right to invade other sovereign states. In February, the Russians are planning a telecast in honor of the anniversary of the conference in Yalta. The telebridge should take place between the studios and Simferopol and the studios in Great Britain, France and the USA. On it, the occupiers plan to spread messages about Nazism in Ukraine and that the modern world order is outdated.

The occupiers pay the police for each detainee who signs a contract with the Soviet Union	About this reports Center of National Resistance. Thus, the investigator who pressures the suspect in the case to enter into a contract with the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation in exchange for dropping the charges receives 10,000 rubles. premium rubles. In this way, the repressive apparatus of the Ministry of Interior of the occupiers is interested in putting pressure on the detainees, cases of physical beatings with the demand to conclude contracts have also been recorded. At the same time, the police were presented with a plan, which is 10% of all detainees in the region. It is in this way that the enemy plans to carry out the plan for mobilization on the TOT, because at the moment the plans have failed due to the reluctance of the locals to serve in the army of the occupier. Recruiting residents of the occupied territories is a violation of international law, which the aggressors deliberately violate. However, the perpetrators of this crime are not protected, because they are redundant witnesses for the Kremlin. We remind you, in the so-called LNR, the invaders admitted that they do not carry out systematic work aimed at disassembling rubble of buildings destroyed by the Russians in 2022, under which the bodies of civilians remain.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/26/okupanty-platyat-policzayam-za-kozhnogo-zatrymanogo-yakyj-uklade-kontrakt-iz-zs-rf/	2024-12-26T09:06:17-08:00

In this way, Moscow wants to increase the Russian Federation's competitiveness in order to expand sales markets and minimize the impact of Western sanctions. And by lowering the prices of goods, the Kremlin is trying to increase the dependence of African countries on Russian imports. Russia resorts to similar methods when it helps some countries of the continent to implement nuclear programs, turning these projects into a long-term dependence on Moscow's help. Subsidies can become part of broader agreements, which will include logistics investments, trade development, etc. Most likely, it is about countries that already have close ties with the Russian Federation due to the long-term presence of Russian mercenaries (CAR, Mali, Burkina Faso), and about states with respect to which the Russian Federation is taking another step towards rapprochement (Algeria, South Africa, Egypt and others).	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/26/stalo-vidomo-dlya-chogo-rf-zaprovadzhuye-pilgy-dlya-pereviznykiv-produkcziyi-v-afryku/	2024-12-26T08:33:07-08:00

A cynical diversion scheme: the violators disguised themselves as a funeral cortege of a fallen sold...	This was reported by Western Regional Office of the State Border Service of Ukraine. The ferrying scheme was planned by two Transcarpathians living in the border region. For a monetary reward of $18,000, they undertook to deliver two residents of Uzhhorod to the border. The crossing of the state border was planned in the area of ​​Knyaginya settlement of Uzhhorod district. In order to transport the -clients- through the checkpoints, the shippers resorted to the most cynical plan. They pretended to be on their way as part of a funeral cortege that accompanied the body of a fallen soldier to the burial place. Offenders even hung a national flag from the window of the car in which the border violators were being transported. However, the tricks of the shippers were exposed. The operatives waited until the procession ended and began to arrest the offenders. During it, one of the smugglers did not comply with the legal demands of the law enforcement officers to stop and made an attempt to run into the border outfit. The -clients- of the dealer were thrown out of the car and ordered to run away. The response team, together with operatives, apprehended the fugitives and their smugglers and brought them to the border unit. In the actions of the shippers, they see signs of a criminal offense under Part 3 of Article 332 of the Criminal Code -Illegal transportation of persons across the state border of Ukraine.- The corresponding message was sent to the address of the Uzhhorod District Department of the National Police. They were also prosecuted under Article 185-10 of the Code of Criminal Procedure -Malicious disobedience to a lawful order or demand of a serviceman or an employee of the State Border Service of Ukraine or a member of a public organization for the protection of public order and the state border.- Both -clients- will have to answer to the law for attempting to illegally cross the state border.

The enemy is constantly trying to infiltrate there. Now Ukrainian soldiers there are inflicting damage and repelling attacks,- Viktor Tregubov noted. The Russians are killing their infantry en masse here. They can be forced to storm just to see where the Ukrainian position is. -They have problems with logistics. Because the further the front is from the railway stations, the worse their supply is. And, of course, these logistics are getting worse due to Ukrainian strikes on their rear. Therefore, the further they are from the railway or the Russian border, the worse things turn out for them,- Viktor Tregubov said.

In the Russian Federation, inflationary processes are accelerating	reports this Service of foreign intelligence of Ukraine. Annual inflation is expected to peak in April 2025. We will remind that the October forecast of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation predicted inflation in 2024 in the range of 8–8.5%. At the same time, there is currently no inflation forecast from the regulator for 2025. Representatives of the Russian banking sector state that today the Russian economy is -developing in not quite normal conditions-: -We have large budget expenditures for defense, at least 30%, as well as a huge number of sanctions.- They also admit that the restrictions on the Russian Federation -complicate and make payments more expensive-, and the acceleration of inflation is associated with both the presence of a large money supply and the -increase in tariffs of natural monopolies-. Inflation rates (real inflation in Russia — 25–30%), as well as the lack of reaction of Russian banks to the decision of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation to maintain the discount rate, indicate a high probability of strengthening monetary policy by the Russian regulator as early as January 2025. However, any actions of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation will not save the Russian economy, since there are no more correct moves left. We remind you, employees of the State Bureau of Investigation reported about the suspicion of the director of an enterprise from Kryvyi Rih, which in 2023 supplied one of the military units with 20,000 sleeping bags of low quality.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/26/u-rf-pryskoryuyutsya-inflyaczijni-proczesy/	2024-12-26T01:52:27-08:00

Defense procurement from the Ministry of Defense: how the DOT-Chain system is changing the provision...	This is stated in messages MOU. In particular, significant work has been done to overcome the so-called -paper army- — redundant bureaucracy that takes away time and energy from the military. For this, the DOT IT department developed and implemented the DOT-Chain system from scratch. Currently, it operates in the field of providing the Armed Forces with food products. DOT-Chain has significantly accelerated and simplified processes for suppliers and the military, in particular: The system has a confirmation of compliance with the security level of KSZI. In addition, DOT is in the final stage of obtaining the ISO/IEC 27001 international information security certificate. -Digitalization does not just simplify processes — it radically changes approaches to the provision of our military. Thanks to modern technologies, such as the DOT-Chain system, we are already seeing concrete results today: reducing bureaucracy and improving the quality of service to the military. This allows the army to focus on the main thing - the defense of our state. Every hryvnia directed to the Armed Forces should work for our victory, and digital solutions are becoming our reliable ally in this direction,- said Deputy Defense Minister of Ukraine Dmytro Klimenkov. Among the important achievements of the IT team, it is possible to single out the implementation of various accounting and document management systems, on the basis of which DOT is developing its own ERP system, as well as the development of infrastructure and information security systems. An important step was the implementation of ICS MOU SAP, which, together with other achievements, significantly improved the internal processes of DOT.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/26/oboronni-zakupivli-vid-minoborony-yak-systema-dot-chain-zminyuye-zabezpechennya-zsu/	2024-12-26T01:07:32-08:00

However, he notes the good professional level of work of their -politicians-. -They talk about the fact that Ukrainian captivity is the most terrible thing that can happen. About alleged torture and everything else. That is why it is very difficult to take prisoners,- said the spokesman of the Third Assault Brigade. Increasing the exchange fund is very difficult, he admits. Enemy infantry, fearing capture, often simply settle accounts with their lives. -Russian servicemen sometimes undermine themselves. That is, the internal propaganda work works for them. It is taken very seriously. Prisoners talk about it too. They tell how they are taught, how they are explained. Everything was done in order to minimize the number of prisoners on their side,- said Oleksandr Borodin. As reported ArmyInform, soldiers of the 80th Airborne Assault Brigade of the DSHV of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were captured four Russian soldiers in Kurshchyna, who shared their impressions of the Juche fighters.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/26/profesijni-pozhyrachi-mizkiv-politruky-zhenut-rosiyan-v-ataky-i-zmushuyut-do-samogubstv/	2024-12-26T00:52:30-08:00

The cost of the sleeping bags was 30 million hryvnias, but the examination established that the product did not meet the technical requirements, which did not allow them to be used for their intended purpose.

According to him, the enemy used at least two units from the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation, which produced -Caliber-. -It is impossible to say that it came as a surprise. Because when ships go out to sea, you have to look at the sky. And given that you could see the preparations for the strike, it was logical that the ships would also be used in this case. We were ready for this,- Dmytro Pletenchuk assured. He said that the occupiers operate according to a similar scheme. They leave the base point in order to strike, and immediately turn back, under the cover of their air defense on the shore. -We should not forget about this danger. However, so far I have not seen any information about the successful use of Calibers. And I haven't seen her for a long time. Which, in principle, confirms the thesis that the main purpose of using this tool is to load Ukrainian air defense and nothing more,- summed up the spokesperson of the Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

Live bait and shelters from artillery: the SSO told about the tactics of the North Koreans in Kurshc...	About this told in the Special Operations Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The next part of the records of Private Gyeong Hong Jong reveals quite interesting methods of combating Ukrainian drones and artillery used by the North Korean military. In the notebook of the North Korean special forces officer killed in Kurshchyna, he describes how to shoot down a Ukrainian drone alive. In his notebook, when he was still alive before the meeting with the SSO operators, private Hyong Hong Jong wrote down tactics for shooting down a UAV and hiding places from Ukrainian artillery. It is currently unknown whether this is an authentic North Korean tactic, or the Russians taught them that way. But this tactic uses live bait. The SSO presented a full transcript of another entry from the trophy notebook. The recording is completed with illustrations from a soldier of the SSO of the DPRK: How to eliminate a drone When detecting a drone, you need to create a trio (3 people), at the same time, the one who lures the drone keeps a distance of 7 meters, and those who shoot - 10-12 meters. If the one who is baiting stands, the drone will also stop its movement. At this moment, the one who shoots — eliminates (the drone). How to avoid the zone of artillery fire In case of getting into the zone of fire, after appointing the point of the next meeting (group), you need to diverge small groups and get out of the firing zone. Another way: since the artillery does not fire at the same point, you can hide at the point of (previous) hit, and then get out of the shelling zone. -35-naslidky-rankovogo-masovanogo-obstrilu-harkivshhyny/-> in the first part of the deciphered notebook, author — Hyong Hong Jong — wishes another soldier Song Ji Myung (or Yong) a happy birthday.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/26/zhyva-prymanka-i-hovanky-vid-artyleriyi-u-sso-rozpovily-pro-taktyku-pivnichnokorejcziv-na-kurshhyni/	2024-12-25T22:41:20-08:00

How the self-propelled gun -Bohdana- demonstrates itself in battle: the gunner of the 48th brigade t...	The 48th separate artillery brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine was one of the first in Ukraine to receive arming divisions SAU -Bohdana-. And now this formidable weapon is destroying the occupiers in the Donetsk direction. Chief Sergeant of the First Battery of the Self-Propelled Artillery Division of the 48th Brigade, Dmytro, told ArmyInform about the capabilities and combat work at the front, the number of shots fired per year, and whether the -Bohdan- can withstand the 203-mm blows of the Rashist -Pion- Dmytro: -Our division was one of the first in Ukraine to receive ACS -Bohdana-. This happened at the end of 2023, and the alignment of our unit began immediately. Before that, the crews underwent enhanced professional training, adopted the equipment and further practical tests. Our combat calculations actually -run-in- the self-propelled guns on the training ground from scratch, learned to aim and strike from weapons. After combat coordination, we were immediately sent to the front. -Bohdana- is accurate, reliable and modern. Its combat capabilities are impressive, especially here, in the Donetsk direction, in real combat conditions. Self-propelled gun - hits the target very accurately. Usually, the target is hit from the second shot. According to TTX, the declared fire range is up to 42 km with a high-explosive fragmentation projectile, and an active-reactive projectile can reach the enemy up to 60 km. Here in Donetsk region, our artillery calculations worked on the enemy up to a maximum of 30 km. They destroyed all the military targets of the Rashists, which were reported to us by intelligence. According to confirmed data alone, these are hundreds of combat vehicles, armored personnel carriers, BMPs, tanks, artillery systems, defense structures, warehouses with ammunition and armored personnel carriers. Since the beginning of the large-scale invasion of the Russian Federation, I have worked on the Soviet Pion self-propelled guns and the German Panzerhaubitze 2000 installation. I will say that these systems are far from Bogdana in terms of firing accuracy. Weight - 28 tons, range on the highway - 800 km, cross-country - 300 km. The car is quite lively: on the highway - 80 km/h, on the field, of course, the speed is a little lower. When working at the positions on the self-propelled guns, it is mandatory to install the REBs. To counter the operation of enemy FPV drones. There are special mobile fire teams that are armed with anti-drone guns and -shooting guns-. Artobsluga also with small arms. And of course, camouflage and anti-lance nets. Somehow an unpleasant situation happened. Bogdana was attacked by more than 5 enemy kamikaze drones. The armored cabin of the ACS took the hits. The armor survived, the guys inside, of course, were contused, but they will remain alive. Our -SAUShka- withstands even an explosion on an anti-tank mine. Everything was fine with the crew that day, just an injury. In war, different things can happen, you have to be ready for everything. -Bohdana- is really very well protected by reservation. Katsap 203 mm -Peonies- inflicted fire damage on us with cluster shells. Yes, the car was cut into pieces, but nothing critical. Guys are alive and that's the main thing. How does a typical working day of a -Bohdana- ACS service ideally go? The coordinates of the target are received, the combat mission is recognized. The crew practices deploying to a firing position, aiming, firing, adjusting fire, firing, firing again if necessary, and then quickly collapsing and moving to a -hideout- or to another position. This is a clear algorithm of actions. These skills are extremely necessary for the calculations of self-propelled guns, because after shooting you need not to come under enemy counter-battery fire and safely leave the area of ​​the combat mission. The safety of the crew and the preservation of the -Bogdana- in a combat-ready condition is a priority. It usually takes two to three minutes for the crew to practice one combat mission and the artillery makes the first shot. Gunners assure that they can do it even faster. In general, the speed of the ACS is also its big advantage. In one incomplete year of combat work, the -Bohdana- self-propelled guns, near which gunners worked, fired more than 3,000 shots. At other installations, the number has already exceeded 2,000 in some parts. Like any other equipment, -Bohdana- can break down. The crew is not allowed to do any repair and restoration work. After all, self-propelled guns are covered by the manufacturer's certification guarantee. Therefore, all -repair manipulations- are carried out by the manufacturer's representatives in a safe and designated place. The crew only delivers the car from the positions. Again, so that no one knew about it, let alone saw it. One of the common technical malfunctions of the -Bohdana- is the wedge of the engine and the replacement of the operational rings on the gun. Electronics hangs sometimes. But the factory workers promptly repair everything so that the machine can return to combat work as soon as possible. Recruitment for the brigade is also currently underway. Therefore, every Ukrainian can join the team and work on a modern Ukrainian-made artillery installation. -The situation with replenishment of personnel is not simple. But recently we managed to attract several talented people to our battery. This became possible thanks to changes in the legislation. Since the fall, conscripts and volunteer reservists can choose a military unit for service without going to the territorial recruitment and social support centers. It certainly helped,- says Dmytro. — We are looking for purposeful people who can learn quickly. Here, on the spot, we will teach them the specifics of working on the -Bohdana- air defense system, there are training centers where the military will receive professional training.

Alone at the position for 36 hours in a row, he repelled enemy assaults: the story of a soldier of t...	How Dmytro single-handedly repelled enemy assaults for 36 hours in a row? But how does he assess the enemy's infantry? The soldier told our correspondent about this: &#8220;Before the army, I worked at a metallurgical plant in the Zaporizhzhia region. Since 2021, he served in the 79th Brigade. Participated in the OOS. And he also met a large-scale invasion in the composition of the 79s. At that time, our unit in the area of ​​the city of Shchastya was performing tasks. I was a MANPADS anti-aircraft gunner and a unit commander. By the way, a soldier from our branch shot down an enemy Su-25 after the start of the invasion. In 2024, I transferred to the Third Assault Brigade. &#8230;There was a case when our department was in position for almost three days. And it so happened that on the first day, the enemy fired at us continuously from barrel artillery, and everyone in the unit was wounded, except for me. One fighter, although he was badly injured, helped me jam enemy drones. And before those who were supposed to replace us came to the position, I had to run to the position myself. Simply put, you do not sleep or eat for 36 hours in a row. You are constantly told which way the enemy is coming from, and you move there, take a firing position and shoot back. The enemy did not stop firing artillery even as their assault group approached. So the katsaps also helped me kill their people. We also had enemy crews with droppers and FPVs working against us. And, of course, enemy infantry stormed us. During that time, they had seven 200s. Some of them managed to run up to a distance of 20 meters to our position. And the last hours before we were changed were very difficult. Already once at night, the batteries on the electronic devices ran out. But they were not fully discharged. &#8230;Artillery fire was coming at us continuously, about every minute a plane arrived. And all this for 3-4 hours, then it fell silent for half an hour and then again. They stopped at night. In principle, we are already used to artillery fire, but we are still adjusting to such a huge number of enemy drones. And their infantry began to storm us from dawn. That is, they accumulated at night, and at dawn they began to climb. That opponent was not too prepared. He had a lot of firearms, but he was just drafted, fresh, literally 2-3 weeks in the service. Their whole tactic was that they would get lost in a bunch and go to the position, hoping that we were all already dead. Those who stormed us were mostly 35-40 years old. &#8230;I will say this to Ukrainian men who are not yet in the army. This is the same reason why you can't roll away from a position. You can't, because the enemy will kill you in the back. So here: these men can come. Only no longer TCC, but Katsaps.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/26/sam-na-pozycziyi-36-godyn-pospil-vidbyvav-vorozhi-shturmy-istoriya-voyina-tretoyi-shturmovoyi-brygady/	2024-12-25T20:48:52-08:00
-Sea Tiger- sharpens its claws: the German Navy bets on the newest NH90 Sea Tiger helicopter	The phase included various operational scenarios and tests of the aircraft's mission system, including sonar, electro-optical surveillance and targeting systems, as well as weapons. -A total of over 140 flight hours have been logged over the past 11 months and all the helicopter's capabilities have been validated- - Airbus explained Helicopters regarding the course of the tests. According to data by the authors of Defense Post, in 2020, Germany ordered 31 NH90 Sea Tiger helicopters. The value of the contract was €2.7 billion ($2.89 billion). The ordered helicopters will be based on German Navy frigates, thereby replacing the Sea Lynx Mk88A, which entered service in 1981. Currently, the German Navy already operates 18 NH90 Sea Lion military transport helicopters, which were delivered from 2019 to 2023. Sea Tiger is the newest version of NATO's carrier-based helicopter, designed specifically for the needs of the German Navy. The helicopter is designed to fight enemy submarines and surface ships. Distinctive features of the machine are a new electro-optical system and -enhanced electronic support measures-, as well as a submersible sonar, sonar buoys and armament represented by missiles and torpedoes. In addition to combating submarines, additional tasks of the NH90 Sea Tiger helicopters include reconnaissance, search and rescue, as well as the transportation of personnel and cargo. Experts of the defense portal Army Recognition reminded that the NH90, which is also detailed told in one of his publications by our agency, is a twin-engine multi-role medium-sized military helicopter designed in accordance with NATO's requirements for universal and a modern helicopter. It is produced by NHIndustries, a consortium of Airbus Helicopters, Leonardo Helicopters and Fokker Aerostructures. Designed for both land and sea operations, the NH90 is available in two main variants: a tactical transport helicopter (TTH) designed for Army missions such as troop and equipment transport, medical evacuation and utility missions, and a NATO frigate helicopter ( NFH), optimized for naval applications including anti-submarine and anti-sea warfare, search and rescue as well as maritime surveillance. A defining feature of the NH90 is its all-wire flight control system, the first of its kind on a production helicopter. This technology improves flight stability and reduces pilot stress. The airframe is built with extensive use of composite materials, providing a lighter and stronger structure with a reduced radar signature. Its spacious cabin can accommodate up to 20 fully equipped soldiers or 12 medical evacuation stretchers. Since entering service in 2007, the NH90 has been adopted in many countries, including Belgium, Germany, France, Italy and the Netherlands. By the beginning of 2023, more than 500 units of aircraft with a flight of more than 400,000 were delivered. hours Despite the advanced design, the helicopter development program faced some challenges, including technical issues and concerns about maintenance and operating costs. In response, NHIndustries has implemented modernization programs to improve the helicopter's performance and reliability. A recent €600 million contract with the NATO Helicopter Management Agency highlights ongoing efforts to modernize the NH90 and extend its service life.

-Apikhatinka of the Armed Forces of Ukraine free of charge-: until Christmas and at all times, Ukrai...	Before Christmas, ArmiyaInform also visited the extraordinary homestead of Christian volunteers who take care of the souls of Ukrainian defenders while taking care of their bodies. A bathhouse, a laundry room with washing machines, a room with folding dryers and a line with clothes just outside - the volunteer manor meets us in the midst of daily work. Someone from the military goes to the bathhouse, someone puts in the laundry or picks up washed clothes, another soldier drinks coffee while waiting for his turn. Volunteers are constantly moving between them - they put dirty clothes in washing machines, hang up washed clothes, take them off and put dry things in bags. There are only three volunteers at the site now - the married couple Serhiy and Elena, as well as a very young girl, Polina. They have to be in time everywhere, so they talk about the initiative to help the military almost constantly. — We have been working in this format for the second year, since November 2023. They saw that the boys needed somewhere to wash, wash their clothes, rest a little - and they organized it, says Serhiy Severyn. Resting here now are only bees that fall asleep for the winter. So the apikhatinka — a special house for bee therapy — is temporarily closed until spring. Despite this, it still smells pleasantly of honey and wax. The God's Couriers volunteer initiative has been active since the beginning of the large-scale invasion. At first, it focused mainly on helping the local civilians of Donetsk region, delivering them food, water and other necessary things, as well as organizing evacuation. Their name is connected with the story of the biblical prophet Elijah, who was fed by ravens during his stay in the desert at the Lord's command: -And the ravens brought him bread and meat in the morning, and bread and meat in the evening, and he drank from the stream.- (Third Kings 17:6). — That is why our chevron features a raven and the slogan: -At the right time, in the right place.- Because we are the messengers, the couriers who deliver to people what they need most - bread, food, water and everything they need for life, Serhiy explains. Together with Olena and Polina, he mentions dozens of people from all corners of our country who in one way or another joined the volunteer initiative - either by handing over necessary things or by coming to the east of Ukraine and helping here with their work. Pastor Andrii Malov from the -Light of Resurrection- Church, who stood at the very beginnings of this volunteer initiative and is the coordinator of the -Light in the East- mission, is most often mentioned. It was he who, from the very beginning, found things people needed and delivered them to Donetsk region. As soon as the volunteers saw the urgent need of the military in the organization of life, they immediately reacted to it as well. As early as the fall of 2023, they organized a bathhouse and a laundry for servicemen in one of the estates in the front-line town. Initially, it was a mobile -Chaplain's Bath- on wheels near the house, and within a year, thanks to the support of dozens of caring people and associations, a capital stationary building was built. It can accommodate more than 100 people per day. - This is a joint Christian initiative, because Christians cannot be indifferent. God teaches us to bear one another's burdens and to care for those in need. This is how unity between people is formed, because the enemy seeks to divide and, thanks to this, rule over us, instead, the Lord calls us to unity, says Serhiy. A volunteer explains how important community support is to the military. Therefore, this volunteer initiative is needed not only to meet their purely physical needs, but also to provide spiritual support to Ukrainian defenders. — We want boys to understand that they are not alone, that they are not alone. That ordinary people appreciate what they do for them at the front, that ordinary people sympathize with them and want to help. And when there is such a relationship, it becomes easier for the boys, the volunteer emphasizes. The military will find out about the bathhouse and laundry thanks to a billboard placed near the road with an announcement and personal communication, so the initiative does not need special advertising. The complex is already working at the limit of its capacity - about a hundred servicemen visit it every day. It is necessary to wash the things left behind mainly at night, because water and electricity may run out for everything at the same time. In order to dry the washed clothes in the autumn and winter period, the manor has a heated drying room. Everything is organized in such a way as to make the defenders' stay as comfortable as possible. - These are simple, elementary things, but defenders really need them. We have a lounge - you can drink tea or coffee, eat goodies. We don't have time to cook, but the -Volunteers from God- organization from the Church -Design of Christ- helps us, Serhii says. While we are talking, he himself, as well as Olena and Polina manage to put wood in the stove that heats the bathhouse, pour coffee for the guys, take off and hang the washed clothes, put new loads of laundry in several washing machines. The work does not stop even for a moment. A little later, more workers are added - Serhiy's daughter arrives with her husband and several other people. Their work is difficult, but grateful - a tired smile and a kind word of thanks from the defenders are extremely inspiring to work further. By Holy Evening and Christmas, the mood in the manor is particularly high. Volunteers strive to bring to the soldiers a portion of the warmth and kindness of the bright holiday of the incarnation of the Lord. - In the sorrowful time of war, it is a great joy to share the joy of the holiday with your loved ones. And it is a great happiness to be useful, to be God's hands and God's messengers for our defenders, says Serhii. He compares the sacrificial feat of Ukrainian soldiers with Christ's atoning sacrifice. After all, becoming defenders of good and light from the attack of evil and darkness, warriors are likened to the One who came to protect people, taking upon themselves all their faults. - The Lord was born in a simple barn, because there was no other place for Him then. Now our defenders also live in dugouts and dugouts, in which there is no comfort. But we can make them feel our love, our care and make sure that their sacrifice is important to us and that they are not alone in their wanderings, the volunteer emphasizes. Together with all his like-minded people and associates, he is sure of the presence of God in the midst of those who take upon themselves the burden of their neighbor and ease his suffering. For where two are gathered together in His Name, there He is in the midst of them.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/25/apihatynka-zsu-bezkoshtovno-do-rizdva-i-povsyakchas-pro-ukrayinskyh-zahysnykiv-dbayut-bozhi-kuryery/	2024-12-25T01:44:37-08:00

According to Oleg Chaus, during the attack on our positions, one group was neutralized, and two groups were entrenched in front of our positions. -Maybe it's some new unit, or maybe it's some support coming to level some of their front lines. And it is very good that our drones, scouts, they noticed in time. And if one of those three groups had not been destroyed, they would have continued their movement,- Oleg Chaus summarized.

A moment of silence in Ukraine	-In order to honor the bright memory, civic courage and self-sacrifice, strength of spirit, resilience and heroic deed of the soldiers who fell during the execution of combat missions to protect the state sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, civilians who died as a result of the armed aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine , decree: to start a national minute of silence every day at 9:00 a.m. for compatriots who died as a result of the armed aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, which should be announced in all mass media, regardless of the form of ownership,- the document says.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/25/v-ukrayini-hvylyna-movchannya-50/	2024-12-24T23:00:18-08:00
The data of a war criminal from -gru- annexed Crimea was received	This is reported by Center of National Resistance. Despite all efforts to hide his activities as much as possible and cover his tracks, it is known that Mr. Sadovnik has a military engineering and technical education, he signed his first contract with the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation on August 27, 1999, and at the beginning of 2014 he was transferred to military unit 43292 ( Moscow region, Solnechnogorsk, village of Redino) to the position of senior diving specialist of the group tests A morbid mania to prove his importance to the whole world already in 2016 led him to the special operations forces of the Russian Federation and later to the game of the Russian Federation. The data of the gardener are highlighted in the list of military unit 00317 (317th special operations center (marine), which is located in the city of Sevastopol, Crimea). It is from this time that the psychopathic gardener draws legends for himself, and even in the description drawn up of him by the commander of military unit 43292, a certain Colonel Fufurin appears as the year of birth -1979-, not 1980 as in the passport. It is also worth paying attention to the nationality -Ukrainian- specified in the document. Despite everything, it is worth noting that the captain-lieutenant of the 3rd rank of the gardener has special feelings for the Ukrainian Special Operations Forces. The man keeps a whole gallery of photos with the emblem of the SSO of Ukraine in his phone. Moreover, in 2016, a non-hero gets a werewolf tattoo. We have several volumes of compromising materials for the gardener at our disposal (weapons, numerous mistresses, fraud with funds, -work- with children in the combat sambo federation of the Russian Federation). However, the personal -complexes- of the gardener have no meaning for us and we will leave them for justice. It is important that this person takes a direct part in the so-called svo. This is confirmed by a letter of appeal addressed to the general director of JSC -Northern Press- Kruglikova V.Ya. In it, the gardener asks the mentioned comrade to help equip his unit with drones, which is participating in the war against Ukraine and signs himself as the company commander of military unit 00317, captain of the 3rd rank, I. Sadovnik. It is known that the 317th special operations center of the Russian Federation is involved in the annexation of Crimea in 2014, Moscow's participation in the Syrian conflict in 2015-2017, and a large-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The servicemen of this unit are still shelling Ukrainian cities and villages with the help of missile and bomb weapons, which are based on the sea, in aviation and on the ground. In addition, they continue to carry out sabotage, intelligence and subversive operations, both in the real world and in cyberspace. We remind you, 266 combat clashes were recorded during the past 24 hours. The situation at the front remains difficult.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/25/otrymano-dani-voyennogo-zlochynczya-iz-gru-aneksovanogo-krymu/	2024-12-24T22:57:30-08:00

A gift for Christmas: what the Brazilian padre of the International Legion prays for	Before Christmas, he told ArmiyaInform about his service to Christ, comrades-in-arms and the Ukrainian people, and also told about his most desired Christmas present. Like many volunteers from Latin American countries, Father Makariy came to Ukraine following the call of his heart. He speaks Ukrainian well on everyday topics and confidently recites the Lord's Prayer and the Creed also in Ukrainian translation during joint prayer. This is not surprising, because the priest knew a lot about our people even before arriving in Ukraine, as he communicated a lot with representatives of the Ukrainian community in the south of Brazil. It was this good knowledge of Ukrainian culture and history that prompted him to serve as a military chaplain in the Armed Forces of Ukraine. — I grew up among Ukrainians, I know the history of Ukraine and feel the culture and spirit of Ukrainians. I know what evil the Soviet Union brought to your people - the Holodomor of 1932-1933. The archbishop who ordained me to the priesthood was from Poltava, and on the day of my ordination I promised to serve the Lord God, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and I also mentioned serving Ukraine and the Ukrainian people, says Father Makarii. So now the chaplain not only instructs and strengthens the Christian faith of the fighters of the 2nd International Legion from different countries of the world, but also tells them about Ukraine and Ukrainians, introduces them more deeply to the culture and history of our people. -I have a Ukrainian soul,- he smiles. The priest wanted to come to Ukraine back in 2014, but then the position of his parents, who were very worried about his son, prevented him. However, having stopped him from traveling then, they could not stop him now, because the priest felt that he should be here together with Christians from Latin American countries who came to help the Ukrainian people. — I knew that my place was here, that I should be in Ukraine. When I turned to the archbishop with a request to bless me for my journey and ministry, he gladly did so because he shared my sincere support for the Ukrainian people, says the holy father. However, the future military chaplain did not immediately dare to tell his parents about the decision and informed about it already during his stay in Ukraine. He is moved to show his vow and the response of his mother, an Arab Christian from Syria, who supported her son's decision. Over time, the strict father - a serviceman of the Brazilian army - softened. The priest arrived in Ukraine in May, after which he underwent training and training together with all foreign volunteers. Padre Makariy says that he wanted to become a military chaplain, but already in Ukraine he learned that foreigners do not have such an opportunity, so he was ready to continue his service as a medic, saving the lives of soldiers. - I decided that if I can't be a chaplain, I will become a paramedic, and in my spare time I will serve as a priest to everyone who needs it. Therefore, after training, I put on a cassock and served together with other soldiers, says the chaplain. This was noticed by one of the Ukrainian officers who introduced Father Makaria to the Orthodox priest. Together, they helped a padre from Brazil realize his desire to become an official military chaplain of the 2nd International Defense Legion of Ukraine. - It was like receiving a gift from heaven from the Lord himself, Father Makarii says emotionally. — When I was told that I was now a military chaplain of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and could officially serve Christ and my brothers, tears came to my eyes. It was one of the best days of my life. — I was born in Brazil, but for me Ukraine is also my country. When the war is over, I don't want to leave. I want to continue to be in Ukraine, to serve God and the Ukrainian people, because after the war we will have a lot of work, says Father Makarii. Now he instructs and strengthens the Christian faith of the fighters of the 2nd International Legion. Padre Makariy combines priestly service with a vocation to serve the Ukrainian people and does everything possible to convey his love for Ukraine to all soldiers. — We treat Ukrainians as brothers. We protect Ukraine with Christian love, because we love this land as sincerely as our own homeland. If someone thinks that this is just to make money, then they are deeply mistaken. We are going to war and are forced to fight for love and peace, the chaplain explains. After the coming of peace, he is convinced, everyone will have jobs, because it will be necessary to heal the wounds caused by the war. The priest will have his own special role in this, for which you should prepare now. - Now I am preparing the soldiers for the Christmas celebration. Often we can't be together because of combat and training, but every day I call or write to them, reaching out with a sermon and a prayer. This is very important for them, because no one yearns for peace more than a soldier, says the padre. He notes that not only the body of a soldier suffers from war, but also his psyche and soul. And together with him, his family and relatives also suffer, because they know in what danger their loved one is in. Therefore, the chaplain's task is to help and pray for everyone in need, even when they don't know it. Padre Macarius does this all the time, because he knows that a priest does not have days off - every day of his life should be dedicated to serving the Lord. - When Jesus Christ was born, His land was captured by foreigners. However, He came to us to bring us eternal salvation, no matter what. Therefore, it is very important that regardless of where we are, in this case at war, that we have love for God inside us, - Padre Makariy emphasizes. - When we celebrate our birthday, we get presents. When Christ is born, we ask for gifts and receive gifts. And the most important, the most precious gift today, when this terrible bloody war is going on, the gift for which I pray all the time, is peace! - the military chaplain from Brazil does not hold back his emotions. He calls on all people of goodwill all over the world to pray for this together, because, he is convinced, sincere prayer with true love from every heart is capable of creating a great Christmas miracle: - I ask everyone to pray for Christmas so that this war ends. That the Russians go away from Ukraine to their own country and stay there, that they leave the land of Ukraine forever. Because this is not their land and they should not seek it. Therefore, let's forget about our own selfishness and don't ask for any material gifts for ourselves. Let's pray together for peace in Ukraine and in the whole world. And according to our faith, we will definitely receive this most valuable gift from Our Lord Jesus Christ.

How to become an officer in 40 days as a medic	There is currently a retraining program for tactical-level medical officers in Ukraine. And according to the head of the training department of the headquarters of the Medical Forces Command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, medical service colonel Yaroslava Semirunchyk, this allows filling medical positions. The training and retraining of medical service officers for the needs of the Defense Forces is carried out by the Ukrainian Military Medical Academy. span> Military servicemen serving as non-commissioned officers and having a higher medical education must write a report to the name the commander that they wish to undergo additional training under this training program. Documents must be sent to the email address of the Ukrainian Military Medical Academy. The training lasts 40 days. The first block - 22 days takes place online and is completed with credits. After the successful completion of the first block, an invitation is given for an 18-day offline assembly. -These people pass the position in the military units that they hugged They are assigned to the position of an officer in the same military unit and arrive at the military medical academy. Enrolled as cadets. They study for 18 days. After completing training and passing exams, they receive the primary officer rank of junior lieutenant of the medical service,- &#8211; said Yaroslava Semirunchyk. Currently, the 12th recruitment for such a course is underway at the Military Medical Academy. In total, 251 servicemen have already been retrained. This made it possible to fill a significant number of medical positions. As ArmyInform reported, civilian doctors also have the opportunity get the rank of officer. But it will take them 4 months. In particular, doctors fit for service who do not have a military education can apply to military departments of medical higher education institutions. In four months of training, they can obtain the rank of officer for further service in the Armed Forces in positions of their own profile.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/25/yak-medyku-staty-oficzerom-za-40-dniv/	2024-12-24T20:46:14-08:00
Faster, higher, as far as possible: France and Italy created a new version of the Aster 30 missile, ...	Designed to provide advanced defense against sophisticated air threats, including ballistic missiles, this missile was presented as an important element of the European defense strategy. During a recent real-time demonstration at the Biscarross test site, the Aster 30 B1NT successfully handled complex threat simulations, demonstrating its capabilities in high-intensity scenarios. Portal Defense network disclosed some technical data of the newest charge. Designed for use with both the ground-based SAMP/T-NG system and naval systems such as PAAMS, the Aster 30 B1NT missile is capable of intercepting high-speed targets at ranges of over 150 kilometers and altitudes of up to 25 kilometers. Equipped with a high-precision Ka-band radar, this missile is capable of engaging both ballistic and hypersonic missiles. This capability positions the Aster 30 B1NT as a credible European alternative to comparable systems such as the US Patriot, which until recently was widely regarded as the world's leading anti-missile defense option. -Aster 30 B1 NT will be equipped with units of the armed forces of France and Italy, which will operate ground-based air defense systems of the new generation SAMP-T, which are planned to be put into service by 2026. This system is capable of intercepting hypersonic missiles, countering threats in 360 degrees and doing it in a multi-layered way,- emphasized the Minister of Defense of the French Republic Sebastien Lecornu, who was present at the first tests of the warhead. The comments of the Army Recognition site received from European experts indicate that while American Patriot, widely used by NATO armed forces and well known for its effectiveness against short-range ballistic and cruise missiles, the Aster 30 B1NT has greater versatility and intercept medium-range ballistic missiles and high-altitude targets including hypersonic missiles. Most of all, the SAMP/T-NG system, which can be deployed both autonomously and in addition to other NATO defense systems, provides increased flexibility in terms of interoperability and rapid response. Countries such as Belgium, which recently expressed interest in acquiring the SAMP/T-NG system, underline the appeal of the Aster 30 B1NT in Europe. By opting for a European system rather than an American one, Belgium intends to move to greater strategic autonomy while facilitating the integration of its defense capabilities with those of France and Italy, which are currently users of the system. In Brussels, it is emphasized that the adoption of the Aster 30 B1NT would also allow Europe to improve its defense capabilities and optimize the resources of the European military-industrial complex within the framework of the EU with the support of expanded cooperation programs. By participating in the development of the Aster 30 B1NT, the European companies MBDA and Thales demonstrate their ability to compete with the American leaders of such products, contributing to the technological sovereignty of Europe and promoting autonomous defense solutions. Thus, as emphasize European media, this missile meets Europe's goal of reducing dependence on American anti-missile systems by maintaining a high level of protection against complex threats. European commentary notes that as other European countries may soon join France and Italy in deploying the Aster 30 B1NT, this missile could become a cornerstone of European air defenses, strengthening the continent's security against various threats. As reported by ArmyInform , the government of the French Republic attached Aster 30 missiles to aid packages to Ukraine. Aster 30 B1NT rocket test launches.

Why did the Russian Federation launch the IPSO on the exchange of prisoners	In addition, propaganda telegram channels continue to spread fake news that Ukraine is allegedly disrupting the exchange of prisoners of war, citing fake lists of mobilized people who previously had no relation to the army. These are all fakes. First, the Institute for the Study of War did not publish this video on its resources. The video was edited from publicly available materials. In particular, the propagandists took the footage of the released commanders who led the defense of Azovstal from their first video statement after returning from Russian captivity in September 2022. And the footage of the return of the Ukrainian military from captivity was taken by fakers from a video published on October 19, 2024 on the official Telegram channel of Volodymyr Zelenskyi. Alan Scheinwald, who allegedly says that the Ukrainian authorities prefer soldiers of the so-called -nationalist battalions-, because they are more ideologically motivated, not a military expert, but an American investor. In addition, the footage where he seems to be commenting on the strategy of the Ukrainian authorities in exchanging prisoners of war is taken from a video from August 2019. In it, Sheinwald talks about his career as an investor, the company he founded, what services he provides, etc. And, of course, the divisions were incorrectly named in the fake. -Azov- is not a battalion, but a brigade, and -Kraken- is a special unit of the Main Directorate of Intelligence. With such fakes, Russian propaganda tries to discredit Ukraine and the prisoner exchange process. In particular, it is Russia that purposefully does not exchange captured defenders of Mariupol. However, Ukraine consistently advocates the exchange of prisoners, and President Zelenskyi's proposal to exchange -all for all- is ignored by Russia itself. Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets noted that her statements about Ukraine's rejection of exchanges are part of an information and psychological operation (IPSO).	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/25/dlya-chogo-rf-zapustyla-ipso-pro-obmin-polonenymy/	2024-12-24T20:09:11-08:00
From the new year, the occupiers will begin importing cultural workers from the Russian Federation t...	About this reports Center of National Resistance. Within the framework of the program, the enemy plans to establish 1.1 thousand on TOT. Russian For agreeing to move to TOT, the tourist must receive a one-time payment of 2 million rubles. The reason for the program is the refusal of Ukrainians to work for the enemy and mass exodus, which led to a shortage of personnel in the industry.

Export volumes of Russian electricity are decreasing	reports this Service of foreign intelligence of Ukraine. During the winter, deliveries to China may stop altogether. In fact, the main problems of the drop in exports are the wear and tear of the infrastructure, high losses of electricity and insufficient flows between the energy systems of the Far East and Siberia. By 2030, the energy deficit in the Far East will reach 10 billion kWh and 3 GW of capacity, because the Kremlin does not have enough money to support the relevant infrastructure, and instead of developing its own country, it continues the war against Ukraine.

The professional standard -Military Accounting Inspector- has been registered in Ukraine.	Colonel Oleksiy Dudka, one of the developers of the mentioned standard and the chief specialist of the Department of the Central Department of Military Education and Science of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, told the ArmiyaInform correspondent in more detail about this. -According to the current legislation, we must keep military records in every enterprise. There are more than a million enterprises in Ukraine, and there are still no specialists who know exactly what to do in this position. This standard, as a document, will from now on be a beacon to which you can orient yourself: what should a person in such a position do in all enterprises of Ukraine where military records are kept. And now it is everywhere,- noted Oleksiy Dudka. According to him, the professional standard -Military Accounting Inspector-, which was registered on December 19, is a national document: -Now, any company that plans to hire a specialist - a military accounting inspector - having read this, will know what kind of person needs to be hired, so that they have a military record, so that they have there were no fines. Because the state has taken this issue quite seriously.- The officer emphasized that before the large-scale intrusion into the military records, they did not receive as much attention as they do now. -Now, when the issue of mobilization and the availability of personnel is on the agenda, the state has seriously begun to think about it, and there are no real experts on this issue. The mentioned standard organizes these issues, both for employers who hire these specialists, and for ordinary citizens, conscripts, who work in all enterprises of our country. At the very least, the specialist who will occupy this position will be able to tell how to comply with the laws of Ukraine in the performance of his military duty, how to avoid fines from the TCC and SP, what needs to be done for this, and how to properly perform this duty before the state,- added Oleksiy Dudka. He emphasized that this standard is a guide for all people who, as of now, know too little to finally solve the mobilization issues in our country: -The first thing businesses that will familiarize themselves with this standard should do is send their specialist to training . Currently, about two dozen educational institutions conduct advanced training courses where this science is taught to one degree or another. And after completing such courses, a specialist from the enterprise will meet this standard. And then the quality of mobilization work, starting with a small enterprise and ending with the scale of the state, will increase significantly, and in a geometric progression&#8230; And, talking about the work on this standard, I can't help but mention that it was also born thanks to the fact that I, as one of the developers, was actively helped by my colleagues. This is the ideologue of the -Oberig- system, Colonel Oleksandr Pravdyvets and Colonel Oleg Pavlovsky, who has been taking care of military accounting issues in the country for many years. And in general, the standard is the result of the work of a working group with representatives from the Ministry of Defense, the General Staff and the scientific community, because the group included 3 doctors of science and 2 candidates for doctors of science.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/24/v-ukrayini-zareyestrovano-profesijnyj-standart-inspektor-z-vijskovogo-obliku/	2024-12-24T09:53:59-08:00

The occupiers' base in Luhansk was exposed thanks to the imprudence of a Russian colonel	About this reports Center of National Resistance. Among the entire array of data, the Defense Forces received lists of Russian Guard personnel who participated in the armed aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine. Also, the testimony of the punisher was received about war crimes against the Ukrainian civilian population, in particular about the sweeps of the Rosguard in the villages of the Luhansk region and the taking -to the basement- of those who caused any suspicion of disloyalty to the occupier. In addition, Machkur revealed the location of the Russian occupation forces in the temporarily occupied Luhansk. During a careless and frivolous conversation with his lover, the Rosguard wanted to brag about his -achievements- and sent a photo of the place where he and his henchmen were staying. Through OSNT-reconnaissance and photo analysis, it was established that the building in the photo taken by the criminal is the former Luhansk-Avto building, located in the village of Katerynivka (Yuvileyne) in the suburbs of Luhansk. Coordinates: (48.56169529658107, 39.18334084019029). The Defense Forces of Ukraine did not take long to respond. The testimony of the occupier himself to his lover will be quite eloquent - he then correctly understood that the attack was carried out by local Ukrainian patriots. The Russian Guardsman also specified the losses of the Russians - more than ten -boys- returned to their native regions in comfortable packages.

More than half of Russians dream of the return of the death penalty	About this reports the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. Such a high level of support for the death penalty indicates the accumulation of aggression in Russian society. Residents of small towns and villages speak -for- - 58%. In large and medium-sized cities, 49% support the death penalty. 55% of men and 50% of women support the reinstatement of the execution. The biggest opponents of this initiative are persons under the age of 29 (61%). With age, the number of supporters increases — among people aged 60 and over, 65% support the death penalty. In support of the return of the highest degree of punishment, people without higher education are also more likely to express their support - 60%. Among respondents with a higher education, there are equal numbers of supporters and opponents (47% each). The purpose of updating the issue of the death penalty in the Russian Federation is the desire to strengthen the government's control over the population through intimidation and pressure, as well as the Kremlin's demonstration of its -activity- in the fight against terrorism and crime. We remind you that in the temporarily occupied territories, the Russians continue to organize lectures on -their heroes - for teenagers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/24/bilshe-polovyny-rosiyan-mriyut-pro-povernennya-smertnoyi-kary/	2024-12-24T05:32:59-08:00
The invaders get rid of the personal belongings of the owners of the apartments at the TOT of Luhans...	This reports the head of Luhansk OVA Artem Lysohor. The quality of work remains low. However, as before, valuable things disappear. Excess, according to the occupiers, are thrown into the trash. That's where homeowners find some property. It should also be noted that these repairmen do not pay anything for a temporary stay in someone else's apartment. Utility bills are issued to the owners. The result is debts, lack of things and, in the best case, replacement of radiators with similar ones. Individuals in Lysychansk are allowed to conduct business prohibited for others. For example, for 25 thousand rubles, wealthier citizens are offered equipment for using the Internet, which is turned off by the Russians in the front-line zone. The option is unreliable, without a provider and guarantees. But the occupiers are unable to offer anything better than buying an antenna, and with it the opportunity to steal.

The Russian IPSO sings a rap about dodgers	His video and audio are used in social networks to create a negative image of TCC employees and military personnel involved in the mobilization. This, in the opinion of the Center for Combating Disinformation, indicates the activation of another disinformation campaign aimed at disrupting mobilization and discrediting the military and political leadership of Ukraine. By discrediting the mobilization, the Russian Federation is trying to incite hatred and create tension among Ukrainians. Russia is not the first to use the TikTok social network to achieve its strategic goals in the information war against Ukraine. Back in April of this year, the enemy launched the information campaign -Ukhlyant- aimed at disrupting the mobilization. And in July, a large number of captioned videos circulated about the -intolerability- of life in Ukraine in the context of war and blackouts, with calls to leave for other countries. It is worth noting that the main feature of all such videos is the accusation of the Ukrainian authorities, not the Russian Federation, which is waging a terrorist war against our state. The creation and distribution of such destructive materials plays into Russian propaganda and fits into the Russian strategy of undermining Ukraine's defense capabilities, in which the enemy has invested large resources since the very beginning of a full-scale invasion.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/24/rosijske-ipso-spivaye-rep-pro-uhylyantiv/	2024-12-23T20:46:14-08:00

ArmiyaInform correspondents visited one of the firing positions of the second artillery battery of the self-propelled artillery division of the brigade and talked with the crew of the British AS-90 installation. The guys talked about the combat capabilities of the artillery system, its advantages in the battle against Soviet installations, the destroyed -fat- Russian targets, how they work in the conditions of the enemy's UAVs and why the Russians are mad and can't get our gunners. We leave in the morning in full gear, we move in two cars. We quickly leave settlements where peaceful residents live. Further on, there is no asphalt, we drive along broken country roads for quite a long time. -Now hold on, this section of the road must be skipped as soon as possible. Enemy UAVs are operating,- says the commander of the second self-propelled artillery battery to the Patron fighter jet that accompanies us to the position. We do not drive through, but -fly over- this road and break into a destroyed settlement, many of which were destroyed by the enemy in Donetsk region. Cars in shelter, and get to know the gunners themselves. We look around. A typical village in the steppe part of the Donetsk region, simple Ukrainians once lived here. Now there are completely ransacked residential buildings, burned cars in yards, broken fences, and farmsteads torn by shrapnel from projectiles. In a word, the Rashists did not leave a living place, just an -ideal picture- of the post-apocalypse, from some horror movie. Enemy positions are no more than 7 km. Battery commander Yevgeny with the call sign -Patron- says: the British artillery has excellent combat capabilities and during fire missions shows itself only from a positive side. Advantages of the AS-90: very fast targeting and firing, armored protection and mobility. The effective firing range is up to 24 km, and the maximum range with active-reactive projectiles is up to 30 km. Compared to the Soviet -Gvozdika- and -Akatsia- artillery installations, the British AS-90 has a great advantage in both accuracy and range. The installation weighs 45 tons, armed with a 155 mm cannon. The machine is equipped with an autonomous navigation system and automatic gun aiming. The gun is loaded thanks to the delivery system, and the installation of an additional tray allows for quick loading after each shot. In addition, there is an opportunity to load the gun manually in case of a malfunction. The tower rotates 360 degrees. This is very important in battle. Each gun is equipped with a radar to measure the initial velocity of the projectile. Crew of 5: Gun Commander, Gunner, Service Number Master, Service Number and Driver Mechanic. -From the moment of receiving the coordinates of the targets, setting the firing task, preparing and leaving the self-propelled guns to the firing positions (100-150 m from the -hideout-), targeting a specific target and practicing strikes on the enemy, it takes 4.5 minutes. In modern conditions of warfare, this is an extremely powerful indicator. We are very satisfied with this artillery system,- says Combatant Patron. By the way, the gun's rate of fire is up to 6 shots per minute. The guys call the AS-90 a -tracked sniper- for a reason. Enemy targets destroyed by gunners are diverse: command and observation points (control points), field warehouses with ammunition, self-propelled artillery installations, rocket salvo fire systems -Grady- and -Hurricanes-, tanks, BMPs, armored personnel carriers, some shelters and other defensive structures of the Rashits . Hitting enemy manpower counts as a very small target for gunners. -They recently performed a combat mission. Our UAV-reconnaissance units reported to us: they discovered the KSP of the Rashist battalion. The video showed that it was camouflaged and well fortified. So, with the very first -target- projectile, we definitely hit the -top ten-. The success was confirmed with the second projectile, completely dismantling the enemy's anti-tank missile system. Later it was found out that it was a fat target: the combatant and many invaders were destroyed. Obviously, this was their headquarters,- says the gun commander Yaroslav. The boys no longer keep any statistics of Russian military targets hit. They say there are so many that they simply don't keep track of what was destroyed. -Even in the first month, when we were transferred here to the Pokrovsky direction, I counted every hit target. Now it's simply banal that there isn't enough strength and time to do it,- adds the -Patron- combatant. Our gunners work powerfully within the limits of counter-battery struggle. These are tens, if not hundreds, of various enemy artillery systems affected. Therefore, for the enemy, artillery calculation and AS-90 self-propelled guns are a priority target. Right during the recording of the interview with the Patron battery commander, enemy UAVs attacked the AS-90 self-propelled guns. At that time, we were very close by in a ruined house. There was an explosion. As it turned out, the Russian ZALA drone was working in the sky above us, which is designed to conduct reconnaissance at any time of the day with real-time video transmission. He adjusted the -Lancet- barrage ammunition to our artillery installation. But it didn't hit, it exploded nearby. Fortunately, the guys camouflaged our -SAUSHKA- well, so it's not so easy to detect it, even from the air, it's another -quest-task-. Let's go to the AS-90 installation for a second, everything is fine with it. Nearby we see smoke from the impact. The command -Into shelter- sounds. Threat of re-strike from the air. We quickly run to the basement of the house. We'll hack it below. -The enemy is flying around here. There is no safe place. It is necessary to always be -on track-. There are days when up to 15 UAVs of different types are in the sky at the same time. A few days ago, we destroyed their Hrads, we heard their interceptions: they are in shock and furious, and we are in high spirits,- the gunner boys say. Not even a few minutes pass - there is an explosion again. The battery commander is informed: enemy FPV drones are operating. We hear the blow again! They sat in the shelter for more than two hours. During this time, katsaps attacked the broken buildings of the former village about ten times. I ask: what about the self-propelled guns? Will it withstand direct hits from kamikaze drones? -It will last: the gunners affirmatively say. Ours in Kurshchyna were performing tasks, up to 9 FPV drones were hit by AS-90s and the armor could not withstand anything, the crew remained alive, only the good one was concussed,- the gunners answer. -In the Pokrovsky direction, the enemy is now using FPV drones that work on optical fiber. Therefore, it is not possible to suppress them with EW means. And this is a big problem for us. For the most part, our mobile fire groups work on such drones, we use anti-drone rifles and small arms,- ​​explains Yulia, head of the communications department of the 117th separate heavy mechanized brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. By the way, Yulia was also in the shelter with us during the air strikes of the Russian Federation. And at the same time, she made a video inclusion in the telethon about the operational situation in the Pokrovsky direction. It's good that the guys had Starlink, there were no problems with communication. -This is our job. The information front, as well as combat operations, is not stopped by anyone, so we have to work in Spartan combat conditions,- says Yulia and adds: it is much more difficult for our gunners here. We continue to communicate with the guys in the basement. The British self-propelled gunners of the brigade received for armament more than a year ago. Before that, the entire personnel of the self-propelled artillery division studied at the Royal School of Artillery in Great Britain. Intensive preparation lasted more than a month. They studied the tactical and technical characteristics, equipment and combat capabilities of the equipment. Mastered not difficult -repair operations- on the self-propelled guns. Exams were taken at the training grounds of Misty Albion. -The first combat use of AS-90 in Ukraine was in the Bakhmut direction, then in Zaporizhzhia in the Rabotyno region. With the beginning of the offensive operation of the Ukrainian Defense Forces, a battery of British self-propelled guns was used in the Kursk region. They piled on the Rashists on their own territory. The intensity of combat tasks was extremely high. It happened that more than 100 shells were launched in a day. Now -British female snipers- are successfully working in the Pokrovsky direction,- says the -Patron- combatant. In combat calculations, people of different age categories, from different regions of Ukraine. All are called up for mobilization. People are motivated and energized. Battery Commander Yevgeny, nicknamed Patron, is a 2023 graduate of the Missile Forces and Artillery Department of the National Army Academy. He is from Chernivtsi. Immediately after graduation, he got the position of senior officer of a self-propelled battery in the 117th brigade. Very soon he was promoted to battery commander. Patron is a leader, you can feel it right away. Guys respect him. He is for the battery gunner team as a playmaker on the football field or as they say in football -classic ten-. Only here on the battlefield, this is not a football game, but a real war. Every -tactical combination-, every pass of -tens-, every order to a subordinate is valuable here! Yuliya, head of the communications department of the 117th brigade, told ArmiyaInform about the situation in the Pokrovsky direction: -The main task of the artillery is to destroy the enemy's forces and means by fire. This is a tremendous help for our infantry who are on the front line. Our defenders from artillery installations are literally tearing apart the occupiers and holding back the enemy's onslaught in Donetsk region. Ammunition is provided to us in sufficient quantity. This is help from our foreign partners. Overall, the situation is difficult but under control. The guys are doing their heroic work on the front lines every day. Regarding countering enemy UAVs. Our team includes pilots of unmanned systems that fly to the same altitude as the Russian UAVs -Lancet- and -Zala-. And the boys manage to knock them down. How they do it, let's leave it a secret.- Yulia also said that the enemy has already started using North Korean-made remote mining systems: -These are cluster munitions. How it works is that sub-munitions are -poured out- from the cartridge, which explode instantly on the terrain or are timed and then go off on command when the enemy needs it. &#8230; -We do not observe air means of defeating the enemy.- -Zala- to 1 km from us- - came the report of the -Patron- combatant. It's getting dark outside. The guys say: the -window of opportunity- has arrived, you can leave the positions while the katsaps charge the next FPV drones. Farewell, thanks to the gunners for their work! Our cars quickly left the destroyed village and set off on the seemingly endless Donbas roads towards civilization.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/24/snajperka-na-gusenyczyah-yak-brytanska-sau-as-90-rozryvaye-voroga-na-pokrovskomu-napryamku/	2024-12-23T20:34:04-08:00
Army fashion for parallelograms: a European consortium has developed a barrage munition with a diamo...	As French engineers indicate in the presentation release, the drone with diamond-shaped wing is equipped with a pyrotechnic payload suitable for hitting different types of targets, such as vehicles with different armor protection. Analyzing the reasons for such innovation from, first of all, specialists of the leading European developer and manufacturer of missile systems, which is MBDA, experts of the defense portal Army Recognition concluded that this new addition to the MBDA arsenal is a strategic entry into the munitions market, for which international demand is increasing due to recent conflicts, including long war in Ukraine. Raijin's RD-120 combines innovative Fly-R technology with MBDA's operational expertise, offering the military a flexible, powerful solution for engaging enemy forces in dynamic battlefield conditions. The RD-120 Raijin ammunition is designed with an emphasis on flexibility, power and accuracy. Equipped with a high-performance day/night camera, it can detect, identify and engage targets in a variety of lighting conditions. The munition contains a tunable pyrotechnic charge that adapts to the armor level of various targets, from light vehicles to heavily armored vehicles, maximizing mission effectiveness. When folded, the RD-120 Raijin is 250mm wide, 255mm high and 1195mm long, allowing for compact storage and transport. When deployed, its wings automatically deploy to a deployed size of 1,215mm wide, 225mm high and 1,070mm long. With a maximum take-off weight (MTOW) of 5 kg and a payload capacity of up to 1.5 kg, the Raijin is compact yet powerful. The propulsion system of this munition is driven by an electric motor, which provides a wide operational speed range from 95 km/h to 200 km/h, depending on mission requirements. Raijin's RD-120 is launched from a portable tube launcher, reaching an initial speed of 95 km/h, which it can quickly increase to a cruising speed of 110 km/h. After entering the attack phase, the Raijin accelerates to an impressive dive speed of 270 km/h, delivering a quick and powerful strike to the target. It has a range of up to 50 km, with an endurance of 45 minutes at cruising speed, making it well-suited for long missions and wide battlefield coverage. Raijin is capable of working at an altitude of up to 3,000 meters. meters, which gives it an advantage on various and difficult terrains. One of the defining characteristics of the RD-120 Raijin is its diamond-shaped wing configuration. This unique design improves maneuverability and reduces wingspan and overall weight by about a third, providing a high lift coefficient and greater stability in flight. This design allows the Raijin to perform fast, precise maneuvers while maintaining flight stability even at high speeds, and to approach targets at steep angles, ideal for sudden and precise strikes. Designed for rapid deployment, the RD-120 Raijin can be launched directly from a reusable shipping container. Its autonomous flight mode can be overridden by a ground operator who verifies target identification and gives the final engagement order. Advanced targeting algorithms developed by Fly-R guarantee precise positioning, providing exceptional accuracy on both stationary and moving targets. In the attack phase, the diamond-shaped wing design further improves the drone's visual, acoustic and thermal stealth, making it difficult for adversaries to detect or intercept. With a take-off weight of 5 kg, including 1.5 kg of payload, the RD-120 Raijin offers a substantial combination of power and efficiency. Its adaptability and various attack parameters allow it to meet operational needs in various combat scenarios, from precision strikes on high-value targets to group operations with other drones. The Raijin's efficiency, maneuverability and tactical flexibility make it an attractive choice for countries looking to expand their capabilities with advanced munitions. By bringing the RD-120 Raijin to the defense market, MBDA and Fly-R aim to capitalize on growing demand, positioning the Raijin as an important asset for militaries seeking to enhance their precision strike capabilities.

Destroyed three tanks in one shift: the story of the operator of ATGM Vitaly	Vitaly was born in 1968, from Chernihiv Oblast. What does a soldier who has destroyed three enemy tanks in one turn feel? But what happened when he hit the sledge on which the enemy was transporting ammunition? The soldier told our correspondent about this. -In 2022, the Katsapas advanced through our village to Nizhyn. For more than a month, while I was in the village, I counted and recorded how many and what kind of enemy equipment passed by us. And he passed it on to guys he knew from TrO. Thanks to this, a lot of Katsapa equipment was destroyed at that time. My backpack was already packed from the first day. I knew I was going to fight. And after the liberation of our village, I went to the TCC. And in 2023, my son also went to fight. Currently, he performs tasks in the Kupyansk direction. &#8230;For me, the best ATGM is Stugna. Because there is an opportunity to observe, bring to the target and see an accurate hit, be sure that the target is destroyed. There was an interesting episode in winter. I saw that the enemy on sleds was bringing ammunition and food to the forest strip where their positions were. My commander gave the go-ahead to destroy the enemy with a high-explosive fragmentation projectile. Well, I hit the target. You could see how everything was flying around there, how pieces were flying from them. They had -two hundred-, -three hundred-. Therefore, the enemy did not receive either ammunition or food. I also had a day when I destroyed three tanks. Then in the morning, around 8 o'clock, the enemy began to storm our positions. Three of their tanks left. And before that, our boys had already beaten up their other cars a little. And new tanks were hiding behind them, firing at our positions. They were driving, there was a lot of dust and smoke. So I had to be guided and guess a little by the shots, by the flashes&#8230; I brought it to the target, fired and the hit was recorded. Sometime after lunch, around two o'clock in the afternoon, the commander relayed on the radio that there was movement of enemy equipment. I noticed that there was dust behind the forest strip. I looked closely at where that tank could be hit. Found a gap in the forest strip where there are no trees. I went there in advance and waited for the tank to drive there. He just drove in, and I immediately conducted a rocket launch on him. And this tank did not even have time to fire a single shot. And was destroyed. The commander also told us about the third tank. We started watching, found this car. It was a little more difficult, because the tank was far away and hiding behind the trees. I came up, fired a shot. The rocket had to be raised a little to hit the target, because the trees there were a little in the way. Well, he still hit, the tank was destroyed. The adrenaline that day was good, I wanted to beat them again and again. I remember another case&#8230; Once an enemy tank and two BMPs drove out of the forest strip. And they were moving, they wanted to break through to our infantry. But we reacted in time. I was not yet an operator at that time, but simply helped, changed rockets, observed. We then had only high-explosive fragmentation missiles. But we still fired shots. The tank was hit, but it was shrapnel: we did not hit it. But he got scared and ran away. Similarly, BMP had a hit. She went beyond the forest line and caught fire there. And the third BMP&#8230; also just ran away. And this is how we helped our infantry units: the katsaps did not harm them.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/24/znyshhyv-try-tanky-za-odne-cherguvannya-istoriya-operatora-ptrk-vitaliya/	2024-12-23T20:05:37-08:00

To be near and take care of the spirit of the Ukrainian soldier: graduation of military chaplains of...	The unit's military chaplain is the one they turn to for comfort and support.

Four training courses for military chaplains are planned for next year 2025. Also, not only military chaplains, but also their assistants take courses here. Military chaplain assistants are just as important as chaplains. They are, first of all, guards and assistants of our military chaplains, who are always close to them in the army and take care of their safety. We will also have another course, a higher level. This is a training course for officers of the Military Chaplaincy Service,- said Oleksandr Vovkotecha. And the deputy head of the Military Chaplaincy Service of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Colonel Lubomyr Yakibchuk, said that the Military Institute of Taras Shevchenko Kyiv National University is the only educational institution in which military chaplains of the Armed Forces are trained under a special training program in accordance with the requirements of the Law of Ukraine -On Military Chaplaincy Service- of Ukraine. -The program was jointly developed by the Military Chaplaincy Service in accordance with the requirements set by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine regarding, in fact, the training of tactical-level officers.

Even 300 boats with infantry, and it is this kind of landing that scares the Russians, will not be able to help them. -A few volleys of cluster munitions and they went to feed the crayfish. the Russians already have the experience of forcing the Siverskyi Donets river and let them remember it. How many losses have they suffered both in manpower and in combat equipment. Although the Siversky Donets is several times narrower than the Dnipro,- noted Vladyslav Voloshyn. As reported by ArmyInform , Soldiers of the units of active actions of the GUR, performing combat tasks on the southern front, destroy invaders and Russian equipment with the help of artillery and FPV drones.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/23/shturmy-v-pidtrymku-rakiv-bilya-dniprovskyh-ostroviv-chlenystonogi-gotovi-benketuvaty-rosiyanamy/	2024-12-23T04:57:50-08:00

About this on the broadcast of the telethon -Edyny Novyny- the spokesman of the OTU -Kharkiv- told - lieutenant colonel Yevhenii Romanov. According to him, the Russians use the equipment infrequently, mainly for transporting attack aircraft. They attack at night or under cover of rain, snow or fog. -Well, they haven't moved in columns for a long time. Sometimes there are mechanized assaults, but this technique is detected in time and destroyed even on the far frontiers. The main task of reconnaissance, artillery, and unmanned systems is to destroy these groups as far as possible from the position where the enemy infantry is waiting,- Yevgeny Romanov noted. As reported by ArmyInform , in the north of Kharkiv Oblast, the weather situation is difficult - fog and rain require extraordinary efforts from Ukrainian drone operators.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/23/kolonamy-davno-ne-sunut-na-harkivskomu-napryamku-mehanizovani-ataky-rosiyan-ridkist/	2024-12-23T04:08:29-08:00

A guard at a Russian torture chamber campaigned to join the Russian army, but he was detained	The SBU informs about this on December 23. -The figure is a junior inspector of the Kherson remand prison, who supported the Rashists at the start of a full-scale war. For this, he was -appointed- as a guard in the Russian torture chamber, which the enemy had set up in the building of the captured pre-trial detention center,- the report says. While in the -post-, the traitor guarded the cells in which the occupiers imprisoned local residents en masse. Most of the victims were among the members of the resistance movement in the southern region of Ukraine. In addition, the person involved promoted his acquaintances to join the occupation institution of the Russian Federation, promising potential candidates a -salary- in rubles and loyal treatment from the aggressor. -After the liberation of Kherson, the perpetrator tried to avoid justice and for this purpose constantly changed his place of residence. Law enforcement officers located the traitor and detained him. -During the search, a mobile phone with evidence of his crimes was seized from the suspect,- the report said. Currently, the detainee has been notified of suspicion under two articles of the Criminal Code of Ukraine: The perpetrator is in custody. He faces life imprisonment with confiscation of property.

From ammunition to UAVs: the organizer of transporting men abroad with an arsenal of weapons was det...	About this informs December 23 State Border Service of Ukraine. In the course of implementing this information, the men were detained by border guards near the border. While communicating with the detainees, the border guards learned that each of them paid the main organizer of the illegal scheme 10,000 euros for illegal trips to a neighboring country. -At that time, it was not possible to detain the organizer himself. However, the border guards continued the measures to establish his location and finally achieved a result,- said the DPSU. As part of open criminal proceedings under the procedural guidance of the prosecutor's office, border guards together with representatives of the National Police and military counter-intelligence of the SBU conducted an authorized search at the residence of the main figure in the case. As a result of the search of the residence of the main figure in the case, law enforcement officers discovered and seized 2 carbines with magazines, 570 cartridges for them, 2 pistols with magazines and about 300 cartridges for them. They also seized 4 RGD-5 grenades, an F-1 grenade, a smoke grenade, 7 fuses for grenades and 7 detonation initiators, 6 lines for remote electrical detonation of explosive devices, a radio station, 2 UAVs, a package with a green substance of plant origin, cash . In addition, the offender had a special uniform with the insignia of the National Police and the Security Service of Ukraine and forged identification cards, which he used to deliver his -clients- to the border. In addition, the law enforcement officers seized 2 cars, which were also used in illegal schemes.

According to Nazar Voloshyn, the occupiers abandoned the tactics of head-on assaults on populated areas. Now they are trying to block transport arteries and cut off logistics from our defenders. And they liked to use kamikaze. -In the Kurakhiv direction, in particular in Kurakhiv, the occupiers use such tactics. They find suicide bombers who take tank mines with them. Trying to break through the fire of our defenders, these mines are thrown into the building. In this way, they are destroying urban buildings,- Nazar Voloshyn said. As reported by ArmyInform , on the eastern front, the enemy works in combination, changing the tactics of assaults and using equipment in a measured manner.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/23/shturmy-zhyvymy-minamy-okupanty-polyubyly-taktyku-dzhyhadystiv/	2024-12-23T02:11:39-08:00

The Russian crew is trying to fix the problem and is drifting in the open sea near Portugal. Meanwhile, the remnants of the Russian contingent in Syria have finished withdrawing from remote areas and are in only two places - the air base in Khmeimim and the naval base in Tartus. Russia began to transfer some of its weapons and equipment from the port of Tartusa by sea to Libya. Also, the Russian military in Syria is actively discussing the alleged demand of the new authorities of the Arab republic to Moscow to completely withdraw its military contingent from the Syrian territory, in particular from the bases in Khmeimim and Tartus, no later than February 20, 2025. This move is allegedly related to the desire of the new government in Damascus to achieve the lifting of international sanctions.

The high technology of modern warfare, -Oreshnik- and the elections in the USA: an interview with Ol...	Oleksandr Zavitnevich, head of the Committee on National Security, Defense and Intelligence, gave the answers to these questions to ArmyInform. —Recently, we passed the 1,000-day mark of the beginning of the great Russian war against Ukraine. You are the head of the committee, which in terms of subjects takes a leading place in strengthening the country's defense capabilities. By request, you are one of the most informed officials about the realities on the front line, the capabilities of our defense forces and the enemy. Based on all this, what are your main conclusions from the specified period of the great war of the Russian Federation against Ukraine? — To list and reveal all the conclusions, a separate interview will be required, but if we talk very briefly about the main thing, then they boil down to this: the first — all of us, who have the opportunity for working days, owe an gratuitous debt to our Heroes, who gave their lives in the fight against the Rashists, and by those who are currently in the ranks of the defense forces protecting us from missile terror, restraining the Russian onslaught, protecting Ukraine and the entire civilized world from Russian evil. This awareness should be perceived not just as an element of politeness, but as the main motivator of our further resistance and indomitability, stability and even revenge against the enemy for all the troubles and misfortunes that he brought to our land, for the death of our sisters and brothers. We should also be grateful to all those who prioritized helping the front, helping the veterans of this war, and the families of fallen soldiers as the main priority of their lives; the second is that we are a nation of invincibles. So it was and will be! But the harsh realities of war are that we will be supported and helped as long as we demonstrate unity, as long as we ourselves believe and fight, as long as we are unyielding and unceasing in our pursuit of Victory and a just peace; the third - high technology has become the main feature of modern war, its importance will continue to grow. The enemy greatly exceeds us in numbers and resources, and we will not be able to compete with him in this matter. This means that we are doomed to defeat it technologically, with new models of OIT, advanced methods of warfare. We have to be more mobile, unreachable for the enemy in terms of creativity and ingenuity. Only the national defense industry, which is able to meet the needs of the Armed Forces to the maximum, is a reliable guarantee of maintaining their combat capability both in peacetime and during war. Our stability, successful defense and victory directly depends on the growth of the Ukrainian defense industry. — In your opinion, what are the strengths of the enemy, why is he still able to continue the creeping occupation, increase the production of military equipment, including those recently used against Ukraine as the Oreshnik missile? — Summarizing all factors , we can say this—the strength of the Russian Federation lies in the weakness of the measures taken to force the Russian Federation to a just peace. The Russian Federation is successful only because it feels impunity, indecisiveness in making decisions that Ukraine offers in order for the enemy to realize the futility of continuing the war, so that every day, every hour he feels the exorbitant price he has to pay for every millimeter of success. In addition, the rhetoric and consciousness of a certain part of the Western political community is dominated by the thesis that security assistance to Ukraine is only to contain the Russian Federation. But our President, Ukrainian diplomacy and the deputies are trying to convey that this is an extremely narrow perception of war. We call for aid and international support for Ukraine to be part of the general Euro-analytical strategy of forcing Putin to a just peace on the basis of the UN, recognition of the territorial integrity of Ukraine. The components of this strategy are the invitation of Ukraine to NATO, the closing of the Ukrainian skies by the Alliance forces, the removal of any restrictions on strikes deep into the territory of the Russian Federation, the filling of the security system with such types of IPT that will affect the ability of the Russian Federation to wage war. All this is clearly stated in the doctrinal documents presented by President Zelensky. Their implementation directly depends on the political will of the leadership of European states and the leadership of the United States. As for -Oreshnik- and other modified samples of the enemy's OiVT, this is a direct consequence of the ineffectiveness of sanctions against the Russian Federation. Visible proof of this is that the lethal weapons used by the enemy against the civilian population contain between 60 and 80 percent foreign components. Other reasons are that Ukraine has so far received all the necessary samples of long-range weapons, and we do not have the right to use those in the arsenal deep into the Russian Federation against the enemy's military-industrial capabilities. —The appearance of North Korean servicemen on the battlefield as part of the occupying forces. Someone says that this is an indicator of the weakness of the Russian Federation, the inability to independently achieve the goal of the so-called SVO. Other analysts say, on the contrary, that the indicator of power, the power to unite evil. What opinion do you hold? - Each of the following statements contains truth. Our unprecedented national resistance dispelled the myths about the greatness of the Russian Federation, its armed forces, which were ranked third in the world. Yes, the enemy is insidious, capable of getting stronger, but, as the Ukrainians proved, he is not invincible. Yes, the enemy has significant resources and power, but they are vulnerable to Ukrainian cotton, and therefore the enemy is not invincible. It became obvious to everyone, even Putin and his henchmen, that the Russian Federation alone is incapable of occupying Ukraine and continuing the war. The fragile economy, the defense industry is facing a number of serious problems, its entire sectors are on the verge of bankruptcy. These are eloquent indicators of Russia's weakness and the main reasons for Russia's vassal dependence on China in the supply of energy resources, receiving military aid from North Korea, Iran. But the open participation of the North Korean military in the war against Ukraine should not only be perceived as a real factor in strengthening the enemy. This is also a danger of a strategic, global scale. Moscow is multiplying the subjectivity of the North Korean regime, which until recently was on the outskirts of major politics. The Kremlin seeks to strengthen its global subjectivity, to apply the tactics of the good cop and the bad cop. That is, he wants to frighten the world with the strengthening of North Korea, show his ability to influence Pyongyang and, against this background, look attractive for negotiations and compromises taking into account his own vested interests. —In the context of the difficulties faced by the enemy, it is worth mentioning that from the end of 2023, most analysts recognize a significant depletion of resources for the continuation of the war. This became almost the main reason why the struggle for the vision of its completion came to the fore in the information space. How can you comment on this? - War really requires colossal resources, its duration is known to all without exception to its participants. Today, the capabilities of our defense forces are heavily dependent on the security assistance and leadership of the United States, which in turn is derived, as you said, from the vision of ending the war. the kremlin daily produces tons of disinformation, grossly exaggerating its capabilities, distorts reality in every possible way, cynically and mercilessly manipulates the burdens of war. Moscow seems to offer a simple and quick solution to their end — pacification of its aggressive plans at the expense of Ukraine. The enemy's aspirations are obvious—to weaken the unity of partners, to convince them of the futility of supporting Ukraine. As for the Ukrainians, the effort is aimed at undermining national resistance from within through a destructive influence on Ukrainians' thoughts, attitudes, beliefs, attitudes towards the government, and perception of its decisions. - Can the restoration of the functioning of the Committee's page on the Facebook social network be considered as a countermeasure to the Russian information offensive? - Partly with this too. We consider the committee's Facebook page as another reliable source of information, its materials should contribute to increasing the media literacy of Ukrainians, their resistance to fakes and hostile IPSO. We aspire to ensure that the information on the committee's website does not give the enemy any chance of success in manipulating Ukrainian society on issues related to the committee. — What can Ukrainians expect from the results of the elections in the USA and the vision of the newly elected US President Trump and his team for the further course of the war? — First of all, let us recognize that the activities of the President, Ukrainian diplomacy, and parliamentarians ensure bicameral support for Ukraine. This is an extremely important factor for our defense capability. Yes, US President Trump really declared his intention to end the war in the shortest possible time. This completely coincides with the aspiration of Ukraine, but only with a significant addition - a fair conclusion. Today, the mass media is full of all kinds of statements and retelling of rumours. Some predict considerable support for Ukraine, others, on the contrary, the strengthening of Putin. I believe that it is necessary to wait for the official statement of the US leader. Kyiv and Washington maintain a working constructive dialogue, which, for obvious reasons, requires confidentiality. Therefore, it is unlikely that there is reliable information in the media. These are the thoughts of analysts, experts. But what I said above remains unchanged—we will be helped as long as we fight, as long as we are steadfast, persistent, unyielding in our pursuit of a just peace. —What legislation and committee decisions were most impactful to national defense and intelligence security in 2024?—Primarily, the mobilization bill. It was an urgent response to the security situation that developed on the front line and ensured a real strengthening of the defense forces. According to the information of representatives of the Ministry of Defense and the General Staff, after the law came into force, the number of mobilized men improved dramatically, military registration data through the TCC and the -Reserve+- application were updated for millions of conscripted men. The list of positive changes can be continued. However, this does not mean that the law will not be amended. Everything will depend on the development of the situation on the battlefield, in the defense sector, the initiatives of the Ministry of Defense, the General Assembly and the people's elected officials. There is no law that remains unchanged, frozen at the time of its creation. In the same context, I can mention the relevant changes to the laws regarding the following: In addition, a significant part of our work was devoted to the national defense industry. — This is about the national defense industry. How do you assess its capabilities and prospects for further development? - Our stability, successful defense and victory directly depend on the growth of the Ukrainian defense industry. Therefore, we not only hold cabinet meetings with the participation of representatives of ministries, defense industry institutions. The practice of business trips to relevant enterprises and institutions is widespread. At each of them, in a business-like, frank, acute and principled way, the challenges and opportunities of production processes in wartime conditions, ways of increasing capacity are discussed. Committee members also constantly visit exhibitions where the latest examples of OiVT are presented, economic forums. At such events, the priority is to attract foreign and domestic investments in the defense industry. We present convincing indicators that the national defense industry is increasingly establishing itself as a locomotive of the national economy, as an investment-attractive sector of the economy, in which more than 40 foreign companies are already actively operating. To a large extent, this is due to the global trends of relentless growth in defense spending in the world's leading countries, NATO, overall defense spending, and the prospects that these trends open for both the national defense industry and its investors. I would like to emphasize that we are not talking about abstract prospects, but about specific areas of investor participation in the strengthening of the defense industry. — The development of the defense industry can significantly contribute to the return of Ukrainians and keep specialists from emigrating. — I completely agree with you. Personally, I am a supporter of investment packages and not just in one or a few objects of the defense industry, but in the creation of a complete ecosystem, a defense industry hub on the basis of a system of industrial parks as a successful model of job creation, transfer of relevant skills and technologies, attraction of foreign direct investment and development of industry. In order to implement the above, great attention should be paid to the system of training specialists for defense industry enterprises, the formation of powerful ambitious national production forces, scientific and engineering potential with a market mindset, as they say, sharpened to self-realization in Ukraine and for the sake of Ukraine, achievements in competitive conditions. This is the future technical intelligentsia, which over time will determine the business card of Ukraine as a dynamic industrial country. Only by joint efforts will we turn challenges and difficulties into our capabilities. - As the Chairman of the committee, you have a number of meetings with your colleagues. What are the main directions of inter-parliamentary activity? All inter-parliamentary activity takes place in the fairway of the tasks set by the President of Ukraine for Ukrainian diplomacy. It is about the promotion of Ukrainian interests, international support for the Ukrainian Victory strategy presented by our President. One of the main tasks is to facilitate the receipt of security assistance in the volume and composition required by our defense forces. We constantly remind and convince our partners that the unprovoked large-scale aggression of the Russian Federation is not only about geography. This is primarily about a mixture of ethnocide and genocide against Ukrainians, and later Europeans. Intercommittee relations with colleagues from foreign countries are being developed so that Ukraine does not disappear from the radars of legislators' attention, so that there is their support for Ukrainian foreign policy initiatives and needs. It has become a good tradition that individual representatives of parliaments consider it an honor to visit the front line personally, accompanied by members of the committee, to meet with the Defenders. Such trips are accompanied by significant mini-packages of aid to specific units, which significantly strengthen Ukraine's informational position in certain countries. During such trips, our colleagues can see for themselves what their cities will look like if they do not help Ukraine, if it does not stand up. A separate direction of interparliamentary interaction is the support of the national defense industry, creating conditions for scaling up the experience of foreign companies that invest in the Ukrainian defense industry and open their own production facilities in Ukraine. We are making efforts to allocate funds by partners for the purchase of products of Ukrainian OiVT manufacturers on the principle of -buy from us for us-. The priority is the production of Ukrainian missiles, drones for various purposes, ground robotic complexes to support operations on the battlefield, electronic warfare systems. —How categorical are the partners for Ukraine to lower the mobilization age to 18? What is your point of view on this issue? - Referring to my experience and the experience of my colleagues on the committee, I can say that there was never any categoricalness or even a discussion on this matter. Yes, sometimes parterres showed interest in whether there is a reduction in the mobilization age in our plans. But this never determined the nature of our conversations in the discussion of security assistance to Ukraine. In my opinion, at the present time, Ukraine, first of all, needs an appropriate number and types of OiVT within the framework of security assistance, compliance by partners with the agreed terms and volumes of their supply. The priority is the full armament of all formed units. In general, if we talk about equipping the defense forces with the required number of mobilized personnel, then this should be considered not only in the context of lowering the mobilization age. Reserves should be used to improve the system of incentives for the contractual form of joining the army, improve the recruiting company both at the level of the Ministry of Defense, the General Staff, and the units themselves, as well as the conditions of military service. — In conclusion, would you like to wish our readers and everyone who fights or works for Victory? — First of all, great gratitude to everyone who fights or works for Victory, their families and relatives for the family supporting their sustainability. Peace, respect, independence are not inherited and are not guaranteed for the future. Each generation faces extremely difficult challenges and threats, finding ways to neutralize them. We do not have the right to make a mistake, on the contrary, our generation is obliged to correct the historical mistake of the past.

This was reported on the Espresso broadcast by a representative of the communications service by the public of the -Charter- brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine, sergeant Volodymyr Degtyarev. According to Degtyarev, in the area where the -Charter- stands, the main enemy tactic is the infiltration of small groups. Such attacks resumed for one reason - during enemy mechanized assaults, the Defense Forces burned the equipment and destroyed many paratroopers. -Small groups are literally two, three, four people moving around on foot during the main day. Because we see that they lack night vision. They use the fog and bad weather to catch the -windows- when there may not be surveillance drones of the Defense Forces of Ukraine in the air,- said Volodymyr Degtyarev. As reported by > ArmyInform, in the north of Kharkiv region, in the Lyptsiv region, the Defense Forces conducted the first operation with the use of exclusively robotic systems on the battlefield.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/23/hronichna-meteozalezhnist-okupantiv-na-harkivshhyni-rosiyany-lovlyat-vikna-shhob-atakuvaty/	2024-12-23T00:41:46-08:00

-Meat- and on stolen -Zhigulya-: a scout -KPD- told how the enemy attacks near Pokrovsk	Senior sergeant Vyacheslav Vishnevsky with the call sign -KPD-, who currently holds the position of platoon commander, told ArmyInform about his combat path from the very beginning of repelling the Russian aggression against Ukraine in 2014, the modern tactics of the Russian occupiers near Pokrovsk and the importance of the commander's example for motivating soldiers reconnaissance of the 117th separate heavy mechanized brigade. Vyacheslav received his call sign -KPD- during the Revolution of Dignity, in which he participated from the very beginning of the events at the end of November - in December 2013. Then the future scout, like the vast majority of Ukrainians, felt that the country was going in the wrong direction. — It was December 2013. I just couldn't stay away when I saw what was happening in our country. The course of Ukraine is definitely not with the Russians, because they are hungry people who are unable to restore order in their own country. Historical examples perfectly demonstrate with whom, how and in which direction to move - with the civilized world or with the world of dictatorship, - he recalls. The military man is convinced that even then Russia was on the way to entering the category of the most disgusting totalitarian regimes in the world. He mentions the example of North and South Korea, which now belong to different worlds, and notes who Putin was ultimately forced to choose as allies. — During the Maidan, I got to know guys from the Right Sector. Then there was such an -infectious- atmosphere among these people who had an ideological attitude to their work that I wanted to stand on an equal footing with them. And I did all the tasks that were assigned to me with maximum efficiency, showed the maximum efficiency ratio (in Russian - -coefficient of useful performance - KPD- - ed.), - he continues Vyacheslav, explaining where the call sign came from. He wanted to get to the -Right Sector- from the very beginning, but he was afraid that he would not reach the level of requirements and training, so he joined the Maidan Hundred of Self-Defense. However, fate soon decided everything for him. — After a few days, the hundred was integrated into the ranks of the -Right Sector-, which I was very happy about later. This allowed me to be filled spiritually, to meet extraordinary people who were examples of a strong life, says the scout. Then, together with his brothers, Vyacheslav went to the East of Ukraine to defend our state from Russian aggression. — First of all, we went through, so to speak, the course of a young fighter, now we would say — BZVP. We had to learn from scratch, most of us had no military experience. I will never forget that atmosphere, because I tried my best to reach the level. There were not enough weapons, they were issued only to the best or to those who already had experience, says the senior sergeant. Among the senior comrades and experienced fighters, he recalls, there were many who had already opposed Russian imperialism during the struggle for the freedom of Ichkeria in the 1990s and the repulsion of Russian aggression against Georgia in 2008. -You had to shorten the distance to their level very quickly, literally in a month-and-a-half, so that you, too, were entrusted to participate in combat missions, so that you were given such an honor,- says the soldier. It fell to the future scout to begin his military career in the Pokrovsk region, which was then still called Krasnoarmiisk. By a coincidence of fate, he is now fighting in the Pokrovsky direction. The date of his combat baptism - May 11, 2014 - was forever engraved in the soldier's memory. — It was May 11, the very day of the pro-Russian obscurantism — a pseudo-referendum against Ukraine. The Armed Forces did not control Krasnoarmiysk at that time, roadblocks stood only on the outskirts of the city. We were assigned the task of taking control of administrative buildings and stopping pro-Russian speeches, - the military man recalls. Since then, on this day, he remembers his fallen brothers, reflects on the path he has traveled and ponders the future. After all, the soldier is convinced, reflection on such dates is important in order to understand the context of the events of one's own life and to remember fallen comrades. The scout remembers the further battle route in dotted lines - Karlivka, Pisky, Avdiivka, Krasnohorivka, the famous raid, Amvrosiivka, Savur-mohyla&#8230; — We were constantly sent to assault groups. Together with the Armed Forces, we liberated settlements in Donetsk region. After that, I spent about three weeks at the Donetsk airport together with the 79th air mobile brigade, I also met very worthy people there, Vyacheslav recalls. And then the war changed, he says. After the Minsk agreements, the artillery stopped working and the distance between the Ukrainian defenders and the enemy rapidly decreased not even to hundreds, but to tens of meters. — The distance between infantry units has sometimes decreased to 50 meters. It was a time to quickly occupy the gray areas, of which there were many. I had to work in Marinka and occupy gray areas. Together with the infantry of the Armed Forces, they stormed the Avdiyiv industrial zone, he recalls. The industrial zone directly faced the Yasynuvat junction, which played the role of a key transport artery for the supply of Donetsk. So cutting her was an extremely important task. Vyacheslav joined the Armed Forces of Ukraine on his own, dedicating four years of his life to the volunteer movement. With respect, he remembers Dmytro Kotsyubail and the company in which he served with him, but he decided to join the Armed Forces regardless of the organization. — Integration is very difficult. Sometimes commanders and ordinary volunteers are not very ready to command military formations and serve as part of them in the ranks of the Armed Forces, because they do not understand the order of what and how happens in the army, he explains. There are some successful exceptions of the integration of entire units, Vyacheslav notes, but it was the servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine who took an active part in the development of these military organizations, who directed the volunteers in the necessary direction. Therefore, he considers joining the army to be a good option. - I felt the beginning of a full-scale war half a year before February 2022 - I began to write poems on this topic, memories of hostilities flared up very strongly. At that time, I was in a relationship with a girl, she lived in Mariupol, where all my combat equipment was located. So I asked in advance to send everything to me, - recalls the scout. With the beginning of the -wide-scale- Vyacheslav was invited to the 6th separate rifle battalion, which was formed from volunteers. Many of the men had no military training, but were extremely motivated. - Not a single line-up was complete without someone leaving the formation with the commander's permission and asking when we were going to go to reclaim our land. -I saw a mass of charged people who were almost without equipment, with weapons that were many times inferior to the enemy, and were ready to tear the enemy with their hands,- the scout recalls. Comparing the modern war with the previous combat experience, the scout notes that now the fighting is changing extremely rapidly. — Since 2014, the war has changed on average about once a year. At first, it was strongly influenced by the Minsk agreements, then reconnaissance drones became more widespread. But from the beginning of the full-scale invasion to the present day, the war has already changed many times and has a very different character depending on the shade of the battle line, says the intelligence officer. Now, according to Vyacheslav, the nature of hostilities changes approximately once every three months or once every six months, depending on the section of the front. This is influenced by both technological innovations and a change in the tactics of actions of both the Ukrainian defenders and the Russian occupiers. — Now the vast majority of fellows with whom I have to perform the most difficult operations are those who have recently joined the military. We carry out operations with high dynamics, high intensity of combat operations, carry out counter-offensive actions - all this is successfully carried out by people who have not previously been in the military, Vyacheslav says. The main ones, in his opinion, are motivation, training and the example of a commander who is able to give fighters self-confidence by his own actions and example, to give them a charge that will allow them to go into battle and win it. — Commanders are divided into two types: the one who says -let's attack!- and the one who says -follow me!-. For me, all people are motivated, we just need a clear framework, an ideological component is needed, people need to know why, for what, for whom they are here - and there will be no problems with motivation. We motivated all the people who came to this level. When they saw that they were able to effectively carry out combat tasks, then there was no stopping them, he says. — Now in the Pokrovsky direction we encountered a change in enemy tactics. If he does not succeed in the directions of the main attack, then he changes his tactics - they either stupidly and rudely push forward, not sparing personnel, then somewhere they connect more artillery, and somewhere they conduct a -creeping- war, trying to throw a group to our rear, - says Master Sgt. However, most often the occupiers resort to the infamous -meat- assaults, first used en masse by the -Wagnerians- in Bahmut. The fighter says that sometimes his unit and his comrades destroyed up to a company of the enemy in a day, and the Russians relentlessly pressed into battle. - Their tactics are quite primitive - they send infantry without artillery training and we destroy them. The next day they send the same number of infantry and they are routed again. On the third day, they send twice as many infantry and eliminate them again, the scout says. However, having scouted the firing positions of the Defense Forces due to such actions, the Russians then throw infantrymen on high-mobility vehicles into the assault with the goal of shortening the distance as much as possible and proceeding to assault actions. — They send people to storm on stolen Zhiguli from Selidovoy, on any other civilian vehicles not equipped with any protection for combat missions. Their goal is to shorten the distance as much as possible so that they are not destroyed on the approaches, explains the senior sergeant. Sometimes fire contact with enemy infantrymen took place at a distance of 5 meters, but Vyacheslav proudly claims that the battalion in which he is fighting in the Pokrovsky direction has not lost a single direct battle. During the conversation, one can feel how Vyacheslav has changed over the decade of war - from a civilian lad, he has gone through the path of becoming not only a courageous professional soldier, but also a responsible and skillful commander. The scout not only resolutely goes into battle himself, but also confidently leads fighters who will not hesitate to follow an experienced commander and a trusted comrade. From Krasnoarmiisk to Pokrovsk, scout Vyacheslav's -efficiency- as a professional soldier increased enormously.

-Lost-, but did not lose strength: the Czech Republic developed a lightweight model of a machine gun	According to the developers of the new weapon, its key features are a quick-change barrel and a trigger selection of fire, which allows you to conduct single shots. A 30% reduction in weight compared to other light machine guns of the same category allows each operator to carry more ammunition or other necessary materials, ArmyInform notes. According to the experts of the defense market, who shared their findings with the authors of the defense portal Army Recognition, thanks to the easy, but of rugged construction, the PZD Mk24 minimizes recoil, allowing machine gunners to target distant threats with precision and control. The machine gun is chambered in 5.56x45mm NATO and these models are available with 16-inch or 14-inch barrels, providing weapon lengths of 919-1001mm and 868-950mm, respectively. Weighing only 5.2 kilograms, this machine gun reflects the desire of the DSS engineers for mobility without compromising on performance. The launch of this model of weapons into the series marks progress in the DSS range, which already includes the widely presented PZD 556 model, which is also used by the Ukrainian Defense Forces. In particular, as declared the official portal of the domestic defense department, in February of this year The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine issued registration certificates for another 20 samples of foreign-made small arms. Among them, as reported by the Deputy Minister of Defense, Lieutenant General Ivan Gavryliuk, there is also a PZD 556 machine gun. Meanwhile, with the PZD Mk24 machine gun, DSS gunsmiths seek to revise the balance between firepower, portability and ergonomic design in modern weapons. This new weapon resembles the FN Evolys produced by FN Herstal from Belgium, about which in one of its previous materials told our editors. Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that this new Czech light machine gun is designed to compete with the Evolys. One of the main advantages of the PZD Mk24 is a 30% weight reduction compared to other light machine guns in this category. This lightweight design allows soldiers to carry additional ammunition or critical equipment, increasing their operational endurance and flexibility. Despite the reduced weight, the PZD Mk24 does not compromise on durability or functionality, as it has a quick-change barrel and a trigger with a selectable fire that allows for both single and burst fire. DSS has also developed a minimalist feed mechanism for the PZD Mk24, which ensures that accessories such as optics and other equipment mounted on the Picatinny rail remain securely in place and maintain their accuracy even during prolonged firing. A free-floating Picatinny rail system in combination with a one-piece receiver improves heat dissipation along the barrel, maintaining performance during extended engagements. This machine gun features a four-position adjustable gas regulator based on a long-stroke piston mechanism that allows operators to adapt to specific operational needs. With a maximum firing range of 1,200 meters and an effective firing range of 600 meters, the PZD Mk24 is a versatile weapon capable of meeting the demands of a wide range of combat operations. Finally, the PZD Mk24 includes integrated folding sights for quick and practical use in the field. DSS's attention to weight reduction, durability and performance underscores the company's commitment to innovation in the defense sector, offering highly effective and maneuverable weapons for soldiers in today's challenging combat environments. With the introduction of the PZD Mk24, DSS reinforces its commitment to advancing firearms technology through innovative design. Addressing the critical operational challenges facing today's soldiers, such as fire, recoil and heat management, DSS aims to create a new standard for light machine guns adapted to today's combat scenarios.

In Ukraine, no one announced a reduction in the cost of prosthetics for the military: Moscow distort...	-People lost their limbs not because of the state, but because they were just unlucky. Therefore, there can be no claims against the state,- fake users cite a fictional -quote- from the minister. In fact, no one in Ukraine has announced the government's plans to reduce spending on prosthetics and military rehabilitation. Viktor Lyashko's quote, as well as the information about reducing the cost of prosthetics, is nothing but a fake. Neither on the official website of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine, nor in the media, nor on Minister Lyashko's personal pages in social networks are there any quotes or news that are at least slightly similar to the above-mentioned -reduction plans- from the state. On the contrary, it turned out that next year Ukraine will allocate even more funds for prosthetics and rehabilitation of civilians and military personnel. According to the budget, in 2024, 4.3 billion UAH were allocated for primary prosthetics and means of rehabilitation, which is 40% more than last year. In 2025, this amount will increase to UAH 4.6 billion. UAH 1.1 billion is also provided for high-tech prosthetics. 5.7 billion hryvnias were allocated in the budget for rehabilitation services, and they remain free for military and civilians. Russian propagandists spread such fakes in order to deepen Ukrainian society's distrust of the state and its social programs. Such disinformation is aimed at discrediting the Ukrainian authorities, accusing them of alleged indifference to the injured military, spreading panic and disillusionment among the military and their families. This fake is also used to divert attention from the real problems of the Russian side.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/23/v-ukrayini-nihto-ne-zayavlyav-pro-skorochennya-vytrat-na-protezuvannya-vijskovyh-moskva-perekruchuye-fakty/	2024-12-22T20:20:17-08:00

But the most interesting thing is the signatures of the owners. They are made in Korean, which shows the real origin of these soldiers. This case once again confirms that Russia resorts to any methods to hide its losses on the battlefield and to hide the foreign presence,- the SSO said in a statement. SSO fighters continue to track down and destroy mercenary units, disrupting the enemy's plans.

The enemy does not pay wages to porters	This is reported by the Center of National Resistance. While Russian propaganda talks about -improvement- with the arrival of the invaders, the reality is somewhat different. The humanitarian crisis continues in the region, which makes residents increasingly dependent on the Kremlin's policies. Yes, port workers in Berdyansk do not receive salaries. It is worth noting that the port itself, like the neighboring port of Mariupol, is actually standing. From time to time, the ports take out the looted grain, but the total cargo turnover is hundreds of thousands of tons per year, which is a pittance with millions by 2022. These figures speak of the true economic situation at TOT. Russians destroy everything they touch, exporting only lies to the whole world. We remind you, invaders are recruiting Ukrainian schoolchildren to Russian universities.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/22/vorog-ne-platyt-zarplatu-portovykam/	2024-12-22T08:54:23-08:00

The Gvozdika self-propelled gun can hit the enemy at a distance of up to 16.6 km. But even such a powerful technique requires taking into account a number of factors - from the quality of the charge to weather conditions. Four fighters are currently working in the ACS crew. The command ensures their interaction with infantry units that are on the front line. Among the memorable combat episodes, Shvydkiy recalls the case when his -Carnation- destroyed a cluster of occupiers. -There were specific goals, and we had to work very quickly on manpower and equipment. It was necessary to act as efficiently as possible. This made it possible to suppress and destroy the enemy, protect the infantry and prevent the enemy from entering our positions,- the gunner adds.

Keeping the discount rate will accelerate the destruction of the Russian economy	This is reported by /a> Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. The decision to raise the rate may be taken at the next meeting in February 2025 in the event of continued -overheating- of the Russian economy. In fact, the preservation of the discount rate has a political nature and was adopted under the pressure of some representatives of political circles, as well as Putin himself, who during the -direct line- publicly stated that he hoped for a -considered decision- by the Central Bank. Currently, inflation indicators in the Russian Federation are much higher than those observed before the previous increases. Against this background, deepening of crisis phenomena in the Russian economy and more destructive consequences than in the case of an increase in the discount rate are predicted. Putin's policy is leading the aggressor country to economic collapse. We remind you that the G7 countries are discussing the possibility of a complete ban on processing of Russian oil.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/22/zberezhennya-oblikovoyi-stavky-pryshvydshyt-rujnacziyu-rosijskoyi-ekonomiky/	2024-12-22T01:36:08-08:00

All business entities, so to speak, are in the -state- ownership of the so-called -LNR-, but not paying bills is in their blood. After 9.5 years of waiting for funds and the impossibility of issuing a pension, they decided to turn to the Russians for a subsidy. Multimillion-dollar debts remain to the miners of other enterprises of the occupied Luhansk region. Before the invaders had time to introduce new, minute-by-minute pricing conditions for the residents of the front-line settlements, the signal deteriorated where they went to call dozens of kilometers from home. For example, residents of Siversko-Donetsk used to actively travel 15 km to Smolyaninovoy and could make the necessary call from there. Now and there the connection has almost disappeared.

The adversary continues the forced passporting of the population of the TOT of Ukraine	This is reported by Center of national resistance. Enemies of Ukraine refer to such a process as -care for the local population-, but in fact such measures are a criminal instrument of subjugation, control and destruction of the national identity of Ukrainians. Thus, according to the norms of international law, the forcible imposition of citizenship is a violation of the Geneva Conventions. However, the occupation authorities ignore these principles, resorting to intimidation, discrimination, and blackmail to force TOT residents to accept Russian passports. However, for those who do not want to receive a Russian passport, the occupation authorities are trying to limit people's basic rights. This applies to a number of restrictions on receiving medical services, social benefits, etc. Also, without a Russian passport, citizens lose their movable and immovable property. In addition, the enemy is actively working on the young population, forcing them to accept Russian citizenship. Therefore, the occupation goals are the usurpation of power and the destruction of identity. Thanks to passporting, the enemy -legitimizes- the occupation, and presents the residents of TOT as -citizens of the Russian Federation- in order to justify their crimes in this way. Along with this, through passporting, the occupiers get access to the personal data of residents, which allows them to better control them and suppress the resistance of the Ukrainian underground, which continues to work effectively under the temporary occupation. Despite the difficult circumstances in the TOT, the occupying power, which is involved in forced passporting and other crimes, will be brought to justice. The Ukrainian state, together with international partners, collects evidence of human rights violations at the International Criminal Court, so that everyone involved receives a fair punishment.

Even before the approach to the landing site of the enemy landing, the infantry fighting vehicles were attacked by the military, but not too successfully. Already directly at the place of rush, when the enemy infantry began to leave the combat vehicles, the external pilots of the brigade began to work with drones with drops. An attempt to save and hide the enemy's combat equipment failed, which led to its destruction by drone strikes. First, the enemy lost an infantry fighting vehicle, and then a tank was finished. Both units were completely destroyed beyond recovery. Due to the loss of equipment, the enemy's personnel, who were thrown into battle, could not conduct maneuvers and attack. He tried to hide in a forest strip, where a significant part of him was also eliminated by drone strikes.

The G7 countries are discussing the possibility of a complete ban on the processing of Russian oil	About this notifies the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. The goal is to reduce Moscow's ability to finance the Russian-Ukrainian war. Among the initiatives is a complete ban on the processing of Russian oil and a reduction in the price limit from the current 60 to about 40 dollars. USA. The readiness for such actions is connected with forecasts of an oil surplus on the world market in 2025. According to the estimates of the International Energy Agency (IEA), if the OPEC+ countries maintain the current level of production, in 2025 the supply surplus will amount to 950,000 barrels. barrels per day. If OPEC+ begins to reverse voluntary cuts from the end of March 2025, the surplus will increase to 1.4 million barrels per day. At the same time, according to JP Morgan forecasts, the growth of global oil demand will slow down from 1.3 million barrels per day in 2024 to 1.1 million barrels per day in 2025. We remind you, combat operations in Ukraine and the Middle East demonstrate the growing role of UAVs in modern armed conflicts. This has led to a sharp increase in demand for technologies that can effectively detect and neutralize such threats.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/22/krayiny-g7-obgovoryuyut-mozhlyvist-povnoyi-zaborony-obrobky-rosijskoyi-nafty/	2024-12-21T23:32:57-08:00

A smart weapon with a specific name: an American company with the involvement of a Ukrainian present...	The Bullfrog Gun Turret robotic system, designed for effective detection, identification and destruction of drones of classes 1-3, combines advanced machine learning algorithms, modern sensors and proven kinetic technologies. The Bullfrog system includes a 7.62 mm M240 machine gun, the operation of which is integrated with advanced technologies such as computer vision and AI. This system is designed to effectively and economically neutralize enemy drones and is positioned as an alternative to more expensive anti-aircraft missile systems. -Recent advances in drone technology have made them more resistant to RF jamming. The only reliable way to disable them is to inflict kinetic damage that physically damages or destroys the UAV,- the developer's website says. The system is equipped with innovative sensors and Linux-based software that supports integration with various radars and control systems (C2). This ensures: The system's open architecture allows you to easily adapt to unique requirements and quickly update functionality. A key advantage of the Bullfrog Gun Turret is its intelligent threat detection system. It uses a large database trained on millions of annotated images, which ensures a false positive rate of less than 2% and identification accuracy even in challenging conditions such as poor visibility or obstacles. Autonomous modes of operation are complemented by the -man-in-circuit- function, which prevents unauthorized actions and ensures maximum security. Thanks to shot prediction, the system guarantees a high probability of successfully hitting the target with a minimum amount of ammunition. The Bullfrog Gun Turret is a compact and lightweight system, making it ideal for mobile operations or defense of mission-critical facilities. Operation from a standard 24V DC power supply allows for easy integration of equipment with vehicles. In addition, the system can operate in a passive mode, reducing the likelihood of detection during deployment. Bullfrog can operate in both autonomous and semi-autonomous modes, targeting UAVs weighing up to 600 kg, with a flight range of less than 180 meters and a speed of less than 250 knots. This development underscores the need for military forces to adapt to a new generation of threats, including low-cost but highly effective drones. The Bullfrog Gun Turret is an example of how modern technologies, including artificial intelligence, can significantly improve the efficiency and safety of military operations. It should be noted separately that a specialist from Ukraine is directly related to the presentation of this development. After all, it was computer artist Artem Pokutniy from Sumy worked on video for the American defense company Allen Control Systems, which created this robotic anti-drone turret. And among the enemy UAVs in this video, Russian kamikaze drones Geran-2 (Shahed) are quite easily recognizable. Autonomous machine gun system Bullfrog Gun Turret for destroying UAVs.

How models of military equipment are created: the manufacturer's story	The representative of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Colonel Yuriy Ignat, at one time noted that -models are also combat units maintained by humans. Their main task is to confuse the enemy. The enemy spends up to 4 million dollars to launch one Iskander missile. The model costs up to 25 thousand dollars, which is much cheaper than one Iskander. If we talk about -Kinzhal-, then a missile of this type costs up to 500 million hryvnias. Patriotic domestic companies joined the production of OVT models almost immediately from the beginning of the war. In particular, a number of enterprises have established the production of engineering structures that completely replicate the appearance of radar stations and artillery installations. So, how mock-ups mislead the enemy and force him to use expensive high-precision ammunition, ArmiyaInform asked Mr. Oleg, a representative of one of the companies that specializes in the production of anti-aircraft mock-ups: -One of the mock-ups we make can cost 100,000 hryvnias. And the real unit of military equipment, which we want to replace with this model, costs 5-7 million hryvnias. Therefore, our goal is to inflict material losses on the enemy. The cost of one -lancet-, for example, can be about 30 thousand dollars. And if this drone hits a model that costs 2-3 thousand, then the score will be in our favor. And in addition, this reduces the amount of ammunition the enemy has - this is a double benefit. The layout should not just resemble the contours of combat equipment, it should be very similar to it. If you were not able to mislead the enemy, that is, he recognized that this is not a real unit of equipment, then you will not achieve your goal, these are just wasted resources: both money and time. Therefore, the layout should be very, very similar, even have, if necessary, thermal radiation: for example, the engine should glow in the infrared range after application. But here it is necessary to observe the golden mean. That is, it is also not worth making mock-ups so similar that even from a distance of 5 meters it is not possible to recognize that it is a mock-up. Because the enemy, as a rule, now looks at all this through the eyes of reconnaissance drones from a height of about 300-500 meters. Therefore, in this case, unnecessary detailing is not necessary. Because it will lead to unnecessary expenditure of time, money and materials. Models are made from wooden shields, sheathed with existing equipment that fits the dimensions, made of plastic, and even inflatable. Each species has its pros and cons, and the balance between them is not always maintained. The layout should be easy to carry. Must stand alone, without constant maintenance. The enemy should not have time to notice the assembly process, so the layout must be assembled very quickly by the forces of the unit (crew). The crew of, for example, a self-propelled artillery installation (ASG) can load a disassembled model onto their self-propelled gun, drive to a certain point, unload the model and assemble the frame in a few minutes by pulling a cover over it. Track tracks will lead to this mock-up, the enemy will see not only the self-propelled gun mock-up, but also accompanying signs of unmasking, and will most likely strike this mock-up, and will not look for a real gun. For example, our enterprise, in order to make a high-quality mock-up, first makes a 3D model of a combat unit. The designer then passes this on to a builder who models the collapsible metal frame. The next step is for the 3D designer to overlay the surface texture of the equipment on the frame model. At this stage, we can choose the color or type of camouflage. Its surface will also show all the details of this machine, that is, tracks, rollers, hatches, exhaust pipes, scratches, peeling paint and dirt. We even have a print of the beret there, it is also printed. After agreeing on the design option, we translate these surface textures into a 2D dimension and divide them into fragments for printing on a plotter. Then the printed pieces are used to make a cover for this layout. Photo-realistic printing of the cover with the smallest details provides such detail that, being stretched on the frame, at 50 meters you can no longer distinguish this product from real equipment. About 20-30 units of such models can be produced per month. For example, the collapsible frame of the Gvozdika 2C1 ACS model will weigh about 200 kilograms, and the awning will weigh another 10-15 kilograms. All this will easily fit into any pickup truck. And it can be quickly transported to the right place. &#8230;So when the enemy hits mockups but doesn't hit our equipment, we save money on repairing or restoring that equipment. Or we don't buy new equipment abroad. And most importantly, the trained crew remains alive. Which will then harm the enemy.

the Russians wanted to return the St. George tapes to Ukraine through the court: what happened	About written by specialists of the StopFake project. They found out that, in fact, in the case -Borzykh v. Ukraine- (No. 11575/24), in which the applicant complained on the basis of various provisions of the Convention against the ban on wearing the -Georgian ribbon- in public places, the ECtHR decided that the ban on the use of the -Georgian ribbon- tapes- is justified and does not contradict the article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The decision emphasizes that the ribbon acquired a symbolic meaning associated with the aggressor in the context of the Russian-Ukrainian war. The ban was partial, allowing use in awards until 1991. The applicant, Yurii Borzykh, a former military man, claimed that he wanted to wear the ribbon on May 9. He was not able to prove that the ban significantly affected his life or caused psychological suffering. The ECtHR recognized the actions of Ukraine as lying within the state's discretion aimed at protecting national security during wartime. Therefore, the statement that the ECtHR recognized the banning of the -Georgian Tape- as a violation of freedom of expression is not true. This is an attempt by Russian propaganda to create a disinformation effect and discredit Ukraine's measures to combat symbols associated with enemy aggression.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/22/rosiyany-cherez-sud-hotily-povernuty-georgiyivski-strichky-v-ukrayinu-shho-z-togo-vyjshlo/	2024-12-21T20:22:33-08:00

Currently, the military man is successfully performing tasks in the area of ​​hostilities on one of the difficult front lines in the ranks of the 66th separate mechanized brigade named after Prince Mstislav the Brave. ArmyInform asked an army man about his combat routine, training, motivation, the way to the army, the destroyed enemy and more. Yakov joined the army in 2022, leaving his civilian life and the automobile business. He is 32 years old, originally from Sumy. He recalls that a few months after the beginning of the large-scale invasion, he went to the Military Commissariat and the very next day he went to training: -BZVP lasted more than a month (artillery specialty - ed.). There was both a theoretical and a practical part. At the training, the instructors provided a lot of really useful information and shared their own experience. And all this - in the shortest possible time.- The most vivid memory from BZVP, he recalls, is the practical part. -In particular, firing from different types of weapons. Some of them are a first for me. It was interesting and useful. But it would be good to extend the training period for new recruits, as well as update some disciplines for the modern realities of war. Perhaps this was implemented over the years, because my experience of the BZVP dates back to 2022,- says the military man. Subsequently, Yakov took an active part in the creation of a UAV platoon. -Our workflow went through certain stages of evolution and naturally grew into a full-fledged platoon. Therefore, its creation, let's say, was ripe and gave us an impetus for development. It is very good that the command supported us both at the stage of development and in the creation of a platoon. The complexity of our business creates a critical need for constant movement and improvement, and we are no exception. Every day the enemy tries to hinder work, it is necessary to constantly change, develop technical means, develop and implement new work methods, train people. This is the main difficulty,- the officer thinks. And at one time, it was under the leadership of the senior lieutenant that about 15 units of weapons and military equipment were hit, as well as 42 people of the enemy's manpower. -This was achieved thanks to our talented bombers and FPV operators in the first place. Of course, the best practice was during the winter and autumn active operations of the enemy. Here you can recall the BMP, full of paratroopers, which was hit even at the entrance. Or the burned and abandoned -Tiger-, abandoned by the Russian special forces. Or massive attempts to approach our positions by groups of infantry with further damage to them,- he says casually and succinctly about his work. We ask whether officers and commanders are afraid during combat sorties, and if so, how do they deal with it. -At first, everyone is afraid, but with experience and understanding of certain processes, fear recedes into the background. I will say this, the infantry in the positions is many times more difficult, and a lot depends on us to provide them with eyes and firepower. When clarifying what you, a military man, would like to advise civilians who, for various reasons, have not yet joined the Defense Forces, Yakov emphasizes that this is happening, in particular, including because of fear. -I will say that uncertainty and the unknown are more frightening. Therefore, you need to prepare and train to reduce the impact of these factors.- And we traditionally ask what a victory in the Russian-Ukrainian war will be for the military: -To have stable peace and confidence in a bright future for our children in a free democratic country.- Photo from Yakov's personal archive &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/22/vzvod-bpla-urazyv-15-odynycz-tehniky-ta-majzhe-piv-sotni-rosiyan-istoriya-yakova-zahysnyka-z-66-ombr/	2024-12-21T20:14:34-08:00
Is the infantry running out? — the enemy began to throw a lot of armored vehicles into battle in Kur...	Oleksandr Shirshin, commander of the 47th mechanized brigade battalion, told on the ArmyTV stream about this. -The enemy began to use equipment, there were already several rolls. They are trying to conduct classic offensive actions. Before that, the Russians worked purely in groups on foot. Mostly they accumulated and then in small groups tried to storm and seize positions. But in the last few days, vehicles have started arriving, such as tanks, BMPs and armored personnel carriers,- Oleksandr Shirshin said. According to him, the intensity of the fighting has increased several times. At the same time, the Russians use well-trained units: marines and paratroopers. As reported by ArmiyaInform, fighters of the fire support company of the 47th mechanized brigade with the support of the Bradley infantry fighting vehicle uspih-shturmu/->conducted an assault, knocking out the enemy who was holed up in the house.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/21/pihota-zakinchuyetsya-vorog-pochav-kydaty-v-bij-na-kurshhyni-bagato-bronetehniky/	2024-12-21T11:14:53-08:00
Not Rebbe! — -Birds of Magyar- hit an enemy tank with a fiber-optic drone	The video was made public on December 21 on the battalion channel. The occupying tank was in position and fired at our troops. It was impossible to hit the tank with an ordinary FPV drone, because the tank was protected by a powerful EW. Then -Birds of Magyar- used fiber-optic drones, thanks to which they somehow got a video of excellent quality and were able to hit the tank, and twice. &nbsp; -Shall we look at the inscriptions on the barrel of the worm tank?-, - commented the battalion commander Major Robert Brovdy on the video. The quality of the video fully allows this. As reported by ArmyInform, the 414th battalion of unmanned systems -Birds of Magyar- becomes the 414th separate brigade of unmanned systems of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/21/ne-rebe-ptahi-madyara-urazyly-vorozhyj-tank-dronom-na-optovolokni/	2024-12-21T10:48:11-08:00
A miracle at the checkpoint: the border guards helped the charming Oleksandra remember that he is An...	The State Border Service of Ukraine reported this on December 21. The drama of gender confusion took place at the -Ugryniv- checkpoint in the Lviv region. On the bus heading to Poland, border guards found a man pretending to be a woman. The guy began to tell that he felt like a woman since childhood, but this version did not stand up to scrutiny. It turned out that he had divorced his wife the day before, but he didn't really plan to leave her - the woman was also a passenger on the bus. Andrii-Olexandr was handed over to the National Police, but his ex went further abroad without remorse. ArmyInform reminds that it is better not to break the law or risk your life, but to use the aggregator of vacancies in the Armed Forces and recruiting centers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/21/dyvo-na-punkti-propusku-prykordonnyky-dopomogly-zgadaty-charivnij-oleksandri-shho-vin-andrij/	2024-12-21T10:24:42-08:00
They went on an assault and died - enemy infantry are destroyed by cluster munitions and drones	The video of the battles was released on December 21 on the brigade's channel. A group of Russian attack aircraft first ran into the position of our infantry and had to flee with losses. Then the artillery hit the Russians hiding in the landing with cluster munitions. Then drones took over. -The enemy does not stop trying to storm our positions, but our units know how to reduce the population of the Russian army and do not leave the enemy's attempts to approach our positions unpunished. In the video, you can see the coordinated work of infantry, artillery, and FPV drones of our brigade together with adjacent units,- commented the video part. As reported by ArmyInform, soldiers of the 17th separate heavy mechanized brigade together with adjacent units successfully eliminate enemy -stormtroopers- in the forest belts.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/21/ishly-na-shturmu-i-zagynuly-pihotu-voroga-nyshhat-kasetni-boyeprypasy-ta-drony/	2024-12-21T10:01:04-08:00
Western SAM operators are not sent to the infantry — the Air Force	About this in his post on December 21 public relations officer of the Air Force Command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Colonel Yuriy Ignat. -All types and branches of the Armed Forces send people to units and units of the Ground Forces, including the Air Force - the second largest type of the Armed Forces. This is a well-known fact. In addition, I would like to remind you that for more than a year the Air Force has been sending people to reinforce the front from the Combined Rifle Brigade of the Armed Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, at the base of which servicemen first undergo training, and then, as part of units, are sent to difficult areas of combat operations,- he wrote Yuriy Ignat. He acknowledged that the transfer to the infantry creates personnel issues within the Air Force. -There are not enough people and this is also a well-known fact! But why talk about the ineffectiveness of anti-aircraft defense and that they began to shoot down less? After all, air defense is not only the Air Force! Air defense is a system of air defense of the state, which includes units of all the Defense Forces capable of firing at air targets, and infantry, and sailors, and helicopters... They are shot down, as they were shot down. The effectiveness of air defense against enemy UAVs remains at the level of 95 percent, taking into account those shot down and those that fall by themselves or under the influence of EW, the so-called -locationally lost-. For missiles, of course, the percentage is lower, taking into account the growth in the use of ballistics,- Yuriy Ignat explained. He stated that he checked with the personnel center. -And there they assured that no one has ever sent servicemen who were trained abroad on Patriot, Nasams or Iris-T to the infantry (there was one such case, and that was due to certain circumstances)...-, Yuriy Ignat said. He reminded that the Air Force is a high-tech type of the Armed Forces, in which there are really many people with unique specialties, with extensive work experience, and no one will replace them. -Therefore, the transfer to the -land route- is quite a painful process for the PS, this applies to both combat brigades and support units,- noted Yuriy Ignat and urged to avoid manipulation and distortion of facts. As reported by ArmyInform, the General Staff of the Armed Forces commented the statement that is spreading on the network about the -transfer of air defense to the infantry- and stated that they are unreliable and incorrect. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/21/operatoriv-zahidnyh-zrk-ne-vidpravlyayut-u-pihotu-povitryani-syly/	2024-12-21T09:42:00-08:00

Usually, such meetings are not publicly announced, and all our meetings — in Ukraine, in other European countries, in America, and in other parts of the world — took place without official notification. But now, after the last visit, it is worth saying openly. I wish you and your family the best, Bill! May luck support you,- said the President.

Married, but living in parallel worlds: two pseudo-spouses were exposed at the border	About informs December 21 State Border Service of Ukraine. On the border with Poland, at the -Grushiv- checkpoint, border guards of the 7th Carpathian border detachment discovered a 33-year-old native of the city of Poltava and a 39-year-old young woman from the Poltava region. The DPSU noted that they got married, probably without the intention of creating a real family. -Because a woman has a disability, it gives her husband the right to cross the border. The pseudo-spouse allegedly went to Austria to visit her husband's friend. In communication with the border guards, the -family couple- could not answer a number of logical questions,- the border guards said. In addition, at the checkpoint -Krakivets- they exposed a 38-year-old native of Ivano-Frankivsk region and a 33-year-old native of Khmelnytskyi region, who also has a group of disabilities. According to legend, the newlyweds were on their way to visit their mother-in-law. -However, both of them told the border guards completely different stories from their married life, including dating and living. Border guards did not let the men across the border. The sincerity of feelings and the real motives for the marriage will currently be investigated by law enforcement agencies,- said the DPSU. ArmyInform reminds that it is better not to break the law or risk your life, but to use the aggregator of vacancies in the Armed Forces and recruiting centers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/21/odruzheni-ale-zhyvut-v-paralelnyh-svitah-na-kordoni-vykryly-dva-psevdopodruzhzhya/	2024-12-21T08:43:42-08:00

Decisions on the transfer of some servicemen of the rear units to combat units are also aimed at fulfilling this priority task. At the same time, the number of downed Russian -martyrs- has not decreased in any way,- the report says. The General Staff of the Armed Forces emphasized that the anti-aircraft defense of the Air Forces of the Armed Forces performs its tasks well, distinguishing between real enemy attack drones and UAVs of an unspecified type - mostly false targets, which are most often reported as -locationally lost- in reports on the repulsion of air attacks. -Observe information hygiene, trust official sources, support the Armed Forces and join the ranks of the Defense Forces of Ukraine!- - summarized at the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

The resolution also regulates the criteria for forming this list. These are, for example, codification or admission to operation, localization of at least 50% of the production cost, mass production, and others. The bottom line is that this list will include those types of weapons that are really needed by the Security and Defense Forces, can be purchased by the state customer and are mass-produced on the territory of Ukraine. -The approval of the list of -Weapons of Victory- should become the basis for manufacturers to receive long-term contracts - for 3/5/10 years, which will be a booster in the development of the Ukrainian defense industry,- said Herman Smetanin. As reported by ArmyInform, Ukraine and Germany strengthen cooperation in the defense industry.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/21/kabmin-zatverdyv-postanovu-pro-zbroyu-peremogy/	2024-12-21T05:05:17-08:00

A new unit was created in the Armed Forces of Ukraine - the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukr...	This was reported by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on December 21. The new unit will include military personnel who have education and previous work experience in the field of culture, archaeology, history and museum work. The main task is to coordinate actions aimed at protecting, preserving and preventing the destruction of cultural heritage sites that may be threatened by hostilities. -This initiative is another proof that Ukraine complies with the norms of international law, fulfills its obligations, makes maximum use of all existing mechanisms and tools for the protection and preservation of cultural values ​​in conditions of armed conflict,- the message reads. It is noted that the Armed Forces once again confirm compliance with the norms of international humanitarian law, in particular, the provisions of the Convention on the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict, adopted in the city of The Hague on May 14, 1954, and the two protocols to it on the creation of a specialized unit for the protection of cultural heritage.

Cars were also damaged,- succinctly informed about the consequences of the shelling by Chief Slav Yansk city military administration Vadim Lyakh. — Two KABs arrived. One on that street, after a minute there was a break, and one here. Shortly before five in the evening, says local resident Serhii, who was in his own homestead, located just 15 meters from the site of one of the hits. He helped rescue an elderly woman whose house was completely destroyed by an explosion. She miraculously survived and was quickly helped by local residents, but after the terrible explosion, the condition of the victim is serious. — When we jumped out, she shouted: -Help!-. At first there was no one there but us. Here she was, right near the pit, next to this log. She was sitting facing her, Serhii points to a deep ravine next to a completely destroyed house. There were children in houses near the hit sites who were under acute stress and in need of help. The youngest child is about 2.5 years old, she was with her parents at the time of the explosion. However, there are also older children who were struck at home alone and were helped by neighbors. Several nearby buildings near the epicenter of the explosion were also almost completely destroyed - their roofs were not only destroyed, doors and windows were knocked out, but also the load-bearing walls were moved. Obviously, some of them are not recoverable. The force of the explosions and the scattering of debris were such that windows and roofs were broken in dozens of buildings located a few dozen or even tens of meters away from the places of impact, and in those closer to them, strong outer doors and gates to yards were even torn off and bent. On a neighboring street, a bomb hit an open area near the houses, but the few closest ones were of little help, missing windows and parts of their roofs. — It is necessary to close the roof and keep the windows. It will rain, snow&#8230; Everything will be now&#8230; -We still can't get to the roof,- says a local resident. Her trouble is shared by all the neighbors, three dozen of whom the street gathers from. People are waiting for building materials from local authorities and charitable funds, with the help of which it will be possible to somehow temporarily patch up housing. There is no real repair yet - to begin with, at least the broken windows and doors must be closed, and the roofs covered.

They promise to silence -In the times of communism-: the US space force is preparing to deploy a sys...	According to the article, posted on the portal of the Bloomberg news agency, the system was developed by the American company L3Harris Technologies Inc. The latest equipment, which is declared under the name Meadowlands (-Meadows-, or in another version of the translation -Times of Communism- - Ukrainian), is a lightweight and mobile version of the existing -Counter Communications System-, which was officially put into operation in 2020. Meadowlands can receive software updates and is able to jam a wider range of frequencies, which makes its application more flexible. However, according to Bloomberg reporters, it will be delivered to the troops more than two years later than planned. The reason for the postponement is technical problems, which the manufacturing company did not disclose. Currently, according to representatives of the Space Force, -Meadowlands- has passed all the necessary system tests and is ready for delivery. This -jammer- is designed to interfere with spacecraft communication systems and acts directly on satellites. And unlike most similar stations, including the Russian 14Ц227 -Tobol-, which jams GPS in Europe, it is made on a mobile chassis. While bringing the Meadowlands EW station to combat-ready samples continued, their developer, the American giant L3Harris, managed to produce as many as five such complexes. They will be transferred to the electronic warfare unit of the US space force Space Delta 3, which specializes in protecting US space systems from profile threats. Specialists of IKK Defense Express noted that Meadowlands is the result of system development , which is known as CCS (Counter Communications System) 10 and its implementation in the Block 10.2 version, the contract for the development of which L3Harris received back in 2014. At the same time, the CCS Block 10.0 launch version was first deployed in 2004 in the number of three systems. Its upgraded Block 10.1 version had seven systems. At the same time, initially Block 10.2 was planned in the amount of 16 units, but apparently the order was doubled. And thanks to the mobility, as well as the number of such systems, which means the possibility of rapid deployment of Meadowlands in certain areas and the formation of continuous zones where the enemy will not have access to their spacecraft, the United States plans to gain a significant advantage over the enemy. In particular, leave it without satellite communication or navigation systems. After all, even in a publication in a Western publication, it is clearly stated that the main targets of this system are satellite groups of the Russian Federation and China. In particular, we are talking about military satellite communication equipment, which in the Russian Federation is represented by a fairly significant number of spacecraft, in particular, the Rodnyk-S series (similar to the civilian Gonets-M), Meridian-M relay satellites, etc. In addition, such systems as Meadowlands should also affect satellite navigation. In the period from January to March 2025, the Space Force will assess the readiness of the first five of the planned 32 units of the system for operational use. Coincidentally, the authors of the Bloomberg portal said that China now uses more than 300 remote sensing satellites with different sensors, -improving the Chinese military's ability to monitor US aircraft carriers, expeditionary strike groups and deployed air units,- the United States Space Force said in its next review of space threats. -Despite the fact that Russia has some of the most powerful remote sensing satellites in the world, their number in the Kremlin is limited compared to the United States and China,- the Pentagon said. &nbsp; Suppression systems for hostile satellite radio signals for the US Space Force from the L3Harris company.

There are no -unknown soldiers- in Israel: about the experience of the IDF in identifying the bodies...	— What is the algorithm of identification, collection of primary information for further identification of the bodies of dead soldiers in Israel? — Identification of the dead is based on four biometric features. These are the testimonies of friends, fingerprints, teeth and DNA. There are several situations where people die. For example, when a fighter died on the battlefield. He is alone or there are several of them, but they died, say from bullet wounds or something near them was torn apart, and the bodies remained intact. In this case, the recognition algorithm is as follows. There must be two people who will say that this soldier's name is so-and-so, and another is called so-and-so. Then they will be able to sign a special identification form. This happens if there are comrades or commanders with them who can recognize them. Then the testimony of two people can replace one of the biometric methods of identification, but in reality this is very rarely the case. - Why does this happen occasionally? - Simply because the dead are usually taken somewhere outside the battlefield. For example, if they are in Gaza, they are taken over the fence to Israel. There is a casualty collection station and other people working there who already have the appropriate forms and all the necessary equipment to do all the necessary procedures. And on the battlefield they simply prefer not to linger, and therefore such recognition happens infrequently. The evacuation of both the wounded and the dead is carried out by special teams whose main task is evacuation. Their task is to load the wounded into a vehicle as quickly as possible and take them to a safe place. This is usually any place where a helicopter can land, where it will fly in a few minutes and take the soldier to the hospital. This is the same -golden hour- for evacuation, which is well known all over the world. If it is the body of a dead soldier, it is taken to a collection point for the dead in the territory of Israel, and there the people from the Rabbinate take on further transportation. This is done only by the Military Rabbinate, because it is this institution in our country that is responsible for burials and for providing religious services to other religions as well. In addition, people who work at such a point have special devices that they carry with them, and they can take fingerprints for the first stage of biometric recognition right on the spot. These devices are connected to the service phone and the victim's fingerprints in electronic form are immediately sent to the database, and usually within, well, literally half an hour, an answer is received about the probable identity of the victim. - Why likely? - Two methods are required for definitive identification. When conscripts go to the army for the first time or to a reservist meeting, they are required to give their fingerprints. They must also have a panoramic photo of their teeth, photos of both jaws, and a blood test for DNA. Due to the fact that many of our citizens were once in the army, even civilians are in the army database. - What happens after that? - Fingerprints have been used for initial identification. And with some probability they found out that this is the same fighter. And as soon as a suspect is identified, officers are usually sent to the victim's family to inform them that this has happened. At the same time, the body of the deceased is transported to the military morgue and immediately informed that such and such a soldier, with such and such a personal number, is heading to you and is already on his way. This is done so that it is possible to already look in the military database, what information is available about these soldiers regarding, firstly, the teeth, and, secondly, to get from the database a DNA sample that this soldier once gave. When soldiers donate blood for DNA, nothing is done with these samples immediately, they are simply archived. they are analyzed only when there is a need for it. Analyzing a DNA sample takes several hours and is the slowest method of detection. By the time a soldier arrives at the morgue, we, that is, the identification team — dentists, doctors — already roughly understand what awaits us. We know if we have pictures, if we can even try to identify from the teeth or pictures, if there are none at all, and we don't even have to look at the teeth first, but immediately take DNA and things like that. Or at all they tell us that his friends have identified him, there are fingerprints and everything, and you just have to examine the corpse, record all the injuries and everything, and you can send it to the funeral team. That is, the task is actually quite difficult, because according to the Jewish religion it is very important to bury the deceased as soon as possible. This, of course, depends on the wishes of the family, sometimes there are relatives abroad who need to come. But there were cases when a soldier died during the day and the family expressed a desire to bury the same night. And we left for the funeral at night, at 23:00-00:00. — Vladislav, one more question. Let's say it's a person who has suffered a landmine blast injury. The face is distorted, the jaws are broken, a fragment flew into the face. That is, it is impossible to take a picture of the teeth. Fillings were mixed up there, part of the teeth were lost, a piece of the jaw was lost. How do they do it in such a case? - First, when we receive casualties after explosions, usually if there is a fragment of the jaw, I, as a dentist, can recognize by the anatomy of the teeth which teeth they are. Even if there is one human tooth lying in front of me, I may not know who it belongs to, but I know what tooth it is by number. By the way, an individual tooth can also be sent for DNA analysis. If we are talking about explosive injuries, then we have a different problem, because according to the Jewish religion, all the pieces of a person must be buried together. And so it's usually about doing a lot of DNA samples from different tissues and then matching them with the initial DNA sample of this or that soldier and deciding that it's his, and maybe it's not his, but it's his. a friend This happens when a crew dies or when several soldiers die nearby. We had an explosion of an armored personnel carrier in which there were 10 people. Unfortunately, no one could be identified by their teeth, and a lot of samples were compared for DNA with the sole purpose of burying each one in his own grave.

How -Sovietness- and -Star Wars-: Sergeant -Lucas- about BZVP a quarter of a century ago and today	The sergeant-instructor of the 199th training center of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine with the call sign -Lukas- shared his experience and thoughts on the training of new recruits from ArmiyaInform. -Lukas- began his military career with his military service in 2000 - he served in the 95th separate airborne assault brigade. After completing the -term-, he signed a contract with the State Border Service, later also worked in a department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Despite peacetime, from a review of the specifics of the service, even before 2014, he gained serious combat experience. — in 2014, as part of the unified unit of the Zhytomyr region, he participated in the anti-terrorist operation, working then in the Shchastya district, Stanytsia Luhansk. And in 2017, he transferred to the newly formed 148th Artillery Division to the position of commander of the fire support department, the military man recalls. -Lukas- says that already at that time, the division began to turn to the use of UAVs, formed a platoon of unmanned aerial systems. After leading this unit, the military man of 2019 received training on working with UAVs at one of the training centers. At that time, it was about reconnaissance drones of the -wing- type, while drones of the copter type appeared much later - already after the beginning of a large-scale invasion. — We do not stand still. Even those complexes that have been in service since 2019 are being updated - manufacturers are improving the software, eliminating flaws. Even when we were in the OOS, they came to us on the front line, worked together with us. We took off and they watched, everything is going well, what are the problems in the application of the complex, says the instructor. He is convinced that the experience of using UAVs during the anti-terrorist operation and anti-terrorist operation became an important basis for the widespread use of drones after the beginning of a large-scale invasion: - I think that if there was no experience, it would be much more difficult. Those people who worked on the UAV in 2014-2015 taught us in 2019, and later we passed on our experience to the next ones. — Since 2019, my path as an aerial scout began. In 2021, we entered the zone of the Joint Forces Operation, and a large-scale invasion was met by the crew of reconnaissance UAVs at positions near Shchast. Then they fought for two months in the Severodonetsk region, says -Lukas-. Over time, the military man had to fly both large Ukrainian-made Furia UAVs and small Maviks and Autels. In the Zaporozhye region, he fought as a platoon commander of unmanned aerial systems of the artillery reconnaissance unit. After being wounded, VLK decided to leave the service in the Armed Forces, but decided that his knowledge and experience could be useful to new recruits. He is convinced that this can be done in the best possible way in the 199th educational center of the DSHV, because the most favorable conditions have been created for this. — We try to teach everything we know ourselves, we give more than is required according to the papers. As soon as there is some free time, we try to conduct additional classes. Everyone gives 100%, we pay a lot of attention to fire, tactical, engineering training, we study tactical medicine, says the instructor. Considerable attention is paid to combating enemy UAVs - bombers and kamikazes, because now a lot of enemy -birds- are regularly circling over the combat engagement line. -Lukas- is convinced that it is not enough to theoretically explain to the soldiers what should be done during a meeting with a Russian drone - the soldiers must automatically, without trying, perform the worked-out algorithm: - Everything must be practiced to the point of reflexes. A fighter does not have to stand and remember what he should do, what the instructor told him. He must first do, survive and remain intact, and then in a calm environment to think and understand what and why he did exactly what saved his life. — I have an older son, he is 17 years old. Therefore, recruits who come to us are like children to me. We want to give them everything they need to be able to save their lives during the fight, know and be able to know as much as possible - not only what is written in the program, but also everything that we know ourselves, -Lukas- emphasizes. The instructor is convinced that it is not age that is important in the attitude towards new recruits, but their perception not only as soldiers, but also as people who must not only protect Ukraine, but also return from the war alive. - This is one of the most important, in my opinion, elements of training - we must protect our boys. For this, they should be prepared with the highest possible quality. We are able to do this because all our instructors have combat experience, he assures. For some of the cadets over 40 years old, Lukas says, it can be difficult to get through the purely physical part of the training. Then it is necessary to facilitate something, to simplify the task a little. However, he is sure that the psychological adjustment and motivation of the fighters are more important than physical endurance. — Everything depends on desire, on attentiveness. If a fighter comes and prepares with the right attitude, age will not be an obstacle for him. If there is no mood, then nothing will help a young person, no matter how physically healthy he is, he says. In view of this, one of the tasks of the instructors is the psychological preparation of recruits, the heart of their will. To train a real fighter, the instructor must be not only a deep professional in his field, but also a psychologist and a teacher. Speaking about the changes in the Armed Forces, -Lukas- notes a significant improvement in material support, food, medical drugs, and the availability of the latest Western-made weapons. Comparing military service a quarter of a century ago with training today is like comparing the Soviet Union with Star Wars. — There are many changes for the better. It is enough to look at the provision of military personnel. When I served in 2000, there was almost no such provision. Now, a recruit has everything he needs, and if it's not the most expensive brands, it's still very high-quality, solid,- says the instructor, pointing to the line of cadets who are passing by us. He sees the same positive developments in the plan of training cadets. Now, says -Lukas-, there is no shortage of ammunition or other consumables during training - the fighters have everything they need to get quality training.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/21/yak-radyanshhyna-i-zoryani-vijny-serzhant-lukas-pro-bzvp-chvert-stolittya-tomu-i-sogodni/	2024-12-20T20:25:24-08:00
A fake about Santa Clauses from the TCC in Odesa: the quilters can't take it	First, what are Santa Clauses? This Soviet rudiment has long gone out of fashion. It is attended only by children from particularly wealthy families. Summons should be handed out in the costumes of St. Nicholas - this would be our way! It turned out that, in fact, this video has nothing to do with the work of the territorial picking centers. The recording shows volunteers who were conducting another charity event. Such fakes are used to undermine trust in the TCC and SP, create a negative impression of mobilization, and spread panic among the population. Propagandists often use similar manipulative techniques to distort real events and discredit the Ukrainian authorities.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/21/fejk-pro-didiv-moroziv-z-tczk-v-odesi-vatnykam-ne-jmetsya/	2024-12-20T20:10:23-08:00

We see the activation of the occupier in the Kherson direction — the President	About this President said on December 20 during an evening address. He also said that today he listened to the report of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, General Oleksandr Syrsky, about the situation in Donetsk region and the Zaporizhia region. -Special attention is paid to the fighting in Kurshchyna: more and more North Korean soldiers have been killed there. And this shows that Russia is trying to pass off these North Korean soldiers as representatives of national communities living on the territory of Russia itself. This is Moscow's complete contempt for the indigenous peoples and for the Koreans themselves as well,- Volodymyr Zelenskyi said. He reminded that the Russian missile strike in the morning, which resulted in one death, damaged houses, the Church of St. Nicholas, as well as 6 diplomatic missions at once. -Obviously, such Russian madness should not be taken for granted by the world — everyday terror deserves ever-increasing pressure on the terrorist. Russia must answer, and even if they are led by a completely inadequate person, the Russian state, thanks to the pressure on it, must feel what reality is and how reality can punish international criminals. Greater sanctions against Russia are needed,- Volodymyr Zelenskyi said. He thanked all Ukraine's partners, who are responding to this and other Russian attacks by being ready to provide more air defense systems, more weapons that can protect against terrorists. -We have now returned from Brussels with new agreements on air defense. Also, Germany has already handed over an additional IRIS-T system — thank you,- the President said. He also informed about the meeting of the governments of Ukraine and Lithuania. -The new Lithuanian government is in full force in Ukraine for the first time immediately after the appointment, and this is a clear priority of Lithuania for the alliance between our countries; we in Ukraine appreciate it very much,- said Volodymyr Zelenskyi. He announced that he had approved the list of new Ukrainian ambassadors. -I agreed to more than 30 decisions. Among them Nariman Dzhelyal - to Turkey, Alyona Hetmanchuk - representative of Ukraine in NATO, Andriy Melnyk - representative of Ukraine in the UN and others. These and other decrees will be issued soon, according to diplomatic procedures,- the President noted. As reported by ArmyInform, the President of Ukraine discussed with a Czech colleague the training of Ukrainian brigades and the strengthening of air defense.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/20/bachymo-aktyvizacziyu-okupanta-na-hersonskomu-napryamku-prezydent/	2024-12-20T11:50:40-08:00
They take off and wait - the enemy has developed a special tactic for its fiber-optic drones	The head of the public relations service of the 110th mechanized brigade named after General Khorunzhy told on the ArmyTV stream Mark Bezruchka Major Ivan Sekach. -We missed this moment with optical fiber and, frankly, we don't know how to deal with it,- said Ivan Sekach. According to him, recently our BMP was hit, which was equipped with EW, but it is powerless against optical fiber.

He came under fire, fainted, took the prisoner and went out to his people! — the incredible story of...	The post about the fighter was published on December 20 on the brigade channel. -We drive up to the trenches - they start working on us in batches. I jump out of the car and see a flash in front of me, another flash and darkness. Lost consciousness. Came to my senses. A fragment flew into the jaw below the ear and cut the right hand. I look around - but there is no one around. Probably, the Evac didn't notice me in the dark,- -Grandfather- said. According to him, the man had never had such fear. -The point was squeezed in such a way that words cannot convey it. When KABs, hailstones, and tanks are moving, it's all scary, but not so when you're left alone. This is the worst thing that can happen in war. Got to an empty dugout. Found cigarettes and water. Suddenly I hear a voice: -Is there anyone?-. I say: -Yes, yes! In the West!-. And I remove the fuse... And he shouts: -I'm a Russian, I've come from a dealer.- Fuck your mother, I was born in a shirt!-, -Grandpa- still violently experiences those events. It turned out that the Russian was a prisoner. -That's all, I think, Khan - I'll blink for a second and my neck will twist. But he was also wounded and contused. He says they don't have food or water there - he couldn't stand it, he chose captivity. We went to ours. That Muscovite was holding me back a lot - he was walking slowly, he hadn't even heard a scream yet, so he was constantly shouting. I say: -Shut up!-. And I'm thinking - now I'll quietly shoot him and that's it. He seemed to feel it, began to beg: -Don't shoot! I'm begging you, don't shoot.- And I could not It's not so easy to shoot a living person when you see him in front of you, even without a weapon,- -Grandfather- explains. On the way, they were met by an evacuation vehicle. -The doctors immediately recognized me and rushed to the Muscovite. I say that he is a prisoner. So they all went crazy there! It was then that I lost my point&#8230; I thought my heart would jump out. Feeling as if it was all a terrible dream, and now it's some kind of fairy tale.

The Central VLK told how many servicemen with limited fitness have already passed the review	He reminded that after the changes in the legislation, the term -limited fitness- no longer exists. And citizens who received this status by February 5, 2025 must undergo a review. This applies to both active servicemen and conscripted citizens. -After making the changes, we worked out a plan within the Armed Forces, counted all these people, distributed them evenly over periods and organized such a review. As of now, among active servicemen, more than 83 percent have already passed this review. We still have December and January. So we have to finish it by February 5,- Dmytro Miroshnychenko emphasized. As for the review of conscripts, i.e. civilians who received the status of -limited suitability- in a certain period, the numbers are somewhat smaller. But this comes with a lot more people to look at. -The number of people there is much larger. They must be reviewed by commissions of TCCs and joint ventures. Given that mobilization does not stop for a single day in our country and the commissions work with those who are mobilizing, the review procedure of limited conscripts is stretched over time. Therefore, the numbers there are somewhat smaller. But the process is ongoing,- noted Dmytro Miroshnychenko. As a reminder, the legislation currently provides for up to 5 statuses: — suitable for military service; — suitable for service in the TCC and SP, higher military educational institutions, logistics units, communications medical units, etc.; — temporarily unfit who need treatment or vacation; — not applicable with revision after 6-12 months; — unfit for military service As reported by ArmyInform, conscripts will be able to receive an electronic referral for passing the VLC through the Reserve+ application without the need to visit territorial recruitment centers.

A new data protection method was added to Army+ and repeated authorizations were removed	About this reported on December 20 the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. Already 500,000 servicemen use Army+. To protect data, the application periodically deletes user information and asks for re-authorization and confirmation of military service. This is a safeguard that prevents attackers from accessing the information in the application. In the new version, the data has cryptographic encryption, which strengthens the security of the application. Active users who log into Army+ at least once a month do not need to re-authorize. Eventually, the application will also save information for electronic reports, in particular, the Army ID of the commander or the title of the position, so that you do not have to enter them every time when submitting documents. -We received many comments and comments on the need for constant in-app authorization from our users. Thanks to cryptography technology, we have strengthened data security. And we no longer need to require re-authorizations for active users. Digital services from the state should be as convenient as possible,-, said Deputy Minister of Defense for Digitalization Kateryna Chernogorenko. A new criterion was also added to Army+, according to which the system will automatically check the status of a serviceman and allow entry into the application. This will speed up data processing and reduce the burden on operators. The number of successfully processed authorization requests will now automatically increase. -Make sure your app is version 2.0.5 or higher. Download Army+ only from Play Market and App Store.

North Korean solitaire: an expert told whether the Kimchens are really so formidable	What threats does it pose? But are the soldiers of this country really as terrible as they are depicted in propaganda? Military expert Petro Chernyk said: &#8220;The defense forces of Ukraine cannot, of course, ignore the 11,000-strong corps (of North Korea - ed.), but along with that, as it turns out, North Korean soldiers can also die. Why is this important? Because Russian propaganda before the introduction of this corps raised the level of tonality to such an extent that, they say, these are some kind of soldiers who don't take a few bullets. If you look carefully at the video, where there is a direct fact of their deaths and injuries - by the way, quite high figures in the range of at least 500 people - then their equipment raises very, very huge doubts. And there is no need to talk about preparation at all. Why? Because the Russians used a classic infantry shaft without providing these units with almost any equipment. Several armored personnel carriers and trucks, as well as buggies, are not considered full support. The general conclusion in the combat component: does not affect this contingent on any very solid combat schedule. However, there is one dangerous thing about this North Korean solitaire. What does it consist of? Sources that I personally trust say that the North Koreans can deliver a whole range of mortars to the battlefield. Let me remind you that North Korea is the largest operator of 60 mm, 82 mm, 120 mm mortars. And they have a rather interesting Chinese development called the Type 63, a caliber of 107 mm: a kind of rocket-propelled volley fire system in a mortar version, which can inflict damage at a range of up to 8.5 km. There are fragmentation projectiles that fragment into more than 1200 fragments. This is quite a dangerous weapon, and if you understand that there are 12 guides, then they can hit, conventionally, an area the size of a football field. Summarizing the military component, I repeat my opinion once again: at this moment, the soldiers of North Korea have not demonstrated any special type of combat and have not become a serious decisive force. True, there is another serious geopolitical cut here. It is truly serious, fundamental and historic. In general - and we do not question this - North Korea has entered into a de facto war with Ukraine. I emphasize, not de jure, but de facto. That is, the so-called tyrannies continue to challenge world democracies, and only our allies can give a full answer to this question. Although my personal point of view: there will not be any global, comprehensive answer yet. The only thing we can count on is an increase in funding and perhaps a slight increase in the flow of weapons, especially in this segment, because it is necessary to respond symmetrically. Our allies also have a whole nomenclature of a wide variety of mortars of various types. The bottom line: It did happen. So, to some extent, the phenomenon that I keep talking about as an expert—the growing potential for our conflict to escalate into a Great World War—has indeed begun. We are still in the conventional October of 1939.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/20/pivnichno-korejskyj-pasyans-ekspert-rozpoviv-chy-dijsno-kimchenynivczi-taki-grizni/	2024-12-19T21:07:22-08:00

On the F-16 - in Romanian: why training Ukrainian pilots in the east of NATO is beneficial for every...	ArmyInform tells about the context of the creation of the European F-16 Training Center in Romania and its significance for the training of Ukrainian pilots. In Ukraine, the creation and activities of the European F-16 Training Center in Romania are considered mainly in the context of the -F-16 Coalition- - an international association designed to ensure the supply of F-16 fighters to the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, as well as the training of pilots, technicians and personnel for maintenance of these aircraft. This is quite justified, because it was the need to help Ukraine repel a large-scale Russian invasion that really played a significant role in the establishment of the training center in Romania. However, the Ukrainian factor became a catalyst rather than the root cause of the establishment of a special training center for the training of F-16 pilots in Eastern Europe. The primary reasons for the creation of the F-16 training center in Romania lie in the need for new users of the -Fighting Falcons- to train their own pilots, technicians and support personnel to maintain these fighters in the face of a significant reduction in training programs by those countries that are switching to the F-35 Lightning II. For example, in August 2022, the Netherlands closed its F-16 pilot training center in Tucson (Arizona, USA). This center, which has existed since the 1980s, has lost its relevance since the Royal Netherlands Air Force retired the F-16 fighters and eventually switched to the F-35. The reduction of training programs for F-16 pilots and technicians in a number of countries of the world coincided with the emergence and growth of demand for the training of these specialists on the part of those states that became users of the -Combat Falcons- relatively recently - first Poland, then Romania, Slovakia and Bulgaria. After a large-scale attack by the Russian Federation, Ukraine also joined this club of states — new F-16 operators. In the context of repelling Russian aggression, the Ukrainian request for Fighting Falcons and trained pilots and personnel for them opened a window of opportunity for both former and new users of Fighting Falcons. The less prosperous countries of the NATO bloc benefited primarily from the current situation, which were able to take advantage of the context of assistance to Ukraine from the richer states of the North Atlantic Alliance. The opening of the European F-16 Training Center in Romania fits this logic as well as possible. Romania began the transition to the Combat Falcons from the aging MiG-21s in 2016-2017, acquiring 12 modernized F-16AM/BMs from Portugal. In 2020-2021, the Romanians purchased 5 more Portuguese Fighting Falcons, and in 2022 they concluded an agreement to purchase 32 more fighters from Norway. The purchase of so many fighter jets and the associated costs for their basing, maintenance and training of pilots and personnel became a very expensive pleasure for Romania. For example, the value of the agreement concluded in November 2022 for the purchase of Norwegian F-16s amounted to 454 million euros. In this context, basing the European F-16 Training Center on the territory of Romania has become very beneficial for the country. After all, the Netherlands, having taken the initiative /a> created the cell, provided it with its own aircraft and equipment, and ensured the coordination of efforts to support it on the part of all members of the -F-16 Coalition-. The first five Dutch F-16 fighters ->arrived in Romania at the beginning of November 2023. -Together with Denmark and with the support of the United States, the Netherlands is responsible for coordinating European efforts to create an F-16 capability for Ukraine,- the Dutch Ministry of Defense said in a statement on this matter. November 13 the official opening of the European F-16 Training Center at the 86th Air Force Base took place Air Force Lieutenant Gheorghe Mochornice of the Air Force of Romania, located near the town of Fetești in the Borča commune of the Celeraş county in the south of the country. Romanian pilots were the first to start training. The media assumed that the Ukrainians would join the Romanian aviators by the end of 2023, but in practice it happened later. It is officially a fact that Ukrainian pilots are training in Romania z-ministrom-oborony-rumuniyi/->testified the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Rustem Umyerov based on the results of the telephone conversation with Romanian counterpart Angel Tilvar on September 12, 2024. -The number of F-16s in Ukrainian skies will also increase: a group of our pilots is already undergoing training in Romania,- the head of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry noted at the time. Rustem Umyerov thanked his Romanian colleague, the people and the government of his country for supporting and strengthening Ukrainian air defense. Shortly afterwards, at the end of September, the French armed forces notified that the first group of Ukrainian pilots completed training on Alphajet jet training aircraft and will go to training center in Romania to master F-16, since France does not have these aircraft. Therefore, Ukrainian pilots began training at the European F-16 training center from the fall of 2024. Romania is providing a training base, supplies and logistics, the Netherlands is providing aircraft, machinery and equipment, and F-16 manufacturer Lockheed Martin is sending instructors. As reports The Ministry of Defense of Romania, December 12, the Minister of Defense of Romania Angel Tilvar and the Minister of Defense of the Netherlands Ruben Breckelmans signed a Letter of Intent in The Hague, in which the commitment of the two states to strengthening and deepening cooperation within the scope of the European F-16 Training Center was confirmed. Therefore, the opening of the European F-16 Training Center is beneficial to Romania primarily because it allows the country to modernize its own Air Force. For the Netherlands, supporting Romania and Ukraine is strengthening NATO's eastern borders in the face of the Russian threat. How much the Ukrainians benefited from the creation of the European F-16 training center in Romania with the decisive support of the Netherlands is unnecessary to explain. We can only thank the Romanians and the Dutch, because during almost three years of large-scale invasion, these two nations have supported Ukraine most consistently and effectively.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/20/na-f-16-po-rumunsky-chomu-navchaty-ukrayinskyh-pilotiv-na-shodi-nato-vygidno-vsim/	2024-12-19T20:53:01-08:00
Will fly 10 thousand km: the Hungarians boasted of the development of a giant drone with the abiliti...	As informs the MSN portal, the aircraft is extremely durable, capable of performing a wide range of tasks and boasts an impressive flight range of up to 9,980 kilometers, notes ArmyInform. In turn, the researchers of the defense site Army Recognition, who investigated the drone developed by engineers from Budapest stated that in the background with the rapid development of aeronautics, PHANTOM becomes a stealthy and effective option for complex missions. Designed to push the boundaries of what drones can do, it combines advanced technology and adaptability, setting new standards in aviation, particularly with its range. The technical characteristics of this UAV from the Hungarian UAVIATOR Drones Ltd make it a promising player in the field of drones, capable of meeting a variety of needs, from surveillance to critical logistics missions. With a structural weight of 600 kg, the PHANTOM is designed to carry a significant payload of up to 500 kg. This significant capacity allows for a wide range of operations, from the transportation of specialized equipment to the delivery of essential goods. The total take-off weight of the drone reaches 1,100 kg, which is a testament to its robust construction and optimized design for long-range missions. Its 14-meter wingspan provides excellent stability in flight, ensuring reliable maneuverability even in difficult weather conditions. PHANTOM also stands out for its high-altitude capabilities, reaching a maximum flight height of 6,000 feet. meters At this altitude, it can cover impressive distances with a range of up to 10,000 km, making it suitable for large-scale international operations. A slip ratio of 52:1 provides optimal efficiency, reducing energy consumption and maximizing gliding efficiency. These qualities make the PHANTOM a valuable tool for operations that require both caution and endurance. The introduction of stealth technology further enhances its potential in sensitive environments where avoiding detection is critical. -PHANTOM's ability to blend in with the horizon while remaining undetectable by traditional detection systems provides a strategic advantage for users. For surveillance, reconnaissance or logistical support, PHANTOM provides efficient operations while maintaining a low profile.- — emphasize Hungarian engineers from UAVIATOR Drones Ltd. In addition, PHANTOM is designed with modularity in mind, allowing the configuration to be easily adjusted to meet specific mission requirements. The ability to equip or remove non-essential components makes it an extremely versatile drone suitable for a wide range of operational applications. The integration of LEDs and modular components also supports night missions and low-visibility operations. Presentation of unmanned aerial vehicles from the Hungarian manufacturer Uaviator.

Vampire hexacopter on the front lines: how a fast and long-range heavyweight drone works	ArmyInform learned about this after attending a demonstration and training flight of the heavy night UAV Vampire in the 25th separate Sicheslav Airborne Brigade. The crew of the Vampire aircraft complex consists of three people - the crew commander and at the same time the first pilot, second pilot and engineer. Now they are preparing their rather large nocturnal -bird- for flight. The goal is to practice the mechanics of ammunition drops and demonstrate the capabilities of a powerful UAV. — In combat conditions, we wait for an indication of the target and process the data, that is, we look at the horizon, the wind, how much to fly, how much -batka- we will spend - we take everything into account. Depending on the target, we select the BC to hit it - -shrapnel-, -cumulum- or something needs to be burned, - says the crew commander of the heavy night drone Bohdan with the call sign -Rambo-. The distance to the target, the battery charge (battery), weather conditions, the weight of fragmentation (-fragments-) or cumulative (-cumulus-) ammunition - all this must be carefully taken into account for the effective performance of a combat mission. Only after that, the crew advances to a pre-selected position and begins combat work. The weight of the entire Vampire unmanned aircraft complex is more than 30 kg, and a heavy-duty UAV is capable of lifting a 15-kilogram load into the air. However, these are -passport- data that may vary depending on actual conditions. - In combat conditions, he carries 20 kilograms - and he is fine. The main thing is to take into account the costs of the -batka- so that it is enough depending on the temperature, humidity, and wind. I personally flew 12 kilometers in favorable weather conditions at good altitudes and carried 6 kilograms. We then hit the target, says Rambo. However, he recalls, one of his brothers already managed to break this record - he flew 14 kilometers and successfully bombed and returned. As the crew chief talks, the co-pilot and the engineer secure the munitions, this time two of them: a home-made FAB and a hand grenade equipped with a special release shank. -Now there is a self-made 8.5-kilogram Ukrainian-made FAB and a manual cumulative grenade of 1980 production, which the infantrymen were supposed to throw manually according to the technique,- explains the pilot. Ammunition for drones is made by specialists, they do not do it themselves. But to attach two landing gear of different weight to the UAV, balancing the weight accordingly, is already the task of the engineer and the pilots. — The bird does not like sudden movements, because it all makes the -father- sit down. If you fly such long distances, you must fly very gently, be very careful with it, so as not to waste the -batka- for nothing. And don't spin - it rose and popped at the working height, explains the drone commander. The altitude at which the Vampire operates depends on the terrain and the combat environment. Changing it arbitrarily is not worth it, because it drains the battery and destabilizes the drone once more. — If I am at the top, then in order not to spend the -batka- as much as possible, I will rise to 30 meters and swim at this height. If there are any obstacles or obstacles on the way, or I know that the EW station is standing, then I go up 150 meters and bypass the dangerous area, says -Rambo-. He says that sometimes even enemy snipers hunt for a combat drone. The invaders call the Vampire UAV -Baba Yaga-, -Staraya-, -Kostlyavaya- - that's how scary and deadly it is for the invaders. — The speed of the drone can reach 80 kilometers per hour, if there is no wind. If the wind blows at my back, it will go 100 kilometers or even faster. It is more difficult to fly against the wind, but according to the passport, the drone can overcome the wind at a speed of 12 m/s, and in reality even 15-17 m/s, says the pilot. Today, the combat hexacopter was previously developed as a peaceful agricultural UAV, which was supposed to spray fertilizers or poison against agricultural pests over the fields. Now it has been improved and it destroys the Russian invaders just as effectively. Due to its original purpose, the drone -jumps- a little after the bombing, because while spraying fertilizers, it was released from its weight gradually, and the ammunition is dropped -with a jerk-. However, thanks to the improvements of the engineers, the drone quickly stabilizes. In general, in order to turn a civilian -bird- into a military drone, it had to be significantly improved - more powerful engines were installed, mounts for dropping four ammunitions were installed, and other features were used, which are not worth talking about in general. -Vampires- engineers monitor the progress of the war and constantly improve the drone, says -Rambo- and assures that these changes are quite noticeable in combat conditions. In addition to home-made FABs and grenades, the -Vampire- crew had to drop 16-kilogram 120-caliber mortar mines and install 10-kilogram PTMK and TM-62 anti-tank mines. — We pass in the same way. We bring in anti-tank mines at night and place them on the road. Then enemy equipment comes, runs over and blows up, says -Rambo-. Also, the drone performs logistical tasks, delivering everything necessary to the fighters to the forward positions. — We deliver water, provisions, cartridges, medicines, candies. We drop everything the guys need, says the pilot. While we were talking, the co-pilot and engineer finished preparing the UAV for takeoff and the Vampire was taking off. In a few minutes, the drone moves to a safe distance and the first powerful explosion is heard, followed by the next one. Having completed the task, the hexacopter royally proudly and solemnly returns from a successful mission, and -Rambo- tells that in civilian life he worked as a prospector in a mine and never thought that he would deal with the sky and flights. However, he loves his current job. - You need to carefully prepare BC, love -Vampire-, take care of him - and then everything will work. Because it is very unfortunate when you make an accurate drop - right into the hatch, and there is no explosion. This, unfortunately, happened, says the pilot. He has been working with the Vampire UAV for about a year. During this time, we had to work on the enemy's manpower, shelters, and armored vehicles. At first, 4-5 sorties were made per night, but when the intensity of hostilities increased, the number of combat missions could increase significantly. — The most we made was 35 flights per day. Back in a circle after that, says Rambo. However, the crew survived even this extremely intensive combat work, and the Vampire proved its reliability and efficiency. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/20/geksakopter-vampire-na-peredovij-yak-praczyuye-shvydkisnyj-i-dalekosyazhnyj-dron-vazhkovagovyk/	2024-12-19T20:25:21-08:00

According to him, there are enough diverse brigades in Ukraine, including those that are primarily unequipped with weapons. -We are talking about weapons here, not people. That is, not enough weapons, but not enough people. Of course, there are always not enough people, but it is very important to staff the brigades and to have them defend the state,- he said. The President of Ukraine emphasized that, after all, the war now is mostly technological. -Of course, people are important. But modern technologies of missiles, drones, long-range capabilities, air defense are all very important things.

Severodonetsk in ruins: how the occupiers erase the evidence of their crimes	This was reported by Artem Lysogor, head of the Luhansk OVA. According to the occupation administration's plans, 30 residential buildings will be dismantled in the first phase. Not even a foundation remains at the site of the destroyed structures, and the archival documentation that could store information about these objects has probably also been destroyed. Representatives of the occupation authorities have already said that this is just the beginning and that the demolition will continue. Meanwhile, the residents of Severodonetsk remain without proper heating for the third winter in a row. In the old districts of the city, earthworks, called the preparation of the heat supply system, are ongoing. However, some plots have been in an unfinished state for over a year.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy called on everyone present to work together so that China, India, Saudi Arabia, Brazil and other partners from the Global South not only respect the territorial integrity of Ukraine, but also use their influence on Russia when necessary. -We ask Europe to pay more attention to the role of these countries, as they can push Russia to respect the principle of territorial integrity, which corresponds to their own interests and will contribute to the rapprochement of peace,- the President emphasized. Volodymyr Zelenskyy also noted that it is important for Europe to make a significant contribution to guaranteeing security. Within the framework of these guarantees, Ukraine supports France's initiative regarding the military contingent in our country and calls on other partners to join it. -Europe and America are capable of bringing an end to the war, a just and reliable peace. However, in order for the United States to apply maximum pressure, Europe must take a clear position,- the Head of State added. Among the steps that will force Russia to recognize the need for peace, the President first named geopolitical certainty for Ukraine and Europe, which means inviting Ukraine to join NATO.

Corresponding changes to Resolution No. 1291, initiated by the Ministry of Defense, were approved at the Government meeting. From now on, when changing the place of service, the military position will not be indicated in the transfer order. Only his name, rank, part number and tax payer card number will be shown. The designation of the position itself allowed military units to create obstacles to transfer in individual cases. For example, a serviceman was transferred to another position within the unit. This made it possible to refuse to change the place of service, since the positions in the order and the staff list did not match. The resolution adopted by the Cabinet of Ministers will change this. Also, this resolution ensures a more accurate distribution of powers in the process of preparation and signing of transfer documents. -We are gradually improving the process of changing the place of service. Initially, this service was launched in Armiya+, which removed several bureaucratic obstacles. Further, we continue to improve it and pay attention to all the details that can be manipulated and not to the benefit of the defender,- said Kateryna Chernogorenko, Deputy Minister of Defense for Digitalization. According to her, the Ministry of Defense strives for the service of the Ukrainian military to be effective and not held back by artificial restrictions.

Corporate bankruptcies await Russia	This is reported by the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. In 2025, they may cover more than 12% of companies, which will account for about 20% of revenue. The problems will mostly concern the spheres of transport, communication, construction, coal industry and trade. In addition, the high rate has already exceeded the profitability of working capital, which makes it difficult to attract investments and leads to the reduction of development programs even in state monopolies. Further growth of the discount rate also increases the probability of a crisis in the banking sector. This is caused by such factors as: The probable bankruptcy of companies that generate almost a fifth of the income of the Russian Federation will have a significant negative impact on the economic stability of Russia. Among the consequences of a long-term increase in the accounting rate is a decrease in production capacity, an increase in unemployment, and a decrease in tax revenues. This will lead to a chain reaction that will intensify the economic crisis in the Russian Federation. We remind you, GUR published the losses of mobilized Russians according to the occupiers' calculations since September 2022.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/19/rf-ochikuyut-korporatyvni-bankrutstva/	2024-12-19T04:37:53-08:00

Assaults -infiltrators-: during the offensive, the occupiers use several standard tactics	The spokesman of the operational and strategic group of troops -Khortytsia- lieutenant colonel Nazar Voloshyn. However, according to Nazar Voloshyn, the main tactic of conducting hostilities by the enemy in most directions is the so-called -infiltration-, that is, the penetration of small groups of the enemy into positions. -Enemy attack aircraft are trying to infiltrate the positions of our defenders. Then they are dispersed and fixed. As for assaults on populated areas, the enemy mostly tries not to go head-on, but to break through the flanks in order to avoid frontal assaults,- said Nazar Voloshyn. During such assaults, the enemy's losses, the spokesperson notes, are huge. That is why the Russians introduce reserves into the battle. -The Russian military command is forced to use a significant part of its strategic reserves, which it has accumulated during this year.

About the turn of the war at sea, new corvettes and the elite club of missile manufacturers. Intervi...	The war at sea has now reached a completely new level, and this is exactly what the Commander of the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Vice Admiral Oleksiy Neizhpapa, told in an interview with ArmyInform. - How it was possible to deprive Russia of dominance in the Black Sea for 2022 - 2024? - In general, this is a fruitful work of all the Defense Forces of Ukraine. The first such successful experience was the use of the Neptune missile complex. And later, during a joint operation of the Navy and the SBU, we used kamikaze naval drones that entered the Sevastopol Bay. At the time, it was a sensation, because no one had done this before. It is interesting that on October 29, 1914, even at the same time, the so-called -Sevastopol Awakening- was taking place, when Turkish ships approached the city and attacked it with ship guns&#8230; A century has passed, and we attacked the enemy in our Sevastopol with naval drones. In addition, it is worth highlighting the strikes of our Air Force with missiles from partners -Storm Shadow- and -Scalp-. This is quite fruitful, multi-stage cooperation with the involvement of absolutely all Defense Forces of Ukraine, which made it possible to first deprive the ships of the Russian fleet of the opportunity to operate in the western part of the Black Sea, and then we forced them to withdraw from the bays of occupied Sevastopol to Novorossiysk. We also made the Sea of ​​Azov dangerous for maneuvers. — How do naval drones affect the course of war now? Will modern technologies allow us to change tactics? — Maritime drones are a revolutionary path, but not a panacea for war at sea. Of course, they are a danger to the enemy, but they are also preparing something similar to strike at us. The enemy already has some developments, but as the war continues, we are also improving our technology. Of course, it was the creation and use of naval drones that changed the course of the war, because even now they are not just kamikaze drones, they are real platforms for other drones or types of weapons. - How does the modification of the Neptune missile complex take place? - We have entered the elite club that produces cruise missiles. After we sunk -Moscow-, the Navy of the Armed Forces even won the championship in this club. I head the state commission for accepting these missiles. In fact, all modifications take place in front of my eyes. We are working diligently and are in constant contact with the Hero of Ukraine Oleg Korostelev, who is constantly inventing new modifications that will increase the missile's range and improve accuracy. Unfortunately, I cannot reveal all the secrets and new characteristics, because this may play into the hands of the enemy, but I can definitely assure you that the Neptunes of 2022 and 2024 are already different missiles. - Can we involve partners from NATO countries in the future for demining the waters of the Black Sea? - In general, we approach this issue very gradually. The first stage is demining without the involvement of partners. The second is to build up mine countermeasures capabilities with the help of partners. Yes, in 2023 we were given two mine countermeasures ships (Great Britain), in 2025 we will receive three more ships (two from the Netherlands and one from Belgium) and three boats. Then, at the end of 2025, we will have a full division of 5 battleships and three boats, which are completely renovated, equipped with modern anti-mine systems, with a trained crew, but the most important thing is that we will have a headquarters, because arms and legs do not work without a head. This is one of the directions we are currently taking in the conduct of hostilities. Of course, complete demining is possible only in peacetime, because now we search for mines, including -drifting- ones, and carry out demining under the enemy's sight. As for our partners, the NATO countries that have access to the Black Sea, which are Turkey, Bulgaria and Romania, have created a tripartite Mine Action Task Force, which began its operations focusing on -drifting- mines in the waters of these countries. We have common views, and with their help we can do it even faster. I personally met with the naval commanders of these countries, and we discussed the direction we should move. Of course, partners can help to conduct a large-scale demining operation, and then demining will be faster, but if we have all these means, then we ourselves demine the Ukrainian waters of the Black Sea, just not as fast. —How is the training of mine countermeasures experts carried out?—Currently, the main training takes place abroad in Great Britain, Denmark, and Germany. Our divers, specialists without crewed anti-mine systems, crews of ships that will be handed over to us already next year are trained there. Our mine countermeasures ships -Cherkasy- and -Chernigiv-, their crews have completed a full training course. Next year, they will undergo a full evaluation according to NATO standards and will be able to conduct searches not only for demining the Black Sea, but also as part of NATO mine countermeasures naval tactical groups. This is quite a serious step that we are taking for our future, because we have to become members of NATO. The training of ship crews for future actions is carried out with the help of partners both in training centers and on ships of NATO countries. Rehearsing of joint actions together with the ships of partner countries and certification of our ships according to NATO standards takes place at the -Sea Vreeze- exercises. These are Ukrainian-American studies, they are open to other countries. Due to the full-scale aggression of Russia, these exercises are being held for the second year in a row not in Ukrainian waters, but in the waters of Great Britain, Romania and Bulgaria. — What is the role and place of application of ADA type corvettes in the system of the Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine? — We started this project back in 2021 by the decision of the President of Ukraine. Our first corvette -Ivan Mazepa- is currently undergoing trials and will soon be included in the composition of the Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and the second - -Ivan Vyhovskyi- - was launched this year. As I said earlier, not all problems can be solved by maritime drones alone, even air defense issues. To protect civilian ships at sea following sea routes far from the coast, you need to have a fairly powerful air defense system, and it is very large and heavy. Our corvettes are already equipped with powerful weapons for reconnaissance and air defense. These ships also have missile strike weapons, which will be used at a long distance to strike coastal targets. In addition, we are considering corvettes for participation in NATO and EU operations (missions), because the Armed Forces Navy must contribute to international security not only in the Black Sea, but also, for example, in the Mediterranean. Our ships will be involved in NATO's maritime tactical groups. In addition, corvettes are platforms for unmanned and unmanned systems, they are equipped with torpedoes, as you can already understand, they have a lot of functions and purposes, which is why they are called multi-purpose. Today, there is a trend in absolutely all navies of the world to create such corvettes that will be equipped with such powerful weapons. - Ensuring the operation of the -sea grain corridor- is one of the key tasks of the Naval Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. What can you tell us about it? - One of the key moments for the opening of the sea corridor, which provides civil shipping, was the sinking of -Moscow- and the liberation of Zmiiny Island. In August 2023, we opened an alternative grain corridor without the Russian side, because before that the so-called -Grain Agreement- was in effect with the participation of the UN, Turkey and Russia. Colossal work was then carried out on demining organized corridors, formation of convoys and their support. We started then with one such a day, and now we have them functioning both during the day and at night. Civil shipping is extremely important, because it is our economy and geopolitics. There are many countries that primarily need wheat, so it is hard work around the clock for our sailors, UAV pilots, scouts and divers. It should be taken into account that the territory may be mined, hostile DRG groups may make attempts, so this is all a big job. Moreover, the enemy uses new technologies during the installation of mine barriers, and we are actively fighting this. We managed to destroy more than 1,000 mines and ensure, from August 2023 to today, the passage of more than six thousand civilian ships through the combat zone to the ports of -Great Odesa- and vice versa, which made it possible to export more than 82 million different cargoes to 45 countries of the world. And we are talking about the fact that this is not all our capabilities yet, because we are only moving further. The adversary also understood that he was losing his possible dividends, and just then, in the summer of 2023, he increased the number of missile strikes and kamikaze drone strikes specifically on the port infrastructure, but we coped with it. — How can you comment on strengthening the capabilities of the national fleet at the expense of international military and technical assistance from partner countries, namely in terms of ship and boat crews, naval aviation, marine infantry units and coastal missile artillery units? — If we talk now, for example, about the marines, then we used to have two full-fledged brigades. We have now tripled that number. The guys showed themselves in battles in absolutely all directions: Eastern, Northern, Southern, and now even in Kurshchyna they continue to repel the enemy. Our marines have more than 20,000 destroyed Russian soldiers, more than 400 tanks, 900 artillery systems and more than 1,500 destroyed vehicles. Also, Navy fighters from air defense units and mobile fire groups destroyed several warehouses with Shaheds. In total, they have more than 400 destroyed aircraft: they are Shaheds, cruise missiles, and even airplanes. Our pilots were the first to use -Bayraktar- against surface targets, and even successfully destroyed a helicopter that had just landed on Zmiiny Island. When the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces Oleksandr Syrskyi was still in the position of the commander of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces, he proposed to create a river flotilla, because such support from the river was necessary, and therefore it was implemented. Thanks to our partners, we already have two divisions of modern boats, which are equipped with appropriate weapons and are actively used on the Dnipro River and other areas. —How did the naval coalition affect the development of the Armed Forces Navy?—In general, the Naval Capabilities Coalition was created on December 11 a year ago on the initiative of Great Britain, Norway and, of course, Ukraine. Currently, the Coalition, together with Ukraine, includes 19 countries. The maritime coalition is actually one of the largest in terms of the number of participating countries and areas of effort. We are waiting for other countries to join us, because, as I emphasized earlier, the sea is economics and geopolitics, and everyone is interested in being a part of such a great moment. During this period, we managed to fully form a river flotilla, equip it with ships, we received Sea King helicopters, we are increasing our anti-mine, amphibious capabilities, we are working on marine equipment and watercraft. The coalition is working very well according to the working map, I cannot tell you the details. It is worth understanding that a fleet requires a lot of money and time, because a good ship is built from 2 to 5 years, and then another year is needed for the crew to acquire capabilities. Therefore, in order to have a powerful and strong fleet in 2035, we must build ships today, as well as platforms and other activities. We are conducting three key phases and are emphasizing priority needs: EW and EPP, firepower, intelligence, marine weapons, and aviation. Partners also understand the importance of providing us with the necessary equipment on time, and I am personally impressed by the systematicity of our coalition's work. —Recently, gas production platforms near Crimea, where the occupiers installed surveillance systems, were struck. How long has this operation been planned? - This is not a one-day operation, and it will be extended. We cannot allow the enemy to have awareness at sea, we cannot allow our civilian or military ships to be followed, and we cannot understand the situation at all. We work on those towers not only with our naval drones, but also with other types of weapons. We know that the enemy has left special forces there, but they are limited logistically, so they only have air support with the involvement of helicopters. We will continue to work on such towers. - Will the destruction of the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation make it possible to de-occupy Crimea and the south of Ukraine in general? - The destruction of the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation, if we talk about complete destruction, will be a strategic blow to Russia and will really have huge consequences for the war. The events that the whole world has now observed in Syria prove that the enemy will behave as cautiously as possible, because the fleet that they drove to Novorossiysk actually remained the only base closest to the Mediterranean Sea. Especially since they are constantly expecting us to hit. - Can we talk to you about anti-aircraft defense? - It is worth noting right away that it is controlled by the ground commander. Yes, we saw with the naked eye Russian ships near Odessa, but then we did not have the kind of weapons we have today. The amphibious landing was possible only under the condition that the enemy passed Voznesensk and entered the Odesa-Kyiv route. In fact, then Odesa would be semi-encircled and it would be possible to land an amphibious assault from the sea. The 80th DSHV brigade did not allow passage to Voznesensk, and other units, together with the marines, were ready to act in case of need. In general, the enemy tried to conduct only demonstrative actions such as: -We will land now-, but this was impossible to implement. Moreover, our -Neptunes- and, in the future, other striking means were ready to hit enemy ships. That is, no commander will send people if he understands that they are far from our coast, and a cruise missile is already coming at them, that's why they retreated.

Tactics -small infantry corps- and assault tanks: the CEO of the company - an FPV pilot told about t...	ArmyInform asked Roman about how the crew of FPV drones manages to extinguish small assault groups of Russians in the Pokrovsky direction, how many enemy military targets are destroyed by our defenders in one day of combat duty, what is the most difficult thing in the work of operators, and why did the general director of a large company become a simple FPV pilot? -The shift starts early in the morning. At night, we go to positions, change guys, debrief and set tasks, and then there is heavy, as we call it, operational work. The crew arranges a workplace underground, because the Russians spare neither effort nor means to find and destroy our pilots. Ideally, reconnaissance of the front edge of the enemy is first carried out, the locations of enemy forces and assets are determined. Coordinates of priority targets are transmitted. We are FPV drone pilots, fast combat missions. The objectives are different: they are manpower, dugouts, some shelters, weapons and military equipment. In short, we destroy everything we see. Our job is simple - kill the invaders, do everything to make them less. We work day and night mainly at a distance of up to 5-6 km deep into the enemy's battle formations. We can fly up to 20 km, depending on the technical components of the drones. Usually we use fragmentation projectiles for enemy manpower, and high-explosive drops for other purposes. Everything depends on the combat mission and the characteristics of the targets to be hit. The drone can carry up to 3.5 kg of explosives, and a heavier warhead has also been attached. In the Pokrovsky direction, the Rashists use the tactics of -small infantry corps-. The novel tells: Russian attack aircraft come in small groups of 5-6 people, try to advance on our positions, make landings, probe for weak spots in the defense, but suffer losses. We eliminate them, of course, this does not stop the enemy, he then sends the next assault group, which already attacks the bodies of -his comrades-. Photo: Natalia Kravchuk / ArmiyaInform In some places, katsaps come forward to attack on armored vehicles, but recently they use motorcycles, buggies, and even some self-propelled wheelbarrows. Here they concentrate groups of 10-12 people. Enemy EW that the enemy installs on their vehicles almost always works, but we try to quickly change frequencies and inflict fire damage. the Rashists have set up the work of trench EWs quite effectively and it is not always possible to hit the targets. But we are working. I will say this from my own experience: now in some places we even use the frequencies on which all drones flew a year ago. Then the enemy began to actively press them, which forced the FPV crews to switch to other frequencies. What is interesting: we have less losses from controlling drones on those, let's say, -ancient- frequencies than the rest. They may have been forgotten, but this is a fact. What is the logic of the Rashists? First come those who are not sorry. Next, the more professional military of the Russian Federation, who are supposed to gain a foothold in the locality, are pulled over the corpses. There were days when the -meat attacks- of the Russians continued without stopping. And we simply did not have time to destroy them all. The crews of FPV drones of the unmanned systems battalion -Predators of Heights- of the 59th brigade destroy more than 100 occupants in just one day of work in the designated area of ​​responsibility in the Pokrovsky direction. And this is confirmed data. We eliminate more than half of the rashes immediately, the rest are serious injuries. the Russians do not spare their own, no one takes the wounded from the battlefield. Plus about 15-20 more occupiers, whom we cannot clearly establish: whether they were killed or wounded. Because among the racist corpses it is generally difficult to determine what is wrong with them there. One solid flesh and torn bodies all around. And there is no time to do it. There are many tasks, because small infantry groups are still climbing. That's right, we work in this mode. To say that we are tired is to say nothing. If you count the losses of the Russians for a week, then the enemy loses an entire battalion-tactical group only in our area of ​​work. Is it a lot? I think so. We work for three or four days on combat duty, then we are replaced. A great desire to learn is required. And constant training. Not everyone is good at flying FPV right away. You have to learn to be an integral part of the team: look for targets, record hits and help the operator navigate in space. But the most important thing is the experience of piloting and hitting targets. It is difficult to control the drone in bad weather conditions, such as rain or snow. Electronics can fail. I will be 50 in half a year. I remember: 6 people were selected for drone piloting courses. Only two people successfully completed the training and received certificates. The key is practice, you need to keep practicing FPV control. Thoroughly know the technical component, be able to repair drones as needed. Where you need to rearrange the details yourself. Sometimes the drones that come to us require inspection, they are not always 100% technically sound. Again, all the information you need is on the Internet, everything is available. Another very important point is a normal working atmosphere in the team. The crew consists of a pilot, a gunner and an engineer who prepares the warhead and loads the drones with ammunition. Roman is a successful businessman from Odesa region. General director of one of the leading companies supplying agricultural machinery to Ukraine. His company delivered agricultural machinery and precision farming equipment from the USA, Canada, and France to Ukrainian farmers. Both for small companies and for holdings that are among the top 5 leading agricultural companies of our country. -When Russia launched a large-scale offensive against Ukraine, I realized that I had to go to the army and defend our country with weapons in my hands. But before going to the army, it was necessary to implement and successfully close all multimillion-dollar contracts with our partners and legally fulfill all obligations. I will tell you a story. Night of February 24, 2022. Belarusian-Ukrainian border in Chernihiv Oblast. Columns of Russian equipment are already there and are invading the territory of Ukraine. And we have $4 million worth of foreign equipment under contract. I still don't understand how, but we managed to deliver this equipment to Lithuania, and then, of course, to Ukraine. At first, I wanted to join a tank unit with my friend, who was the first from our company to be mobilized. But they were all over the state at that time. Then he got to know the guys from the 59th brigade. I say: -I want to see you.- They told me: -not yet, wait, we will call you. And for now, help the units of the brigade financially.- And then, after some time, it was already in 2023, I received a call: -we are creating a new battalion, we will fight on UAVs, come!- Next moved on to FPV. My motivation is simple: I must go to defend my country, my home, my family. And to destroy the Russians who came to kill Ukrainians. Russia purposefully wants to destroy the Ukrainian people. Not to capture any economic or human resources, but rather to destroy Ukrainians as a people or to make as many people as possible leave the territory of Ukraine. That's why I'm here in the Armed Forces, everything is simple!-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/19/taktyka-malyh-pihotnyh-trupiv-ta-shturmovi-tachanky-gendyrektor-kompaniyi-pilot-fpv-rozpoviv-pro-taktyku-voroga/	2024-12-18T20:44:06-08:00
-Tomahawks- came in handy again: the US army introduced a new surface-to-surface missile system	According to the message, the text of which is posted on the defense portal Army Recognition, this advanced surface-to-surface missile system boasts a maximum firing range of 1,500 km, which attracted considerable interest from industry leaders, defense officials and international delegations who wanted to learn more about its complex capabilities, ArmyInform notes. The MRC consists of launchers, missiles, and a battery operations center designed to counter ground-based threats. It is part of a major modernization priority for the U.S. military to develop and deploy new long-range precision fire capabilities. -Our collaboration with the U.S. military has given us a deeper understanding of its most critical needs,- said Joe DePietro, general manager and vice president of Lockheed Martin. -This partnership has allowed us to leverage technologies across our ships, launchers and combat systems programs to design, develop, integrate and rapidly deliver a solution that meets the Army's requirements. We have created new opportunities through the integration of existing and newly created technologies so that our fighters are ready at the front for any challenge.- The Medium Range Weapon System (MRC), or Typhon Weapon System, is aimed at enhancing the US Army's precision strike capability at a medium range of approximately 500 to 1,500 km. km As part of the US military's modernization drive, the MRC system serves to counter a range of critical threats, including enemy naval ships, air defenses, and land targets. Bridging the gap between shorter-range missile systems and long-range hypersonic assets, the MRC provides flexible and effective options for deterring enemy forces in a variety of scenarios. Its key objectives are deterrence and defense, operational flexibility and increased strike accuracy, enabling the Army to respond to new threats in complex, contested environments. The MRC system has a number of advanced features and combat capabilities. Her two main missiles, the Standard Missile-6 (SM-6) and Tomahawk Land Attack Missile (TLAM), provide significant versatility. The SM-6 offers multi-role capabilities, engaging both air and surface targets, making it suitable for air defense and anti-ship roles. Anti-aircraft, cruise and ballistic missile capabilities enhance the combat capabilities of the United States' Joint Air and Missile Defense Forces. In turn, the Tomahawk missiles, optimized for long-range precision strikes, allow the MRC to target critical land-based targets, such as command centers and critical infrastructure. In addition, the system supports rapid redeployment and strike flexibility, allowing it to adapt to different scenarios on the battlefield, including access-locked environments and restricted areas (A2/AD). Designed for mobility and adaptability, the MRC battery includes multiple launchers, a battery control center (BCC), prime movers and modified trailers. The TSR acts as a command center, coordinating the engagement of targets and controlling the launch process. Each launcher is configured to carry and deploy a combination of SM-6 and Tomahawk missiles, maximizing the battery's strike capabilities. The system's modular structure facilitates integration into existing army units, increasing the interoperability of joint forces and allowing them to coordinate with other large-scale assets. As informed the experts of the IKK Defense Express portal, work on this system started in 2019 immediately after its release Russian Federation under the agreement of the CISG. In 2023, the SM-6 anti-aircraft missile was first launched from the Typhon launcher, and later the Tomahawk cruise missile. Lockheed Martin has showcased the MRC system as a promising future asset for European armed forces, highlighting its potential to support NATO's integrated deterrence strategies and enhance the capabilities of partner nations. As adversaries increasingly advance access prevention and restricted area (A2/AD) strategies, the MRC offers a critical solution that enables allied forces to deliver precise, powerful strikes while remaining adaptable to new threats. The MRC system is one element of the U.S. Army's broader effort to modernize its artillery and missile forces, meeting the needs of various capabilities to keep pace with new threats. Lockheed Martin's partnership with the US Army reflects a commitment to expanding long-range precision fire and medium-range strike capabilities, consistent with a broader vision of multi-domain military operations where joint forces are coordinated on land, sea and in the air.

Discrediting Ukraine in the West with the help of AI: how the Kremlin is fighting for the minds of t...	The researchers found that several videos were actually voiced by real people. This was determined by a noticeable Russian accent. The -Agency of Social Design- - a Russian structure under US sanctions - is behind the organization of the campaign. ArmiyaInform has already mentioned her more than once. Yes, in the summer of last year during a similar campaign of the ASP prepared a series of provocative materials which, according to the authors' intention, had transfer responsibility for undermining the Kakhovskaya HPP dam to Ukraine and create the preconditions for a political crisis. And in September, the current media received leak of internal documents of ASP with information about almost 40,000 units of fake content. The target audience of these materials is citizens of Ukraine's partner countries, but its activities are mainly focused on the information field of four countries: Germany, France, the USA, and Israel. In a video presentation of ASP, which reached journalists as part of a September leak and was apparently not public, they include among their assets: After a thorough description of the disinformation -achievements- of ASP, a voiceover says: -The battlefield is the minds of the inhabitants of planet Earth.- So Russia has long been openly waging war against the entire civilized world, or even the entire planet.

Also, the person involved tried to justify the war crimes of the Rashists, including the Russian shelling of the civilian infrastructure of Ukraine. Separately, the cleric imposed his own intolerance towards representatives of other faiths on parishioners and incited religious enmity. SBU employees documented the crimes of the person involved. The forensic-linguistic examination initiated by the Security Service confirmed the facts of information-subversive activities of the archpriest in favor of the Russian Federation. On the basis of the collected evidence, the investigators of the Security Service informed the suspect of suspicion under two articles of the Criminal Code of Ukraine: The investigation is ongoing to establish all the circumstances of the crime.

The Russians plan to invest almost 3 billion rubles in their construction. High-rise buildings, of course, will be sold as a mortgage. So only Russians will be able to purchase them.

The energy crisis in occupied Abkhazia is a direct consequence of the rule of the Russian peace	About this notifies the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. Currently, electricity is supplied to the population and state institutions only for three hours during daylight hours. Under these circumstances, the majority of educational and medical institutions do not function. The official explanation for the shortage of electricity is a significant drop in the water level in the reservoir of the Ingur HPP. However, the real reason is the destructive influence of Russia, which stopped subsidies to Abkhazia. The goal is to demonstrate to the local population and -political elites- the complete economic dependence of the quasi-formation on the Russian Federation. We will remind that on September 1, Russia partially stopped subsidies to the region (including subsidies for energy resources) due to Sukhumi's failure to fulfill its obligations under -intergovernmental- agreements. At the same time, on December 3, under pressure from the public and the opposition, the -parliament- of Abkhazia refused to ratify the investment agreement with the Russian Federation, which caused a complete halt in Moscow's financing and its coverage of the electricity deficit in the region. In this way, the Kremlin creates the conditions for the guaranteed election of the most loyal candidate to Moscow during the early -presidential elections- scheduled for February 15, 2025. The search for a compromise solution with the Russian Federation is significantly complicated by the different positions of the parties. Abkhazia believes that Russia is obliged to ensure the proper level of the socio-economic situation in the region in order to preserve the political autonomy of Sukhumi. In contrast, the Kremlin believes that Abkhazia must unconditionally agree to any terms of economic cooperation, even those that completely ignore the interests of local residents. The collapse of the economy and infrastructure, energy crises, political instability and the impoverishment of the population are the direct consequences of the rule of the -Russian peace- not only in Abkhazia, but also in all territories temporarily occupied by Russia. Abkhazia is a vivid example of what any territory in which the -Russian measure- will be established will be. We remind you that the Russian shadow fleet at sea is equal to an ecological disaster.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/18/energetychna-kryza-v-okupovanij-abhaziyi-pryami-naslidky-panuvannya-ruskogo-mira/	2024-12-18T10:41:10-08:00

Both vessels should have been decommissioned 10-15 years ago. Volgoneft 212 was launched in 1969, and Volgoneft 239 in 1973. The maximum term of their service does not exceed 40 years.

Swept away with a bad broom: an expert on the unique successes of the Defense Forces in the Black Se...	Why did this happen? Military expert Petro Chernyk said: -Ukraine actually achieved several very important results. Here I must emphasize that we, a state that does not have a full-fledged navy, were able to achieve parity with the Russian Federation, and in some cases even prevail. The first moment: the northern part of the Black Sea water area - to be more precise, the northwestern part - was able to be closed with the help of missile superiority. First of all, I have in mind the Ukrainian R-360 Neptune complexes and the wonderful American Harpoon missile. Our complexes have a strike range of up to 300 km, Harpoon is also somewhere within the limits of 300 km. And it is one of the most massive and successful American missiles of this type. Let me remind you that it was with the help of R-360 Neptune missiles, as well as very cool American targeting, that in April 2022 we managed to sink the enemy flagship, the Moscow cruiser. This is a unique phenomenon from a historical point of view. Nothing like this had happened since World War II, when the Japanese super-heavy battleship Yamato was sunk, as well as the German super-heavy battleship Tirpitz. This is a truly historic combat success. Next moment. As of this minute, we have managed to damage and destroy up to 28 surface ships. Landing class ships are especially valuable. Why? Crimea is a peninsula, it needs endless support, the bridge itself and the railway thread are not enough, especially since the bridge will be destroyed sooner or later. And the fact that out of 15 ships of this type 10 were damaged or sunk is a colossal success. I must remind you that the Russian Federation is unable to build ships of this type any more. The next big success was that we managed to expel the fleet of the Russian Federation from Crimea. How has this goal been achieved? First and foremost is also rocket parity. There is confirmed information that Storm Shadow/SCALP EG cruise missiles have hit their targets in the bays, especially in the south. And such a unique phenomenon as the destruction of an underwater diesel-electric boat of the -Varshavyanka- class took place. Let me remind you that Crimea is 250 km from north to south, 300 km from east to west. And the Storm Shadow/SCALP EG missile in the best configuration has a range of up to 500 km. That's why we have such a really, really serious success. The next point is the application of our unmanned systems such as Magura 5 and Sea Baby. At most, even large-caliber machine guns of 12.7 caliber were able to be integrated into these systems. There is confirmed information that it was even possible to damage enemy helicopters that went hunting for these means. Why is it a great success that we expelled almost the entire naval flotilla of the Russian Federation from Crimea? Only Crimea had all the necessary equipment to load the Kalibr missile onto a carrier. It is actually a very complex technological procedure to load these rockets. These are special cranes and special equipment. Only in Crimea were they of sufficient quality. At the new base, which is in Abkhazia and Novorossiysk, this equipment is not of such high quality and good quality. At the same time, the enemy should not be underestimated. The Russians still have up to 20 Kalibr cruise missile carriers in service. Let me remind you that the range of their strikes is about two and a half thousand kilometers. There is a so-called Volgodon Basin in the Russian Federation. That is, between the Sea of ​​Azov and the Caspian Sea there is a network of channels through which these relatively small vessels can move, and they can and will strike from the Caspian Sea. So, let's summarize. the Russian Federation, which had a very powerful fleet, seven military bases, one of them in Syria, 89 ships is a lot. In less than three years, it loses a third of its potential. And this really speaks of two things: about the highly intelligent organization of a battle at sea by a country that does not have a full-fledged fleet. I mean us, Ukrainians. And it will continue. We understand that the Russians can no longer deliver really heavy frigate-type ships to the Black Sea. Why? The Montreux Doctrine of 1936, signed in Switzerland as a result of the First World War, where all the players in the world at the time agreed that if any hostilities began in the Black Sea, Turkey would close the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles. So, in the future, the Russian fleet is doomed. Well, if not to complete destruction, but to its significant reduction. I have no doubt that in the next ten years the Russian Federation will completely lose its status as a dominant party in the Black Sea. Turkey is already intercepting it. We understand that sooner or later we will have to rebuild our fleet. The good news is that we have ordered at least two Ada-type corvettes from Turkey. And one of them is undergoing technical tests at sea.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/18/pognaly-poganym-vinykom-ekspert-pro-unikalni-uspihy-syl-oborony-u-chornomu-mori/	2024-12-17T21:03:39-08:00
Vacation or money: who will receive compensation for -unused- days	Do these vacation days -burn-, says ArmyInform. Unused vacation days of military personnel do not disappear anywhere. Yes, it will not work to walk them in the next year. But they can be used upon dismissal from service, or receive compensation for them. This is provided for by the Law of Ukraine -About social and legal protection of servicemen and members of their families-, as well as Order of the Ministry of Internal Affairs No. 260 -About approval of the Procedure for payment of monetary support to servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and some other persons-. In particular, servicemen who are released from military service, at their request, are granted leave with the following exclusion from the personnel lists of the military unit for a duration determined in proportion to the time served in the year of release for each full month of service. A cash allowance is paid during such leave. Or servicemen upon dismissal can receive compensation for all unused days of annual basic leave, as well as days of additional leave, including for previous years. The calculation of monetary support or compensation for all unused vacation days is carried out on the basis of official salary, salary according to military rank, seniority allowance and monthly additional types of monetary support, taking into account the change in years of service and the norms of monetary support that the serviceman received at his last full-time position. At the same time, the one-day amount of cash support is determined by dividing the monthly amount of cash support by 30 calendar days. An important point - compensation can be provided for unused days not only of annual basic leave, but also additional. These include, for example, leave of up to 14 days for combatants. It is not provided during martial law, but compensation can be obtained for it. Upon dismissal, a report must be submitted to the commander of the military unit with a request to compensate for unused vacation days. The report must state the reason and date of dismissal, the number of days of unused additional leave and the law providing for such compensation.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/18/vidpustka-chy-groshi-hto-otrymaye-kompensacziyu-za-nevykorystani-dni/	2024-12-17T20:52:30-08:00
Survive yourself - and save a friend: at Interflex in Britain they teach takmed	Instructors bring the cadets' skills to automaticity, sparing no effort and consumables, because their lives depend on how well a fighter masters the algorithm of helping himself or a wounded comrade. The correspondent of ArmiyaInform tells about how Ukrainian military personnel are trained in tactical medicine during the BZVP as part of the Interflex multinational training mission on the territory of Great Britain. Late evening of another hard long day. After long trainings, we were lined up for the final task. We are standing in front of a hangar capable of accommodating the An-225 -Mriya-. The main gate is now closed, so the instructors enter and exit through a door almost invisible against the background of the huge structure. Inside, something is happening - plumes of smoke are coming out of the ajar doors and cracks under the gates, the muffled sounds of explosions and the ringing -gunfire- can be heard. It is clear that this is an audio recording played through powerful speakers, but the feeling is still unpleasant - it seems that a real battle is going on somewhere nearby. Our task is to provide first aid to the wounded under conditions simulating combat. To do this, you need to find a fighter in the hangar who needs help, find out what kind of injury he has and work out according to a well-learned algorithm. We were intensively taught what and how to do it for several days beforehand. At first, classes were held in classrooms and on training grounds in the camp, then in field conditions in the middle of the forest. During this time, we all helped ourselves and our brothers several times - learned the algorithm and practiced applying tourniquets and bandages. Under calm conditions, each of us will confidently perform the MARСH algorithm without getting confused in the sequence of actions, because the number and duration of training were more than sufficient to bring our actions to automaticity. However, what seems simple in a bright, quiet, comfortable training hall becomes much more difficult in the midst of danger, dirt, and the roar of battle. Already during field training, we were able to feel how difficult it is to work out the usual aid algorithm in conditions when it is necessary to evacuate a wounded person from under conventional fire in the -red- zone. In real combat, it will be even more difficult to do this, so with each subsequent training, the instructors try to bring us as close as possible to real combat conditions. Training in the hangar is another stage on this path of increasing the complexity of tasks. We know that there is a mock battle going on outside the door and there are wounded people, but other than that we don't know anything. From a calm line-up, we will be thrown into the thick of hostilities and it will be necessary to orient ourselves on the spot, what and how to do. The first unit has already started training and we are watching closely as the instructors briefly instruct each fighter before literally throwing them inside the building. The instructor is particularly emotional, and she clearly determines which of the fighters catches the gaw and pulls him out of line. Receiving an assignment is even more unexpected for such a cadet than for others, so when our unit starts training, we try not to lose our vigilance, carefully follow the queue and maintain eye contact. I am the weak link - it was enough to be distracted for a hundredth of a second and the instructor pulled me out. The briefing is short and clear: a group of fighters has been covered by -arty-, there are dead and wounded. I need to get to them as soon as possible under fire in an unfamiliar area, find the 300th, give him first aid and prepare for evacuation. I listen not to the translator, but to the instructor - this always gives me a few seconds head start. -Are you ready? Are you ready? Go, go, go!- she shouts, grabs me by my shoulders and literally throws me into the hangar. It is dark, noisy and stuffy behind the door - the sounds of explosions and gunshots are much louder than outside, and it becomes noticeably harder to breathe in the smoke. The next ten minutes pass like a moment - everything has to be done so quickly that only after the fact you realize what and how it happened. I act instinctively and automatically - exactly as I was taught during previous classes and training. The most difficult part of the task turns out to be to get to the wounded man - more than a quarter of the hangar has to be crawled in a narrow tunnel, constantly encountering some obstacles. Then, through piles of construction debris and branches, I finally get to a tentative position and start looking for the -wounded-. The search takes several seconds - in the darkness, among a pile of dirty rags, I notice the outline of a human body, which is barely perceptibly moving. Artificial blood from the -torn off- hand splashes into the face, thickly filling the glasses, so you have to apply the tourniquet and work out the entire MARCH algorithm almost by touch. I note with horror that the -wounded- person really does not have an arm - an artificial bone and pieces of meat have been fitted to a real giggle. I shout to the wounded man, he answers something indecipherably in English so that I can only hear: -Hand, hand!- However, I have already noticed the detached arm and applied a tourniquet - we must move on. At some point, when it comes to the thermal blanket, the instructor stops me and talks to the -injured-. It turns out that he was not yelling about my arm, but hers - I tightened the tourniquet too much and he asked me to loosen it. The instructor checks and removes the tourniquet - this completes the training. We go out into the fresh air and I listen to comments and wishes for improvement. Two main points - I did not use disposable medical gloves and applied my own tourniquet instead of finding a -casualty- tourniquet. -He was bleeding, and I didn't see anything, so I had to do as it turned out,- I briefly explain the reasons for the mistakes. -Well done, 'in real life' he would have survived,- she says and puts me back in position to rest while the other cadets continue their training. The comrades are joking about how the instructor once again slipped out of the outfit of the next biggest gap. After training, we are approached by a man who played the role of a wounded man. It turns out that he is a professional actor who lost his limbs in a car accident. Now he joined the Interflex training mission as a volunteer to help the Ukrainian military. The man emphasizes that he is proud of us and that he can help Ukrainians prepare for the defense of their native country and repel Russian aggression. He says that we did a good job and jokes that he felt on his own body that we take training very seriously. The instructors also praise us, but note that in the following days, intensive training with takmed will continue, because only practice is the key to perfection.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/18/sam-vyzhyvaj-i-tovarysha-vyruchaj-na-interflex-u-brytaniyi-vchat-takmedu/	2024-12-17T20:33:08-08:00
German songbirds in the sky of Ukraine: which reconnaissance drones are transferred to the Defense F...	As stated in the official release, posted on the portal of the German government, similar UAVs were previously included in the list of weapons supplied to the Defense Forces, ArmiyaInform reports. In total, Germandrones, a manufacturer of unmanned aerial systems with headquarters in Berlin, has developed three versions of the Songbird drone: Songbird 60, Songbird 100 and Songbird 150. The Songbird system (-Singing bird- - Ukrainian. - Ed.) is the result of years of testing and improvement from German engineers and designers. The combination of the advantages of traditional aircraft and multi-rotor drones creates a new class of unmanned aerial vehicles with advanced capabilities. Vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) eliminates the need for a runway while retaining all the advantages of a fixed-wing aircraft (high speed, long range). Songbird's modular concept allows for versatile use of the various cameras and sensors installed on it. Specialists of the Defense Industry Portal Europe believes that the Songbird 150 model offers the best performance among versions of the entire Germandrones family of aircraft. Specifically, it can carry a maximum payload of 4.4 kg. The range of these drones is up to 110 km. The Songbird 150 can reach an altitude of 5,000 m. meters Thanks to its high aerodynamic properties and uncompromising lightweight design, Songbird achieves a flight time of up to two hours, which is approximately twice as long as similar systems. Depending on the payload, one flight can fly up to 25 km². The designers installed a highly developed autopilot in the drone with the possibility of programming for fully automatic takeoff and landing. This program allows you to use Songbird with just one operator, and no lengthy pilot training is required. Together with the significant flight time and tool-free assembly of the UAV, this ensures a high return on investment. A large payload allows the use of very powerful batteries, multiple cameras or highly specialized sensors such as LIDAR scanners or real-time mapping devices. The maximum allowable take-off weight remains less than 10 kg. Songbird has been tested in extreme climates - from the African desert to the tropical jungle - and can operate in winds of up to 19 m/s, as well as in extreme heat, cold or light rain. The UAV is equipped with a 20x zoom video camera and a 2x zoom thermal imager. Video communication with the ground station is carried out in LTE/5G standards within a radius of up to 10 kilometers. In the absence of communication, Songbird stores the collected information on the built-in media. The device is transported in a strong aluminum box. The time of assembly and preparation for work is no more than 10 minutes. Authors of the profile portal for UAV specialists DroneXL note that the supply of Songbird unmanned aerial vehicles to Ukraine by Germany shows a strong commitment to maintaining its security and sovereignty. By strengthening Ukraine's intelligence capabilities, Germany is contributing to a strategic advantage that could become key to the current challenges the country faces. -This cooperation between nations underscores the importance of technological progress in modern warfare and defense strategies. As Ukraine integrates these high-tech drones into its military operations, this marks a significant step in the direction of preserving its territorial integrity and protecting its citizens,- Hay Kestelo, editor-in-chief and founder of the DroneXL website, emphasized in his article. The Songbird family of drones from Germandrones has been certified for quality and suitability according to DIN EN ISO 9001:2015 international standards. Songbird drone capabilities presentation.

Fake pages and disposable phones: fraudsters prey on relatives of prisoners of war and missing perso...	informs about this Center for Strategic Communications and Information Security. Relatives of prisoners of war and missing persons are of increased interest to fraudsters, criminals and enemy special services. Criminals take advantage of the vulnerable emotional state of these persons, manipulate their desire to get at least some information about their loved one and return them home. Fraudsters are trying to establish contact with relatives of Ukrainian servicemen who were captured or are considered missing, and to seize their funds. Often, Ukrainians unknowingly help fraudsters and turn them on themselves by posting information about their relatives and requests for help on social networks. This provides fraudsters with initial information about the missing person and the relative's contact information. The victim can be contacted both directly on the social network where the ad is posted, and by phone or via messenger. Fraudsters create fake pages in social networks and use -disposable- numbers. Offer of a -list for exchange- service. Fraudsters contact relatives of captives and offer assistance in speeding up the process of releasing the person from captivity. Relatives of a missing serviceman may be told that he is in captivity. Fraudsters can pose as representatives of official structures (SBU, GUR, counterintelligence, etc.) or as persons with connections in these structures. The victim can be shown a list from the -database- of persons who are allegedly planned to be exchanged in the near future. And offer to include their relative in this list. For this -service-, fraudsters ask to transfer funds to a private or even -official- bank account. After receiving money, fraudsters usually stop contacting the victim. However, relapses are also possible: an attempt to re-take possession of the funds of the defrauded person with the assurance that -this time everything will definitely work out-, or the -explanation- that -tariffs have increased-. Scheme -your relative is in hospital.- Fraudsters have adapted the old scheme -your relative is in need- to the realities of wartime. It applies mainly to people who have posted an ad about the disappearance of a missing relative. The fraudster makes contact and claims that this person is in some remote hospital or hospital after a serious injury and urgently needs funds for his treatment. The attacker can pretend to be a fellow soldier (especially if the unit is listed in the ad), a volunteer or just an acquaintance, a doctor, etc. During the contact, the fraudster puts pressure on the victim, claiming that a person's life literally depends on the urgent transfer of funds, without giving time for additional verification of information. Extortion of non-existent debts. Criminals call relatives of a serviceman, usually his wife or mother, and demand the return of some debt, intimidate and threaten. Other members of the criminal group, who may pose as comrades in arms, offer to help -solve the matter.- Getting access to a bank account. Another old scam used on military relatives. Under various pretexts, fraudsters try to obtain the number and CVV code of the card to which payments are received. Or gain access to the Internet banking account by issuing a virtual duplicate of the victim's SIM card. For this, they can ask to turn off the phone for some time so that the real card is not online. Having gained access to the account, fraudsters withdraw funds from it. The Coordinating Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War takes care of assistance to relatives of prisoners, missing military personnel and civilians. You can contact the Coordination Headquarters in Kyiv directly (in particular, the hotline 0 800 300 529), and consultative centers in Kharkiv, Lviv, Mykolaiv, and Vinnytsia. Employees of the Coordination Headquarters provide relatives of captured and missing persons with detailed instructions on all necessary actions. The road map of actions in case your relative disappeared or was captured is published on the official website of the Coordination Headquarters. It is also worth remembering that: According to the materials of the Center for Strategic Communications and Information Security &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/18/fejkovi-storinky-i-odnorazovi-telefony-shahrayi-polyuyut-na-rodychiv-vijskovopolonenyh-i-znyklyh-bezvisty/	2024-12-17T20:08:07-08:00

And it is clear from these vehicles that the Russians are trying to cover them with something, they are making some strange boxes with hooks for drones. Spoiler alert, none of this helps much. We can conclude that they probably don't use it because of a good life. I hope that this is an indicator that the Russians do not have enough armor,- said Oleksiy Godzenko. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the 413th battalion of unmanned systems -Raid- of the SBS of the Armed Forces of Ukraine showed footage of the destruction by missiles of the command post of the Russians on on the eastern outskirts of the village of Maryine in the Kursk region of the Russian Federation.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/17/pislya-tankiv-sarayiv-baggi-sobachi-budy-rosijskyj-inzhenernyj-genij-prodovzhuye-dyvuvaty/	2024-12-17T11:35:37-08:00
In 2024, the occupiers removed more than 350,000 tons of cargo from Mariupol	This is notified Mariupol City Council. According to preliminary information, it is known that more than 350 thousand tons of various types of goods have been exported from Mariupol since the beginning of the current year. Earlier, the Russian occupiers started the operation of the cargo sorting and transshipment station, as well as restored the large railway scales. This allows you to increase the pace and additionally transfer resources through the seaport. -Mariupol is strategically important for the Russian invaders. Invaders actively use the seaport to take away the loot and supply the military needs of their army. In addition, the port has already started loading sea bulkers with dual purpose cargo. All this shows that the occupiers are increasing the use of the port for transportation, including materials necessary for the needs of the front,- said Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko. We remind you, in Mariupol, the occupiers will launch a propaganda center. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/17/za-2024-rik-okupanty-vyvezly-ponad-350-tysyach-tonn-vantazhiv-z-mariupolya/	2024-12-17T11:32:40-08:00

This was stated the representative of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine Vadym Skibitsky during the conference -European Defense Industry: Prospects of cooperation with the Ukrainian defense industry-, which was organized by the analytical center We Build Ukraine. -The first step that must be taken is the strengthening of international sanctions. And we can see how the flow of relevant components to the Russian Federation is decreasing. The so-called secondary sanctions are also hitting the Russian Federation very hard,- said Vadym Skibitsky. He explained that secondary sanctions target supplies through third countries, companies and other indirect supply schemes that Russia uses to obtain foreign parts for weapons production. Vadym Skibitsky also noted that many enterprises of the military industrial complex of the aggressor were subjected to -kinetic and non-kinetic- influence. -This is also the cyber sphere, this is the information sphere, etc. Without influence, it is impossible to stop production,- noted the representative of the Ministry of Education and Culture. Obstructing the supply of manufactured weapons directly to the Russian occupying forces also remains an important area of ​​work. Vadym Skibitsky emphasized that the destruction of the aggressor's arsenals and military depots requires powerful forces and means of action and called on partners to deepen cooperation in the field of combating the Russian military-industrial complex. We remind you, on traffic jams on the roads of the Kursk region due to the huge amount of destroyed Russian equipment. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/17/vtorynni-sankcziyi-kinetychnyj-ta-nekinetychnyj-vplyv-%e2%80%95-vadym-skibiczkyj-opysav-vektory-borotby-z-vpk-rosiyi/	2024-12-17T11:07:16-08:00

Twelve friends of Putin — a group of F-16 hunters was exposed	The Security Service of Ukraine reported this on December 17. Military counterintelligence of the Security Service neutralized a large-scale agent network of the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces (known as the game). Criminals spied on the Defense Forces in five regions of Ukraine at once. As a result of the special operation, 12 Russian agents and their informants were exposed. Some of them are deserters who voluntarily left units of the Armed Forces, and when they were hiding from justice, they were recruited by the Russian special service. The members of the enemy cell acted separately from each other and focused on the resident (head) of the agent group, who was in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. He used fake -cover documents- such as fake -volunteer ID- and -anti-corruption activist- for the conspiracy.

In these regions, the perpetrators scouted the firing positions of Ukrainian air defense, tried to identify the locations of secret military airfields where, according to the Rashists, F-16 aircraft could be based. A separate task of the enemy agents was to establish the addresses of companies involved in the production of means of radio-electronic warfare against Russian drones. In order to obtain intelligence, those involved -undercover- used their acquaintances, in particular, Ukrainian military personnel who were in the front-line regions of Ukraine. In the case of receiving preliminary information, agents went to the area to conduct reconnaissance near potential targets. At first, the members of the agent group -reported- to the resident, and then he passed the information on to his Russian curator. Military counter-intelligence of the Security Service exposed the entire enemy cell in advance, detained its organizer and four key accomplices. During the searches, mobile phones, flash drives, military documents and fake identity cards were seized from them. The SBU investigators informed the detainees of the suspicion (according to the crimes committed) under two articles of the Criminal Code of Ukraine: — ch. 2 Art. 111 (treason committed under martial law); — ch. 2 Art. 114-2 (unauthorized dissemination of information about the movement, movement or location of the Armed Forces).

The president also reported a cynical fact: after fighting with Ukrainian defenders, the Russian military tries to burn the faces of dead North Korean soldiers to hide their identities. -This is a demonstration of the contempt that currently reigns in Russia, contempt for everything human. There is no reason for Koreans to fight and die for Putin. And even after death, only abuse awaits them,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy emphasized. The president stressed that this senseless and cruel madness must be stopped by a reliable and lasting peace, as well as by holding Russia accountable for the war that has been unleashed.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/17/rosijski-vijskovi-spalyuyut-oblychchya-zagyblyh-pivnichnokorejcziv-na-vijni/	2024-12-16T21:22:50-08:00

Strong Twardy nuts from Poland: how -Caesar-, -Foreman- and -just Vanya- destroy the enemy in Donets...	ArmiyaInform told ArmyInform about training and an armored combat vehicle from Poland, the tasks of each crew member and the power of the 125 caliber, the role of tanks in modern warfare, the greatest dangers and protection against them. Intensive training on modernized PT-91 Twardy tanks in Poland is remembered with gratitude by fellow crew members. They say that they taught conscientiously, trying to prepare Ukrainian tankers as well as possible for real combat operations. — The Poles tried very hard to explain and teach us everything. They are great guys, to be honest. They wanted to explain to us in a human way - so that it was both elementary and understandable. Not for the proforma, not to hand in the papers, but precisely so that we can then actually fight on this tank, says the commander of the -Foreman- tank. However, he immediately adds, then he had to learn a lot on his own, because in a few weeks of study in Poland, you can manage to master only the minimally necessary basic knowledge. Tankers acquired real skills already in Ukraine, including during intensive combat operations in Zaporizhzhia. Tankers also speak positively about their combat vehicle, a modification of the tank based on the T-72M1 improved by the Poles. Her engine is powerful and reliable, her defenses are improved and strengthened, and her fire control system and sights allow for extremely accurate fire. — The car itself, if in good condition, is very nice. If good equipment is well repaired, it will show itself well. If there is something wrong with it, then it is not a technique anymore. It can only stand for repairs and nothing more. The car must be ready to leave, everything must work perfectly, -Caesar- emphasizes. Tankers explain that it is especially dangerous to detect a malfunction already during a battle. They recall a case when they came up close to the enemy - at a distance of about 100 meters - and after the first shot they had to quickly retreat, because the armored car broke down. This should not happen, they emphasize. As we speak, several mechanics are inspecting, testing and repairing the Twardy. In a few minutes, they start the powerful engine of the armored car - the environment is filled with a loud growl. The task of their team is to ensure what the commander talks about - the full serviceability and reliable reliability of the tank in battle. — If something doesn't work even a little bit, that's it. When we went to battle with the overhaul, it was the best. Then, confident in the car, you leave and don't worry that something might break in your car. You're not afraid that something might get stuck somewhere in you, - the gunner -Foreman- picks up the commander's words. In difficult situations, the tankers are saved by the coordinated work of the team, first of all, the least talkative member of the crew - Mechvod Ivan, who is called -just Vanya- by his comrades without a call sign. It is he who is responsible for the speed and maneuverability of the battleship and, ultimately, for the safety of the crew. — Everything depends on the driver. Maneuverability must be at a height so that he can quickly bring you in and then take you out even faster when we roll away. Therefore, a serviceable car and a good mechanic are the foundation, more than half of the task depends on them, the tank commander emphasizes. Mehvod Ivan modestly smiles and notes that his job is simple - to follow the road and react to the situation, to follow the commander's orders. However, he immediately adds that in a combat environment, one also has to make decisions independently, without waiting for a direct order. -If the commander is busy, then you yourself decide where and how to maneuver, where to go,- he says. - Then you choose the path yourself and react to the situation, because there is no time to wait for orders - you need to make decisions yourself. The gunner continues that his task is to be able to feel the maneuvers of the combat vehicle and take it into account when firing. He emphasizes that shooting from a tank while moving requires completely different skills and abilities than when shooting from stationary closed positions. - You need to feel the car - when it is moving, you need to turn the turret and catch the sight on the move, take prejudices, take into account the movement. When I hear that he (nods at the mechvod Ivan) is turning, I immediately take it into account when aiming, explains the gunner -Foreman-. The tank commander smiles and says that with experienced comrades, his tasks are the easiest - to give instructions to whom and what to do. And if the crew is experienced, then this is not necessary either - they will do everything themselves. However, all jokes aside, the role of the commander is important in battle, because thanks to the information from the headquarters and what he sees with his own eyes, he is the one who best navigates the combat situation and makes the most well-considered decision. — You talk to your crew and keep in touch with headquarters. They correct us from the -bird's eye-, but they can't see everything that we see from above, so we have to decide for ourselves how to carry out the order. For example, they cannot see from above that there are bushes in front of the tank, but we take this into account and act at our own discretion, - explains -Caesar-. Speaking about the effectiveness of tanks in modern warfare, fighters speak highly of the combat qualities of powerful tanks and the tasks they are capable of performing. Enemy armored vehicles, accumulations of infantry and enemy shelters - everything that can be reached by the direct fire of the -long arm- of the tank gun is guaranteed to be destroyed. — 125 caliber can do serious wonders with direct aim. Imagine that the tank is 300, 200 meters away from the enemy shelter and -dismantles- it - how will the enemy feel? The tank is a terrible machine and it will do a job that no one else can do - neither mortars nor artillery, says the commander of -Tvardogo-. He explains that the kinetic energy of an armor-piercing cartridge alone is enough to completely destroy the enemy's position in any structure in which he tried to entrench himself. Enemy infantrymen are destroyed by the very fragments of the walls, which fly in all directions after being hit by a tank shell. Realizing the danger of tanks, the Russians are intensively hunting Ukrainian armored fortresses on tracks. Tankers consider FPV drones, the Lancet barrage munition and the Kornet anti-tank missile to be the most dangerous threats. Anti-tank mines are also dangerous. In addition to the PT-91 Twardy's composite armor and explosive dynamic protection, EW and protective shields help defend against these threats. They appeared, the tankers recall, at about the same time. Back in the summer of 2023, there were no REBs or protective screens on the tanks, but already about a year ago, in the fall - at the beginning of winter, they began to spread more and more. At first, screens were self-made, later also factory ones appeared. Now every tank is protected by them, because they have proven their high efficiency, saving the lives of Ukrainian tankers many times. Thanks to these innovations and improvements, the already strong Twardy nut from Poland has become even harder. And the combat crew of the tank - -Caesar-, -Foreman- and -just Vanya- - pose an even greater danger to the enemy thanks to the experience gained in previous battles.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/17/miczni-gorishky-twardy-z-polshhi-yak-czezar-prorab-ta-prosto-vanya-nyshhat-voroga-na-donechchyni/	2024-12-16T21:02:08-08:00
At first glance - a business jet: the US Army will acquire a high-tech spy plane	As informs the defense portal Army Recognition, the US Department of Defense (DoD) has released a new image of the ATHENA army platform (ATHEN - Ukrainian), an advanced intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) aircraft, which is closely related to the capabilities of a modern reconnaissance aircraft, ArmiyaInform notes. Experts of the publication say that it is a modified Bombardier Global 6500 jet equipped with advanced sensors and communication systems, which underlines the army's transition to advanced ISR technology based on jet-powered aircraft. The U.S. Army's ATHENA A-ISR reconnaissance aircraft is designed to perform stealthy multi-domain reconnaissance missions across large operational areas, strengthening the Army's strategic and tactical advantage through real-time data collection and improved situational awareness. Aviationist website TheAviationist said that in December 2023 the Pentagon signed a contract with Bombardier for the first Global 6500, which will become the HADES prototype, with options delivery of two more boards of this model. It is planned to create an air fleet of 14 aircraft, which should replace the entire fleet of manned ISR aircraft of the previous generation in the US Army. A-ISR stands for Air Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance. The term refers to military operations and technologies that use aerial vehicles such as drones, helicopters, or airplanes to gather information about enemy troop movements, terrain, and other operational data from the air. The ATHENA aircraft is to be equipped with state-of-the-art technology designed for both tactical and strategic missions, providing the Army with an important intelligence advantage. Among its extensive mission capabilities, ATHENA stands out for its high-resolution imaging capability, using advanced optical and infrared cameras to capture detailed images from high altitudes. This capability is necessary for monitoring large areas, identifying enemy formations, and tracking movement in difficult terrain. In addition to image processing, ATHENA will be able to boast powerful signals intelligence (SIGINT) capabilities. Sensors installed on the aircraft will be able to intercept and analyze electronic communications and signals emitted by the devices of a potential adversary, which allows finding, identifying and characterizing these signals for threat assessment and support in electronic warfare. The ATHENA platform should also include sophisticated electronic warfare (EW) systems that can disrupt, confuse or disable enemy communications and radar systems, thereby providing tactical support to US forces on the ground and in the air. In addition, ATHENA's high-altitude capabilities will facilitate large-scale observations over large operational areas in a single mission. Thanks to the increased endurance and range, the aircraft will be able to stay in the air for a long time, which makes it very effective for missions that require constant surveillance. ATHENA's main goal is to replace aging ISR rotorcraft with faster and more efficient jet platforms capable of operational deployment around the world within 24 hours. With improved speed, range and altitude, ATHENA will be able to operate above enemy air defenses, increasing survivability while providing constant reconnaissance coverage. The program unites the future army fleet of aircraft of the program HADES (High Precision Detection and Exploitation System), a planned ISR platform expected to be operational by 2035. The data collected by ATHENA will play an important role in the HADES program, enabling the next generation of ISR aircraft to meet the operational requirements of today's multi-domain conflicts. The Pentagon has already made significant progress on the ATHENA project this year, awarding contracts to defense firms such as MAG Aerospace, L3Harris and Sierra Nevada Corporation. Each contractor is working on specialized versions of ATHENA aircraft, ranging from operational platforms to research-oriented variants designed to test sensor performance and mission adaptability. As the US Army modernizes its ISR capabilities, the ATHENA aircraft offers a sophisticated solution to meet growing intelligence requirements. With rapid deployment capabilities, advanced sensing technology, and high-altitude operational advantages, ATHENA is poised to provide information dominance for the Army in current and future theaters of operations. How the military is going to use the Bombardier Global 6500 business jet for reconnaissance operations.

How to defeat the enemy at sea: the expert talked about the new Maritime Security Strategy	What is its uniqueness, how its implementation will contribute to the strengthening of the naval capabilities of Ukraine in the Azov-Black Sea region in the confrontation with the Russian Federation, and what will the national fleet look like in the medium term, a military expert, a retired captain of the 1st rank, told in an interview with ArmiyaInform. candidate of military sciences, associate professor Stepan Yakymyak. - Is such a strategy timely, or is it worth it was to focus efforts on its finalization right now? After all, work on it began even before the full-scale military invasion of the Russian Federation, right? What is the relevance of the Maritime Security Strategy of Ukraine, its necessity at the present time? — Do we now need -some kind of strategy on paper-, if every second it is necessary to make situational decisions, strike at the enemy and withdraw our forces from under attack? Such a pessimistic thesis, I think, could be heard from anyone today, taking into account the situation in the war. Maybe this Strategy is really out of date? There is an unequivocal answer to this or similar questions: yes, it is necessary! After all, the actual presence of strategies is the key to victory, because in any struggle there must be clearly formulated goals and tasks that must be achieved. Only then is it possible to allocate available resources in time and space rationally, judiciously and reasonably. In the conditions of the war, in particular, as a result of the enemy's capture of Crimea, parts of other coastal regions, the loss of socio-economic facilities and Ukraine's access to the Sea of ​​Azov, issues of maritime security have become critical. After all, this is a loss of economic and other resources. They significantly reduce the opportunities of the Ukrainian nation and its descendants in the future. Therefore, at sea, Ukraine is fighting for the return of maritime spaces. There have been great successes, but the matter is not over yet: Crimea, the Ukrainian part of the Azov and Black Seas, and the adjacent coastal parts of the territory of Ukraine have not been liberated. — If we are talking about the national security of Ukraine at sea, how can we characterize its state today? — Everyone knows that, despite forcing the enemy’s forces to withdraw to the eastern part of the Black Sea, significant -gray areas- remain area of ​​the national maritime space of Ukraine in the Azov-Black Sea region. These water areas, which cover the uncontrolled part of the territorial sea, internal sea waters and the exclusive economic zone of Ukraine in the Black Sea and Ukrainian internal waters of the Sea of ​​Azov, total more than 123,000 sq.km or about 96.9% of their total volume of over 127,000 sq. km And this is only a one-sided and formal quantitative assessment of the state of security of our main national interests at sea. Therefore, the emergence of this Strategy is more relevant than ever. — What is the uniqueness of the new Ukrainian Strategy? — The fact is that a similar strategy, which defines the goals and objectives of ensuring national security at sea (maritime security), is far from available in every leading maritime country in the world. First developed in 2021, it was adopted in February 2022. But the start of a full-scale military invasion delayed its implementation for more than two years. The maritime security strategy of Ukraine is the latest and unique in its construction and development approaches. It can be classified as one of the best global standards, because the latest similar strategic documents of the world's leading states were used during its creation. For example, during the development of the Strategy, the National Maritime Security Strategy of Great Britain 2022, the National Maritime Security Strategy of Spain 2013, the Strategic Concept of Maritime Security of the Republic of Poland were studied. strong> of 2017 and others. The use of the best foreign models ensured a high level of quality of the Ukrainian Strategy. The uniqueness of the Strategy is also due to the fact that it was developed and implemented for the first time in the world in the conditions when the state is at war. On the one hand, it is not easy to develop a strategic document during permanent, 24/7 attacks by the enemy. On the other hand, its appearance takes into account the military experience that Ukraine has accumulated online during the war. It should also be noted that the Strategy is a medium-term planning document, so it takes into account not only current dangers and threats, primarily the danger of Ukraine's independence from the Russian Federation, but also other threats, including terrorism, piracy, illegal arms trade and migration, environmental threats and other. It is clear that at the present time these threats do not have priority relevance. — What should be understood by the maritime security of the state and what is the purpose of the Maritime Security Strategy of Ukraine? — A correct understanding of the subject of the Strategy is conditioned by a clear definition of the main concepts. The concept of maritime security of Ukraine refers to the protection of Ukraine's national interests at sea from existing and potential threats. In the conditions of the war, as a result of the actions of the enemy, in addition, there was a danger of the independence of Ukraine. That is, we need to use the term -danger-, including at sea, in relation to the loss of sovereignty and territorial integrity. Based on an overview of the fierce nature of the confrontation in the Russian war against Ukraine and its possible consequences, the main goals of ensuring maritime security in the Strategy include the de-occupation of temporarily occupied areas of the territorial sea, internal sea waters, the exclusive (maritime) economic zone, the continental shelf of Ukraine, as well as the provision of state sovereignty, sovereign and other rights in the maritime spaces of Ukraine. In addition, the Strategy defines other goals, the achievement of which ensures the development of Ukraine's capabilities. It is very valuable that the Strategy provides for the possibility of evaluating the effectiveness of its implementation. Although a generalized indicator for assessing the state of maritime security of the state is not given, it is noted that there are -quantitative (indicative) and qualitative indicators- provided for in the plan of measures for the implementation of the Strategy. Also, for independent experts, unfortunately, it remained unknown which indicators will be used to assess the operational capabilities of the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the Maritime Guard of the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine. After all, it is these capabilities that should guarantee Ukraine's victory at sea at the present time. In order to coordinate actions and efforts in achieving the goals and fulfilling the tasks provided for in the Maritime Security Strategy of Ukraine, in November 2024, by order of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, a consultative and advisory body was created - an interdepartmental working group, and the provisions on it and its composition were approved. - I wonder what the main figures are in the action plan for the implementation of the Maritime Security Strategy? In your opinion, to what extent will they contribute to strengthening security and winning the war? - Given that success or failure on each day of the war can be decisive, strategy in war, especially at sea, must focus on measures and actions in the short term. Of course, both medium-term and long-term measures should be planned and implemented. However, what are the main measures envisaged in the Plan to complete their implementation already in 2024 and 2025? Among the measures envisaged in the Strategy implementation plan, the following are the most important: to ensure the Defense Forces' need for Neptune anti-ship cruise missiles with the creation of appropriate military, operational and strategic stocks; adopt high-speed patrol boats with striking capabilities into the Navy; conclude agreements with leading Western manufacturers and ensure joint production of sea unmanned and sea unmanned aircraft complexes of various purposes in accordance with identified needs. As we can see, the developers of the Strategy implementation plan relied on the experience of already conducted military operations at sea. It was realized and analyzed the superiority of Ukraine over the enemy thanks to the latest models of missile weapons, which include the Neptune missile complex, and maritime robotic systems, namely unmanned surface and unmanned aerial systems. Therefore, in the Strategy implementation plan, emphasis is placed on their development. Also during this period, it is planned to: increase the capabilities of the defense-industrial complex of Ukraine in the production of products to cover the needs of the Security and Defense Forces in naval weapons; implementation of measures provided for by the State Targeted Defense Program on the creation of a state integrated information system for covering the surface and underwater situation in the waters of the Black and Azov Seas and the basins of the Dnipro and Danube rivers, in particular, to deploy and ensure the sustainable functioning of the relevant information system on the basis of the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine . Important measures should also include: holding consultations with the EU and NATO and making decisions regarding the earliest possible initiation of joint or coordinated security missions (sea patrols) in the Azov-Black Sea basin. During the period from 2024 to 2026, the plan envisages the implementation of the following main measures: signing a contract and starting the construction of two more corvettes for the Navy, probably referring to the ships of the Turkish Ada project and their acceptance into the Navy by 2030; implementation of 100% of the planned activities of the project -Building up the naval capabilities of Ukraine, sufficient to ensure the defense of the sea coast and the protection of national interests in the waters of the Black and Azov Seas and the Dnipro River-; implementation of the maritime situational awareness (MSA) system in the Navy and Maritime Guard of the State Border Service, as well as the exchange of relevant data with NATO. In the same period, the following is planned: the development and adoption of a draft law on the territorial sea of ​​Ukraine in the Sea of ​​Azov, the Kerch Strait and the northeastern part of the Black Sea, as well as the approval of a plan of measures for the demarcation of maritime spaces in the Black and Azov Seas and the Kerch Strait from the Russian Federation in accordance with norms of international law; concluding new agreements on cooperation in the field of security with the countries that joined the Joint Declaration on Support for Ukraine of July 12, 2023. in the city Vilnius, as well as the introduction of an initiative together with the leadership of the interested states to ensure the security of the Azov-Black Sea and Mediterranean regions, in particular the safety of navigation, the formation of the international platform -Safe Black Sea-. — And what, in your opinion, are the most important mid-term planning measures, i.e. for the period up to 2030, defined in the Action Plan for the Implementation of the Maritime Security Strategy of Ukraine? Maritime Guard of the State Border Service within the framework of the Coalition of Maritime Capabilities. It is about the acquisition of capabilities by the Naval Forces in accordance with the future structure - Future Navy - 2035. Resolution of the issue of the construction in cooperation with Denmark of four multi-functional patrol ships of the MRPV type for the Navy and one for the maritime search - rescue service of the Ministry of Infrastructure. By 2028, it is planned to achieve the compatibility of the Navy and the Maritime Guard of the State Border Service with the naval forces and coast guard units of NATO and EU member states, ensuring readiness for joint use as part of international formations, species, interspecies and interagency groups. These measures will be carried out in accordance with the list of requirements for the interoperability of the Defense Forces of Ukraine, considered during the meeting of the Ukraine-NATO Council of the NATO Summit in Washington. It is also envisaged to bring anti-ship capabilities into compliance with NATO standards, as well as the ability of the Navy and the Maritime Guard of the State Border Service to act in conditions of high-intensity operations, the implementation of cooperation in the joint management of integrated anti-aircraft and anti-missile defense. Also, during this period, it is planned to conclude international agreements on the temporary international military (naval) presence of NATO member states on the territory of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea (after its de-occupation), demining the waters of the Black and Azov seas, internal waters of Ukraine with the assistance and participation of the countries -partners, NATO and the EU, to take measures to ensure environmental security, ensure development of the defense-industrial complex, in particular the shipbuilding industry, the development of the system of waterways and the creation and functioning of the Center for Situational Awareness on Inland Waterways. Ensuring Ukraine's permanent presence in international institutions on issues of maritime security and activities at sea and on international rivers will also be an important measure. The set of tasks to create a multi-level system of professional military education in accordance with NATO standards, the best domestic and foreign practices, and our own experience of conducting combat operations will be large in scope in the medium term. Thus, cooperation will be organized with numerous NATO centers of excellence dealing with issues of maritime security and maritime operations. The training of personnel of the Navy and the Maritime Guard of the State Border Service will also be expanded on the territory of European countries under the auspices of the European Union Assistance Mission to Ukraine. At the same time, by 2028, it is planned to complete the creation of the Naval Academy on the basis of the Institute of Naval Forces of the National University -Odesa Maritime Academy-, and the subordination of the academy to the Naval College for the Training of Senior Officers, the Naval Lyceum named after Vice Admiral Volodymyr Bezkorovany, the Diving Center training and survival at sea. The training sailing frigate -Druzhba- will be restored and put into active use for training cadets. In the interests of national and patriotic education, a modern museum of war at sea will be created during 2024-2030 on the basis of the Military and Historical Museum of the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces (Odesa). An interactive branch of the museum will be introduced for all age groups with the use of gaming technologies for controlling unmanned (unmanned) systems and coastal missile systems. It is also planned to create the museum complex -Snake Island- as a branch of the museum. After the end of the hostilities at sea, the places where the ships of the Navy and the Maritime Guard of the DPS were killed will be established, measures will be taken to honor the memory of the fallen sailors and determine the historical and touristic places of resistance to the enemy on the island. Zmiiny, in the cities of Odesa, Ochakiv and others. —What are the risks and how will control over the implementation of the Strategy be carried out? — The biggest risk is the loss of the initiative at sea and the enemy’s attempt to overcome Ukraine’s technological and intellectual advantage in operations at sea. This requires already now, at the end of 2024 and at the beginning of 2025, to take all necessary measures to liberate Crimea, weaken the enemy's defenses in southern Ukraine, and thus create conditions for victory in other strategic directions. Therefore, if during the implementation of the Strategy there will not be a clear vision regarding the tasks and measures for the liberation of Crimea by military or other means, then the top leadership of the state and the military leaders of the Armed Forces and, in particular, the Navy will not have enough justifications regarding the expediency or possibility of conducting such an operation. Unlike -those ideas- offered by some independent experts. There are probably relevant data, facts, figures and calculations for this. As it is known, some experts offer options for carrying out a kind of -special military operation- to restore control over Crimea. This operation involves surprise raids from the sea to seize key logistics centers, military and government control points and critical military facilities after an intensive air operation to suppress all types of enemy defenses in Crimea. With regard to other risks and the implementation of control over the implementation of the Strategy, it is worth emphasizing that the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine must inform the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine about the results of the implementation of the plan every six months. In addition, the Government will make proposals to improve the effectiveness of activities to ensure the maritime security of the state. In its turn, the NSDC will make the necessary decisions regarding the protection of national interests and the defense of Ukraine at sea. It is important that the Strategy also provides for the implementation of democratic civil control over the activities of state bodies in relation to its implementation, as stipulated by the Law of Ukraine -On National Security of Ukraine-. Within this control, the media, independent experts and public associations will always play a decisive role. Summarizing, it is worth noting that the new Maritime Security Strategy of Ukraine is a clear sequence of steps leading to Ukraine's victory, particularly at sea. Yes, the Strategy does not unequivocally indicate in what way the Crimean Peninsula will be liberated - by diplomatic or military means. Because such information would be very useful to the enemy. Therefore, it should be in closed planning documents. For example, in the strategy of military operations of the Defense Forces of Ukraine at sea, which, I am sure, is already being developed and, most likely, is already being implemented.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/17/yak-peremogty-voroga-na-mori-ekspert-rozpoviv-pro-novu-strategiyu-morskoyi-bezpeky/	2024-12-16T20:39:06-08:00
Putin's regime stamps fakes about -‎Azov-: which -sensation- is replicated by the Russian media	-Azov- &#8211; a longtime target of Russian propaganda. For many years, the Kremlin spread the lie that -Azov- is a -Nazi- formation, and Russian -courts- sentence captured -Azovians- for non-existent -war crimes-. Back in 2014, when the newly created -‎Azov- in the course of a military operation knocked out Russian forces from Mariupol and defeated the troops of the aggressor country in the Shirokyn direction, the regime Putin began to stamp fakes against -‎Azov-. Using frankly false statements and a network of its political agents abroad, Russia in the information environment actually constructed an alternative -Azov Battalion-, which has nothing to do with the real activity of the Ukrainian regiment -‎Azov-. At the beginning of the large-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russian propaganda in absentia chose the Ukrainians as its main opponents nationalists, personalizing them in the image of -Azovians-. Enemy fakers still demonize Azov symbolism, ideology and organizational structure at every opportunity. Now they thought of accusing -Azov- of corruption. It should be understood that these accusations are just another propaganda attempt to demoralize the soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and discredit -Azov-. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/17/rezhym-putina-shtampuye-fejky-pro-azov-yaku-sensacziyu-tyrazhuyut-zmi-rf/	2024-12-16T20:17:59-08:00

In the conditions of interrogations carried out by the aggressor, they can be forced to voice what is imposed on them, without reflecting their true opinion or position. This is not evidence of betrayal or lack of patriotism, but rather the result of the difficult conditions of captivity. It is important to be careful and critical of videos that are distributed by the enemy. It is necessary to realize that these materials can be partially or completely falsified. -Let's remember that the informational struggle is an integral part of repelling armed aggression, and by joining forces, we can resist enemy propaganda!- the message says.

-We have our scores with the enemy-: the story of the Savchenko family, which lost two sons in the w...	Today, lieutenant colonel Serhiy Savchenko holds the post of chief of staff - first deputy commander of the voluntary formation of the Sumy urban territorial community. - Serhii, when and how did you learn about the enemy's invasion? From the TV news? — All decent Ukrainians knew that the liberators were about to visit us. After all, everything that Putin and his henchmen said on the eve of the invasion, the anti-Ukrainian hysteria that affected almost all Russians, the accumulation of troops and weapons in the immediate vicinity of the border indicated that war would inevitably knock on our door. Personally, I and my closest friends learned about the date of the invasion a day before it - February 23. From what sources - I will not say: the time has not yet come. - Weren't you stunned by such news? - No, but my soul became somehow anxious and even creepy. My friends and I, and these were mostly yesterday's soldiers, in particular, participants of the anti-terrorist operation, who at one time served in the special forces and had combat training, decided to act. We didn't have a single machine gun or even a pistol. But practically all of us were hunters, and had quite decent hunting carbines and rifles. It is about 20 kilometers from Sumy to the border with Moscow. So on the night of February 23-24, we advanced to him. Around five o'clock in the morning, they saw a small convoy of vehicles, which consisted of cars and an armored personnel carrier. In 30-40 minutes, some of them caught fire, and a few got to us as trophies. As well as small arms. Some -liberators- also fell into our hands, whom we soon handed over to the competent authorities, starting to fill the so-called exchange fund. Apparently, the stars aligned in the sky and the Lord God Himself favored us (smiles. — Ed.). And the factor of suddenness worked. Firstly, they hoped that they would be treated to vodka and dumplings here from the very morning, and secondly, the column consisted exclusively of conscript soldiers of the first year of service, led by a lieutenant who had graduated from a military school just a few months before the invasion and about the war knew from movies. True, one of our comrades died in a short skirmish. That's how, in short, my new stage of life began, which has been going on for almost three years now. In general, I will say that then, in the first hours of the invasion, many residents of Sumy Oblast resisted. And why, on the first day of the invasion, the occupiers found themselves on the outskirts of the regional center, not to mention the border villages, then, in my opinion, the factor of suddenness, their number, the amount of weapons also worked: according to these indicators, they outnumbered us many times. — After being discharged in 2006, 10 years later you returned to the army again, spending three years in the ATO/OO area. How did it happen? — During 30 years of service in officer positions, I gained experience. So, in 2016, he volunteered for the army, taking the position of chief of staff of the howitzer division in the 95th Airborne Assault Brigade. Three years later, he resigned and was appointed head of the district state administration of the Putivl district. After being released from this position, he engaged in military-patriotic education of youth. On public grounds. — What tasks are assigned to your voluntary formation? Who is part of it? — We are subordinate to the Sumy Territorial Defense Brigade. The main tasks are the protection of Sumy itself and important facilities located in the city, the fight against sabotage and reconnaissance groups, anti-aircraft warfare, as well as the destruction of enemy UAVs, i.e. -Shakheds-. For this purpose, we have several mobile groups armed with heavy machine guns. They already have 5 shot down Shaheds. Company strongholds have been set up, at which our fighters are on duty 24 hours a day, at which our fighters take turns holding the defense. There are also sapper units capable of demining and demining, erecting various defensive objects, etc. The average age of the boys is 50–52 years. All of them are different in age, profession, state of health, but they are able to hold weapons in their hands. Also, they love their land, are ready to protect their children, wives, and parents. Especially valued are people with combat experience who have undergone a -run-in- during ATO/OOS. Our formation is maintained at the expense of the Sumy territorial community. Financial support varies between 8-9 thousand hryvnias, we have some social benefits. But the absolute majority of guys joined the ranks of the formation not because of any material benefits: the driver of the same -route- receives much more. Many have their accounts with Muscovites. After all, among us there are those who lost their children, wives, parents, and ultimately their homes in this war. — The length of the Ukrainian-Russian border through the territory of the Sumy region reaches about 600 kilometers, and the regional center and Russia are separated by some 22 kilometers. Hence the question: do katsaps bother the countrymen a lot? — Already in the morning of February 24, Russian troops approached the city from the north-eastern direction, after which the fighting for it began. In some places, Muscovites managed to enter the city itself. Those were days filled with horror, the deaths of many people, including children, and the destruction of many buildings. Back in the summer of 2022, experts estimated that the Russians destroyed about two thousand buildings. Sumyshchyna is under constant rocket and artillery attacks: the distance that separates us from this devil allows him to strike from his territory. - Don't sabotage-intelligence groups give you peace either? - As my guys joke, they keep us in a constant state of tension, not allowing us to relax even for an hour. Today, our Sumyshchyna comes under fire dozens of times during the day, 5-7 DRGs penetrate our territory every day, trying not only to gather intelligence, but also to commit various acts of sabotage. These groups of up to 15 people are well prepared and armed to the teeth. I will not say that it was the volunteer formations that played and continue to play a decisive role in the confrontation with the enemy. After all, in addition to us, many units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, National Security Service of Ukraine, Security Service of Ukraine, National Police, State Security Service are concentrated here. We restrain and destroy the enemy by joint efforts. - I know that in the struggle with our eternal enemies you lost your two sons&#8230; - It hurts, it hurts to talk about it (he falls silent for a few minutes. - Ed.). The younger son Maksym died in 2014 while commanding the assault group 95 DShB. And it was his death that prompted me to go to the TCC and ask to join the army. The desire to avenge the death of my son, to protect my native land became the meaning of my life since then. On March 13, 2024, these creatures took the life of Denis's eldest son, who was serving in the 27th separate rocket artillery brigade. And if I were a little younger, had better health, I would be fighting -at zero- today. But, I think, here I am also useful. - What does lieutenant colonel Serhiy Savchenko dream about the most? - I used to fall asleep and wake up with only one dream - that my boys would return home alive and unharmed. Unfortunately, this dream was not destined to come true. So what can I dream about today? So that the Ukrainians as soon as possible defeat this wild tribe of creatures that came to kill, rape and rob. And I also dream that my grandchildren Arina, Sava and Ulyana will grow up to be worthy children of their parents, who gave their lives for their future. I am a Christian. But I will express a sinful desire that you cannot call a Christian desire. I want to see a bastard called poutine with a zashmorg around his neck. As well as his closest friends who bathe in our blood. This is my greatest desire, although I take sin upon myself with these words. But the one who lost a son or daughter in this cursed war, whose grandchildren these bastards made half-orphans, will understand me, I hope.

Norway will allocate about $204 million to strengthen the Navy of Ukraine	This was reported by December 16 Norwegian government. -Ukraine needs additional support to further weaken Russian naval forces in the Black Sea. It is necessary to protect the Ukrainian population and infrastructure from the attacks of the Russian Black Sea Fleet. It is also important to protect the export of grain and other goods by sea, which provides an important income for Ukraine,- said Prime Minister Jonas Har Støre. He announced the new donation from the Norwegian Nansen program during a meeting with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Norway and Great Britain lead the Coalition of Maritime Capability of Ukraine, which was launched in December a year ago. A portion of the funds will go toward innovation and autonomy efforts in the Maritime Capabilities Coalition. Several specific innovative projects and development projects are working on strengthening safety at sea. The Government of Norway also allocated about $13.5 million for the purchase of small boats that will be donated, as well as for the contribution of the Armed Forces to the training and training of Ukrainian small boat drivers for river operations at the training center. As reported by ArmyInform, Norway in 2025 will train Ukrainian F-16 pilots in Portugal.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/16/norvegiya-vydilyt-blyzko-204-mln-na-zmicznennya-vms-ukrayiny/	2024-12-16T06:07:06-08:00
the authorities of the Russian Federation are unable to ensure the demand for currency in the countr...	About this notifies the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. This amount is not enough to cover the entire demand for foreign currency in the country and indicates the inability of the Russian Federation to ensure the specified level of imports at the expense of the available foreign exchange revenues. According to the preliminary assessment of the balance of payments (as of December 12), exports of the Russian Federation in September amounted to 39.1 billion dollars. USA, in October - 36.6 billion US dollars, and in November - 32.2 billion US dollars. Imports were $26.8 billion in September, $27.5 billion in October and $25.9 billion in November. The downward trend in exports is due to the drop in demand for Russian energy carriers, as well as increased competition on international markets. China's purchases of Russian coal from January to November decreased by 21% year-on-year — from $13.3 billion. USA up to 10.5 billion dollars. USA. In addition, India reduced the import of Russian coal - from January to September it was 26% less than in the same period last year. The total figure of Russian coal exports for 11 months decreased by 23% from 30.3 billion dollars. USA up to 23.3 billion dollars. USA. the Russian coal industry was on the verge of bankruptcy due to falling coal prices and high production costs. To support businesses, the Russian government canceled export duties on coking coal and extended a moratorium on other duties until the end of 2024. At the same time, China increased coal imports by 14.8% year-on-year to 490 million tons between January and November. However, this growth came at the expense of increased supplies from Mongolia and Australia. The decrease in foreign exchange earnings and the reduction of exports, which is directly related to the war against Ukraine, has a negative impact on the Russian economy, increasing financial instability. As a result, this leads to a further weakening of the ruble and a deepening of the budget deficit of the aggressor country. We remind you that while the transitional government of Syria under led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) is consolidating power in the country, Russian troops continue to evacuate from the region.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/16/vlada-rf-nezdatna-zabezpechyty-popyt-na-valyutu-v-krayini-deficzyt-byudzhetu-poglybytsya/	2024-12-16T05:54:22-08:00

Enemy stormtroopers are trying to infiltrate our positions and gain a foothold. One of these -gathering points- in Chasovoy Yar is the canal pipes,- the brigade commented on the video. It is in those pipes that a significant number of occupants find their death. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the -Rarog- unmanned systems battalion of the 24th mechanized brigade named after King Danylo destroyed several units of enemy equipment, in particular the Russian MT-LB with the RBU-6000 -Smerch-2- naval bomb launcher installed.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/16/trupy-u-trubah-pid-chasovym-yarom-voroga-nyshhat-u-kanali/	2024-12-16T05:11:28-08:00

In this regard, the Kremlin began to open -volunteer- centers, particularly in Donetsk. The task of the -volunteers- who arrived from the Russian Federation is to plan propaganda events until May 9. At the same time, all measures must be structured and carry a general narrative about the exclusive victory of the Russian Federation in this war. Downplaying the role of allies, denying the alliance between Stalin and Hitler at the beginning of the war and discrediting the role of Ukraine in this war. In particular, Ukrainians will be portrayed as collaborators, Nazis, and draw parallels between the present day. Occupying administrations will ensure attendance at the events by force. We remind you, in the temporarily occupied territories of Luhansk oblast, the Russian invaders want to legalize the so-called nationalization of apartments and houses that have been abandoned since 2014 year.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/16/rosiyany-stvoryly-volonterski-czentry-pidgotovky-shabashiv-do-80-richchya-dnya-peremogy/	2024-12-16T04:57:01-08:00
the Russian Federation is unable to exert geopolitical influence on several fronts at the same time	About this notifies the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. Large amphibious ships are urgently transferred to the Mediterranean Sea from the Baltic and North Seas to evacuate the occupation contingent. There are also chartered vessels under the flags of -convenient- countries for loading equipment near Tartus. Cargo planes are used to move troops from the Khmeimim air base. Negotiations with HTS regarding Russian bases are coming to a logical end - they have no place on the territory of Syria. From the rest of the strongholds in Syria, in particular in the areas of Manbij, Kobani and Qamishli, which were not specified in the agreement on bases in Latakia, Russian troops are moving in the direction of Tartus or Khmeimim. Minister of Defense of Turkey Ya. Güler supported the withdrawal of Russian troops to Khmeimim and Tartus, assuming that Turkey would act against other Russian bases. In general, the situation is a logical result of the aggressive foreign policy of the Russian Federation. After the fall of the Assad regime, the Russian presence in Syria has no prospects. Also, the defeat of one of Russia's closest allies undermines the reputation of the Kremlin in Africa, where many leaders considered Russia a guarantor of their regimes against internal and external threats. This is yet another confirmation that the Kremlin's war against Ukraine weakens Russia's position in other key regions, emphasizes its limited resources and inability to exert geopolitical influence on several fronts at the same time. We remind you, December 15, 2024 columns the troops of the aggressor state continued to withdraw from the interior of the country to the bases in Khmeimim and Tartus, control over which the Kremlin seeks and hopes save.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/16/rf-ne-v-zmozi-geopolitychno-vplyvaty-na-dekilkoh-frontah-odnochasno/	2024-12-16T04:41:27-08:00
An enemy general was suspected of ordering the use of chemical weapons against our soldiers	reported this on December 16 Security Service of Ukraine. The official is responsible for the mass use of prohibited chemical weapons by the Russian Federation against the Defense Forces on the eastern and southern fronts of Ukraine. By order of Kirillov, since the beginning of the full-scale war, more than 4,800 cases of enemy use of chemical weapons. In particular, we are talking about combat grenades -K-1-, which are equipped with poisonous substances of an irritating effect - CS and CN. Their use is prohibited by the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction dated January 13, 1993. During the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation, more than 2,000 people were sent to military hospitals and other medical facilities in Ukraine. of the Defense Forces with various degrees of chemical poisoning. For the most part, the occupiers use ammunition with poisonous substances in the form of drops from FPV drones on the defense points of Ukrainian defenders. When grenades with a chemical charge are activated, their poisonous compounds affect the mucous membranes of a person, primarily the eyes and respiratory tract. In this way, the Rashists are trying to force Ukrainian soldiers to come out of the trenches under the direct fire of the occupiers. According to the investigation, the occupiers use dangerous chemicals mainly in the hottest areas of hostilities, where they try to hide the use of chemical agents under heavy artillery fire. The SBU identified Russian grenades with poisonous substances and corresponding soil samples on the battlefield and handed them over to the international Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in a procedural manner (chain-of-custody). Two laboratories of this institution, which operate separately from each other, confirmed the respective war crimes of Russia. On the basis of the collected evidence, the investigators of the Security Service informed Kirillov in absentia about the suspicion under part. 2 Art. 28, ch. 1 Art. 438 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (a war crime committed by a group of persons based on a prior conspiracy). The pre-trial investigation continues to document other violations of international humanitarian law by the occupiers. As reported by ArmyInform, more than two thousand Ukrainian military were poisoned by the troops of the aggressor country.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/16/vorozhyj-general-otrymav-pidozru-za-nakaz-zastosuvaty-himichnu-zbroyu-proty-nashyh-bijcziv/	2024-12-16T04:22:39-08:00

The Navy explained why the occupiers' ships are sinking in the Black Sea even without Ukrainian dron...	The spokesperson of the Naval Forces told about this on the air -Suspilne Novosti- Ukrainian Armed Forces captain 3rd rank Dmytro Pletenchuk. According to him, two tankers, which are actually river-class vessels, went out to sea without complying with shipping conditions. And the fact that they would go to the bottom was only a matter of time. -They are 50+ years old - each of them. Therefore, here, as always, the Russians violated everything they could violate. There is also information that they were detained at the anchorage longer than planned. But the captain of the ship had to take into account all these factors and, accordingly, calculate all the risks,- said Dmytro Pletenchuk. However, as the spokesman of the Navy noted, the smooth operation of rusty oil tankers is vital for the Russian Federation. Therefore, they will be sent in any weather. -Transferring Russian oil or other fuels and lubricants is more important to them than complying with the requirements for the safety of civil shipping. This is not the only incident. This is also the permanent shutdown of the identification system, this is also non-compliance with the requirements regarding coastal warnings,- said the spokesman of the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. As reported by ArmyInform, the number of barges, which were supposed to protect the -illegal construction- in the Kerch Strait, decreased - only 18 remained.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/16/u-vms-rozpovily-chomu-sudna-okupantiv-tonut-v-chornomu-mori-navit-bez-ukrayinskyh-droniv/	2024-12-16T03:52:17-08:00
Sniper record: a special officer of the GUR - Lector - eliminated the occupier at a distance of more...	The video of the combat operation was released on December 16 by the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. Sniper GUR -Lektor- was actually on the same terrain level as the Russian occupier, aimed in harsh Ukrainian December conditions, shot while standing in a trench at the enemy who was moving by landing - and hit with the first shot. -In the conditions of modern war, you have no opportunity to climb out of a trench, lie down in a landing, etc. Enemy drones do not allow shooting from classic positions,- the scout explained. The Lector's record-breaking shot was noted by the head of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, Lieutenant General Kyrylo Budanov. -A masterpiece that will definitely go down in the history of our struggle for freedom. Hitting a moving target at such a distance is a huge achievement; evidence of high professionalism and concentration, which Ukrainian military intelligence snipers are famous for. We continue the fight to destroy even more Russian occupiers,- said Kyrylo Budanov. In civilian life, -Lecturer- worked as a hunter. He joined the Security and Defense Forces of Ukraine together with his son. At first he served in the intelligence of one of the TrO brigades, and since February 2023 - he has been fighting in the ranks of the active operations unit of the GUR of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. Passed a number of specialized military training, including the sniper school of the GUR and the -Pure Anger- course from the -Return Alive- competent assistance fund of the army. During the full-scale invasion of the -Lektor- account, more than three dozen targets were already destroyed. According to the sniper, he selects a separate type of rifle for each task. The historic hit shot at 2,069 meters was made with the Sako M10. -But if I had to choose one rifle and one cartridge, I would take the Sadex Kraken and the .338LM caliber,- Lector noted. It is noted that the confirmed record for this caliber is held by a British sniper, Royal Blues and Royals Guards Corporal Craig Harrison. In November 2009, during the war in Afghanistan, he successfully hit two Taliban at a distance of 2,475 meters, and also damaged their machine gun. Harrison fired while lying down, in a significantly higher position than his targets. Accuracy, according to the corporal, was also helped by windless weather and clear visibility. However, before hitting, the British sniper had to make nine close shots. As reported by ArmyInform, during December 14 and 15, 2024, in the areas of the villages of Plekhovo, Vorozhba, and Martinovka of the Kursk region of the aggressor state of Russia, units of the North Korean army suffered significant losses ― it says of at least 30 soldiers killed and wounded.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/16/snajperskyj-rekord-speczpryznachenecz-gur-lektor-likviduvav-okupanta-na-vidstani-ponad-2000-metriv/	2024-12-16T03:39:59-08:00

Collaborator with a white armband: the court sentenced an ex-policewoman who directed Russian convoy...	About this informs December 16 State Bureau of Investigation. In March 2022, it began to cooperate with the occupation authorities. In order to facilitate the task of the Russian military, the traitor met the invaders' columns in the center of Izyum and pointed out to them where all the state bodies were located.

On the highway - up to 65 km/h, on rough terrain - up to 45 km/h. The operational range of work is up to 600 km. Shelby says the Marder has better cross-country ability and armor than the Soviet BMP-1 and BMP-2 models. They are comfortable for the movement of military personnel. The crew is 3 people, the landing compartment is designed for six fighters in full equipment. -The seats for the staff are conveniently located in the car. Even when driving off-road and maneuvering an armored personnel carrier, the guys feel quite confident inside.- Regarding weapons. The Marder's main weapon is a 20mm cannon that can effectively engage lightly armored targets and enemy manpower. Its damage range is up to 2.5 km. In addition, the BMP has 7.62 mm machine guns. Cannon ammunition is 1250 rounds, machine gun 5000 rounds. The declared rate of fire of the gun is up to 1000 rounds per minute. There is also an anti-tank complex MILAN 2T with a firing range of 2 km. The Marder is additionally equipped with a deployable anti-drone net to counter Russian FPV drones. Komroty Rostyslav tells: after receiving the BMP, the units undergo practical training. Before that, driver mechanics and gunners underwent a 2-week training course on the operation and use of combat vehicles. Currently, they are already working directly on Marder. Vehicle commanders are still undergoing training and will soon join their crews. In general, the training includes BMP management techniques, technical maintenance features, providing guidance on the combat use of weapons. The crews train to target and shoot. The guys learn to repair equipment on the spot, it is very important to be able to troubleshoot during combat operations, so to speak, -repair from the wheels.- If you compare Marder with Viking amphibious all-terrain vehicles, -Shelby- emphasizes: -At one time, we worked on APC. In my opinion, Marder is more practical in operation and has a higher degree of armor protection and more powerful firepower this combat vehicle can be used for various purposes - both for the delivery of personnel to the positions and for evacuation from them armored capsule, even if the car is blown up, the personnel will remain unharmed and can continue to perform combat missions. He came across this BMP while studying at the Military Academy in Odessa, and then worked on it at the Training Center of the Military Academy. Therefore, I think the German car is somewhat better than the Viking. Although the amphibious armored personnel carrier is able to overcome water obstacles and operate in flooded areas, thanks to the wide rubber track. -I am from Odesa region. At the age of 15, he went to study at the Naval Lyceum named after Vice Admiral Volodymyr Bezkorovayn. After that, he entered the Faculty of Airborne Assault Troops and Marines at the Military Academy (Odesa). After graduation, he joined the 38th Marine Brigade, which, in fact, he wanted to join. I really wanted to be a combat officer, to manage personnel in combat conditions, in war. To work in difficult conditions. Management noticed. I was encouraged and given the opportunity to lead an assault company. Rostislav, commanding a company in battle, was wounded. But he says everything is ok. 3 days in the hospital and then returned to his unit. -We have a pretty great atmosphere in the unit, but it all starts with a personal example. In the mouth, the vast majority are men older than me, who are more than 30-40 years old. An individual approach to each. We are the Marines, we are one team. Brotherhood and trust are the foundation. The boys pick up Marine values ​​very quickly. I am very happy when I see how my subordinates learn and strive to become better. How the level of training of fighters increases, where there is a certain breakthrough in the knowledge of combat, weapons and technical equipment. We look at the potential of each and determine where it will be better to perform a combat task, so that the coefficient of useful action only increases, and does not stand still.- By the way, recently the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, General Oleksandr Syrsky, awarded Rostislav with the -Cross of the Brave- badge. The young company commander received the award for personal courage and heroism, demonstrated during combat missions to protect the state sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/16/kunyczya-na-gusenyczyah-morpihiv-na-pokrovskomu-napryamku-posylyly-nimeczkymy-bmp-marder/	2024-12-15T21:01:57-08:00
Artificial intelligence is modernizing transport: NATO vehicles will be equipped with an operating s...	As experts from the Dutch Army Recognition portal emphasize, this system is designed to modernize existing vehicles by converting them into autonomous and interconnected units, while ensuring integration with current defense and commercial operations, ArmyInform notes. The platform is focused on enabling the military to increase mission flexibility and adaptability without the need to replace existing equipment. The Mithra OS includes the Legacy Autonomy Kit, an upgrade feature that equips conventional vehicles with AI-based capabilities. These upgrades include adaptive navigation, autonomous intelligence, and remote control, reducing the need for human intervention. The system supports both manned-unmanned and unmanned-unmanned command, which ensures increased safety and operational efficiency. Another feature, Interconnectivity &amp; Swarming Pilot allows vehicles to share real-time data and conduct synchronized operations, while the Situational Awareness Suite integrates sensors for real-time monitoring and data processing to improve battlefield intelligence. In the manned-unmanned group, unmanned units perform tasks such as reconnaissance, evacuation of wounded and intelligence sharing. In an unmanned joint, this facilitates the coordination of unmanned ground and aerial vehicles for tasks such as perimeter security and combined reconnaissance. In addition, Mithra OS enables autonomous missions, including reconnaissance in high-risk areas and demining operations aimed at reducing threats and increasing security for advancing forces. Mithra OS can also be used in a non-military context, offering tools to improve the productivity and flexibility of commercial operations. The platform's modular and scalable design allows it to be integrated into autonomous and connected systems in various sectors. ARX ​​​​Roboticsemphasizes that the system is compatible with legacy software and includes its capabilities update in radio mode. This ensures that existing fleets can adapt to new technologies, potentially extending their service life. The modular approach aims to enable operators to efficiently upgrade their fleets, addressing both current operational challenges and future requirements. According to Lt. Gen. (Ret.) Frank Leidenberger, BWI's CEO, upgrading legacy equipment is a practical solution to meet the evolving needs of the military within budget constraints. The development of operating systems based on artificial intelligence for military equipment reflects the global trend of modernization of the armed forces. Germany's Rheinmetall is working with American company Auterion to create standardized software for drones aimed at increasing interoperability between NATO allies. In the United States, Textron Systems and Kodiak Robotics are working on artificial intelligence-based autonomy for military ground vehicles, and Anduril Industries has developed the Lattice operating system to coordinate autonomous assets such as drones. Australian company BAE Systems introduced the ATLAS platform for integrating autonomy with existing military systems. These programs are focused on upgrading existing fleets rather than acquiring new platforms to address cost and operational efficiency issues. Several other systems have also been developed in recent years that turn military vehicles into remotely operated or autonomous units. Milrem Robotics has developed a set of intelligent features that give cars the ability to operate autonomously or with the help of remote control. The US Army has tested the Light Robotic Combat Vehicle (RCV-L), a semi-autonomous system designed to improve mobility on the battlefield while reducing risks to personnel. Defense company ARX Robotics has unveiled ARX Mithra OS, which it describes as the first independent AI-based operating system for military vehicles.

Drone revolution: Ukrainians show fantastic results. The expert called the phenomenon of this war	What does this mean, ArmiyaInform asked military expert Petr Chernyk: -Drones of all classes, varieties and types are becoming a very serious strike force. True, one must understand that they will never really replace barrel artillery or aviation. These are the types of weapons that will always be appropriate and valid in any war. At the same time, the drone revolution did take place and we, Ukrainians, showed fantastic results in part of their application. Here are just a few words about the types and varieties of drones. All drones are divided into two categories: reconnaissance - those that collect information about the enemy and strike. This is if we are talking about the aerial component, because we understand that there are also ground drones and surface drones, but still aerial drones are the main mass. According to the method of technical use, there are drones -on the wing- and what we call -copters-, that is, small helicopters. Their combat load can vary from a few grams or kilograms of explosives (say, even TM-62 - an anti-tank mine is already integrated into drones) to 50 kg, or even up to 100 kg. The most popular drones currently in use on the front line are so-called FPV drones. Those controlled by a person at a distance of several hundred meters to, as a rule, 15-20 km. This is precisely the area of ​​operation of barrel artillery. The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine has provided our Armed Forces with up to a million drones over the past year. Is it a lot or a little? If you divide by 365 days, you get about 2,700 drones per day. That's pretty good. At the same time, understanding that we have 1,000 kilometers of demarcation line, that's roughly 2.7 drones, rounding up to three drones per kilometer. Let me remind you that 1.5 km is an oral reference point. It's not that much anymore. This is an average. That is, in order for drones to really change something in a part of the battlefield, their number must be seriously increased. Another million plus would be a colossal step forward. The Ukrainians have reached such a filigree work with drones that an FPV kamikaze drone can fly directly into the head of the occupier, or, say, into a tinted car. Plus, in this part, drones also need to be divided into two categories: this is a suicide drone that has explosives on it, and the drone dies when it explodes, and the so-called -resets-. -Drop- is an improvised explosive device, or, say, a fragmentation hand grenade of the F1 or RGT-5 type, or RGO, or RGN, which is dropped from a height of several meters and works very accurately primarily on manpower. Indeed, drones are a phenomenon in this war. One very specific example: during 90 days of fighting, 4,500 pieces of barrel artillery were destroyed in the summer part. This, if divided by 72, because that is how the artillery brigade is equipped, is more than 60 brigades. Half of it was destroyed precisely with the help of drones. Drones are our everything, so I appeal to the citizens of Ukraine: we will donate, donate and donate again for drones. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/16/revolyucziya-droniv-ukrayinczi-pokazuyut-fantastychni-rezultaty-ekspert-nazvav-fenomen-cziyeyi-vijny/	2024-12-15T20:26:17-08:00
From a TV presenter to a press officer for the Steelers: what Dina Wong will never forget	I joined the army because I felt that I should and could take responsibility for the future of the country, that I was ready to take decisive action to stop Russian aggression, that I would finally be able to do something valuable and meaningful in my life. Dina cooperates with ArmiyaInform, tells about the successes of the brigade at the front. It recently came out na-kurshhyni/-> author's material about the commander of the division of the rifle battalion with the call sign -Red-. During the interview, ArmyInform asked Dina Wong about the brigade in which she serves, about her brothers and sisters, memorable episodes of the war, and plans for the future after the Victory. - What kind of people do you have to serve with? What is interesting about your brigade? - I am currently serving in the 1st separate tank Siver brigade. The brigade was involved in a number of key operations during the ATO period, and continued to defend the country in the East during the Soviet Union. But for me, as a resident of Chernihiv, the participation of the steel workers in the defense of the city and Chernihiv region is especially valuable and significant. In fact, I owe my life to the servicemen of the 1st separate Siver tank brigade. People here are different. But equally steel. We have many divisions, so it is difficult to make any generalization. I just want to emphasize that our tankers are currently working at the limit of the impossible. If necessary, they go out for direct targeting and successfully destroy places of concentration of enemy personnel and their equipment. In the conditions of modern war, when the enemy can direct from 20 fpv and more to one tank, not counting other means, such work requires a steel character. Such as our tankers. Fighters of the rifle and mechanized battalions firmly hold their positions in the areas of our responsibility. For me, each of them is a Hero. I think if you have an idea of ​​how the infantry works, then you can not explain further. Our gunners do not like the phrase -Gods of War-, but I believe that this description is completely deserved for them. The way they destroy the enemy is truly divine. You can make sure of this if you look at the video of their work on our page. -Pegasus- - the fighters of the company of unmanned attack aircraft systems are particularly fond of destroying moving targets. This unit is made up of people who are constantly improving their skills. Our brigade is also a repair and restoration battalion, where specialists with truly golden hands serve. These are also fighters of the engineering and sapper company; scouts, REBivtsi. Everyone risks their lives during combat missions. That's why it's hard for me to single out one person, for me all our fighting guys are heroes. - Are there any episodes of the war that will never be forgotten? - It is difficult for me to answer this question. A lot has already happened. But the beginning of the large-scale invasion of Chernihiv Oblast is something I will definitely always remember. I was a civilian then, and because of what I experienced, I am now in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Because, first of all, I don't want the war to continue and be repeated again. Second, the enemy must answer for what he has done. - Tell us about the most difficult and happiest moments during the service. - The most difficult thing is, obviously, losing your brothers. War is war, people die in war, but it is still very difficult for me when people die from the battalion in which I started my service and from the brigade in which I am currently serving. Subjectively. The happiest is working with one of our tank units. I believe (and this is my personal opinion, not as a representative of the communications department, but simply as a person who serves in the army) that one of the tank battalions of the 1st Separate Tank Siver Brigade is the embodiment of what the Ukrainian army should really be. I have great respect for all of our divisions. I admire our infantrymen and artillerymen. It's just that if I abstract and say that what has strengthened my motivation and belief in victory the most is working with tankers. - How do friends, acquaintances who have remained civilians perceive that you serve? - They perceive. Everyone understood that this would be the case. At one time, I publicly voiced my position, so some things are absolutely obvious. - Can you tell us about the oldest and youngest fighter in the brigade, other interesting brothers and sisters? - I have already said that I cannot single out one person, because I believe that all our fighters are legends. But I don't think anyone will be offended if I tell you about our pseudo-demons. She was the commander of the BMP and the commander of the department. She is one of those who protected Chernihiv. She took part in quite difficult battles in the East of the country. The guys talk about her as a fair but strict commander. People from her battalion (mechanized battalion 1 of the separate Siver tank brigade) treat her with great respect. He is a very strong, strong-willed and competent person, I am honored that we serve in the same brigade. She has already done so much for the common victory. I understand that very often people are interested in the topic of women in the army. But our Demon is primarily about what a real effective leader, commander and warrior should be. She is a young and very beautiful girl. However, this did not prevent her from breaking all possible stereotypes about women in the army and gaining authority among her peers. I personally admire her. And I am grateful for Chernihiv. And also, from my own observations. There is a tendency in our tank battalions that both very young guys and older soldiers serve. There are quite a few tank commanders who are not yet 25. They signed contracts at the age of 18-19. There are also those who are over 50, for example. But these are very experienced tankers. And they perform their tasks at a very high level. Despite such a difference in age, the crews have a perfect understanding. Of course, tankers sometimes joke that they have boys commanding grandfathers, but this is no more than a joke. Everyone does their work with maximum dedication. Our crews are a symbol that the youth are ready to fight and are fighting for their country. And that the older generation is just as actively working to win. It's inspiring. - Do you feel on the same level as the boys? What is the attitude towards a woman in the unit? - In our brigade, you are treated first of all as a specialist, as a military serviceman. Regardless of your gender. - Is journalism at the front different from journalism before you joined the army? Tell us about your creative experience. - The work of a communications officer and the work of a journalist are fundamentally different things, so I don't think it's worth comparing them. Although there is something in common. I will only note that my experience in journalism contributes to my work as a representative of the brigade's communications department. —How do you motivate to join the team? Tell us about your recruiting experience. — In different battalions of our brigade there are people from Chernihiv region who joined the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine after the beginning of the large-scale invasion. They fundamentally wanted to join the 1st separate Siver tank brigade, because it was she who liberated their cities from occupation. This motivation completely coincides with my own, by the way. But. Our brigade is called a tank brigade, but we have many different units. In fact, here, a person can choose his path in the army - he can be a tank driver, an artilleryman, a medic, a scout, an infantryman; can repair equipment, can work on means of radio-electronic warfare. There are many paths to victory, and we suggest you choose your own and follow it as part of the 1st Separate Siver Tank Brigade. As for recruiting, now a person can call us directly and consult about the service. Her skills and competencies will be taken into account, of course, her wishes will be taken into account. In addition, our Recruiting Group officers will advise on returning from the SDF and on the possibility of transfer from another place of service. Let me remind you of our contact: 0688824156. - Do the brigade and you personally maintain contact with the families of the victims? - Of course, our officers from the civil-military cooperation department are constantly in contact with the families of the victims. Also, the siblings of our Heroes are constantly in touch with their loved ones. — What do you dream of doing after the Victory? Will you continue to be in the army or will you return to civilian life? - My main desire is to return to Chernihiv and live there peacefully and happily. This is a wish I am absolutely sure of. As for what I will be doing, it is still too early to talk about it. Above all, Victory. And Victory will grant the right to choose further.

45 -boys in panties- on organs: the enemy invents -atrocities- in Kurshchyna	In particular, a member of the Russian State Duma Nikolai Ivanov accuses the Ukrainian military of creating -death camps in the homes of civilians-, burning villages and destroying social infrastructure. The propagandists draw special attention to the -fate of 45 children- (-boys in panties-) who were allegedly -taken to Ukraine for organ trading-, which is why -the price of donor organs fell in the West-. It is also claimed about the alleged -stealing of livestock and grain-. the Russian MP did not provide any independent verifiable evidence of his claims. Similar statements are often spread by Russian propaganda for manipulation without a factual basis. The statement about -reducing prices for donor organs- is absurd and reinforces the already existing propaganda message about Ukraine as the -center of black transplantology.- Despite the fact that, in fact, the system of organ transplantation has high standards of verification of their origin and international monitoring. Such -throw-ins- are aimed at diverting attention from Russia's actions, in particular its aggression against Ukraine and crimes within its framework committed by the Russian military. These statements are part of an information and psychological war aimed at discrediting Ukraine and creating a distorted reality for the Russian audience. In addition, in this way, the Russians dream of demoralizing the opponent. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/16/45-malchikov-v-trusikah-na-organy-vorog-vygaduye-zvirstva-na-kurshhyni/	2024-12-15T20:01:06-08:00
The memory of the fallen actor and military serviceman Volodymyr Kucherenko was commemorated in Kyiv	The actor, known by the nickname -Boris-, died on December 6, 2024 during a combat mission. His image in the play -Ch.S.-, which premiered in 2021, became a symbolic reflection of the strength and vulnerability of the male soul. At the commemorative evening, the actors of the theater read a monologue dedicated to Boris, based on real events. Director Olena Vahrameeva projected an excerpt from the play in which Volodymyr played back in 2020 onto the wall of the stage. -Yesterday, we experienced a loss, we felt that Vovchik was with us,- said Olena Vahrameeva. The event was attended by family, relatives, brothers and friends of Boris, as well as fans of the work of -TOTEATR-. Donations gathered during the evening were sent to purchase an FPV drone, which comrades from Volodymyr's unit will send to the front in his honor. The play, which premiered on May 17, 2021, explores the strength and vulnerability of a man in his various guises: father, warrior, son, lover. -TOTEATR- is an independent body-oriented theater founded in 2021. The theater uses the poetics of speech and the minimalism of expressiveness, creating a therapeutic effect for the audience and revealing stored emotions.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/15/u-kyyevi-vshanuvaly-pamyat-poleglogo-aktora-ta-vijskovosluzhbovczya-volodymyra-kucherenka/	2024-12-15T09:21:54-08:00

Storming Kurakhovo: the occupiers use DRG, disguising them as civilians	informs OSUV -Khortytsia- on its official Telegram channel -Khortytsky Wind-. Since the beginning of the day, there have been 10 combat clashes in the Kurakhovo region. Russian troops, having a numerical advantage in personnel and equipment, attack with the support of artillery and aviation. The enemy concentrated its efforts on the southeastern outskirts of Kurakhovo, trying to seize the road junction, the block of high-rise buildings in the southern part of the city, as well as important administrative and industrial facilities in the central part. The occupiers use sabotage and intelligence groups that act under the guise of civilians. In response, the Defense Forces of Ukraine conduct counter-sabotage measures to prevent such actions. The command takes all the necessary decisions to stabilize the situation in this direction. -We express great gratitude to our soldiers, sergeants and officers, who are heroically holding back the onslaught of the Russian occupiers,- the message reads. Separately, it is indicated that Russia continues to conduct a hybrid war, including the dissemination of distorted information about the situation in Kurakhovo for informational pressure and destabilization. As reported by ArmyInform, infantrymen of the 2nd battalion of the 12th -Azov- brigade captured five invaders during a combat mission on Toretsky direction.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/15/shturm-kurahovogo-okupanty-vykorystovuyut-drg-maskuyuchy-yih-pid-czyvilnyh/	2024-12-15T10:54:24-08:00

The desire to help the military through medicine became a key factor in her decision. The first trip to the ATO zone took place in 2016 to Mariupol. Then, for the first time, she encountered the realities of war, which significantly changed her outlook on life. Since September 2022, -Krokha- has been working on the front lines, performing its duties in the face of a full-scale invasion. Her story is an example of resilience, dedication and desire to help others despite all the hardships that war brings.

Currently, at the first stage, transfers within the National Guard are open for National Guard soldiers, but there is a task to add the possibility of transfers between units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the National Guard. More units of our border guards will be added to -Army+- in the near future. As of today, there are already 3,607 positive decisions regarding transfers for our soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The team from the Ministry of Internal Affairs actively worked together with the Ministry of Defense to achieve results for our National Guardsmen. -Thank you! A concrete positive for soldiers and an opportunity to give people greater motivation,- the President emphasized. We remind you, situation on the frontline remains difficult. Defense forces of Ukraine direct efforts to disruption of the offensive plans of the Russian aggressor and destroy its personnel and equipment.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/15/prezydent-u-armiya-teper-mozhlyvi-perevedennya-dlya-voyiniv-naczionalnoyi-gvardiyi-ukrayiny/	2024-12-15T10:10:07-08:00
The occupiers at the TOT of Donetsk region are opening centers for the promotion of the language	This is reported by a> Center of national resistance. So far, such propaganda centers have appeared in occupied Donetsk, Khartsyzk, Novoazovsk and Mangush, however, local collaborators were instructed to organize such centers in every library of the occupied region. These centers create the impression of -normalization- of life in the occupied regions, while at the same time trying to change the consciousness of local residents by imposing a -Russian- identity on them. As part of such activities, Russian language courses, propaganda lectures and -cultural- events are organized, which aim to force the local population to abandon their roots and adopt a foreign, imperial identity. Thus, the Russian authorities are trying not only to change the political landscape, but also to carry out cultural assimilation aimed at destroying the national identity of Ukrainians. This is especially true for the younger generation. We remind you, almost 2,000 multi-apartment buildings located in the Luhansk region's TOT have not been serviced by utility companies for years.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/15/okupanty-na-tot-donechchyny-vidkryvayut-czentry-populyaryzacziyi-yazyka/	2024-12-15T09:41:53-08:00

Gauleiter Pushylin turned off communication during a -direct line- with residents of TOT of Donetsk ...	This was reported by the Center of National Resistance. Only, unlike a bunker terrorist, they have no one to filter out uncomfortable questions. That is why, during the -direct line- of the Gauleiter Denys Pushylin, during the fractious -direct line- of the Gauleiter, the connection was suddenly cut off after a question about fraud with funds for the reconstruction of the housing of civilians in Donetsk region destroyed by Russia, a scheme to squeeze property through the -nationalization- of real estate and the settlement of occupied Ukrainian cities by representatives from the most remote regions of the Russian Federation . In general, the list of problems with which the civilian population has to live in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine is endless. And this is despite the fact that the Kremlin is making huge infusions into the Ukrainian land it destroyed. After all, this is not surprising because the local puppets of Moscow shamelessly steal them. We remind you, almost 2,000 multi-apartment buildings located in the Luhansk region's TOT have not been serviced by utility companies for years.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/15/gaulyajter-pushylin-vymknuv-zvyazok-pid-chas-pryamoyi-liniyi-iz-meshkanczyamy-tot-donechchyny/	2024-12-15T08:14:49-08:00
Almost 2,000 multi-apartment buildings, located on the Luhansk region's TOT, have not been serviced ...	This reports the head of Luhansk OVA Artem Lysogor. Residents did not pay the so-called -rental fee-, utility workers, in their turn, got rid of difficulties in servicing high-rise buildings in need of regular repairs. Urgent reregistration of an apartment under Russian legislation in the so-called -LNR- is not a panacea against the arbitrariness of the local occupation authorities. In particular, in Siverskodonetsk. In the case of a long-term absence of the owner in the city, the re-issued and registered housing is again, but unofficially, recognized as ownerless. Russian handymen, including builders, along with their families who decided to move from remote regions of the Russian Federation are settled there. The power structures of the Russian Federation leave complaints without consideration. We remind you that the enemy threatens to cancel registration of the place of residence in the absence of a passport of the Russian Federation.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/15/majzhe-2-tysyachi-bagatokvartyrnyh-budynkiv-roztashovanyh-na-tot-luganshhyny-rokamy-ne-obslugovuyutsya-komunalnykamy/	2024-12-15T07:53:33-08:00
The enemy threatens to cancel the registration of the place of residence in the absence of a passpor...	About this reports Center of National Resistance. The low pace of passporting is the main problem for the occupation administrations in the temporarily occupied territories. It is this process that destroys the myth of Russian propaganda regarding the support of the -liberators- population. Trying to destroy Ukrainians, both physically and legally, the Kremlin resorts to coercion, but this does not work either. Currently, the enemy threatens to cancel the registration of the place of residence in case of refusal of the passport of the Russian Federation, which is mandatory for living in a totalitarian state. We remind you that the Kremlin left Russians without an important medical preparation.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/15/vorog-pogrozhuye-skasuvaty-reyestracziyu-misczya-prozhyvannya-u-razi-vidsutnosti-pasporta-rf/	2024-12-15T07:31:45-08:00
A civilian resident was injured as a result of an enemy missile attack on Kharkiv	This is reported by the Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office. According to the investigation, on December 15, around 11:00 a.m., the armed forces of the Russian Federation launched a missile attack on Kharkiv. A hit to the ground was recorded on the territory of the sports complex in the Kyiv district of the city. A 48-year-old woman was injured and taken to the hospital. Previously, the Russian army hit Kharkiv with an Iskander-M ballistic missile. Prosecutors and police investigators are taking all possible and appropriate measures to document war crimes committed by the Russian military. We remind you, the enemy is throwing all his forces in order to dislodge our troops from the right bank of the Oskil River.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/15/vnaslidok-vorozhoyi-raketnoyi-ataky-po-harkovu-postrazhdala-myrna-meshkanka/	2024-12-15T07:13:31-08:00

the Kremlin left Russians without an important medical drug	This is reported by Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. It has not been available in pharmacies for a long time, and in hospitals you have to wait for weeks for procedures that require saline solution. Against the backdrop of rising production and logistics costs, lack of equipment due to Western sanctions, pharmaceutical companies are refusing to release this cheap product. They cannot afford to operate at a loss under these conditions. And this is just one example. At the same time, doctors in various regions of the Russian Federation complain of a critical shortage of important drugs, in particular of foreign production, and the assortment of pharmacies has decreased by at least 20% during the full-scale war against Ukraine. At the same time, propaganda assures that there should be no shortage, and the government, instead of solving the problem, is engaged in the search for extremes. Thus, the health of Russians was once again under threat due to the aggressive ambitions of the Kremlin dictator Vladimir Putin. We remind you, December 14 in Ulyanovsk, Russia, an explosion destroyed a railway track - the military logistics of the occupation army of the Russian Federation suffered another complication.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/15/kreml-zalyshyv-rosiyan-bez-vazhlyvogo-medpreparatu/	2024-12-15T06:23:25-08:00
It would be better to wear white slippers - the occupiers dressed en masse in camouflage robes	The video of the combat work was released on December 15 on the brigade's channel. -The occupiers began to disguise themselves in white clothes to blend in with the snow. But this does not save them. Either on the tracks or with the help of a thermal imaging camera, our pilots find and destroy every scum that crawled towards our positions,- the brigade commented on the video.

In the depths of the aggressor country, a railway line was blown up - GUR	This was announced on December 15 by the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. The explosion took place in the railway district of Ulyanovsk, on the line near the Sviaga River, a few kilometers from the local locomotive depot and the Ulyanovsk Motor Plant. It will be recalled that on December 13, a fire disabled three locomotives in the city of Krasnodar, and on December 11, two main locomotives of the aggressor state burned down in Bryansk. -The process of weakening logistics facilities that Russia uses to wage a genocidal war against Ukraine continues. There will be a fair retribution for every war crime!-, the GUR reminds. As reported by ArmyInform, in occupied Zaporozhye burned the whole echelon with fuel.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/15/v-glybyni-krayiny-agresora-pidirvaly-zaliznychne-polotno-%e2%80%95-gur/	2024-12-15T05:43:02-08:00
Russia seeks to save Rosneft	This is reported by the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. In December, the Russian state oil company -Rosneft- and the Indian private oil refiner -Reliance- concluded an energy agreement for the supply of oil for ten years with the possibility of extension. Deliveries are planned to begin in January 2025. According to the agreement, Russia will supply India with almost 500,000 barrels of crude oil per day. Prices will be reviewed annually. In fact, the new contract will determine prices for almost a third of Rosneft's exports and50% of its maritime exports. Most of the supplies will be Russian -urals-, which will be sold at a discount of $3. US per barrel to Dubai quotes. At the same time, the indicated agreement, which covers about 0.5% of global oil supply, was concluded without taking into account the fact that the EU is preparing the 15th package of sanctions against the Russian Federation, which raises questions about the realism of such a project. We remind you, UAE banks are massively refusing to serve Russian businesses.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/15/rf-pragne-vryatuvaty-rosneft/	2024-12-15T05:27:16-08:00
The occupiers conducted educational trainings for collaborators	This is reported by the Center of National resistance Up to 50 traitors were driven west. The platform of the Russian dictator -Senezh- became the organizers. The official purpose of the training is allegedly to develop leadership among the slaves. However, this is unofficially the coordination of collaborators' actions. Despite the fact that the Russians hide the list of participants, it is known to the Defense Forces. Each -leader- is a legitimate target and will be held accountable for their actions, and only time separates them from the moment of reckoning. We remind you that the Russians are trying to recruit bank debtors to the ranks of his army.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/15/okupanty-provely-navchalni-treningy-dlya-kolaborantiv/	2024-12-15T05:09:53-08:00

The North Koreans display their dead in rows - sensational footage from Kurshchyna	The video with Juche customs was released on December 15 on the channel of the 414th Battalion of Unmanned Aviation Systems -Birds of Magyar- as part of the marines. -Specifically, there are 22 yobliks (that's what the enemy's personnel are called)... Here the Koreans, mixed with swamp snakes, once again trampled together with the snow like cockroaches. The video is from an FPV drone, so the quality is not Bollywood,- commented battalion commander Major Robert Browdy on the video. According to him, this is a Sunday morning raid on the enemy, one of ten mass raids today. -After each wave, 4-5 Koreans arrive in buggies, -line up- the chopped carcasses into a ribbon, as in the video, and mask the faces of the dead,- explained Robert Browdy. The video shows how one of these Korean buggies starts to run away after the fragmentary arrival of our drone. According to Robert Broadwood, the assaults were repulsed thanks to the coordinated work of the soldiers of the 414th battalion, 47th mechanized, 95th assault, 36th marines, as well as the 1st and 17th tank brigades. -The carnage continues right now. Half a hundred worms here today only on a specific section of the strip, but the day is still ahead,- wrote Robert Browdy. As reported by ArmyInform, North Korean troops, which were sent to help the Russian army, suffered the first losses on Kurshchyna and out of fear -surrounded- the Kadyrov residents.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/15/pivnichnokorejczi-vykladayut-ryadamy-svoyih-zagyblyh-sensaczijni-kadry-z-kurshhyny/	2024-12-15T04:24:02-08:00
Banks of the UAE are massively refusing to serve Russian businesses	About this informs the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. This caused delays and refusals in Russia's cross-border payments. The change in UAE policy actually supports similar moves by the Chinese authorities. The reason for the complication of financial operations for Russian business in the UAE was the US sanctions against Russian banks. The threat of secondary sanctions forces the financial institutions of the People's Republic of China and the UAE to revise the schemes of interaction with Russia, complicating its foreign economic activities. In addition, banks in the UAE began to refuse en masse transactions related to the purchase of electronics, server equipment, IT services and industrial equipment. Additional pressure is created by Chinese financial institutions, which have also stepped up checks on payments coming from the UAE, India and the special administrative region of the PRC - Hong Kong. The purpose of such inspections is to identify possible connections with the Russian Federation. We remind you, previously, the enemy hit the Kyiv district of the city with a rocket. According to available information, one person was injured.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/15/banky-oae-masovo-vidmovlyayut-v-obslugovuvanni-rosijskomu-biznesu/	2024-12-15T04:11:18-08:00

The enemy continues to be in conditional kamikaze mode. They are trying to fulfill the task,- Yuriy Fedorenko said. As an example, he cited the Russian offensive towards the village of Kruglyakivka. -As for the wedge in the direction of Kruglyakivka, I would like to recall at what cost the enemy managed to advance: for this, about a hundred units of the enemy's equipment were used in a short time, of which the Defense Forces destroyed ninety,- - Yuriy Fedorenko recalled. But no matter how great the enemy, with proper organization and provision, the invaders can be repelled. -The enemy can be suspended and stopped and, in some cases, knocked out of the positions he has taken. This was proved by the 1st brigade of operational assignment and -Edelweiss-, which knocked the enemy out of their positions,- noted Yuriy Fedorenko. As reported by ArmyInform, in recent weeks the enemy /->significantly reduced the use of its aircraft for bombing our positions.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/15/atakuyut-v-rezhymi-kamikadze-rosiyany-tysnut-do-oskolu/	2024-12-15T03:48:36-08:00
the Russians are trying to recruit bank debtors into the ranks of their army	This is reported by Center of National Resistance. Therefore, the occupation administrations call bank debtors and their family members in order to recruit people and at least partially implement the mobilization plan in the temporarily occupied territories. the Russians even promise to forgive loans to those whose close relative signs the contract. the kremlin always uses the poverty created by its actions to recruit people for the empire's wars. However, currently the number of people willing to enter into a contract with the Russian army on TOT is critically low. We remind you, withdrawal of the Russian contingent from remote regions of Syria continues. Armed groups opposed to the Assad regime accompany the Russian military on some routes.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/15/rosiyany-namagayutsya-verbuvaty-bankivskyh-borzhnykiv-do-lav-svoyeyi-armiyi/	2024-12-15T03:29:31-08:00

This was told on the ArmyTV stream by the commander of the Achilles unmanned aerial systems battalion of the 92nd assault brigade Captain Yury Fedorenko named after Ivan Sirko, captain of the basket. -After Ukraine received permits to use long-range weapons, the intensity of the enemy's use of aviation dropped significantly. Because he understands that he can fly in, he is forced to hide his planes, move and maneuver. This is very important. Because the tactic of erasing our settlements to zero, as happened at one time with Vovchansk or Avdiyevka, now the enemy is not succeeding. And this is very inspiring,- said Yuriy Fedorenko. He expressed hope that similar results will be accepted by the US military and political leadership and will allow not only to receive more long-range weapons, but also to establish their production in Ukraine.

Facebook War: How to Counter a Hostile AI-Generated Fake Epidemic	Software algorithms are increasingly spreading them in recommendation feeds, and this -epidemic- is only gaining momentum. From AI-generated images, -Ukrainian soldiers- call for liking, commenting and sharing. Most of such publications, at first glance, have a rather patriotic appearance. Ukrainian flags, embroidery, posts with a call to action (react) or to the manifestation of emotions (sympathize). Among the comments, between -our little girl- and -may God protect you-, there are many comments that such publications are a tool of Russian information and psychological operations. So there are a lot of calls not to like and not to comment (!) on such posts. Especially those responsible -complain- about them to the Facebook administration, but such publications only increase. So, are we dealing with an informational influence on Ukrainians, what can such communication be aimed at - this is discussed in the research of the content of a number of Facebook pages (until December 4, 2024 - ed.). I did not have to search for the accounts of the authors of the researched publications for a long time. After viewing several similar posts, Facebook immediately offered 44 pages with similar images generated by artificial intelligence in the feed. In fact, there are many more of them. Perhaps with a slightly different information content, but all of them are designed for a certain target audience. Obviously, in this case, the algorithms focus on a middle-aged Ukrainian who is Orthodox by faith, has a family and a certain interest in military issues. After a quick analysis of the titles, images and information content of the pages, it was possible to divide them into four conventional groups: patriotic-entertaining, -real people-, Orthodox and nonsense. Page titles are another interesting phenomenon. They seem to be as simple as possible and -not for sale-. However, these communities have a significant audience. Even taking into account that the subscription is -winded up- and there are many bots and -inactive- profiles among the readers, there are quite a few very real people visible in the comments under the posts. So, the authors of these -patriotic and entertaining posts- still manage to reach the hearts and minds of Ukrainians. -Almighty Ukrain- has 223 thousand readers, -I love Ukraine- liked by 221 thousand and read 222 thousand FB profiles. -Congratulations-has a more modest audience with 49,000 likes and 66,000 readers. Music 1 Ukrainian, Ukrainian written in Russian, and actually Russian itself. A certain trend is also visible in posts with generated images such as -it's my birthday today, congratulations.- There are also publications on culture, music and cinema. As for the military, it is dominated by neutral AI images of soldiers standing, sitting, hugging, smiling or crying. Until November of this year, there were many images of soldiers with amputations, cemeteries with Ukrainian flags and women in uniform. Also, the authors are often nostalgic for the Soviet past and the old Russian variety show. For example, -Almighty Ukraine- distributes collages with Nina Matviyenko, and also distributes posts about the death of a Ukrainian composer in Belarus (to find out details, the author suggests following the link). Along with the post about Andrii Danylko (Verka Serdyuchka), there are posts about the Russian actress Alika Smekhova. There is also a patriotic post about our Ptashka (Kateryna Polishchuk). At the end of November and the beginning of December, publications on political topics began to appear on these pages, some of which were provocative in relation to the state leadership. In the names of the studied communities, the names and surnames (may also happen in the patronymic - ed.) of seemingly real people are used in some places. Hypothetically, anyone can be familiar with suchChernetska Victoria, followed by 11 thousand FB users,Oksana Kostenko, whose page has 20 thousand tags Likesand 24kreaders,orTetyana Bondar, whose audience is 9.3 thousand subscribers. True, there are actually not so many pages with people's names. In the list of 44 communities offered by Facebook, their unit. Interestingly, there were no -men- among them. Apparently, in social networks, male names inspire less trust and have few associations with emotional content. At the same time, the filling of such profiles is quite specific. These are mostly AI-generated images on the topic of the military, religion, relationships with grandparents and children. -Chernetska Victoria- has been active since October 20, 2022. Since then, 3-4 posts appear on this page every day with a noticeable bias on the topic of Orthodoxy. On December 8, 2022, the first post about the -Ukrainian soldier- appeared. Since then, many generated images of children, -soldiers of the Armed Forces- and prayers to God have been published on the page. Posts with military personnel depict the difficult conditions of service in winter — soldiers sleep in the snow or eat in the cold. There are also -artificial- photos of children with amputations, elderly people in -grandmother's house- with embroidered towels, ovens with bread, or images of a married couple at a wedding. For reasons that are not yet clear, posts with people in uniform on this page have noticeably decreased in November. Instead, there was an increase in embroidery, birthday cakes, children, prayers and generated photos of mushrooms in the forest. Oksana Kostenko is much less -religious-. Prefers content in the style of -5 brothers-, -5 babies-, -5 teenagers-, -5 girls- or -5 grannies- in his posts. There are, of course, posts where two or three people are depicted. All images are generated by AI, and the texts encourage users to say hello in the comments. The first illustration with -Ukrainian military- appeared on September 14, 2024. From time to time, -Oksana Kostenko- publishes photographs of cemeteries or generated images of people with amputations, which are intended to evoke pity. At the same time, the author asks to -congratulate- them on a certain occasion. On October 11, apocalyptic images appeared: military equipment, planes and houses - everything is engulfed in fire. Tetyana Bondar prefers simpler content. More photos of the military and military equipment, less prayers. The first publications appeared on March 25, 2023, and on September 5, 2024, the first post with a -Ukrainian warrior-. There are many more Orthodox-oriented pages than those described above, but their content is not particularly diverse. Group -God is with us- liked by 11 thousand users, another 79 thousand profiles --God Loves You-, in-Happy Birthday (Jesus Christ Our Lord)-'s audience is 60 thousand profiles and almost as many - 59 thousand have-JESUS ​​LOVES YOU -. The content is mostly similar: 9 out of 10 posts are prayers and messages from God. The rest of the posts feature happy people (women, children, farmers, a couple 50 years ago and now), flowers and weddings. Military figures are often found among such images, most of which are smiling and happy. Although there are also sad ones - with the consequences of injuries. There is also -apocalyptic- content - AI generated explosions, tanks and planes during the battle. -God is with us- began to actively publish -Ukrainian soldiers- from September 26, 2024. The -JESUS ​​LOVES YOU- community has streamed content with -Military Armed Forces- since November 21, 2024. The situation is similar with the content of the pages -God Loves You- and -Happy Birthday (Jesus Christ Our Lord)-. Probably the most mysterious and illogical group of pages under investigation has the general name -nonsense-. These profiles cannot be attributed to the three previous groups either by photo or by information content. Who is this Luis Canuto is unknown, but this page has 53 thousand readers. - Masano's Machine-has an audience of 17 thousand,Trisec - 22 thousand readers and 29,000 profiles on the pageRichard . Luis Canuto has been publishing -patriotic- posts with Ukrainian soldiers - boys and girls - since June 2, 2023. These are both individual portraits and group images of soldiers. There may be children, babies in your arms, or pets - cats and dogs. At first, real photos were used, but over time, AI-generated images began to dominate. Interestingly, during the -promotion- of the page, preference was given to pictures with girls in uniforms and captions in the style of -looking for a partner-. After November 9, 2024, the content changed, with fewer girls. Instead, there was more politics, and the posts concerned the commanders of the Azov unit, Petro Poroshenko, Volodymyr Zelenskyi, Vasyl Malyuk, and Dmytro Yarosh. There are also generated images of soldiers with amputations and posts with Orthodox prayers. The feature of this profile is publications with calls for peace with Russia. There is also video content with opposition political scientists, clips with various conspiracy theories, and negativity regarding mobilization events (against the TCC and the police). The main communication message: the Russians will never end, because there are more of them; the police and the TCC catch people illegally; Ukraine's economy is collapsing; the last thing is taken away from the people through unjust taxes. Trisec began its activity on June 1, 2023 with the publication of neutral landscapes of nature, and the first photo with -Ukrainian military- appeared on April 30, 2024. The content is mostly warm and family: father with children; soldier with grandfather; daughter and father in military uniform; grandmothers with a grandson in their arms; veterans with medals; wedding of a military couple; a soldier with a newborn baby; bread; embroidered shirts; harvesting; soldier's friendship. This list is supplemented by a small number of AI-generated images of soldiers with amputations, photos of cemeteries and -prayer-. Among others, this profile features a small number of Soviet-era photos of children's friendship in the USSR, images from Soviet cartoons, and cover pages of birth certificates. Recent posts include birthday wishes. Among the celebrants are a pilot, a soldier, and a 5-year-old girl. There are also posts with videos. These posts are downright negative. For example, the outrageous communication of citizens with the TCC and the police. On the Richard page, among the AI-generated images, there are also publications about real units of the Armed Forces. The content is mostly neutral - clips collected from the Internet about the activities of the Armed Forces and many videos of domestic topics with girls of Asian appearance. Which posts appeared on the investigated pages for the first time and what is their communication direction? -Congratulations on the birthday (Jesus Christ Our Lord)- was created on April 5, 2022, the capital letter P on a colored background was published . -I love Ukraine- was created on May 26, 2022, capital letter Я was published on a colored background. Richard was created as Gedine on 17 June 2022, renamed to Meghan Markle History on 9 December 2023. Rihcart renamed on 19 Aug 2024, first published on 17 June 2022, this is a capital letter V on a colored background. JESUS ​​LOVES YOU - 16 Aug 2022, first published as a neutral illustration. -Chernetska Victoria- became just that August 22, 2024, and before that it was called -God is with us-, page created on October 20, 2022, published capital letter G on a colored background. Luis Canuto created on January 14, 2023, published capital letter L on a colored background background. -God Loves You- was created February 3, 2023, capital letter B on a colored background was published. -Tetyana Bondar- was created on March 25, 2023, capital letter H was published on a colored background. -Almighty Ukraine- was created on April 1 2023, capital letter B on colored background published. Music1 created March 30, 2023, the first post was a neutral image. Vitannyachko was created on April 8, 2023, the first post was a neutral image. Risec created on June 1, 2023, a capital letter T was published on a colored tli. -God is with us- was created on July 13 2023, a capital letter B on a colored background was published. Oksana Kostenko was created on August 22, 2024, a capital letter O was published on a colored background. The texts of the publications of all investigated pages have one common feature. To summarize, it is an -artificial- language. Obviously, online translators were used for this, which immediately catches the eye. On almost all pages, the first posts were made in Russian, and already today Ukrainian language dominates with signs of machine translation. Russian words and sentences sometimes appear in the texts. In -Oksana Kostenko-, in addition to Ukrainian and Russian, there are posts in English. A notable feature is also the fact that photos and text of publications may be repeated on different pages in different periods. It looks like a certain circulation of content. In their posts, the authors of the publications often encourage users to join the conversation in the messenger chats. Each page may have its own chat, but these calls are very similar. As a rule, these are dramatic illustrations with battle mutilations, apocalyptic images, as well as active text injection, followed by an offer to learn more. For example: why the war will not end or how to save your life. To find out, you need to join the chat. Posts are obviously written in a foreign language, and not necessarily in Russian, and then translated into Ukrainian through online translators or AI-chat. Considering the number of followers on each page, the vast majority of posts are unpopular. An average post collects 100-200 reactions, but there are also posts without a single like per day. Therefore, it can be assumed that the active audience is extremely small. For example, Luis Canuto publishes several posts every day, most of which have between 0 and 100 likes and comments. However, the recent publication -True friendship of Ukrainian soldiers- with an artificially generated image received 6 thousand reactions. Another post with an AI picture -This Ukrainian military man finally got married- has 2.3 thousand reactions and 166 comments. Obviously, such publications are popularized artificially by paying for advertising on Facebook. Among the investigated pages, -Almighty Ukraine- stands out. Individual posts in this community have garnered more than 10,000 reactions and hundreds of appreciative comments for Ukrainian soldiers from profiles that look like the pages of real people. Facebook provides the ability to check information about the main countries/regions of residence of the people who manage the pages. What is the geography of the administrators of groups that so actively get into the recommendation tape of Ukrainians. -Almighty Ukraine-: Armenia - 2 administrators; -I love Ukraine-: Armenia - 4 administrators; -Welcome-: Austria - 10 administrators; Italy - 2; Spain - 4; Music 1: Indonesia - 10; -Chernetska Victoria-: Spain - 10; Italy - 2; Indonesia is 1; Netherlands - 1; -Tetiana Tetiana Bondar-: Spain - 5; Czech Republic - 2; -Oksana Kostenko-: France - 9; Germany - 4; Spain - 3; Greece - 1; Hungary - 1; Italy - 1; -God Loves You-: Spain— 11; Netherlands - 5; Portugal - 3; Serbia - 1; -Happy Birthday (Jesus Christ Our Lord)-: Spain — 13; Netherlands - 1; JESUS ​​LOVES YOU: Spain - 12; Germany - 1; Greece - 1; Italy - 1; Ukraine - 1; Luis Canuto: Indonesia - 3; Trisec: Indonesia - 14; Richard: (listed address London street, London, United Kingdom, +44 7167 856765), Indonesia - 5; -Masano Machine-: Indonesia - 4. Military expert Petro Chernyk reflects on what goals are pursued by the activities of such groups, what Such content is dangerous and as evidenced by the geography of the administrators of these pages. -Unfortunately, we still have a rather large number of Ukrainian citizens who look at this war on the principle of- brother -in -law -. The overall numerical potential of such citizens is within 7-8 percent, which is a fairly fertile field for a potential -masked- Russophile political project. Social networks and the ROC religious sect are platforms for the potential promotion of the political project in the interests of Russia. The analysis of the presidents of the administrators mentioned by Facebook indicates that these are the countries where it has (small) branch and influence of Russia today. It is not necessary to mislead that, in a number of European countries, the mentioned resource is prohibited. The enemy has long entered their networks not only at the official level, but also through the giant network of various humanitarian organizations, etc. -. Petro Chernyk confirmed the conclusions made by the results of the general analysis of these pages. In fact, these communities only seem patriotic, and their true goal is to climb into the heads of Ukrainians and focus their attention on the topics required by the enemy to destroy the unity of Ukrainian society. Obviously, despite the geographical diversity of administrators, these pages are interconnected and have a common purpose. Who or what can unite administrators with Indonesia, Armenia, Spain or Denmark? It seems that the geographical center, like the decision -making center, is located in Russia. In favor of this version, certain trends are evidenced in the history of the communities under study. For example, the time of creation and activation of activity during the active phase of the Russian war against Ukraine. It is also noticeable to the synchronicity of publications for a certain communication purpose, similar to the design of profiles and the identity of content - both text and images from video. Together, all these signs indicate that Russia in the Ukrainian segment of social networks conducts a broad information operation of low intensity with a single coordination and a common plan. For example, warriors with amputations, cemeteries, poor conditions are psychologically associated with the futility of the struggle. Religious content and prayers subconsciously adjust to humility - the task of a person to pray, and God - a more visible winner in the war. Which fits into the general concept of hybrid war against Ukraine, when, in addition to measures of active influence, hostilities, information is used against Ukrainians. In the short term, the purpose of such an operation may be: poor quality of publications - both text and photo - designed for the basic level of society, as well as for sympathizers on religious, political or other characteristics. It is an effort to marginalize certain layers of society. These are -ideological sabotages-, and on social networks they were moved from real life. Such a technique was used in the USSR, and described it by the KGB agent under the cover of Yuri Bezmanov, who at one time worked in Delhi. The point is that ordinary people who are sorry for the -wounded- or want to -congratulate the warrior's birthday- are used as -useful idiots-. The ultimate goal is to influence people's views and, in the end, change them to the right ones. And if there were decades to achieve the goals earlier, then in the social networking era you can do it much faster. The activities of the communities under study are primarily aimed at deepening despair and contradiction among Ukrainians. And here on the hand of the enemy is played by both those who put liked in such groups, and those who call for it not to do it, because in this way there is already a split between them. Old good tactics -Do not feed the troll-: - skip the following recommendations to make them less in the news feed; - to put and comment on the posts of only those people who know personally, or confident in the reality of their existence; - Before reacting to the publication, event, or comment, ask yourself: to whom and in what benefit will my emotion and action be? - It is necessary to find a common language with those who have already hit the hook of the Russian IPSO and to be tolerant of communication, trying to explain that they unconsciously help the enemy.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/15/vijna-u-facebook-yak-protydiyaty-vorozhij-fejkoepidemiyi-zgenerovanij-shtuchnym-intelektom/	2024-12-14T22:08:25-08:00
Making troops invisible: France promotes new camouflage -nanofabric-	How declared experts of the defense portal Army Recognition, developed by the enterpriseKastinger and commercialized by PGM Précision HT4® technology, often referred to as -heat with an invisibility cloak,- opens up new opportunities for the armed forces, ArmiyaInform notes. The material produced by HT4® technology was approved by the French Defense Innovation Agency and selected by the Directorate General of Armaments (DGA). This development, also known as Poncho Infrarouge pour Kits de Survie (PIKS) (Infrared Poncho for Survival Kits, in Ukrainian), provides omnidirectional and adaptive thermal protection, effectively concealing even intense heat sources up to 1000°C, such as helicopter turbine. This technology works by absorbing and reflecting NIR, SWIR, MWIR, LWIR and FIR infrared radiation. Designed to protect personnel and equipment, the HT4® counters a wide range of anti-thermal threats, from monocular thermal devices to sensors mounted on drones and fighter jets. HT4® stands out for its flexibility and adaptability. Whether used in extreme climates or diverse environments, this innovative material can regulate temperature to provide near-total thermal invisibility. Its ability to hide not only soldiers, but also to cover large equipment such as vehicles and aircraft, making them invisible to thermal cameras even after landing, is an important asset for extreme military operations. HT4®'s signature anti infrared fabric is made in camouflage (tarp/poncho, etc.). This makes it possible to use its daytime masking effect on the one hand, and its absorption of thermal radiation on the other, guaranteeing maximum efficiency. Because of this, the following camo colors are available: Brown/Green, Desert, City/Rock, Snow. Its products are resistant to extreme temperatures: thanks to its excellent temperature regime, this fabric keeps you warm in cold periods and cool in hot weather. Thus, it provides excellent thermal protection for personnel working in extreme environmental conditions. This fabric is light, breathable and durable. The properties of this material allow you to equip personnel without causing discomfort, it has excellent resistance to abrasion. Products made of HT4® fabric are compact, which facilitates their transportation. The HT4® fabric has been tested by the DGA (French Directorate General of Armaments), which concluded that it provides -a real gain in reducing the infrared signature of the elements being defended-. In coordination with the DGA-CF2S campaign, the French Air Force Command also authorized the use of camouflage in flight crew survival kits. Numerous tests of various military devices using such camouflage have been conducted using a wide range of air-to-ground and ground-to-surface sensors (JIM LR2, Pod Rafale, C3ISTAR, Sophie Ultima, FLIR, Reaper, etc. ). PGM Précision emphasized the value of working with the DGA in implementing this technology, acknowledging the agency's expertise and support throughout the HT4® development process. This official recognition highlights HT4®'s potential to transform military camouflage, allowing armed forces to conduct operations more stealthily, even in areas controlled by advanced detection systems. The success of the HT4® also reflects the growing interest in advanced thermal camouflage solutions in the defense industry. While some countries are focusing on developing new detection technologies, others, such as France with HT4®, are promoting innovations that challenge these surveillance systems. This technology is compatible with a new generation of thermal camouflage that meets the challenges posed by state-of-the-art detection sensors. The future of military camouflage appears to be moving towards active camouflage solutions, the use of adaptive materials, nanotechnology and biomimicry to make the armed forces invisible even to AI-controlled devices. HT4®'s impact is likely to extend beyond military applications; this innovation can also inspire development in fields such as wildlife conservation and urban planning, where concealment or visual integration can be crucial. HT4® marks a significant step in this continuous evolution. With its ability to provide effective thermal invisibility in extreme environments, this innovation may well redefine stealth on the modern battlefield, prompting military forces to adopt new cloaking strategies to stay ahead of the technological race. How other countries and industries will respond to this advancement remains to be seen, but it is clear that HT4® is a turning point in the history of camouflage technology. Presentation of material produced by HT4® technology.

The enemy is dispersing fakes about -Ukrainian traces- in Syria and Georgia	At first, information began to spread in pro-Russian telegram channels that the fighters of the -Georgian Legion- due to the protests that broke out in Tbilisi were -abandoning Ukraine- and returning home to join the rallies. The press service of the legion categorically denied these accusations, calling them baseless. Also, the other day, the news spread in the Russian information space that in Ukraine, according to an announcement on the Work.ua platform, they are allegedly looking for -tough guys to participate in the protests in Georgia.- At the same time, activists are promised payment of UAH 2,000 per day, accommodation and food, as well as free border crossing. The foreign passport of a Ukrainian, which was allegedly found in Tbilisi on Rustaveli Avenue, is cited as -evidence-. By reverse image search of the Gwara project fact checker found ads about this lost passport from December 29, 2020. In fact, they lost it in the city of Uzhhorod at the bus station. The -Activist- vacancy in question was, of course, never posted on the Work.ua platform. This screenshot is fake. The head of the Work.ua moderation department notes that such fakes are usually created by editing the page code in the browser. This approach is technically simple, but it misleads users by creating the illusion of publication on the site. Propagandists also continue to reproduce myths about the -Ukrainian footprint- in Syria, in particular statements about the cooperation of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine with groups such as -Hayat Tahrir al-Sham-, adding them to their speeches in international organizations. Rospropaganda creates such fakes to discredit Ukrainians and Ukrainian authorities in the eyes of the international community. They are baseless and not supported by any evidence. Their goal is to divert attention from the actions of Russia and its war crimes. The strategy of discrediting Ukraine is also aimed at legitimizing Russian aggression, portraying it as an alleged fight against global terrorism. But this strategy exposes the contradictions in Russian propaganda, which falls into its own traps and is quite often unable to explain its many fabrications.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/15/vorog-rozganyaye-fejky-pro-ukrayinskyj-slid-u-syriyi-ta-gruziyi/	2024-12-14T20:45:59-08:00
The voice of the information war: about the enemy's Achilles heel, love through strength and the fai...	Correspondent ArmiyaInform asked Professor Pocheptsov at what stage Ukraine is now in the context of conducting an information war with the Russian Federation; what are the enemy's strengths and weaknesses in this context; whether the voice of our state sounds loud enough during a duel with the enemy in virtual space, and not only that. —In your opinion, has the methodology of conducting information warfare by the Russians changed in 10 years, since 2014? How? — The approach has become more differentiated for different audiences. In 2014, everything was more unified. Russia is actively entering the mass consciousness around the world with the help of fake sites that are perceived as its own. Because of this, she has a louder -voice- than we do. Although it is hidden in other people's performances&#8230; In general, propaganda is closer to art than to science. This is a kind of political poetry, not just a newspaper article. We are oriented more towards the Soviet variant of propaganda, when everyone is silent and listens to one voice. This will no longer be the case: instead of a monologue, propaganda becomes a dialogue. That's how the audience should feel about her. —In your book -Modern Information Wars- you introduced the concept of semantic warfare. As of December 2024, according to your observations, who is leading in the semantic war: Ukraine or the Russian Federation? Argue. - Everyone is fighting for their own audience, for those who can become their favorite. Everyone wins in their own audience. We cannot win in the minds of the Russian audience because we cannot be heard. We should work more actively with Russians who emigrated, because their voices and faces are familiar to the Russian audience. The audience always wants to hear something of their own, close to their ideas. And this is exactly the kind of channel we need. —The Russo-Ukrainian war seems to be an example of virtual reality giving rise to physical war. What do you think are the ways to end this war? What is the role of quality communication in establishing a just peace? - Unfortunately, the peace will not be very just, because everyone has different goals. Russia generally says that they included our territories in their constitution. And this is absurd, because in this way they can introduce, for example, Belgium, and then say: -It is in our constitution, what can we do.- —Which cases of strategic communication on the part of Ukraine during the large-scale invasion would you call a successful example in the conduct of information and semantic warfare? And what has our state failed in terms of communication? And what can we fix? - Ukraine has done the most important thing - the world's leading media, as well as countries, are on our side. Russia wants to bring love closer to itself by force, and this is a failed strategy. As a result, Russia simply took the old place of the USSR as an eternal enemy. - And what are the strengths and weaknesses of the enemy in this sense? - They know us well, this allows us to place the necessary emphasis everywhere. And the downside is that they are less aware of how we have changed since the beginning of the war. The downside of Russia is the large number of opposition websites abroad, as well as the huge number of politicians, writers, and cultural figures who emigrated. These are all familiar names and faces&#8230; And they are against it. Not because of our propaganda, but because of Russia's actions. Today we are very far from them, but we should -sing- together. We must talk to them based on their arguments. This is a big space that Russia simply cannot censor . And it will grow louder as the war wears on. - At one time you stated that -war is a reality check of the state.- In the third year of the large-scale — has, in your opinion, our state passed this test? — the war passed the test, but the creation of propaganda both for its own audience and for foreign ones did not pass. We have a very weak -voice-. Propagandists during this time were to become the most recognizable figures to the audience. It is difficult to believe in an abstract state voice, people believe in concrete figures. - According to you, the three pain points targeted by communications during wartime are your own population, enemy population, and neutrals. In your opinion, is Ukraine -working through- all these three pain points? As? And what can be improved? - The West does the work for us, talking to its own population and neutrals. And we have not yet learned to talk in such a way that people drop everything and go to the TV to listen to a specific person. Levitan only read other people's texts, and felt like a propagandist, because during the war there is always a lack of information. - To quote you: -Information warfare is a flute tune, propaganda is a brass band that is heard even when one does not want to.- In your opinion, how audible is the flute from Ukraine now? How good is this sound? - Our -flute- is weak. She has a vague idea of ​​what to emphasize. Relatively speaking: what is needed is not just the truth, but an accurate truth that cannot be stopped&#8230; —What advice would you give to Ukrainian civilians to strengthen their emotional resilience at this time? Any advice for every day, -how to preserve clarity of thinking and freedom of action- in the time of flooding with disinformation and hostile IPSO? - We must educate our own agitators and propagandists, whose speeches the population would expect every night. The population wants to hear honest words that at the same time carry positivity. And specific faces that are trusted. - You say that -human history is built on the history of dreams- and that -man lives in dreams-, even though it is about visual space. How would you advise Ukrainians to visualize their dreams, being in a country in a state of war, so that later there would be no disappointments, no pain? - It will definitely hurt, because a compromise is not a victory. Or is a temporary victory. But there is no other option. If we are in a war, we must win.

The Minister of Defense of Ukraine discussed cyber security with American diplomats	This was announced by the Minister of Defense on the evening of December 14. According to Rustem Umyerov, the director of the US Department of Military Innovation Doug Beck and the US Ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Brink also joined the discussion. -The key focus of the meeting is cyber security, where Ukraine seeks to adopt the US experience in countering digital threats as much as possible. We have a successful example of cooperation with American experts from the Hunt Forward team, thanks to which we jointly identify vulnerabilities in our digital systems and strengthen protection. At the same time, our state is already demonstrating that it is capable not only of learning, but also of sharing its own advanced developments,- assured Rustem Umyerov. The minister and his team presented the digital solutions of the Ministry of Defense to the American delegation: -We agreed with Nathaniel Fick and Doug Beck on further deepening of cooperation between Ukraine and the USA in the field of cyber security. The priorities are to increase investment in our innovations, strengthen the digital infrastructure that is invulnerable to the attacks of the aggressor, and introduce the latest technologies, including artificial intelligence. I thank the partners from the USA for the comprehensive support of Ukraine and help in the development of cyber defense,- Rustem Umyerov noted.

Good weather to die - Russians prefer to die in the sunlight	About this on the ArmyTV stream the officer of the public relations service of the 37th marine brigade, junior lieutenant Denys, told Bobkov. -The last few days, when the weather was bad, the number of enemy runs decreased. It's raining, wheeled machinery can hardly be used, heavy machinery as well. But as soon as the swamp froze, the number of assaults immediately increased from 2-3 to 7-8,- said Denys Bobkov. According to him, Russian assault groups always go with EW devices in shoulder bags. Drones are also actively used. -Enemy assault groups don't move just like that, they are always accompanied by FPV drones and drones with resets,- said Denis Bobkov. When using armored vehicles, a Russian tank is always at the head of the column, followed by an infantry fighting vehicle, and then less armored vehicles, such as BRDM or armored personnel carriers. There can be from 3 to 7 cars in a convoy. -The infantry is well equipped, it's not mobs. They know what they are doing, they are trained. The enemy is prepared,- said Denys Bobkov. As reported by ArmyInform, over 40 units of Russian equipment and weapons were destroyed in 10 days of December by fighters of 37 separate brigade of marines and 505 separate battalion of marines.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/14/horosha-pogoda-shhob-pomerty-rosiyany-voliyut-gynuty-na-sonyachnomu-svitli/	2024-12-14T10:41:19-08:00

A column of Russian landing craft tried to reach our positions. But the enemy's equipment was still damaged. The landing party left the -boxes- and tried to hide in the forest strip, where the drones began hunting for him. In the same way, the immobilized equipment of the occupiers was also sought with drones. -According to the results of the battle, our brigade destroyed 6 BMD and 2 motor vehicles. 8 enemies were eliminated, another 13 were wounded. Glory to the marines!-, the 36th brigade commented on the video. As reported by ArmiyaInform, the fighters of the 36th Marine Brigade named after Rear Admiral Mykhailo Bilinskyi destroyed three Russian BMD units .	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/14/spalyly-6-bmd-i-dobyly-dronamy-desant-mykolayivski-morpihy-vidbyly-shturm-na-kurshhyni/	2024-12-14T10:22:17-08:00
Good news from Kurshchyna - the people of Kimcheniv shot the people of Kadyrov	This was reported by the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine on December 14. The aggressor state of Russia began to use North Korean soldiers in assault operations in the Kursk region, in particular, as part of combined units of the marines and airborne troops of the Soviet Union. The North Korean troops have already suffered the first sanitary and irreversible losses as a result of successful fire damage inflicted by soldiers of the Security and Defense Forces of Ukraine. In particular, at one of the positions in the Kursk region, military personnel of the North Korean army were effectively -covered- with FPV drones. Estimated losses of units staffed by Russian and North Korean personnel as of December 14, 2024 amount to about 200 servicemen. In the process of using North Korean troops on the battlefield, the language barrier remains a difficult obstacle for management and coordination of actions. Due to this problem, North Korean soldiers opened -friendly fire- on the vehicles of the so-called -Ahmat- battalion. The result was eight killed -Kadyrivs-. We will remind you that there are about 11,000 servicemen of the North Korean army on the territory of Russia. In the places where they are stationed, the aggressor introduced a special counter-intelligence regime - for admission to areas where North Korean units are located, Russian soldiers and officers are checked by FSB officers, phones and other devices are seized. As reported by ArmyInform, President Volodymyr Zelensky declared that there are already preliminary data on the use of a significant number of soldiers from North Korea by the Russians in the assaults.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/14/blagi-zvistky-z-kurshhyny-kymcheninivczi-perestrilyaly-kadyrovcziv/	2024-12-14T10:15:39-08:00
- Major renovation - occupants: four houses in a year and dreams of water	This was reported by Artem Lysogor, head of the Luhansk OVA. For comparison, much more work was done in the rear settlements, not covered by hostilities, which underlines the negligent attitude of the occupiers to the frontline territories. The situation is even worse in neighboring Pryville. There is not even an attempt to restore basic communications. Electricity and centralized water supply have been missing for more than two and a half years. Local residents are forced to buy technical water, which is delivered from time to time. The price is one ruble per liter, which is unaffordable for many. According to Lysohor, the actions of the occupation administration confirm their complete inability to provide even the minimum conditions for life in the occupied territories. As reported by ArmyInform, in 77% of the settlements of the so-called LNR, namely in 714 out of 920, it is impossible to purchase medicine. Local residents have to travel dozens of kilometers to get essential medical supplies.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/14/velykyj-remont-okupantiv-chotyry-budynky-za-rik-i-mriyi-pro-vodu/	2024-12-14T10:01:05-08:00
He went to the front as a schoolboy, his mother did not know - the story of the youngest soldier of ...	The post about the fighter appeared on December 14 on the brigade channel. Mother did not know that Nikita went to war, and father went missing at the front. -If I was making good money and paying a lot of taxes, maybe I wouldn't have made such a decision. But at the moment I have nothing to give to the state except myself. My mother and my younger sister went abroad at the beginning of the war. When I joined the army, I just didn't say anything to her so she wouldn't worry. She thought I was in Mykolaiv until my brother told me,- says Nikita. His father was a volunteer, fighting since 2014. -In the summer, when I passed the BZVP, he went missing in the Pokrovsky direction. I don't want to entertain myself with vain hope. Therefore, he resigned himself to the thought that he would not return. And I had a desire to kill enemies,- shared Nikita. He is now a Mavik pilot. -I like everything here. Sometimes something flies in, but so far it's more fun than scary. In such stressful situations, on the contrary, I gather, I become more cheerful and confident,- said Nikita. As reported by ArmyInform, the pilots of the battalion of unmanned systems of the 63rd mechanized brigade vdavaly-z-sebe-derevo-ale-cze-yim-ne-dopomoglo/->showed footage in which the occupiers are trying to throw machine guns at Ukrainian drones and pushed the FPV drone with their hands until it detonated.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/14/na-front-pishov-shkolyarem-mama-ne-znala-istoriya-najmolodshogo-voyina-63-brygady/	2024-12-14T09:42:33-08:00

They send tanks at the head of the column and BMP with the landing party behind. Small groups consist of 1-3 people trying to approach our positions,- the officer noted. He also noted that Russians are rarely captured, mostly as a result of an unsuccessful assault or disorientation in the area, when they cannot find a way out. -Enemy activity has been recorded in Terna, Yampolivka, Dibrova areas, where due to adverse weather conditions - strong wind and snow - we are forced to use drones less,- Jackson added. As reported by ArmyInform, a serviceman of the 68th separate hunting brigade named after Oleksa Dovbush, call sign -Trai-, shared the situation on Pokrovsky direction, where fierce battles with the enemy continue.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/14/zagubleni-i-znajdeni-v-zsu-poyasnyly-chomu-rosiyany-zdayutsya-v-polon/	2024-12-14T09:21:32-08:00

A young Ukrainian Air Force pilot did not return from a combat mission	This was reported by the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on the evening of December 14. -Air Force tactical aviation pilots work at the limit of their capabilities, using all available foreign-made weapons. Pilots strike in conditions of active enemy countermeasures, in order to carry out the task efficiently, they constantly have to enter the area of ​​​​the enemy's anti-aircraft defense, withstand high overloads during dangerous missions,- the Air Force said in a statement. There, they reminded that the war continues, called to support the army and honor those who gave the most for the future of our children. -Our Freedom and Independence is given to us at a high price. We need enough means and weapons and more determination from our partners to achieve a just peace in Ukraine! We will certainly take revenge for every Ukrainian whose heart stopped beating because of Russia's senseless war of aggression...-, the Air Force assured. -For all our new tactical techniques, new countermeasures from the occupier will certainly appear! Like us, the enemy quickly learns and develops, modernizes weapons, both air attack means and anti-aircraft weaponry tactics,- Colonel Yuriy Ignat, head of the public relations service of the Air Force Command of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, wrote on his page. Despite the bitter loss, he urged not to give up and not to resort to -betrayal-, but to see the matter through to the end in memory of our brave pilots, infantrymen, and sailors.

The Russians threw the North Koreans into attacks in Kurshchyna — the President	The President stated this in his address on December 14. -The Russians include them in combined units and use them in operations in the districts of the Kursk region. So far only there. But we have information that it can be used in other areas of the front as well. Losses among this category are already noticeable,- Volodymyr Zelenskyi said. He stated that, in fact, Moscow involved another state in this war, and involved it as much as possible. -And if this is not an escalation, then what is the escalation that many have been talking about? It is Putin who is taking steps that expand and continue this war. It is he who repels the possibility of peace. And he wants the world to have more problems in Asia as well. This is why the Russians are training North Korea in modern warfare,- Volodymyr Zelenskyi said. In his opinion, Moscow ignores the calls of all countries, from China and Brazil to many others, regarding the need to do everything for de-escalation. -If there is no strong reaction from the world, Russia is making the war worse. Always so. We will defend ourselves, including against these North Koreans. We will continue to act in coordination with all our partners to stop this war — to stop it reliably, with guaranteed peace,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. He said that next week he will speak in Europe about joint work. -Sanctions against Russia, support for our defense, investments in Europe's common defense and strong diplomacy for the sake of peace - these are things that should be increased every week, so that next year, together with our partners, we will be able to achieve our main goal,- the President noted.

-The Danish model- becomes a key mechanism for accelerating the supply of rear assets of the Armed F...	About this during the video conference said director of the Department of Procurement Policy of the Ministry of Defense Hleb Kanevsky during the meeting of the Supervisory Board of the NATO Agency for Support and Supply (NSPA). -This mechanism has proven its effectiveness and has become an example of an innovative approach to procurement under martial law. The -Danish model- provides for direct financing of Ukrainian defense enterprises by the governments of other countries, which makes it possible to strengthen defense capabilities and support the economy at the same time. Thanks to this approach, the production of critically important weapons, in particular the self-propelled -Bohdan- artillery installations, has already been financed. We strive to scale this experience to new projects with partner countries to bring our victory even closer,- Hleb Kanevsky emphasized.

4.8 thousand chemical attacks since the beginning of the war: the Armed Forces documented Russia's m...	This was declared by the representative of the Department of Radiation, Chemical and Biological Protection of the Command. Support forces of the Armed Forces, during a briefing in Kyiv. Russia actively uses K-51 and RG-VO gas grenades, which are designed to suppress mass riots but are prohibited for use against the military under international law.

Before the battle - only after the psychostrip: how to additionally prepare for the front line in -o...	Correspondents of ArmiyaInform saw with their own eyes how the instructors of the 115th separate mechanized brigade of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine set up and pass a psychological test to assess its complexity before starting training with newly arrived fighters. The psycho lane is designed to prepare servicemen for actions in units on the front line. First of all, it is intended for those who come to the brigade from training centers after basic general military training. It enables newly arrived fighters to psychologically and physically enter the conditions of combat operations. -Psychosmuga adapts fighters to entering the area of ​​hostilities so that they do not experience shock, there is no difference in adaptation, so that they are ready for what happens directly on the battlefield,- explains Chief Sergeant Serhiy Korolev with the call sign -Funtik-. . Every fighter in the brigade has to pass the psycho lane. After BZVP in training centers, they have about a week to adapt, after which they go on combat missions. Then, with individual elements of the psycho lane, fighters also work during internal rotation within the brigade. — Here there are elements of tactics, elements of power loads, basic elements of combat operations. Next is directly the simulation of combat operations with the execution of shooting exercises. All this makes it possible to adapt the fighters to combat, so that newly arrived fighters do not feel the shock of entering combat directly, the instructor says about the psycho zone. Psychological adaptation is necessary first of all for newly arrived fighters, because those who come to the rotation have already been on the front lines. Therefore, they work primarily on improving tactics, taking into account the change in the situation on the front lines. - During the rotation, those who go out not only rest and put their weapons and clothes in order. They also go to the tactical field to practice some tactical elements of movement and combat work, taking into account the current situation on the front line, emphasizes the master sergeant. In order to accept the newly installed psycho lane and now demonstrate how its passage along its entire length, which is about half a kilometer, takes place, the instructors use the entire training arsenal for newcomers - explosions, smoke, overcoming absolutely all available obstacles, practicing assault actions in the trenches and shooting at three guns borders The start of the psycho lane is a steep rocky slope that the runner must overcome with the constant danger of landslides and rocks. To maintain balance, not to lose breath, not to lose speed - all this is not easy even for companions without weapons and BC. Fighters have to do it in full gear - and this is just the beginning. In the next stage, the soldiers are met with loud explosions, thick smoke and difficult obstacles to overcome. To overcome them, one should be physically hardy and psychologically prepared, able to control one's body and emotions, always be ready for unexpected changes and to perform difficult tasks in conditions of smoke, increased noise, and breathing problems. In the first few sections of the psycho lane, the fighters pass the so-called -crossroads- - automobile ramps laid out in two adjacent lanes. You should go through them with the maximum possible speed, jumping from one tire to another. To an outside observer, the task may seem quite simple and even somewhat amusing, but in reality it is quite tiring and at the same time important. Thanks to it, the fighter learns to subconsciously and automatically control the position of his body, to feel in advance where and how the leg will land, and how to compensate for the tilt with the movement of the whole body. - This allows a person to concentrate as much as possible on the conditions of movement, in the conditions of an uneven surface - stones, pits, whirlpools from explosions. When you need to move to your positions or go on the offensive, the ground will not be flat, it constantly has some potholes, some slopes, - explains the meaning of the -Funtik- exercise. Then the complexity of obstacles and tasks only increases. Barbed wire, a wobbly bridge over a stream, a forest clearing, a maze, overcoming a wall - all this is quickly overcome in thick smoke and amid explosions that ring out from both sides of the psycho lane. We barely have time to follow the instructors and manage to get a good shot of the training amid the smoke. Climbing the steep slope, we can only imagine how difficult it is for two fighters to lift an almost 30-kilogram box with ammunition. And in combat conditions, notes the senior sergeant, a situation may arise when BC will have to be delivered alone, so working in pairs is an even easier option. - This is the main element of the load, after which the fighter will experience discomfort and shock in breathing. Therefore, you should learn to breathe properly and move properly in such a way as to avoid injury, explains the chief sergeant and adds that simply climbing the BC up the slope is still far from the most difficult of the possible options. Finally, after passing through a maze, jumping over a wall, another rubble and logs on rivchakami, the fighters go to storm the trenches and dugouts. After a difficult race and overcoming obstacles, this difficult task becomes even more difficult, this is the only way to get as close as possible to real combat conditions. - This is already an element of the combat situation - enemy positions, trenches, dugouts. It already includes working out the tactics of assault actions - how to enter positions, how fighters cut corners when passing enemy trenches, how to enter dark dugouts. In a combat situation, all turns, all elements behind which the enemy can hide, are controlled, the instructor comments. It is this element of the psycho lane that is important for practice not only for beginners, but also for those who have already managed to get used to explosions, smoke and a space cluttered with rubble and debris while in combat positions. At the end of overcoming the psycho lane, we enter the firing lines. There are three of them, and on each of them we can see how exhausting the previous exercises were and how much they affected the shooting accuracy of the fighters. The first firing line is designed to practice moving around the battlefield using cover and shooting from awkward positions. In this exercise, there is also an element of tactics of moving in pairs in difficult terrain among the ruins and rubble of buildings. The next firing range is the trenches, from which the fighters practice firing at aerial targets. These can be -maviks- or FPV drones, bomber drones with drops or kamikaze drones. - The final score is shooting from three positions: standing, kneeling and prone. This happens after great physical and psychological stress, after a shock state of the body. It shows the real accuracy of a fighter's shooting in difficult combat conditions, Serhii Korolev explains. Shooting accuracy, he emphasizes, is the key to survival on the battlefield. If a soldier is aimed at an enemy, it destroys him and secures himself. On the other hand, in the case of low accuracy, the enemy's chances of hitting a Ukrainian fighter increase significantly. — When a serviceman sees that after loads he has a deterioration in shooting accuracy compared to performing the same exercises in a calm state, he understands that he needs to work to have a high level of survival in combat conditions. That is, there is both an element of preparation and an element of motivation here, emphasizes the chief sergeant. The accuracy of the instructors, despite the previous loads, is high, and they are generally satisfied with the psycho lane - for a soldier after passing the BZVP, it will be difficult, but surmountable. Passing such a psycho lane, the fighter will be able to feel himself in conditions as close as possible to combat and not only check, but also significantly improve his level of training.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/14/do-boyu-tilky-pislya-psyhosmugy-yak-dodatkovo-gotuyut-do-peredovoyi-v-suhoputczi-reportazh/	2024-12-13T21:19:30-08:00
Videos and deepfakes with alleged Ukrainian military appear on the network: why is this the enemy	-Military- first allegedly walked along the side of the highway for almost 500 kilometers in the direction of Lviv (which is physically almost impossible without rest, food and sleep), then for four hours he tried to stop his companion, but no one stopped him, until he -picked up - this civilian male driver. Actually, this video is a production. The dialogue between the civilian male driver and the alleged military man is filmed by a person sitting in the back seat of the car, to whom the -military man- for some reason does not pay any attention, even when the video is filmed from a very close angle. In turn, the driver reacts suspiciously calmly to the words of the -military man- about the alleged lack of money, at least for the bus; two years of captivity; about the fact that the -military- community during this time had already managed to -bury- him, erecting a monument to him, etc. In addition, the -military man- says that he has been fighting since 2013, although the Russian-Ukrainian war began only in 2014. In another video, which the enemy is spreading on social networks, a Ukrainian military man allegedly complains about arbitrariness employees of the TCC, the difficult situation at the front, the unprofessionalism of commanders, losses among personnel and calls on Ukrainian men not to go to war. However, in reality this the video was created with the help of artificial intelligence, report in the VoxCheck project. The original source of the video is an anonymous profile on Tiktok, where the author publishes videos with allegedly Ukrainian military personnel and prisoners of war. A check by the Hive Moderation AI tool revealed that the profile contained videos that were generated using a neural network. Accordingly, the tool showed that the appeal of a serviceman talking about the difficult situation at the front was also created with the help of AI. The purpose of such videos is to increase the gap between the military and civilians, as well as to misinform the Ukrainian society about the real situation on the front and disrupt mobilization. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/14/u-merezhi-zyavlyayutsya-video-ta-dipfejky-z-nibyto-ukrayinskymy-vijskovymy-nashho-cze-vorogu/	2024-12-13T20:42:28-08:00
