Graceful red foxes, timid pheasants and powerful wild boars got into the lens - the real masters of the forest. -Despite the natural beauty, encounters with some animals can be a serious test for a person. Aggressive behavior of wild boars or the risk of contracting dangerous diseases from foxes are not the only threats. In view of this, we urge you to avoid walking in the border areas to reduce the risk of dangerous encounters with wild animals,- the DPSU urged. ArmyInform reminds that it is better not to break the law or not to risk your life, but to use the aggregator of vacancies in the Armed Forces and recruiting centers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/01/tvaryny-zamist-tvaryuk-na-kordoni-u-videopastky-dlya-uhylyantiv-potrapyly-predstavnyky-pryrody/	2024-12-01T05:13:03-08:00
Ministry of Defense: in November, the Russian army suffered the largest losses since the beginning o...	About this notified the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. This number of casualties corresponds to the number of conditionally more than three motorized rifle divisions of the ground troops of the Russian Army. According to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, in November, during one day, our soldiers -two hundred- and -three hundred- killed 2,030 enemy soldiers. This is also the highest daily enemy loss rate since February 24, 2022. Also, during November, our soldiers hit 307 enemy tanks. This is the highest figure this fall (291 enemy tanks were destroyed or knocked out in September, 279 in October). There are 31 vehicles in the tank battalion of the Russian Federation, so in the last month of autumn 2024, the Kremlin army lost almost 10 tank battalions destroyed and knocked out. The estimated cost of this amount of equipment is equivalent to 450 million US dollars. As a result of the active combat work of the soldiers of the Defense Forces in November 2024, 899 enemy armored combat vehicles were damaged. Conventionally, this is the number of BBMs of almost four motorized rifle divisions. Such a number of armored combat vehicles cost the budget of the aggressor country approximately at least half a billion US dollars. Last month, Ukrainian soldiers also hit 884 units of enemy artillery. One artillery division of the occupying army has 18 self-propelled artillery installations. In this way, our soldiers deprived 49 artillery divisions of the opportunity to conduct combat operations the previous month. The cost of such a number of artillery installations is about 700 million dollars. If we talk about the total losses of the enemy in weapons and equipment in November 2024, then their estimated cost reaches more than 3 billion US dollars. In September and October, this number was lower. Therefore, the Kremlin continues to spend wildly on the continuation of the war.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/01/minoborony-u-lystopadi-rosijska-armiya-zaznala-najbilshyh-vtrat-vid-pochatku-shyrokomasshtabnogo-vtorgnennya/	2024-12-01T04:52:08-08:00
Assaults only under EW — in Kurshchyna, the enemy is making life difficult for our drones	About on the ArmyTV stream platoon sergeant of the 36th marine brigade named after Rear Admiral Mykhailo Bilinsky with the call sign -Solomon-. -The adversary uses powerful EW means where hostilities are taking place. Unfortunately, they are head and shoulders above us in this regard. Assaults include these devices that suppress the frequencies of both FPV drones and Mavics. That's why it's very hard to work, you have to invent your own know-how in order to bypass the REB,- said Solomon. According to him, to avoid REB, you can use optics, which, unfortunately, are not yet represented in the Armed Forces. -Or install two antennas on Maviks, work from different points to bypass the suppression zone and conduct reconnaissance and impression of the enemy,- Solomon noted. As reported by ArmiyaInform, the soldiers of the 36th Marine Brigade named after Rear Admiral Mykhailo Bilinsky, together with the soldiers of the 73rd Battalion of the Territorial Defense Forces repelled the assault of superior numbers Russian elite units in the Kursk region.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/01/shturmy-lyshe-pid-rebom-na-kurshhyni-vorog-uskladnyuye-zhyttya-nashym-dronaryam/	2024-12-01T04:42:11-08:00

In the Pokrovsky direction, one of our brigades can oppose four Russian ones at once	This was told on the Army TV stream by the spokeswoman of the brigade, junior lieutenant Olena Solonina. -We are facing four motorized rifle personnel brigades of the Russian army, in particular the 74th motorized rifle brigade from the Kemerovo region,- said Olena Solonyna. According to her, among the personnel of the enemy there are also mobilized and recruited under a contract, but all are destroyed. An important role in this is played by drones from the battalion of unmanned attack aircraft systems, which find and destroy groups of Russian attack aircraft with drops. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the 38th Marine Brigade recorded the strange behavior of a Russian who froze in the middle of the field like a scarecrow, or only to deceive our aerial scouts.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/01/na-pokrovskomu-napryamku-odna-nasha-brygada-mozhe-protystoyaty-odrazu-chotyrom-rosijskym/	2024-12-01T03:59:18-08:00
The Defense Forces spoke about the difference between Russian marines and paratroopers in Kurshchyna	About this on the air of the telethon on December 1 told marines We can say that they live richly. They quite a lot use meat assaults, columns of armored vehicles, now the 155th has pulled back, is resting, then we are working with the Russian Airborne Forces. These guys are 100% poorer, because the assaults began on &#8220;rivers,&#8221;, ATVs, and motorcycles. Is this a tactic? It's hard for me to say. It seems more that this is the poverty and weakness of these units,- said -Enei-. When asked by the presenter about the level of training of the Russian marines, the soldier replied: -Standard. I will not say that these are elite troops. For the fact that they fire at our brothers, the enemy will be punished: both by God and by the sword of the Ukrainian marines.- href=-https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/29/vse-chudovo-myasni-shturmy-i-kolony-tehniky-nas-vlashtovuyut-na-kurshhyni-morpihy-peremololy-ochyen-gniluyu-brygadu /->commented that the basis of the tactics of the occupiers in Kurshchyna remains unchanged — attacks from with a large amount of equipment, tanks, BRDM and BMP.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/01/u-sylah-oborony-rozpovily-pro-riznyczyu-mizh-rosijskymy-morpihamy-ta-desantnykamy-na-kurshhyni/	2024-12-01T03:12:07-08:00
His name is Marik - he used to repair iPhones, and now he has already destroyed more than a hundred ...	The story about the fighter was published on December 1 on the battalion channel. -It was difficult to sit at home and do nothing - I went to the military commissariat,- recalls Marik, who was engaged in repairing telephones in 2023, and before that he was a turner. He worked in the infantry for half a year, and when the FPV unit was created in the company, he transferred there. But not in vain: on Marik's account there are 20 units of damaged enemy equipment worth more than 10 million dollars and more than a hundred occupants. You can see an example of his work here: As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the Black Swan strike group of 225 assault battalion made a photo report from a drone over one of the roads of the Kursk region.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/01/jogo-zvut-marik-remontuvav-ajfony-a-teper-znyshhyv-vzhe-ponad-sotnyu-okupantiv/	2024-12-01T02:49:02-08:00

The commander told about this on the air of the telethon -Only News- of the artillery reconnaissance division of the separate artillery brigade of Hero of Ukraine Vitaly Lytvyn. He explained that there is a railway in the vicinity of the settlement, the enemy wants to advance along it to the settlement of Pokrovsk. The enemy grabs some linear object (a building in a settlement or a railway) and tries to advance along it. -Just so you understand, there are situations where 30 enemy personnel were discovered, they launched an artillery strike, killing about 20 enemies at once, and 10 were wounded. And after 30-40 minutes, a group of 20-30 Russian servicemen arrived again, who simply stepped over the bodies and went on to storm the Defense and Security Forces of Ukraine. But then they were also destroyed,- Vitaly Lytvyn said. According to him, sometimes the Russians use small tactical groups, and sometimes assaults take place with the participation of, for example, 30 Russian soldiers. -And we are not counting the equipment, artillery and aviation - and they use them all the time. That is, aviation in this direction strikes not only on the front edge, but also drops guided aerial bombs on logistical routes, on the Pokrovske settlement itself, using anti-aircraft missiles... Defense is very difficult,- the serviceman emphasized. He also emphasized that the difficult weather conditions also do not contribute to the conduct of defensive operations by our Security and Defense Forces of Ukraine, in particular, to the work of aerial reconnaissance. -Cloud cover is often low, making the use of UAVs difficult.- As ArmyInform wrote, the occupying Russian army increases the number of assaults by small groups near Toretsk on Daughters	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/01/znyshhyly-20-rosiyan-za-piv-godyny-pryjshla-nova-grupa-okupantiv-na-pokrovskomu-napryamku-vorog-atakuye-bez-upynu/	2024-12-01T01:58:38-08:00

Special operation T-80: our soldiers took an enemy tank from under the nose of the Russians	Video shown December 1 in the 60th separate mechanized Ingulets brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. -This story was waiting for its time to be told. It all started with the fact that our aerial reconnaissance discovered an enemy T-80 tank that had been knocked down, but was in quite decent condition. He was standing in a place where he could be taken away. After that, there are hours of intense planning,- says the video description. Servicemen from the 60th OMBR tank battalion told more about this operation. -My motivation for stealing the tank was as follows: the gypsies stole it, but we, who are worse than the gypsies, can't do it?- And they were able to, they stole it,- says a military man with the call sign -Khmel-.

The Ministry of Defense presented the concept of reform of military medical commissions	This was reported in MoU. The presentation took place during the thematic meeting of the Council of Donors of Institutional Reforms of the MoU, which was attended by Deputy Minister of Defense Brigadier General of Justice Serhiy Melnyk, Deputy Minister of Defense Kateryna Chernogorenko and Deputy Minister of Health Edem Adamanov. -The principles of the VLK have not changed for decades. The system that exists now is a vestige of the old administrative approach. It is full of shortcomings, unnecessary bureaucratic complications, and corruption risks. We must significantly reduce these risks. Therefore, I am grateful for the support of the reform to all partners and public organizations that were involved in the launch of this project,- emphasized Serhii Melnyk. The participants of the meeting noted that the modern system of military medical commissions has two-sided shortcomings. On the one hand, it allows individuals to avoid military service without legal grounds, and on the other hand, it does not prevent people with serious illnesses from entering the service, which creates additional difficulties for the Armed Forces. The reform will make it possible to divide the decision of the military medical commission into two separate sets of data — medical and administrative. Some specialists will conduct a medical examination for VLC, and others will analyze the anonymized results of these medical examinations. To pass the military medical commission, it will no longer be necessary to go to the TCC. Conscripts will be able to independently choose the hospital where they will undergo a medical examination. Data from there will enter the Electronic Health Care System (ECHS). Over time, data from the ESOZ will enter the medical information system of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which will be modernized under this reform: in particular, the technical possibility to receive data from the ESOZ and the electronic office of the VLK will be created. The military medical commission will receive data about the person, get acquainted with them, and make its administrative decision. Anonymized data will be sent to a random commission whose members will not know whose documents they are reviewing. This will prevent manipulation and abuse. -As of today, in the context of the VLK, we have old bureaucratic norms that work slowly and do not inspire confidence among citizens. This reform is needed so that conscripts can trust the system. To undergo a medical examination in civilian institutions. To feel that their rights are protected and that after a medical examination they are not immediately declared fit if they actually have some diseases. Our proposal is to create a transparent and clear path that will create the basis for trusting relations and ensure that fair conclusions are drawn,- said Kateryna Chernogorenko. After each decision, a digital trail will be visible - electronic signatures of both the doctor and the VLK employee. The conclusions of the commissions will be kept. All this will simplify the verification and monitoring of the activities of the VLK by law enforcement agencies. The reform will be implemented in three stages and should be completed in November 2025. The Council of Institutional Reform Donors of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine is a platform for coordination and communication between the Ministry of Defense and donors regarding the development and implementation of defense sector reforms. Thematic meetings of the Council of Donors of the Ministry of Education and Culture are held with the aim of attracting donors to the implementation of projects in the directions of the strategic priorities of the Ministry of Education and Culture. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/01/minoborony-prezentuvalo-konczepcziyu-reformy-vijskovo-likarskyh-komisij/	2024-11-30T22:41:51-08:00

Blood from the ears after shelling, a broken mortar and trophies of the Kharkiv operation. -Why here...	How a knee-deep trench can save lives and why 2-3 minutes at the front sometimes make a big difference? Vladislav told our correspondents about this: -On February 26, 2022, I came to Obukhiv TCC. He told his wife that I was called, but in fact, of course, he rushed there himself. Eventually got to the 30th separate mechanized brigade. I was immediately appointed mortar commander. There were 10 days of training. There is nothing super complicated like that. The 82-millimeter mortar was fully mastered. By the way, it so coincided that in the calculation, everyone, like me, was born in 1975. The only thing is that I had ATO experience - I served in the -Donbas- battalion, and the boys did not. And then they went to Donetsk to perform combat missions. Our position was called -Depot-, it was immediately behind Toretsk. We were there for more than 4 months. They usually worked as a counter-battery. It's funny, of course, but everything fell on our 82nd mortar: the enemy was working on us with both 120- and 152-caliber mortars. But, I remember, we once hit the enemy's 120th mortar quite well. We detected it and worked on it: we damaged the mortar itself, and the BC warehouse that was near it was also blown up. And, of course, they always worked on the infantry, they didn't let it take hold. Then they left again for recovery. And then there was Kharkiv Region, where we were standing near Izyum. Then their 20th army started towards us. Their paratroopers were attacking us. Well, they were loaded&#8230; Also, the Russians were working there even then with T-90 tanks, and they are really strong - they could withstand even 7 hits from RPG, LNG&#8230; Yes, he had a turret wedged after that, but at least he could move away. By the way, there our colleagues on the 120th T-90 mortar hit and knocked down his goose. It was like this. But on August 14, the Russians already stepped on us in a serious way. Everything flew at us: both -tornadoes- and -hail-. In the morning, the command -To the battle- arrived, because the enemy had gone to break through. We then covered one of our mouths. And at one point&#8230; The exits of enemy artillery can be heard, and when the cassette is opened, there is such a click. I just managed to shout -Lie down- to the boys! We had a small trench even then, knee-deep: this is what saved us. In general, everything went well, but contusions were received, of course. My ears were bleeding, but I didn't pay attention to it at the time. Not before that. We were lucky that then two tanks of our reserves had time to remove from the echelon. And they gave the enemy T-90 a serious fight&#8230; We had one tank driver there, call sign -Kipish-. So he burned the T-90 on his T-64, which started working for us. And when an enemy tank is working on you, you just lie in the trench and read the Our Father. The -Kipisha- tank never hit the enemy, although it spent a lot of shells on him. -Kipish- is a young man. Pity him, he died later near Soledar&#8230; By the way, it is true that the Russians left a lot of equipment in Kharkiv region. It got to the point that our brigades there even started sorting through the trophies: -I don't want the 72, phew, I only want the T-80.- First, the brand new ones that still smelled of paint won trophies. Then it was restored again and we already had the Bakhmut direction: Klishchiivka, Andriivka, Kurdyumivka, Zaliznyanske. I remember how we left Zaliznyanskyi&#8230; One of our drivers arrives and says: -Run, we're leaving here quickly-! And we were no longer even on the road, but on the field from there. And you look back, at the place where we stood, and everything that is begins to fly there. Literally about 2-3 minutes everything was solved then&#8230; Eventually, injuries and other ailments left me with limited fitness. Now I work in the TCC. Yes, it happens that civilians make some kind of claims: why are you here and not there. But, honestly, there is no desire to explain to people what I went through and what I experienced at the front. Why do I have to prove anything to anyone? I also have a wife, children. But the guys who are still at the front should be replaced. They are really exhausted.

Will burn a tank with a meter of armor: the Brazilian defense company is developing an anti-tank mis...	Authors of the online military publication Army Recognition inform that as this platform develops, it will change the perception of anti-tank and high-precision strike capabilities of the Brazilian ground forces, becoming the most important element of the future combat operations of the Brazilian army, ArmyInform notes. In addition to the development of the latest MSS (Míssil Superficie-Superfície) anti-tank missile complex (ATGM), the Sistemas Integrados de Alto Teor Tecnológico (SIATT) company is also working on a new anti-tank guided missile (ATGM) with the -shoot-forget- technology. Such technology allows operators to immediately change position after launching a missile, which drastically minimizes damage to the military by enemy counterfire. The new complex is expected to penetrate more than 1000 mm of rolled homogeneous armor (RHA ). At the same time, effectively neutralizing a wide range of modern main battle tanks (MBTs) and armored vehicles, including those with dynamic protection. Thanks to this level of armor penetration, the MSS ATGM is in the same class as some of the most powerful anti-tank missile systems in the world. In addition to high penetration capacity, the future MSS ATGM model will have a range of more than four kilometers. This is very important for fighting in open or rugged terrain, where the ability to engage in long-range combat is essential for tactical advantage. The portable version of the product consists of a launcher with a tripod and sights weighing about 30 kg, a container with ammunition weighing less than 25 kg. The missile design includes a laser guidance system. In addition to the development of a new ATGM, the company is working on the creation of an anti-tank missile with laser guidance and an increased range. This variant of the ATGM is designed to increase the accuracy and range of the Brazilian army's anti-tank weapons, providing effective combat against targets at significant distances. The laser guidance system allows the missile to be precisely aimed at both static and moving targets, giving operators more control over the missile's flight path and reducing the chance that it will deviate from the target or be intercepted. -The MSS anti-tank missile complex platform marks an important milestone in Brazil's efforts to develop its own highly effective defense solutions, reducing dependence on foreign technologies,- the Army Recognition publication emphasized. In addition, the MSS complex is being developed in such a way that it can be used as an individual means of defeating armored vehicles, and can be installed on various platforms and vehicles. The MSS system is also planned to include a firing simulator with a very accurate representation of the real environment, so it will be possible to train anti-tank troops without the need to use real missiles, as well as test equipment to measure and align the direction of fire. -These capabilities increase the export potential of the system, as countries seeking to strengthen their anti-tank defense are likely to pay attention to the improved characteristics of the MSS anti-tank missile complex and its flexibility in integration with various platforms,- ​​the authors of the publication note.

Mirroring the facts in action: the Russian Federation accuses Ukraine of its own war crimes	Specialists of the Center for Strategic Communications and Information Security emphasize that, in fact, Ukraine strictly adheres to International Humanitarian Law, while Russia systematically attacks civilian infrastructure. Since the beginning of the large-scale invasion, Russia has destroyed 227 medical facilities and damaged 1,714. Also, 3,798 educational facilities have been seriously damaged, of which 365 have been completely destroyed. Particularly egregious examples are the airstrike on the maternity hospital and children's hospital in Mariupol on March 9, 2022, the rocket attack on the Okhmatdyt Children's Hospital in Kyiv on July 8, 2024, when 627 children were in the hospital. Russia uses attacks on civilian infrastructure as a tool to intimidate the population, which is a violation of the laws of war. Russia is trying to create the impression that its actions in Ukraine are -defense- or -response- to Ukraine's actions, despite real evidence to the contrary. Statements about attacks on civilian objects are designed to show Ukraine as a violator of international law in order to undermine its support from the world community. Disinformation is used to bolster domestic propaganda, motivate Russian citizens, and justify the continuation of the war. The distortion of facts is aimed at causing doubts among Ukraine's allies about the provision of further military and humanitarian aid.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/12/01/viddzerkalennya-faktiv-u-diyi-rf-zvynuvachuye-ukrayinu-u-vlasnyh-voyennyh-zlochynah/	2024-11-30T20:08:39-08:00

According to his information, there is also a readiness of the Scandinavians and the Baltic states to increase investments in our defense industry, in particular in the production of our domestic drones. The President reminded that Norway has decided on financial support for Ukraine for the next year of more than three billion. There is also Luxembourg's decision on funds for the purchase of weapons for our Defense Forces of Ukraine. -We also appreciate Britain's decision regarding sanctions against the Russian shadow tanker fleet. It is what keeps the whole world on course for justice. For Russia to feel its responsibility for this war, for its consequences, and for Russia to be forced into peace. The world is capable of ensuring this,- the President said. He also said that he listened to the report of the Commander-in-Chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, General Oleksandr Syrskyi, on the situation at the front and in the areas of the Kursk operation. -I want to thank our brigades that defend the positions that destroy the occupier. And today I want to especially recognize the 38th Marine Corps Brigade, the 68th Hunting Brigade and the 14th National Guard Operational Task Force brigade for this week's battles. Thank you, warriors! Thank you for your bravery in the Pokrovsky direction,- Volodymyr Zelenskyi said. He informed that the team is preparing for quite active work in December: work with partners: negotiations, meetings. -There are solutions that can be implemented precisely in these weeks and months for the sake of our common security — for the sake of Ukraine and everyone who really wants this war to end as soon as possible and, very importantly, justly,- the President noted.

According to the President, long-range weapons are very important for our country. And it was needed even earlier.

Without NATO, Ukraine will not have real independence - the President	President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyi told about this in an interview with Skynews. According to him, for this Ukraine needs to join NATO. In particular, first of all, the part of the territory controlled by Ukraine should be covered with the NATO umbrella as soon as possible. And then deal with the return of the occupied territories by diplomatic means. Without NATO, Ukraine will face serious dangers. -Putin does not want peace. For him, our independence is equal to losing this war. Without NATO, there will be no real independence in Ukraine. He will be back. In the next 10 years,- Volodymyr Zelenskyi believes. The President also added that Ukraine should receive an invitation to NATO within internationally recognized borders. After all, the acceptance of only part of the territory will indicate the recognition of the occupied territories as Russian. Ukraine cannot do this. Volodymyr Zelensky also does not see an alternative to joining NATO. -We don't have nuclear weapons. We gave it to the fact that the most influential leaders of the countries guaranteed the security of Ukraine. But it didn't work and we lost a lot. Maybe there is some alternative besides NATO. But I can't see her. I've heard about security guarantees. And I talked about it with many leaders of countries. Such agreements should include humanitarian, economic aid, weapons, etc. But this is not NATO. And that doesn't equate to security guarantees. We had the Budapest Memorandum. But this did not stop Putin,- said Volodymyr Zelenskyi. The President also calls the principle that no decision should be made without Ukraine as an important point in any agreements. As reported by ArmyInform, the Presidents of Ukraine and France discussed acceleration of Mirage aircraft transfer process.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/30/bez-nato-v-ukrayiny-ne-bude-realnoyi-nezalezhnosti-prezydent/	2024-11-30T04:47:28-08:00

November's top targets: Defense forces named their -fattest- targets for the month	About this reported on November 30 by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. So, at the beginning of the month, Ukrainian drone operators hit the launcher of the Buk-M2 air defense system on a tracked chassis. During combat operation, this air defense system can hit targets both as part of an anti-aircraft missile system when aiming from a command post, and autonomously, in a predetermined sector. A little later, on November 16, 19 and 29, our soldiers hit three more Russian Buk air defense systems of various modifications. The Ukrainian defenders also hunted down the Tor -. It is a land-based -twin- of the Russian sea-based -Kinzhal- air defense system. It is designed to solve the tasks of anti-aircraft and anti-missile defense at the level of a divisional link. In November, one of our ground units added to the list of hit enemy targets at once with two heavy flame-throwing systems of TOS salvo fire -1A -Sunflower-. Also last month, our soldiers struck Russian electronic warfare complex -Borisoglebsk-2-. The main task of the complex is to detect and suppress various communication channels and other systems that use radio signals. First of all, these are tactical link communication and control systems, in particular satellite. The last decade of November was particularly productive in terms of destroying enemy weapons and equipment. In particular, during the repulse of an enemy assault in the Donetsk direction, units of the Defense Forces hit 7 Russian BMD-4s with a crew and a landing party within one day. BMD-4 is the latest version of the Russian Army's amphibious assault vehicles. Units of the Armed Forces also launched a missile attack on the deployment site of the expensive Russian S-400 -Triumph- anti-aircraft missile system. As a result, the radar station was damaged. Let us emphasize that the functionality of the radar station depends on the combat work of other components of the air defense system. At the end of November, in the temporarily occupied Crimea, our scouts destroyed two (!) Russian radar Podlyot complexes. This is a mobile radar, which is used by the enemy to detect air targets at low and extremely low altitudes in a complex obstacle environment. In particular, this radar is involved in the targeting system for S-300 and S-400 anti-aircraft missile systems. in November there is a Russian radar -Zoopark- - a mobile means of counter-battery combat. The main purpose of the complex is the reconnaissance of the enemy's firepower and the adjustment of fire. And another expensive target of our soldiers was the Russian mobile low-altitude radar station -Kasta 2E2-. Its purpose is airspace control, determination of coordinates and recognition of air targets, including at extremely low altitudes. It transmits coordinates and movement parameters of air targets to air defense systems. However, it can also be used as an air traffic control radar. As reported by ArmyInform, on November 28, as a result of a successful operation of the GUR of the MoU in the territory of temporarily occupied Crimea Russian radar complex -podlyot- destroyed.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/30/top-czili-lystopada-syly-oborony-nazvaly-svoyi-najzhyrnishi-urazhennya-za-misyacz/	2024-11-30T03:51:47-08:00
Panic in the jungle -lnr-: inflation, repression against business and -meat assaults- mobilized	This was reported by Artem Lysohor, the head of the Luhansk Regional Military Administration. According to him, more than a year ago, the invaders forced the business to reduce the prices of food and goods, limiting the markup to 5%. This was explained by the holding of the so-called -first elections- and preparations for the re-election of Putin. Now the situation has worsened: due to the rise in prices, entrepreneurs have been accused of cartel conspiracy and issued warnings. The pressure on businesses continues, creating additional challenges for local residents. In addition, the invaders treat the forcibly mobilized residents of Luhansk region with disdain. Those mobilized are often the first to be sent on dangerous -meat assaults-. In the 13th tank regiment of the Russian army, the command forced soldiers from the -LNR- to give 50% of their pay. Those who refused were punished by being sent to the basement in Zaytsevo, known for its brutal conditions of detention. These facts testify to the deterioration of the situation in the occupied territory, both for the local population and for those who were mobilized to the ranks of the Russian army. As reported by ArmyInform, at the TOT of Luhansk Oblast, the occupiers are terrorizing the population: even a Russian passport does not help.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/30/panika-v-dzhunglyah-lnr-inflyacziya-represiyi-proty-biznesu-ta-myasni-shturmy-mobilizovanyh/	2024-11-30T03:28:26-08:00

But studies at the NUOU were not stopped: the educational process continued, graduations took place, and, of course, the emphasis was placed on disciplines that involved the direct repulsion of aggression.

The only question was which institution, depending on the number of scientific and pedagogical workers and teachers, could afford a certain number of groups. Let's add that NUOU is the leader in terms of the number of students,- the interlocutor emphasizes. If we compare the year 2024 with 2022 in the context of learning foreign languages, Nataliya Vasyukova draws attention to not just listener interest, but -motivated interest.- -Because people, in accordance with their positions, which require knowledge of the language or in accordance with the range of tasks performed, understand the complete dependence in certain official situations on the level of English proficiency. And there is also the realization that taking the next step in one's professional development and career growth without knowing the language will be difficult, and sometimes completely impossible,- Nataliya Vasyukova summed up. As ArmyInform wrote, from 2024 in military universities three new specialization. Previously ArmyInform informed that at military universities this year the most popular specialties among women were and specializations that train commanders of mechanized units, units of Airborne Assault Forces and Special Operations Forces.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/30/odyn-zi-stolychnyh-vijskovyh-instytutiv-stav-liderom-z-vyvchennya-inozemnyh-mov-sered-zahysnykiv/	2024-11-29T21:33:44-08:00
The General Staff of the Armed Forces named three areas where the enemy concentrated its main effort...	This is reported by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. In addition, the occupiers are actively attacking in the Lyman and Kupyan directions. The terrorist state launched a missile strike with one missile, 31 airstrikes, dropping 53 anti-aircraft missiles. In addition, the invaders used 581 kamikaze drones for strikes and fired more than 3,000 shots at the positions of our troops and populated areas. On the Kharkiv direction, Russian terrorists stormed the positions of our units five times in the Kudiivka, Vovchansk, and Tikhoi districts. Two skirmishes are ongoing. Seven times the enemy attacked our positions in the Kupyan direction. In the vicinity of Kolisnikivka, Lozova, Pershotravnevoy and Zeleny Gayu, units of the Defense Forces repelled all enemy attacks. In the Lyman direction, Russian troops attacked Ukrainian defenders 20 times in the districts of Grekivka, Novoyehorivka, Terniv, Yampolivka, Dibrova, Torsky, Zarichny, Hryhorivka and in the Serebryansky forest. Our soldiers repelled 18 enemy attacks, two battles are ongoing. In the Kramatorsk direction Ukrainian soldiers repelled three attempts by the invaders to capture our positions in the area of ​​Chasovoy Yar and in the direction of Bila Hora. In the Toretsk direction, the occupiers twice tried to advance in the Druzhba and Toretsk districts, but were repulsed. In the Pokrovsky direction, the aggressor attacked our positions 34 times in the areas of Myrolyubivka, Promin, Lysivka, Dachenske, Chumatske, Novy Trud and Zhovte settlements.

As reported by ArmyInform, on the Kramatorsk direction, the enemy will continue to concentrate its main efforts around the town of Chasiv Yar, but the Defense Forces are holding their positions.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/30/u-genshtabi-zsu-nazvaly-try-napryamky-de-vorog-zoseredyv-osnovni-zusyllya/	2024-11-29T21:18:22-08:00
Army English: about motivated new -blood-, conversation clubs with an attache... and not only	About all this and not only the correspondent of ArmiyaInform asked in an interview the head of the educational and scientific center of foreign languages ​​of the National Defense University of Ukraine (hereinafter - NUOU), candidate of philological sciences, Colonel Nataliya Vasyukova. —How many military personnel did the specialists of your university manage to train since the beginning of the large-scale invasion? And during 2024? - We will not talk about statistics. However, a large-scale invasion became an obvious challenge, because we had to train soldiers who spoke English because of the importance of working with partners, learning western technology, etc. With the beginning of a large-scale invasion, language training was somewhat suspended, as it was necessary to figure out how to deal with the current situation, where to go next. But studies at the NUOU were not stopped: the educational process continued, graduations took place, and, of course, the emphasis was placed on disciplines that involved the direct repulsion of aggression. But in the same year, two foreign language courses were held. One was completed in early February 2022, the second started in October 2022. But it is not only about NUOU, because foreign language courses are available in all higher military educational institutions and military educational units of higher education institutions. And this testifies to the fact that since the beginning of large-scale aggression, these processes have not simply stopped, they have even become more emphasized, thus emphasizing the importance of learning foreign languages. The only question was which institution, depending on the number of scientific and pedagogical workers and teachers, could afford a certain number of groups. Let's add that NUOU is the leader in terms of the number of students. If we compare the year 2024 with 2022, it is worth paying attention to not just the interest of listeners, but motivated interest, because people, in accordance with their positions, which require knowledge of the language or in accordance with the range of tasks performed, understand complete dependence in certain official situations from the level of English proficiency. There is also the realization that taking the next step in your professional development and career growth without knowing the language will be difficult, and sometimes impossible. - Is the training of the military to learn a foreign language now about quantity or quality? - This is a provocative question, because the process of studying, mastering, gaining a new level in a certain direction, including a foreign language, is always a transition to a qualitatively new level. Therefore, it cannot be said that it is only about quantity. Let's talk about quality quantity in this context(smiles - ed.). - How do partners get involved in this training? - We knock on everyone. I can comment on the period of my two years in office. The initiative should always come from the interested party. And in this context, it is about creating a partnership network, first of all, within the Defense Forces. Yes, we try to communicate with all departments involved in foreign language education. We exchange materials, share experience, look for ways to improve educational and methodological support, etc. That is, it is an internal affiliate network. But we also knock on all the doors of our partners. In particular, within the framework of the strategy of internationalization in military educational institutions, the idea of ​​creating a patronage system is laid: when a certain educational institution of partner countries or NATO members takes a kind of patronage over a certain military educational institution. The implementation of this would help to create a partnership network between various educational institutions, which would work not only in the direction of studying general English (General English), but also - what is extremely important today - specialized narrow-profile terminology (English for Specific Purposes). In addition, last year we started the practice of conversation clubs for students of foreign language courses with the participation of defense attachés of the Kyiv Association of Military Attachés. Classes were held 2-3 times a month in the form of interviews, discussions with students according to their level of training. The goal was to consolidate the learned vocabulary and grammatical constructions in speech practice, as well as simply the opportunity to practice speaking, practicing typical communicative situations as close as possible to real ones with the participation of a native speaker (even if it is not his native language). During such classes, students learn to overcome the psychological barrier to start speaking a foreign language, because just as it is sometimes difficult to dare to take the first step, it is also difficult to say the first word, the first phrase in English (-will they understand me-, -will I not errors-). This year, this practice of conversation clubs has spread to other higher military educational institutions that conduct foreign language courses. - Are some subjects taught in a foreign language at the NUOU? - In the center of foreign languages, we definitely teach only in English. In addition, there is also English in research for future Ph.D. But both at the university and at other higher military educational institutions, in accordance with the governing documents and today's conditions, there is a requirement to teach 20% of subjects in a foreign language. Therefore, it is necessary to improve foreign language knowledge not only of listeners, but also of scientific and pedagogical staff. To do this, we cooperate both within the internal network and with foreign partners to create a course in the direction of English as a medium for teaching other disciplines (English-Medium Instruction or English as a Medium for Instruction). In this way, we maintain, acquire or expand the capacity to study and teach in English within the university. —What do you think is the current -room average temperature- for foreign language proficiency among the Armed Forces servicemen? —Thanks to the language testing sessions, I can see the statistics and can make a cut: in fact, so far the overall temperature is— disappointing, as it is cool outside the window now. But this new -blood- that appeared in the army with the beginning of the Russian Federation's large-scale aggression against Ukraine indicates a certain tendency to increase the temperature, I will use the same metaphor - as if the heating was turned on and it's getting warmer. Those who understood that it is very difficult to achieve anything in civilian life without a foreign language, it is difficult to find a well-paid job, it is more difficult to develop professionally - they made their choice in the civilian dimension. And now they are -inspiring- their fellow soldiers with their experience. Well, it is worth emphasizing that there are many servicemen who do not wait for an order or command to learn a language, do not look for people to blame for their ignorance, but look for opportunities and time, take the initiative and start learning on their own, strive to develop, listen to recommendations - because it is the main driving force and key to success in mastering languages ​​are internal motivations and desires. I can say with great pleasure that there are more and more of them. - Do you have enough time to learn foreign languages ​​in the third year of a large-scale war? - No! Unfortunately, we confirm the effectiveness of the proverb -until the thunder strikes...-. Yes, we have started to -baptize-, but the result will take time. If you try to meet all the current needs, I jokingly say that both I and my colleagues need to be cloned! (laughs - ed.) Language is not something you can do in one or two evenings, gain some understanding and more or less master it. Language is something that is trained over time: you train your brain, you train yourself, and it is through self-discipline that you learn. But it takes time. According to our guidelines, there are 500 hours of teacher-led study from level zero to level one, which is pretty intense, and that's the pace at which four-month foreign language courses are taught. And no less important in language learning is the fact that after reaching a certain level, it is necessary to constantly maintain it, so as not to lose it, to keep what has been acquired. After all, if you do not do this, the skills will disappear, not immediately and not completely, but will become passive. Currently, there are many ways to maintain language skills - smartphone apps, news adapted to language levels, even short 15-minute lessons - but systematic - would be very appropriate. For example, we recommend Elena Chekryzhova's -Army English- project to everyone, and we broadcast her lessons to the public on the territory of our center: even passing by, you can hear something new, learn a new term. - Do you cooperate with public organizations, non-governmental institutions to improve and deepen the study of foreign languages ​​by military personnel? - Yes, and the contribution of NGOs and volunteers should not be underestimated, because the civil sector is those who, on a voluntary basis, realizing the need for the military to be included in these processes; provide translation support where necessary; continue to work and help us both abroad and in Ukraine. From November 2024, on the basis of the Memorandum of Cooperation between the Mariupol State University and the National Defense University of Ukraine, permanent and temporary staff of the university will be granted free access to educational courses on the study of the English language on the English4Ukraine electronic platform. This is another example of effective civil-military interaction. - What are your plans for improving the English course(s) for 2025? - When I am asked about the state of affairs, I usually answer -at least not worse- (smiles - ed.). As for plans, it is even more difficult, but you can use the same phrase: indeed, in 2025, we do not want to reduce our current indicators, but to increase them, of course, only under the conditions of an increase in interrelated human capital (research and teaching staff, educational facilities), so that a year later during the interview, without taking your eyes off, talk about quality quantity. We want to open more opportunities for people who want to learn a foreign language. — What interesting, funny, curious incident can you remember related to the stay of our military in an English-speaking environment? During studies abroad, during communication with partners, etc. - All these curious cases are almost always related to not quite perfect command of the language. I don't want to call these cases funny, because it demotivates those who study, strengthens the psychological barrier to language use that I mentioned earlier. And I always insisted: speak, don't be shy. After all, the foreigner with whom you speak English speaks Ukrainian worse than you speak English. One should be demanding of oneself, but the level of self-criticism should not hinder practice. And don't be afraid to laugh, and maybe laugh at yourself sometimes. Sometimes the lack of vocabulary is compensated by the ability to draw well what you cannot say, or curious cases arise not only due to imperfect knowledge of a foreign language, but also due to ignorance of cultural features, so it is always worth conducting small linguistic and cultural reviews of the countries whose language is studied. From the latest that I remember: guys are calling me and telling me: -I tell her: ``Give me keys'' - English). I meant -keys-. And the foreign interlocutor did not hear -keys- but -give me kiss- (English). Then everyone laughed&#8230; &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/30/armijska-anglijska-pro-motyvovanu-novu-krov-rozmovni-kluby-z-atashe-i-ne-lyshe/	2024-11-29T21:03:30-08:00
-Scorpion- is ready to attack again: Turkish defenders are bringing a new version of the armored rec...	In the official release of the manufacturing company emphasized that this versatile vehicle is distinguished by advanced weapons systems and extreme mobility, which makes it necessary for a variety of military missions, ArmiyaInform reports. The new version of BBM Akrep (-Scorpion- in Ukrainian) has added to the line of armored vehicles of Otokar Otomotiv ve Savunma Sanayi A.Ş., a subsidiary of the Turkish financial and industrial group Koç Holding, which specializes in the production of buses and military equipment and whose defense vehicles ArmiyaInform repeatedlyrelate Akrep II to the BBM of the universal segment. The armored two-axle vehicle stands out for its advanced weapons systems and extreme mobility, making it useful for a variety of military missions. Unrivaled maneuverability is achieved thanks to the all-wheel drive system and the additional rear steered axle. These capabilities allow the vehicle to effortlessly navigate difficult terrains, including deep mud, snowpack or water obstacles, as well as successfully overcome natural barriers in combat conditions. If necessary, the driver of the armored car can activate the crab mode, which provides the ability to move in a diagonal direction. In this mode, the rear wheels (see video below) turn in the same direction as the front wheels. If you turn the front and rear wheels in opposite directions, the turning radius is almost halved: the rear wheels steer the car in one direction, while the front wheels steer in the other. The ability to adapt to difficult circumstances makes the Akrep II an excellent option for armies that need a reconnaissance vehicle capable of operating in extreme conditions. The John Cockerilla tower has already received high praise and is recognized as a formidable combat platform. It is designed to integrate a variety of weapon systems, including a medium-caliber automatic gun up to 90 mm. This gun has high firepower and accuracy. The turret stabilization system proved to be an effective ally for conducting accurate fire. It provides the ability to perform aimed shots even while moving, and also allows you to hit targets in different directions at short and long distances. The Cockerill LCTS 90MP turret is distinguished by its high stability and safety due to minimal recoil, which makes it the optimal choice for light shooting systems. This gun works with high-explosive shells and has effective anti-armor capabilities, which allows it to successfully perform a variety of combat missions, including reconnaissance operations. The turret system has become widespread in different countries, in particular, there are more than 300 units in the arsenal. Akrep II is designed to operate with three crew members (driver, commander and gunner) and has a total mass of 15,500 kg. With a length of 5.9m, a width of 2.5m and a body height of 1.97m, as well as a ground clearance of 400mm, this car has a compact profile that contributes to its excellent performance on the ground. The Akrep II 4X4 light armored vehicle is offered in a variety of powertrain options, including diesel, hybrid and electric. These configurations are designed to meet specific operational requirements by reducing thermal and acoustic emissions, which are particularly important for operations requiring cloaking and reconnaissance. The diesel version of the car is equipped with a 360-horsepower engine and a 6-speed automatic transmission, which guarantees reliable operation even in the most difficult conditions. Regardless of configuration, this vehicle offers a number of standard features, including central tire inflation, radial tires with Run-Flat, anti-lock braking system (ABS), as well as air conditioning systems and heating. In addition, it is equipped with five-point seat belts and an advanced driver's vision system. Additional features include Drive-by-Wire technology, a filtering system NBC (Nuclear, Biological, Chemical), a self-extracting winch and a 360° situational awareness system that provides full visibility on the battlefield.

The Army that reads: about the project -Book on the front-, US experience and modern innovations -Cu...	The project leader, Sergeant of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Andriy Ovcharuk, told ArmiyaInform about the significance of the book at the front, the connection with the experience of Great Britain and the USA during the First and Second World Wars, and modern Ukrainian innovations. - When did the -Book on the Front- project start and what prompted its appearance? - The -Book on the Front- project started in April 2023, and I joined it from March 2024. Since in civilian life I was the head of the Kyiv office of -Stary Lev Publishing House- - opened bookstores, was a bookseller and sold books myself, I readily agreed when I was offered to lead this project and develop it. I think this idea floated in the air, because such things have already happened before. During World War I, the British and Americans gave books to their troops. Then, during the Second World War, a huge campaign was organized in the USA, during which almost 123 million copies of the books were given to the servicemen of the US Armed Forces. These books simply went to all fronts, 155 thousand boxes were sent every month, each of which contained 40 different books. In total, they had a very large list of over 1,300 items. These included classics, contemporary American literature, entertaining books - westerns, detective stories, and more. — That is, there was a significant demand for books then. Is it the same now? — When many people who were civilians yesterday and are now mobilized join the army, they bring their everyday habits and needs to the army. Our Defense Forces now number hundreds of thousands, more than a million people, a significant number of whom have read in civilian life. Getting into the conditions of war, into the conditions of military service, they retain this need to read. There are also those who are trained as readers already in the army. Military personnel or those who have interacted with military personnel know very well that in the military there are quite often situations where you have to wait a long time. For example, sitting on your belongings until the transport arrives, or being on the guard of some objects, waiting for some task or resting after its completion. Typical are situations where a significant number of people have some free time that they have nothing to do. For many, the main entertainment is the phone, but we want to offer an alternative. The phone isn't always safe, it's not always smart, it's too easy a dopamine hit. In most cases, the phone is not useful, people lose concentration, and things like attention, imagination and concentration are very important in war. - Does the book help to preserve and develop them? - Yes, the book helps to concentrate and think, especially in conditions of uncertainty. When you don't know what to do, the book can help you find a non-standard solution to the situation. Therefore, we want the military to read books and do everything possible for this. -Cultural Landing- is a big project in which musicians, singers, poets, writers, puppeteers take part. People of many creative professions who worked in the field of culture in civilian life. Currently, groups of -Cultural Airborne- travel around military units in the combat zone, visit hospitals and rehabilitation centers, where they perform in front of the military. These can be different events: poet Artem Polezhaka reads poems, puppeteer Valery Dzhek performs plays, Myroslav Jonovich Kuvaldin from the band -The VYO- plays the guitar, Vitaly Kyrychenko sings songs, the most famous of which is -Good Morning, Ukraine-. And when our -Cultural Landing- groups come to the military, they take books with them. After the performance, after communicating with the fighters, they open a box of books and offer to choose something to read. Accordingly, the military choose something to their taste that they like. —Where does the Book to the Front project get the books it distributes to the military?—In the United States, since World War II, the program to supply books to the military has been supported at the state level. The government decided that this was important for the military, who had no other entertainment than reading - when boxes of books arrived, they would instantly take them apart, read them, and exchange them among themselves. It got to the point that after frequent reading, the books simply fell apart. This, by the way, caused a real book boom after the end of the war, because after returning to civilian life, former soldiers continued to read. Book publishing, the book industry experienced a boom - the book market doubled in the first half of the year, and then doubled again in the following year. In the end, it had a tremendous impact on the development of the entire country. For us, this is now happening on a voluntary basis, so the scale is disproportionate. If in the USA during the Second World War there were tens of millions of books, then we are talking about tens of thousands. We offer ordinary civilians, visitors to bookstores, book festivals to buy a book and donate it to the -Book on the Front- project. On this book, you can write a wish, leave a note for the military who will read the book. Having collected books in the rear cities of Ukraine, we hand them over to the -Cultural Landing- groups who go to the front, to educational centers, to military units, to hospitals, rehabilitation centers - wherever there are military personnel. - A paper book has a certain weight, takes up a certain volume - it is not always convenient for a soldier to take it with him. Instead, almost everyone has a smartphone in their pocket. Does the Book to the Front project practice e-book distribution? - Yes, there are several other initiatives within which the military can access e-books. There is an initiative from online bookstore Yakaboo called The Library for Heroes. We are also engaged in the dissemination of this initiative. The reading application has a separate library that contains more than 700 e-books, several dozen audiobooks. According to the promotional code, which can be obtained from us on the -Book on the Front- project, the soldier will have access to this library and can choose anything there. You really won't carry a lot of paper books with you. For example, after reading one book that was obtained during a meeting with the Cultural Landing, I realized that I wanted to read more. So here's your promo code, pick whatever you want, there's a lot to choose from. But paper books are also important, because it is not always possible to charge a phone - electricity is needed. And many people find it more convenient to read a regular paper book - you get used to it, it's nice to flip through the pages, feel them to the touch. - What is read most often, which genres of books are most often chosen and ordered? - Most often, military personnel read fiction books. They provide an opportunity to distract yourself from the military routine, from anxiety, worries about your life. They allow you to immerse yourself in another world, experience vivid emotions. How do imagination and emotions work? They help to relax, rest, switch off from complex thoughts a little. The book helps a lot in this. Of course, there are also people who like to read non-fiction - something serious, non-fiction, self-improvement books. Many people are interested in the experience of previous wars - historical books on military topics are also quite in demand and popular. It doesn't have to be books about our war—it could be books about the Vietnam War, World War II. It happens that comics are ordered, especially in hospitals and rehabilitation centers there was a request for comics. There was even a request from the military from the combat unit to give them the manga. - And poetry, collections of poems - are they ordered, read? - Of course, poetry is very attractive, because it is a short emotional text that helps you get to your own emotions very quickly. Reading an emotional poem, you yourself begin to feel everything more deeply. You can cry, you can laugh, you can experience many different emotions when you read poetry. Many of those who order books ask for poetry. Some resort to the spoken word in training centers, reading poems to motivate fighters during training. Now there are many bright, talented poets in the army. Artur Trony, for example, writes very strong poems. Unfortunately, a very strong poet Maksym Kryvtsov died, his poems became very famous. I have already mentioned Artem Polezhaku - this list can be continued for a very long time. Military service, reliving the personal experience of war prompts both to write and to read poetry. Therefore, poetry collections are chosen for reading quite often. I had an order from one hospital specifically for poetry, I organized the collection and transfer of more than fifty collections of poetry to them. - Where can a soldier put a book after reading it? - These books are gifts, they do not need to be returned. If it is a school, hospital or rehabilitation center, the book can stay in a local, often informal, library where it can be borrowed and read by others. Most often, books are given to siblings by exchanging books. You can also mail someone, family or friends, to read this book too. This allows you to share your emotions, find a common topic for conversation. Books allow military personnel to think more deeply about and relive their own experiences, and become an additional means of communication both among themselves and with those who remained in the rear. After all, a book is an extension of life. We don't know when the war will end, but life still goes on. And books help us to continue living even in the midst of the horrors of the present war.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/30/armiya-shho-chytaye-pro-proyekt-knyga-na-front-dosvid-ssha-ta-suchasni-novacziyi-kulturnogo-desantu/	2024-11-29T20:28:59-08:00
Breaking the truth: the Russians are circulating fakes about drugs in the army	By keyword search experts from -Vox Ukraine- found the original source of the photo that was distributed by propagandists. The original photo appeared on the Facebook page of the patrol police of the Dnipropetrovsk region. Law enforcement officers seized drugs from a woman in the Samara district of Dnipro. However, there is no information in the police report that the detainee was a soldier. The propagandists cropped the original photo and passed it off as a package with drugs, which are allegedly distributed among the fighters of the 95th ODSHBr. The topic of drugs is extremely popular among Russian propagandists. Propagandists have repeatedly stated that drugs are used by Ukrainian military personnel, and that the narcotic substances themselves are grown in Ukraine by Americans in biolaboratories. In particular, we can recall fakes, as if the Armed Forces of Ukraine are creating a -universal soldier- with the help of drugs, and the Third OSH Brigade is forcing recruits to use narcotic substances. All these and similar -throwbacks- by the Russians are lies.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/30/lomka-za-pravdoyu-rosiyany-tyrazhuyut-fejky-pro-narkotyky-u-vijsku/	2024-11-29T20:10:10-08:00
Ukraine and Norway will increase joint work for the production of weapons and energy protection	This was reported by the Office of the President. The head of state thanked for yesterday's decision of the parliament of Norway to increase aid to Ukraine for the next year from 1.4 billion dollars. up to 3.2 billion dollars. and especially noted its unanimous support by all parliamentary forces.

The Defense Forces told about the unsuccessful attempts of the Russians to cross the canal in Chasov...	A representative of the 24th OMbr named after King Danyla Andriy Polukhin. -The enemy has been trying to attack our positions in the city of Chasiv Yar in recent days. Their main tactic is to bypass our positions and impose a battle in the rear. But this week they also openly tried to storm, to carry out a mechanized assault. But they did not succeed, they lost a lot of equipment,- said Andriy Polukhin. According to him, the enemy is trying to complicate its offensive actions, and for this purpose it bypasses Chasiv Yar from different sides. He added that in the areas on our side of the canal, the enemy has not established a foothold, but is trying to penetrate in small groups. -Our boys identify them very quickly and work on them. The enemy is trying to accumulate forces in this way, but because of our drones, they are unable to do so,- Andriy Polukhin said. According to him, the canal itself is under fire control of the Defense Forces of Ukraine, and even if an enemy group crosses the canal, it is blocked and cut off from its forces. As reported by ArmyInform, on November 29 in the Kramatorsk direction, the invaders > carried out two assault actions near Chasovoy Yar and in the direction of White Mountain. There are currently two ongoing attacks by the occupiers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/29/u-sylah-oborony-rozpovily-pro-bezuspishni-sproby-rosiyan-perejty-kanal-u-chasovomu-yari/	2024-11-29T10:37:24-08:00
Why MRAP armored vehicles are the safest against mines	Armored vehicles MRAP (from the English MRAP, Mine Resistant Ambush Protected - protection against mines and ambushes) - a class of military vehicles specially designed to protect the crew from undermining on min . The first armored vehicles under the MRAP system were produced back in the mid-70s. For the production of such cars, a special design and technological features were invented, which allow to protect the crew when hitting a mine. These machines have reduced the number of losses many times over. Due to the wedge-shaped bottom, the kinetic energy from the mine explosion is directed to the outside of the armored capsule. When making a V-bottom, it is important to maintain a certain angle. The sharper it is, the more energy is directed outwards and the better the crew is protected. At the same time, the sharp angle of the bottom increases the center of gravity and the height of the car, which reduces the car's rollover resistance and increases the height, vulnerability to anti-tank grenade launchers. When making an obtuse angle, the situation is reversed. The more obtuse the angle of the bottom, the worse the protection against a mine explosion, but the lower the center of gravity and the overall height of the armored car, which increases the protection against grenade launchers and other means of destruction. MRAP armored vehicles are designed according to the modular principle - a monolithic protected armored capsule and remote poorly protected external units: wheels, chassis elements, engine. The latter have an inertial fastening principle, that is, they absorb all the kinetic energy of the explosion. This design allows you to withstand detonation of powerful mines with minimal impact on the crew module. By the way, Formula 1 cars are designed according to a similar principle. Amortization seats and units. The design of landing seats in MRAP armored vehicles absorbs the kinetic energy of the explosion, saving the life of a serviceman. The seats are installed in the places of the least impact of the blast wave. During the explosion, the armor module moves, and the chair remains in place. According to a similar damping principle, other components are installed on armored vehicles so that during an explosion they do not harm personnel. For example, fragments of affected units fly out. Special design wheels. MRAP armored vehicles use wide, low-pressure tires with a high profile. Such tires create low pressure on the surface, so they do not activate the effect of anti-tank mines. The high profile of the tire serves as an additional explosion-absorbing factor. Strengthened ballistic protection. The armored capsule of MRAP vehicles is made taking into account the impact not only of small arms, but also of fragments from explosive devices of various strengths. An example of the application of safe technological solutions is the MRAP Buffalo. At the beginning of 2007, the US Army had 90 such vehicles in its arsenal. During the hostilities, they suffered more than 800 mine explosions without a single loss of crew. This fact provoked the Pentagon to start a program of complex procurement of such machines. The most popular foreign-made MRAP armored vehicles are Maxxpro, Casspir, Oshkosh, Mastiff, Bushmaster, Kirpi, etc. Ukrainian enterprises produce MRAP technology, in particular, armored vehicles of the Kozak, Varta, Novator, etc. families. And what about the MRAP technology in the Rosarmy? Objectively, the Russians also worked on this project. In the context of the large-scale rearmament and reform of the Rosarmy, which actively began after the Russian-Georgian war in 2008, and revived after the aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine in 2014, this technology was implemented. For example, we will give the most famous examples of armored cars that were developed by the Russians: It is worth noting one interesting detail. In the West and in Ukraine, armored vehicles, in particular with MRAP technology, are a class of armored vehicles for widespread use in the military. The Russians follow the policy of the Soviet empire: the best weapons and equipment are for the security forces, which are designed to protect the regime, and special forces. For ordinary infantry, a -three-line- is enough. Analyzing open data on orders in the Russian Federation for armored vehicles, in particular MRAPs, their main operators within the country are units of the Russian Guard, force units of the police (riot, sobr), FSB, etc. Paratroopers, scouts and sappers received BBM in the Rosarmy. But for the rest of the ground forces, the command of the occupying army is in no hurry to implement new technological and engineering security solutions, because the life and health of personnel is not a priority for them.

The hero of Ukraine Oleg Apostol told how his 95 beat the enemy: interview	The Hero of Ukraine Oleg Apostol was the commander of the 95th Separate Airborne Assault Brigade of the Polish Army until today. In the spring, the correspondent of ArmiyaInform recorded a long interview with him, we suggest that he be recalled on the occasion of his new appointment. The great war that Russia started against Ukraine 10 years ago, during this period many young but extremely experienced military personnel grew up. who have already entered the history of modern Ukraine as talented military leaders. One of these is the commander of the 95th Separate Polish Airborne Assault Brigade, Hero of Ukraine, Knight of the Cross of Combat Merit, Full Knight of the Order of Bohdan Khmelnytskyi, Colonel Oleg Apostol. During the ten-year war, the paratrooper fought for Slovyansk and Luhansk airport, liberated the Mykolaiv thermal power station in Donetsk region, and from the beginning of the large-scale invasion, also populated areas in Mykolaiv region. With the appointment to the post of commander of the 95th brigade of the Russian Armed Forces, Colonel Apostol led the battles in the Serebrian and Kupyan forests, and now continues to organize defensive and offensive actions in Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Exclusively for ArmiyaInform, Hero of Ukraine Oleg Apostol talked about his combat journey from platoon commander to brigade commander. — What are the most significant combat episodes of the paratroopers since 2014, in your opinion, will go down in the history of Ukraine? — Undoubtedly, the well-known raid (the raid of the Ukrainian paratroopers, which began in July 2014 during the anti-terrorist operation - ed.), defense of Luhansk and Donetsk airports, battles for Debaltseve. During the breakthrough to Luhansk airport, I led a combat reconnaissance platoon, then I was in the position of deputy battalion commander. The occupiers then tried twice to set up ambushes on the advance route. Having calculated the dangerous areas in time, they decided to play it safe. Ordered two tanks and an armored personnel carrier to occupy the designated line. It saved us and prevented us from being destroyed. Everyone knows that 80-90% of ambushes do not survive&#8230; But the commander should always be able to calculate everything in advance, because then it saves many lives and enables the completion of the task. — Tell us about your first battle with the enemy. — June 2, 2014, when everyone went to storm Sloviansk and Lyman. I was tasked with bringing three artillery batteries into a designated area to support operations. Two batteries were equipped with 122 mm howitzers, and one with 152 mm. I was driving behind the 79th DSHV brigade, and then they were ambushed on the climb to Sloviansk. At that moment, I stopped the convoy, because I realized that the 79th was operating with one of the Jaguar special units. All of them are charged, and I have three armored personnel carriers, one -zushka- and three batteries that are covered with tents and not ready for combat. Then the 79th broke through and went forward to Liman, we stood in a column, and the enemy was on our right and left. I understood that the enemy might start to outflank us, so I gave the command to turn off the headlights, turn right and left, and we took up a circular defense. 15 minutes have passed I got on the armored personnel carrier and decided to move forward. I thought then that if I leave and nothing happens, then we will jump by 2-3 cars. When we realized that the enemy had withdrawn, we first thought how lucky we were, because if the enemy had not made such a mistake, it is difficult to imagine what could have happened if three batteries, each with 6 howitzers and ammunition, had been ambushed. ; This is actually the first moment of the battle, but then there was the first contact battle, when I liberated the Mykolaiv TPP. The first time we went there, it was difficult to detect the enemy, and we conducted reconnaissance by combat. The second time, we already knew where all their firing points were, and we simply stopped them with direct fire from tanks. In fact, after we regularly held them at gunpoint, they began to run away. For the third time, we broke through, unblocked Mykolaiv TPP, occupied the commanding heights - and after that Slovyansk was liberated. - What are the most memorable combat episodes since you became the commander of the 95th brigade? - The first is the assault in the direction of the settlement of Kreminna. We had great success there, but the only thing we lacked was effort. Of the four battalions, only two advanced, because the other two were in other directions. We broke ahead, we literally lacked two kilometers. After that, the enemy brought in significant reserve forces, we switched to defense with the task of defending the Kreminny direction. Secondly, this is the defense of the Kupyan forest, at times it seemed that everything was about to fall, but the enemy could not withstand the dynamics of the fighting. This was clearly visible from their assaults. At first, they attacked 15-20 people several times a day. Then 6–8 Russian soldiers, then two people, and then once a day, a couple tried to go on an assault. As soon as such a turning point comes, we immediately tried to regain the lost positions, which we did. - What units of the Russian army did you have to fight against? - We were in the Flint Forest opposite the 76th Airborne Assault Division, which included the 104th Guards Airborne Assault Regiment, the 234th infantry regiment and the 237th Guards parachute regiment On the eastern side, they concentrated the 228th motorized rifle regiment, the 80th tank regiment, and the 4th separate motorized rifle brigade. I am sure that this enemy remembered us well, because we crushed them so much that some units went out to recover. In the Kupyansky Forest, -Sturm Z- and -Sturm V- stood against us, and when the -Zeks- were finished, the personnel left - the 25th Separate Motorized Rifle Guards Brigade, the 138th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade - this was real -meat -. Analyzing the actions of the enemy, you ask yourself the question, how can you just send people to slaughter like this? But I cannot understand this, because my commanders did not act like this with their personnel. And he himself would never do that to his people. At Terny, units of the 20th Guards Combined Arms Army and some assault units of the Tank Army tried to storm us. They have the same tactics here as in the Kupyan forest. They also go in packs, they just put people down. By the way, they call themselves -Kyiv Russia-, but in fact they are simply distorting our history. The most stupid thing is that their people are led by such narratives and believe that it is normal to send people to their death. All this is welcomed by the people, because then they can buy a car. Of course, it is worth noting that the -stacking- tactics of the occupiers is paying off. We have seen this in Bahmut, Soledar and other destinations, but our advantage lies in pure intelligence and technological development. — Your brigade took many prisoners. Will they admit their guilt for all the evil they have committed on our land? - When the occupiers are captured, they immediately become different people. It is clear that at first the characteristic phrases are heard: -We have been abandoned, we are offended by everything and everyone, barefoot, poor, unhappy and hungry.- They behave as prisoners should, they don't show their character, they give us information about where their command posts are, what paths they took, who is senior. If compared with the captives who were at the beginning of the large-scale invasion and now, then I call this -party- mercenaries, because they stupidly go to kill for money. No one catches them and forces them to go fight against Ukraine and kill our civilians and military. This is a purely conscious choice of each of them. When I talk to them before handing them over to replenish the exchange fund, they all say that they were aware of the possibility of their death, but they came to make money. But we understand that they have come to destroy our people. And there is nothing sacred about them. - Which settlements did your brigade liberate? - Our brigade de-occupied Dovgenka, Krasnopill, Makarivka, Pasika, Dolyna, Kamianka, Sukha Kamianka, Studenok, Koroviya Yar, Yatskivka, Krymka, Synycheno. Then they moved to the settlements of Krymka, Shandrigolovo, Zelena Dolyna, Kolodyazi and reached Ploschanka. The Kharkiv operation was well planned by the senior commander, it was correctly selected units, the direction of our shock fist, support and a clear assessment of the enemy. The enemy really relaxed then, they were confident - and that also worked against them. While still a member of the 80th DSHV brigade, he met the war in the position of battalion commander. Such a first moment, which will be remembered forever and will go down in history, is the defense of the settlement of Voznesensk. After successfully repelling the enemy's offensive, we moved to offensive actions. And then they liberated the following settlements in the Mykolaiv region: Arkhargelske, Katerynivka, Kashpero-Mykolaivka, Novopetrivske, Novofontanka, Dobrokamyanka, Ingulets, Vynogradivka, and in this way we reached Yavkina, and already near Snigurivka we supported the enemy. The outlying villages that we held there were: Shiroke, Chervona Dolyna and Kobzartsi. Oh, and we won trophies then! - Which trophies were the -fattest-? - Well, the most I can point out is REB -Resident-. In addition to it, there were gas tankers, water tankers, bathhouses, armored personnel carriers, tanks of various models of the T-72BZ type and modifications, D-30 howitzers, engineering vehicles, MT-LB, pickup trucks, many shells and even to the Grad anti-aircraft missile system. In general, we received such a normal lend-lease from the Rashists, it was -gifted- to us by the 126th separate brigade of the coast guard and the command post of the army. - How has the training of Ukrainian paratroopers changed over these 10 years? - Definitely for the better. Everything we invest in the training of young recruits is invaluable experience forged in battles on our own experience. We in the brigade have developed our own material base and assembled a group of experienced instructors who skillfully manage personnel for each type of combat and explain all the nuances. For me personally, the combat training of personnel is extremely important. — A few months ago, I saw with my own eyes how you set an example and taught the paratroopers of your brigade. To be honest, I was impressed not only by your professional approach, but also by how much your actions motivate the personnel. — Yes, then I gathered my instructors and another certain category of officers and showed all those points that need to be improved in preparation for further training of soldiers on the battlefield. Of course, these are not all dogmas and things are different in battle, but absolutely all situations are analyzed from real battles. We constantly monitor the enemy's channels, watch how our defenders act, analyze where there was success and what caused it, and where we could have done differently. That is, constant analysis of oneself and the enemy gives an understanding of how to plan the course of hostilities. If a person is trained and clearly knows what he should do, then this is already a great destiny of success, because it is the soldiers who forge our Victory in the trenches. And then an extremely important point is the moral and psychological state of my paratroopers. All of us are waiting for our relatives at home. A person should always understand what he is fighting for and what will happen if we do not fight, if we do not overcome this evil now, then Russia will not let us go so easily and will destroy us. — At the beginning of the large-scale invasion, many Ukrainian media underestimated our enemy and dispelled myths that the occupiers were weak and weak. What can you say about this and how often the enemy changes? - If they were weak and weak, we would have knocked them out long ago to the borders of 1991. You can never underestimate your opponent. Russia is a really big machine with a huge human resource, which they do not spare. They are abandoning their people by the thousands and will continue to do so, because history repeats itself. In addition, the occupiers learn quite quickly. Many examples can be given. Russia learns a lot from us and uses it against us in the future. - Did you dream of becoming a paratrooper as a child? - Definitely yes. I never considered infantry or other types of troops. When I was little, in the 7th grade, I had about 300 toy soldiers, up to 100 pieces of equipment, aviation, special forces. All the money that I saved and that my relatives gave me, I spent on my plastic army. I put them against each other according to the scenario, simulated the landing of the landing force and developed various battle sequences. It happened that I was so engrossed in the placement of soldiers that I did not come to the actual battle. After all, I was a child, and I switched to another game, for example, I went to play football, because the placement itself took more than an hour. I have also loved historical films and the history of Ukraine since childhood, constantly read memoirs and historical novels. It was then that my desire to become a soldier was born, I could not see any other way for myself. - What personally gives you strength and how do you motivate your personnel? - Gives strength when the day or battle has passed without loss. War dictates its terms, so you can never get too lazy. I understand that it can be difficult for me mentally at times, because you are constantly worrying about your people, that they are all alive and well, but we understand that it is the hardest for the soldier there. Yes, we plan everything with the brigade leadership, combatants, conduct reconnaissance, provide artillery support, but nothing will happen without soldiers. Therefore, I sincerely want all people to respect our real heroes, because many of them have already given the most valuable thing - their lives. Russia is an enemy and an evil that we must stop. I have lived in this world for a reason, at least we have already avenged both the Cossacks and the Kruts. Now our job is to reclaim the rest of ours. Here you are either the hunter or the prey. — What do you wish for the youth who dream of joining your ranks? What traits do they need to nurture? — DSHV is an elite. I even tell my boys, when they're a little off balance, to remember that they're paratroopers! It will always be difficult, because war is merciless and unfair. We all realize what a tremendous amount of work has been done here to earn the proud title of paratrooper. I wish the youth to cultivate courage, to be physically hardy, to study the entire history of Ukraine, because this is not the first time we are fighting this enemy. Putin's appetite is growing, and it will not stop. He is becoming, and may have already become a copy of Hitler himself, without realizing it. Everyone will have to fight, it is necessary to accept it as it is and with a cold mind. The main thing is to remember and honor all our fallen Heroes!

According to the investigation materials, an employee of a local pharmaceutical company turned out to be an enemy accomplice. Under the guise of business trips, the agent collected information about military facilities, including defense enterprises, and -matched- their coordinates with locations on Google Maps. SBU counter-intelligence exposed the suspect and arrested him during a special operation in the regional center in September 2023. -During the search of his apartment and car, mobile phones were seized with maps of the locations of potential targets, which he tried to pass on to the FSB,- the statement said. According to the investigation, the convict came to the attention of the occupiers as an ideological supporter of racism, about which he repeatedly wrote on Russian social networks. -After recruitment, the agent used a conspiratorial channel of communication with the FSB with the help of anonymous chats in instant messengers, which he registered on the phone numbers of foreign operators,- the SBU said. According to the materials of the Security Service, the court found the intruder guilty of 2 Art. 111 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (treason committed under martial law).

One of such attacks was shelling from Grady, when the positions of the border guards were literally destroyed. There were defenders in the dugouts, and in the forest - the border guard Vadim with the call sign -Obolon- and the position commander. After the shelling ended, the commander rushed to save his comrades, but came across a mine that detonated. -Our commander was cut by shrapnel, a lung was pierced. We quickly gave him first aid and evacuated him. Fortunately, he is now recovering and will hopefully return to us soon,- says Obolon, who temporarily took command of the position. The border guards rebuilt the fortification from scratch, putting all their strength into it. -We do this for ourselves, because it is our security, and for our commander - so that he is satisfied with our work,- Obolon adds. Vadim, who used to work in Kyiv, says that he repeatedly thanked his son for the habit of running: it was she who saved his life during attacks.

The results of the Security Cooperation Forum: who ignored the hysteria of the Russian Federation	The FBS is the OSCE's main platform for arms control, as well as disarmament, confidence-building and security measures, on the basis of which it cooperates for stability in the Euro-Atlantic and Eurasian regions. Russia tried to disrupt this meeting even before it began. In particular, during the adoption of the agenda, the Russian delegation stated that there was no consensus regarding the proposed project. In their statement, the Russians demanded from Denmark: The Russian delegation also demanded to immediately start consultations between the Russian Federation and Denmark with the involvement of -third parties-, in particular Malta and the OSCE Secretariat. In response to Russia's actions, the presiding country resolutely confirmed its position on the impossibility of blocking the agenda, which contains only minimal items (-General statements- and -Other-). The Danish side also rejected accusations of abuse of power. Only Belarus supported the Russian demands, and the delegations of the EU, Ireland, Sweden, the USA, Switzerland, Romania, Croatia, Ukraine, Poland, Latvia, France, Great Britain and Georgia expressed their full support for the Danish approach and called for the continuation of the meeting. All this theater was organized to disrupt the performance of Ukraine at the FBS. But our delegation, headed by T.V.O. the permanent representative of Ukraine to international organizations in Vienna, Victoria Kuvshinnikova, who initiated consideration of the issue of the ongoing Russian aggressive war against Ukraine, nevertheless gave her speech on this occasion. -Ukraine, Europe and the whole world need a comprehensive, just and durable peace. Ukraine, as the main victim of Russian aggression, wants an end to this war more than any other country. But this must be real peace, not appeasement of the aggressor. Ukraine is open to diplomacy, but from an honest, strong position. That is why we have the Peace Formula - it is a guarantee of negotiations without forcing Ukraine to commit injustice. Ukrainians deserve a just peace and we must do everything to end the war next year. Unfortunately, the Russian Federation continues to reject all peace initiatives aimed at restoring justice in accordance with the norms and principles of international law. The criminal regime in the Kremlin still believes that it can achieve victory and change the international order according to its own vision. However, despite repeated claims that Russia has one of the most powerful armies in the world, it is still far from military success even after 1,000 days of intense fighting against a country 28 times smaller in size and almost four times smaller in population.- — said the representative of Ukraine. She also emphasized that the successes of the Russian army are based only on a complete disregard for the rules of warfare and a huge amount of -cannon fodder-. Therefore, the Russian army can be defeated, and the international order can be restored. This goal can be achieved only under the condition that all peace-loving states join forces to force the Russian Federation to end the war and recognize its responsibility for the crimes committed. Statements were also made by Great Britain and the EU, and statements by the United States and Canada were distributed in writing. Thus, for the second time, the Danish chairmanship of the FBS decided to ignore Russia's demands and limited the Russian delegation's ability to speak at the Forum. Such a position, in the opinion of the Embassy of Ukraine, corresponds to the interests of our state, since the actions of the chairmanship emphasize Russia's isolation and the weakness of the aggressor's position in the OSCE arena. In addition, the Danish reaction to Russia's actions caused significant damage to the image of the Russian Federation, emphasizing the destructive nature of its actions and the illegality of its demands.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/29/pidsumky-forumu-bezpekovogo-spivrobitnycztva-hto-proignoruvav-isteryku-rf/	2024-11-29T06:04:40-08:00
Forged documents for almost half a thousand evaders: a man was exposed who made false orders of the ...	About this informsNovember 29 State Bureau of Investigation. It is noted that the intruder, having access to the orders of the Ministry of Economy, according to which decisions were made regarding the reservation of conscripts, made fake extracts from the relevant orders. -He provided them with unreliable information that these citizens allegedly work for various critical infrastructure enterprises and are subject to a 6-month deferment from being called up for military service during mobilization,- the report said. In addition, he produced forged documents regarding the belonging of this or that enterprise to the category of critical importance for the functioning of the economy and ensuring the livelihood of the population in a special period, as well as regarding the reservation of their employees. It was established that documents related to employees of 12 enterprises, in total, related to 454 citizens, were forged. Depending on the complexity, the -service- cost between $200 and $2,000. The documents produced by the attacker were used during the verification of military registration documents of citizens, were entered into the Unified State Register of conscripts, conscripts and reservists, and were also used when crossing the state border of Ukraine. Such machinations harmed the legitimate activities of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and other military formations during martial law. Law enforcement officers conducted 20 searches, during which computers, media, forged documents and lists of persons who used the illegal scheme were seized. The leading engineer was informed of the suspicion of obstructing the legal activities of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and other military formations (Part 1, Article 114-1 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine). A petition was submitted regarding the selection of a preventive measure in the form of detention. Investigative actions are currently underway to identify other citizens and legal entities whose documents were forged. The possible involvement in illegal actions of other persons, in particular officials of ministries, RTCC and SP, is also being checked. ArmyInform reminds that it is better not to break the law or risk your life, but to use the aggregator of vacancies in the Armed Forces and recruiting centers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/29/pidrobyv-dokumenty-dlya-majzhe-pivtysyachi-uhylyantiv-vykryto-cholovika-yakyj-robyv-lypovi-nakazy-minekonomiky/	2024-11-29T05:52:38-08:00

They use administrative buildings, schools, kindergartens, that is, everything that survived. First of all, as a shelter,- said Nazar Voloshyn.

There is no translation for the -Cossack- family: how to improve the armored car -Cossack-	Andriy Kharuk, a well-known researcher of military equipment and armaments, doctor of historical sciences, professor of the Department of Humanities at the National Academy of Land Forces named after Hetman Petr Sagaidachny, told the ArmiyaInform correspondent about the history of the creation of this vehicle. Today is the continuation of the conversation, and the first part of the interview can be read at link. — Andriy Ivanovych, at the beginning of our conversation, you mentioned that the premiere sample of this armored car has already attracted the interest of potential foreign buyers. As far as I know, the manufacturer of this type of special equipment had further plans to enter the international market. What did they consist of? — In addition to the basic version, the Praktika company created a modification of the Kozak-2M2, which was offered for export. In particular, with the optional replacement of the Iveco engine with Deutz or Caterpillar, as well as the manual gearbox with an automatic one. This variant could be equipped with a three-door or five-door body. It was planned to establish the licensed production of Kozak-2M2 in Indonesia. In December 2021, the first Indonesian prototype was demonstrated, but there is currently no information on the further development of this project. —And then the third and subsequent generations of -Cossacks- appeared. What can you tell us about them? — BBM -Kozak-3- is a Land Rover Defender all-terrain vehicle booked by -Practice-. The work was carried out on the order of the State Border Service of Ukraine, and the batch of manufactured machines probably does not exceed several dozen copies. Very little is known about the Kozak-4 - it is described as a 15-passenger transport vehicle that was tested in the National Guard. An alternative to Iveco units was the use of the chassis of the American Ford F-550 car. The Kozak-5 prototype, built on this basis, was presented at the -Weapons and Security-2016- exhibition. Unlike Kozak-2, this car was positioned not as an army armored vehicle, but as a police vehicle, including for special-purpose units of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications. The chassis of the Ford F-550 specially modified for the construction of an armored car by the company - an official converter (reinforced front axle, brakes and suspension elements replaced with stronger ones, installed large 335/80 R20 wheels, replaced gear pairs in the bridges - ed.). The eight-cylinder Power Stroke turbodiesel with a working volume of 6.7 liters develops a power of 390 hp. The transmission is a Ford TorqShift six-speed automatic. -Kozak-5- is lighter than -Kozak-2- - it weighs 10 tons. In the basic version, the armored car accommodates eight people. The design of the body is generally similar to -Kosaku-2-, but in the rear wall, instead of double-leaf doors, single-leaf doors are installed. — But the -fifth- -Cossack-, figuratively speaking, somehow did not go well with the service in the Armed Forces. What, in your opinion, is the reason? — The basic version of the Kozak-5 does not have weapons, but it can be equipped with a machine gun on a turret. And in October 2017, at another -Weapons and Security- exhibition, a variant with a BPU-1 tower from BRDM-2 was demonstrated, in which KPVT (caliber 14.5 mm) and PKT (7.62 mm) machine guns were installed. Unlike Kozak-2 and Kozak-2M armored vehicles, Kozak-5 did not arouse much interest in the Ukrainian military. Only one vehicle is believed to have been transferred to the National Guard in the spring of 2017. She was received by the special forces unit -Vega-. The Armed Forces of Ukraine did not purchase a single armored vehicle of this type before the beginning of the Russian large-scale invasion. Instead, Praktika managed to get an order from Saudi Arabia for 60 armored vehicles. The first batch was ready to be shipped to the customer in April 2021. However, apparently not all Kozak-5 armored vehicles were delivered to Saudi Arabia by February 2022 - photos of such vehicles at the front appeared in the spring and summer. They differ from the armored car given to the National Guard in some details, in particular, the design of the headlights. — However, one of the variants of the Kozak-5 BBM turned out to be a valuable acquisition for Ukrainian sappers, for whom, unfortunately, jobs are constantly being added&#8230; — A special variant of the Kozak-5MPL is intended for demining groups State service for emergency situations. It serves to transport unexploded mines and improvised explosive devices. The difference is a longer wheelbase and a special body design designed to detonate mines/improvised explosive devices that are transported. In addition, the car is equipped with a compartment for a special tool of the pyrotechnic team. In June 2018, the State Emergency Service received eight Kozak-5MPL armored vehicles. — There was an attempt by the manufacturer to create a Kozak-6 special vehicle — In the summer of 2021, the Kozak-6 was produced and tested, a car with a four-door body without a roof. She was appointed to participate in military parades and even took part in the rehearsal of solemn events in August 2021. The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine planned to purchase three -armored convertibles-, but this idea was quickly abandoned, so the Kozak-6 prototype was returned to the manufacturer. — However, the -Cossack- manufacturers did not abandon the idea of ​​providing the Ukrainian army with their armored vehicles. What did the -seventh- Kozak turn out to be? — Yes, the last representative of the BBM data line is the Kozak-7 armored car. Unlike the -policeman- -Cossack-5-, it is positioned as a purely military vehicle. The base chassis of the Ford F-550 has been significantly strengthened - wheel hubs from the US Army JLTV vehicle, reinforced axles and new springs have been installed. The body became three-door. The mass increased to almost 12 tons. Compared to Kozak-2M1, the armored car has better ergonomics, improved dynamic characteristics, as well as lower cost and simpler production technology. On the other hand, it has a frame structure, which was considered the main drawback of the Kozak-2 and became the reason for the appearance of the Kozak-2M1 machine with a supporting body. - This model of armored car has its own -export- history of creation. - Kozak-7 armored car was created for an unnamed foreign customer according to an individual technical task. On January 25, 2022, this machine was demonstrated to the command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Under the conditions of a large-scale Russian invasion, exports were out of the question. However, a certain number of Kozak-7 armored cars were still produced. Since January 2023, their appearance at the front has been recorded, and in May 2023, information appeared about the use of such armored vehicles by the Airborne Assault Troops. Taking into account all of the above, it can be concluded that the Praktika company has created a fairly extensive line of armored vehicles with a 4×4 wheel formula, which are based on the use of imported civilian units. These machines, primarily Kozak-2 and Kozak-2M1, are widely used by the Defense Forces of Ukraine to ensure the mobility of light infantry units (primarily Airborne Assault Forces, Marines and National Guard - ed.), as well as to support the actions of Special Operations Forces . —Mr. Professor, with this conclusion you have effectively summed up the creation and development of the -Cossack- line of BBM in the period before the large-scale invasion of the aggressors. But the manufacturers of Kozak machines continued their improvement after the start of the great war. — In August 2023, a video appeared of the Kozak-2M1 with a new weapon option — a remote-controlled module with a 14.5-mm KPVT machine gun. In June, this module was already spotted on another carrier - MT-LBu, converted into an ersatz BMP (the designation BMP-1LB is found - ed.). The origin of the remote-controlled installation is unknown, but some conclusions can be drawn from its image. Several lenses of the optical station suggest the presence of a night channel (infrared or thermal imaging - ed.). The module is also equipped with a protective shield in the front projection, which hints at the lack of adequate bulletproofing of the installation itself. The gunner controls the module using a joystick. The level of execution of the combat module suggests that it was produced in Ukraine by one of the defense enterprises already during the large-scale invasion. Its weapons are powerful enough to destroy light armored vehicles - Soviet BMP models or armored personnel carriers. However, in my opinion, it would be desirable to supplement the KPVT with a 7.62 mm machine gun for effective damage to manpower. At this time, it is not clear to me personally whether this armored car is a new production, or perhaps repaired after damage. However, the improvements were not limited to a new weapons module - the car also received a digital TV camera for the driver. The production of -Cossacks- continues. Yes, at the end of April with the participation of the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Rustem Umyerov the transfer of 40 vehicles of this type to the 225th separate assault battalion took place at once (15 Kozak-2M1 and 25 Kozak-5). In my opinion, this is a very revealing event against the background of the failure of the German company to supply 400 ordered armored vehicles of the same class. Ukrainian manufacturers manage to increase production even under the conditions of war. This fact cannot help but infuriate our enemies, because photos from this event have already been posted on anti-Russian websites. - Over the years of service, -Cossacks- have become in demand in various units of the Defense Forces. - Indeed, the family of -Cossacks- continues to grow. The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine in July notified about the codification of the medical evacuation armored car -Kozak-5MED-. Like the standard Kozak-5, it has a frame construction and uses the chassis of the Ford F550 pickup truck. The car is equipped with a 330 hp diesel engine. and automatic transmission. -Kozak-5MED- accommodates four wounded on stretchers, or six seated, as well as the driver and the personnel of the medical evacuation group. —The category of these machines for direct combat use continues to develop. What innovations are you aware of in this direction? — I would like to note that the Ukrainian Kozak-5 armored vehicles received a combat module from the company Escribano Mechanical &amp; Engineering for a 12.7-mm machine gun. The module has day and infrared cameras with autofocus, as well as a laser rangefinder. The combat module can automatically follow the target taking into account corrections and fire in several modes. — Protecting armored vehicles from combat drones today poses relevant challenges to the manufacturers and operators of BBM. What has been done to protect the crews of the armored vehicles we are discussing? - Recently, a message was published on the page of one of the domestic manufacturers about a new development - a set of protective anti-drone screens for the Kozak armored vehicles. As you can see from the photo, the design of the screens is well thought out and protects the car from all angles. It is reported that different versions of the kit developed are adapted to specific modifications of the Cossacks. The first 18 kits will be transferred to the 46th Separate Assault Brigade.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/29/kozaczkomu-rodu-nema-perevodu-yak-vdoskonalyuyut-bronovyk-kozak/	2024-11-28T21:04:35-08:00
50 thousand -British-, -The Sun- and death for Ukraine: what Valery Zaluzhnyi actually said at Inter...	The British government made this firm and factual statement on the occasion of the 1,000th day of the Russian Federation's large-scale attack on Ukraine. She quite worried the Russian propaganda, which tried to interrupt the information agenda. ArmiyaInform tells about how Russian propagandists tried to use the authority of the -Iron General- and now the Ambassador of Ukraine to Great Britain Valery Zaluzhny and the Western media with the aim of spreading anti-Ukrainian narratives. More than 50,000 Ukrainian military personnel have been trained within the framework of Operation Interflex, a training program for recruits with no or little military experience according to NATO standards on the territory of Great Britain. About reported in the Ministry of Defense of the United Kingdom. -The UK has stood shoulder-to-shoulder with our Ukrainian allies since day one of Putin's illegal full-scale invasion - providing international support, training 50,000 new recruits and supplying weapons, drones and other critical military equipment,- UK Defense Secretary John Gealey said. The press release of the Ministry of Defense of Great Britain was published on the occasion of 1000 days of large-scale war. It contains an assurance of the United Kingdom's unwavering support for Ukraine and a firm promise to help the Ukrainian people in their just struggle as much and as long as it is necessary. On the same day, British Deputy Defense Minister Luke Pollard together with Ambassador of Ukraine to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland Valery Zaluzhny met with the Ukrainian military who are training on the territory of STANTA - Stanford Training Area in the county of Norfolk in the north east of england -The training of over 50,000 Ukrainian recruits on UK soil since the start of Putin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 is an achievement that cannot be overstated,- said Luke Pollard. During the meeting, Valery Zaluzhnyi addressed the Ukrainian military personnel undergoing training with a short motivational speech. He emphasized the importance of the training mission in Great Britain for the high-quality training of the Ukrainian military and urged them to learn the main things every soldier needs here. Valery Zaluzhny's speech was generally correctly reported by the well-known British media -The Sun-, although the publication about the address to the Ukrainian military came out with a somewhat provocative headline characteristic of a tabloid: -KILL OR BE KILLED. Watch how Ukrainian troops training in Great Britain are told to -kill without hesitation- in a moving speech by the former -Iron General-. Recruits of the heroic army of Ukraine must learn to kill Russians -without hesitation-, The Sun clarified the words of the former Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The publication cited a direct quote from Valery Zaluzhny's speech: -When you see the enemy, kill him before he tries to kill you or your comrade.- The Sun also published video report about the visit of high-ranking officials to the training base on the territory of STANTA. It also contains a video recording of Valery Zaluzhny's speech to Ukrainian soldiers, which allows you to hear exactly what he said in his address to the Ukrainian military. The -Iron General- began his speech by stating that modern warfare is becoming more brutal every day and leaves very little chance of survival on the battlefield. Valery Zaluzhny emphasized that fighters should learn not to be afraid of death and bravely look the enemy in the eye. It was these words that Russian propaganda tried to falsely present as a statement that Ukrainian fighters on the battlefield seem to face only inevitable death and the only thing they should learn is the absence of fear of imminent death. This is how the Russians tried to devalue Great Britain's undeniable colossal contribution to Ukraine's support, including the training and full equipping of more than 50,000 soldiers. To promote a false thesis, the Russians traditionally resorted to the usual propaganda techniques - pulling out of context, focusing on a part of the information and silencing everything else, manipulative statements and appeals to the authority of the Western media - this time they massively referred to -The Sun-. Instead, by looking at the video recording and the full text of Valery Zaluzhny's speech, it is not difficult to make sure that he was talking about completely different things that are completely unfavorable to Russian propaganda. He called the main tasks during training in Great Britain the need to learn how to survive on the battlefield, to take care of one's own safety and to save one's comrades, and to carry out a combat mission by killing the enemy without any extra thought. The -Iron General- urged not to die, but to kill for Ukraine and to survive himself and to help a comrade in arms survive.

the Russians mirror their crimes: they invented a fake about looting in Kurshchyna	Yes, now they are reproducing a photo of a box with allegedly Russian products that fighters in the Kharkiv region received. Such a gift was apparently given to them by the military 154 OMBr from the Kursk region. However, this is not true. Ukrainian names of products are visible in the photo, they are not sold in the Kursk region. These photos were probably taken by Ukrainian volunteers to report on the aid given to the Defense Forces.

Volodymyr Zelenskyi: Putin is brandishing his -oreshnik- to frustrate Donald Trump's efforts	President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyi said this in his evening address. -He can wave his -nutcracker- now only in order to frustrate President Trump's efforts, which will definitely take place after the inauguration.

The president added that today in Kazakhstan, Putin again advertised his missiles — his readiness to kill and destroy. -Putin obviously wants to add thousands more to the thousands of missiles that have already hit Ukraine. He does not need the end of this war. Moreover, Putin wants to prevent others from ending this war,- the head of state said. He emphasized that Putin is the only culprit of this war and the only one who believes in the war. And that is why Putin's escalation now is a pressure to later force the US president to agree to Russia's terms. As ArmiyaInform reported, on November 21, the Russians hit the Dnipro with a new medium-range ballistic missile based on the older Rubezh ICBM, which is a potential carrier of a nuclear warhead.

Fighter -Luna- took part in contact battles in Maryinka and met with 9 enemy FPV drones	An interview with himappearedon the unit page. -After training in training centers, our recruits undergo additional training already in the combat zone.

How to act in the most difficult situations and under fire, how to move during the operation of enemy attack and reconnaissance drones - all this -Luna- knows not from books, but from its own, real, experience. And shares it with those who go into battle. -When we entered Maryinka, it was already difficult there. The hardest thing was not to hold the position, but to get in and out of it. Everyone mostly moved along the roads. Wherever possible, they went around houses and foundations, but mostly it was roads, and they were shot at, birds are constantly flying, constant resets,- said -Luna-. He remembered how once he and the boys left the position with two three hundredths, and the Russians, who were 154 meters away, opened fire on them. -We helped ours, ours helped ours, and it turned out as it should. Sitting with three hundred all day is not an option. And they started running. So they ran from funnel to funnel, to the first foundation, to the first building. It's hard,- he shared his memories. The paratrooper also described his first encounter with enemy FPV drones. -9 FPVs flew to us in 15 minutes. There was a structure, and a hole was punched at the bottom and, as in a dugout, a descent into the basement. And we started jumping in there, miraculously without loss. This was my first experience with these FPVs. We were used to resets then, and here half the house is gone. -Mainly the loss is due to the fact that people are not trained,- he emphasized. According to him, in order to save life, one must constantly learn. -Luna- works every day with those who join the ranks of the Tavrian paratroopers. Earlier, ArmiyaInform told about the story of a fighter with the call sign -Prytsyl-. He fights in the drone battalion air complexes of the Perun Group of the 79th Tavrian Assault Brigade.

Combined strike of the Russian Federation: the Air Force of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of ...	This was reported by the Air Force of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. -The enemy attacked critical infrastructure — electrical substations in various regions of Ukraine. Unfortunately, there is a hit,- the message reads. In addition to cruise missiles three guided air missiles and 35 enemy UAVs were shot down, more than 60 were lost in location. A total of 12 hits were recorded, mainly at the facilities of the fuel and energy sector. The PS of the Armed Forces reported that recently, during air attacks, the enemy has been using a large number of missiles and drones. Their massive use in certain directions often exceeds the number of means of cover. In addition, the enemy uses modern means of air attack, constantly improving them. It is about the firing of thermal and radar traps, and also uses EW means of personal protection installed directly on the missiles. -All this significantly complicates the operation of Soviet-made anti-aircraft missile systems that are in service with the Air Force. Western systems work much more effectively in such conditions, which in Ukraine are not sufficient to reliably cover hundreds of critical infrastructure facilities. That is why, during massive enemy attacks, maximum forces and means are used, including aviation, electronic warfare, anti-aircraft defense and mobile fire groups,- the Air Force said. It is also noted that on the eve of attacks, the enemy takes into account meteorological conditions, which significantly affect the work of mobile fire groups and fighter aircraft. Dense fog and cloud cover, which were observed in many regions at the time of the attack, did not allow the pilots and calculations of the MVG to effectively perform their tasks.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/28/kombinovanyj-udar-rf-povitryani-syly-zsu-rozpovily-detali-ta-naslidky-vorozhoyi-ataky/	2024-11-28T04:14:00-08:00

Trump, Putin and more than 220 clashes per day: an expert explains why the front is getting even hot...	Why the number of enemy assaults has increased so significantly, military expert Petro Chernyk explained to ArmiyaInform. -This is connected with major geopolitics. Putin set two clear and understandable tasks. The first task: before Trump's inauguration, seize Donetsk region at any cost, and similarly, before Trump's inauguration, knock us out of Kursk region at any cost. Does the enemy have the human potential for this? Unfortunately, there is. The total mobilization resource is within 3 million people. This is very, very much. The average figures of their conscription are somewhere in the range of up to 40,000 personnel per month. And I think that in this proportion they will continue to train themselves. Do they still have a certain margin of strength, say, in terms of armored vehicles? Let's look at the example of tanks. At the beginning of the large-scale invasion, they had 3,400 full-time vehicles, but there were still up to 10,000 in warehouses at that time, which is quite a lot. And part of the equipment we destroyed, the enemy managed to restore. Approximately the same applies to artillery. We have already destroyed more than 20,000 units. But they may still have 3,000-5,000 barrels of all calibers. However, we must understand that they cannot and will not be able to build a full-fledged artillery. The comprehensive margin of strength, which is currently calculated for the Russian Federation, is somewhere within the limits until the summer of next year. And then the real problems of both military and economic nature will begin. That is why the Russians set themselves the goal of seizing as much of our territory as possible and knocking them out of Kurshchyna. This is all we need to understand why the number of armed clashes has increased. It is extremely important for us to stay in the Kursk region until the summer, until the next cycle of dry weather. And it is extremely important that we retain Donetsk region also for the summer of next year. Then our positions in a potential conversation through intermediaries will be much stronger.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/28/tramp-putin-ta-ponad-220-boyezitknen-za-dobu-ekspert-poyasnyuye-chomu-na-fronti-staye-shhe-garyachishe/	2024-11-27T21:07:46-08:00
Soldier Mykhailiuk destroyed an enemy tank from an almost unreal distance. The history of the defend...	In civilian life, he was a builder, a loader, in the position of foreman. Currently, he is performing combat tasks as part of the calculation of anti-tank missile systems. His comrades say that he quickly navigates in extreme situations and has already destroyed more than 10 units of enemy military equipment and weapons. ArmyImform succinctly asked soldier Mykhailiuk about his path to the Defense Forces, his participation in the war, and, therefore, the approaching victory over the enemy. — I ended up in the army at a time when the long queues at the TCC stopped, and you could come calmly to the reception. On April 18, he arrived at the TCC, passed the medical examination, and already on the 19th, he left for Desna, the soldier recalls. Next is basic military training. — I already served in the army in 2008-2009 as a conscript. Therefore, I remembered, so to speak, what was once. Passed everything I knew. Nothing new. But they taught about radio communication, special devices. Everything happened in an abbreviated form. It was not difficult for me. All in all, there was plenty. The most vivid memory during the BZVP is scary, but interesting, says the soldier. — There was rocket fire, evacuation of a military unit. I was the driver - I was there -to and from- our outermost soldier from our battery. We assumed that there could be another shelling of the military unit, but, despite all the threats, we got fuel, made several walkers, took out all the people and all the things. The military destroyed more than 10 units of enemy equipment and weapons. We ask the soldier to recall the most vivid case when he managed to work on enemy equipment. Each destroyed enemy vehicle, the military officer states, is both -greasy- and -delicious.- But in October 2023, it was -as fat and tasty as possible.- — Then it was both dangerous and most interesting to beat them. Because there were so many of them, and because of that it was easy to beat them. But we had a connection, although the Russians thought that they had jammed it for us. We were completely controlled by the company. The commander was in constant contact with us. We knew how many enemy vehicles were coming. Yes, they already came in 3 pairs of deuces, 2 pairs of deuces&#8230; And we could already work for them, since we had the calculation of -Stugna- and their trophy -Cornet-, then we had a chance to do everything right. Therefore, their -Cornet- repulsed the attack. So we knew how to destroy them more easily and quickly, and that we would not get anything for it. There was excitement, it made sense to choose (enemy equipment.— Ed.). For example, 2 tanks, 2 BMPs and a trawl drove in. We immediately had the urge to destroy the trawl so that it did not pave the way for our infantry. We didn't let them get up,'' the army man recalls. But after that, he says, the enemy launched a powerful shelling with artillery and aviation: - There was a fire, it was burning, everything was in smoke, we had to change positions. But they failed to destroy us. Each combat exit and each launch is the brightest that can be, the soldier does not hide his emotions: - Nice exit, nice hit. The most interesting thing was when we destroyed their observation post. Then we had to go through a forest strip in the Swativ district, about 5 kilometers. It was approximately three kilometers through the gray zone and 2 kilometers through the red zone. They approached them, 2 km from the enemy observation post, and destroyed it. Later, he says, there was training on enemy tanks: - They came from closed positions and constantly gave nightmares to the infantry at different times. We found an enemy tank, but we couldn't get to it, it wasn't coming any closer. So we came as close as we could to get it anyway. It was a distance of 5200 - almost unreal. He was standing far from the line of scrimmage. And we destroyed him with a javelin. It was a good shot, and the detonated tank burned to the ground. Only the sides remain, and I think it is still there. We ask whether a soldier is afraid during such combat sorties, and if so, how does he cope with this fear: - Fear is in every person. But we have harmony, the commander constantly helps us. We know where we are going, what we are doing, what awaits us. That is, there is no fear as such. But when you perform a combat mission, fear disappears altogether. Yes, when they give you a short briefing and show you what you have to do, yes, there can be some fear. And when you already get into that zone, have already entered, there is no such fear at all. The mood is always fighting - in all boys, not only in me. And what would an army officer advise civilians who, for various reasons, have not yet joined the ranks of the Defense Forces? — There is nothing to be afraid of the army: there are shelling all over the country. And the sooner recruits join the army, the better it will be for our country, and the sooner we will defeat the onslaught of the horde, says Oleksandr. The military dreams of the borders of 1991: — But initially victory is when we stop the Russians and the shelling of our cities stops. And in the future, I am sure that we will reach our borders in 1991.

Blasters are already on the agenda: in the Republic of Korea, they are thinking about arming the tro...	How informs the Army Recognition portal, during the work of the international defense exhibition KADEX 2024, which took place in the Republic of Korea and united the leading players of the global arms and security industry, the development of the local firm LIG Nex1, the newest laser rifle, attracted the attention of visitors, ArmyInform reports. The manufacturing company is positioning its latest creation, which has not yet been named, as a rifle designed specifically for modern combat conditions. This compact and lightweight weapon, equipped with advanced technology, offers not only high power but also stealth, making it ideal for military operations where efficiency and stealth are important. -The rifle produces an extremely low noise level, which allows soldiers to remain invisible during operations. In addition, the low-noise cooling system maintains the optimal temperature of the weapon, preventing overheating during prolonged use,- Army Recognition experts said. Designed for easy operation by individual soldiers, the LIG Nex1 laser rifle features advanced technologies such as non-line-of-sight (NLOS) laser generation. This ability allows the fighter armed with it to hit targets that are not directly visible on the battlefield, providing a tactical advantage in the confrontation with the enemy, especially in difficult conditions where visibility is limited. Featuring high-power laser technology (one kilowatt level), this rifle combines lightness and power, offering soldiers increased efficiency without sacrificing maneuverability. Its discretion and effectiveness make this weapon an essential tool for operations that require precision and stealth. At the same time, official data on the capabilities of the laser rifle are not disclosed. The product at the exhibition was equipped with an adjustable stock, bipods and an optical sight. Shin Ik Hyun, CEO of LIG Nex1, expressed optimism about the impact of KADEX 2024 solutions. -We hope that the solutions presented at this exhibition will not only strengthen the military potential of the Republic of Korea, but also contribute to the expansion of the global presence of K-defense (South Korean arms industry),- said the Korean businessman. Founded in 1976, LIG ​​Nex1 is a South Korean company specializing in the development and production of advanced weapons systems. It offers a wide range of defense products, from precision munitions to electronic warfare systems, drones and tactical communications systems. LIG Nex1, based in Yeonin, Republic of Korea, is a major supplier to the South Korean military and also exports its technology around the world.

The Kremlin spreads the thesis that Ukraine has already lost the war: for what purpose	This was noted by the Center for Strategic Communications and Information Security. His specialists found out that The National Interest is owned by Dmitry Simes, who actively supports Russian propaganda. After 2022, he is in the Russian Federation and is accused by the US Department of Justice of violating sanctions, which carries a sentence of up to 60 years in prison. The publication has long been associated with pro-Russian views, and Symes himself moderated events organized by the Kremlin and received funding from Russian state structures. This message aims to undermine faith in the Victory of Ukraine and encourages citizens to doubt their country's ability to continue the struggle. Such rhetoric also helps to create the illusion that aid to Ukraine is futile in order to discourage Western powers from providing arms and financial support. In this way, Symes justifies further crimes by the Russians, while at the same time creating the appearance of strength and invincibility of the Russian regime for a domestic audience.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/28/kreml-poshyryuye-tezu-shho-ukrayina-vzhe-prograla-vijnu-z-yakoyu-metoyu/	2024-11-27T20:03:57-08:00

He also shared the story of how he disassembled the Msta-S long-range self-propelled gun -into molecules-. -Everyone knows that this is a very powerful weapon on the battlefield, it is long-range. When working on this target, the video shows that the radio horizon was poor. And we couldn't know for sure if we hit or not. But when the next drones flew up and saw that it was scattered into molecules,- the man recalled. In addition, -Ajax- stopped an attempt by a Russian tank to fire on Ukrainian defenders. -I myself was under fire from a tank and I understand how an infantryman feels when such equipment works on him. They contacted the eyes of someone flying there, took off, saw that it was working. They struck him. Luckily we stopped him. They wanted to go, but they couldn't because we damaged their engine. And with the next few copters, they finished off that tank,- he said.

During a meeting with the military at the newly opened center, the founder of the RECOVERY project, Viktor Pinchuk, remarked: — Do you know what I felt at this, the 15th, RECOVERY center? How much it is necessary to do everything now so that our defenders realize: the state, society and the private sector value them, now they are literally our VIPs, because the most important for the state are those who are just now at the front, and those who goes to the front - and also added: - We do everything according to the highest global standards, and there is hope that we set them for everyone: the state, other philanthropists, foreign partners. That is, the standard will be all over the country. The center was equipped according to world standards of inclusivity and technology, providing the highest level of rehabilitation for our soldiers. The complex of simulators and devices covers the entire range of possible functional disorders, in particular injuries resulting from mine and explosive injuries. Physical rehabilitation rooms are equipped with virtual reality (VR) equipment that provides feedback to the patient. Such equipment contributes to the gamification of rehabilitation processes, which, in turn, increases the intensity of training and accelerates the recovery of patients. Task-oriented exercises add motivation, and built-in analysis programs allow you to effectively monitor the patient's condition and evaluate the results of rehabilitation. In addition to VR technologies, the list of equipment equipped with the center includes bobat and massage systems, rehabilitation complexes for limbs, simulators for balance correction, joint mobilization and sling therapy. Like other centers of the chain, RECOVERY in Chernivtsi is equipped with the requirements of inclusivity of premises: wide doorways, no thresholds, medical anti-slip flooring, handrails in the corridors, sanitary rooms for people in wheelchairs and showers with seats and handrails. On the first floor of the rehabilitation center there are rooms for physical rehabilitation (large and small), an occupational therapy room, as well as rooms for physiotherapy, laser therapy, assistive technologies, psychotherapy (group and individual) and a speech therapist. In addition, there are two massage rooms, staff rooms, inventory and pharmacy rooms. The second and third floors are reserved for 22 rooms: 4 single rooms, 6 double rooms, 3 three-room rooms and 9 four-room rooms. Each ward is equipped with functional beds, inclusive bathrooms and comfortable furniture. In addition, the floors are equipped with medical stations, dining rooms and treatment rooms, which ensure comfort and quality medical care for patients. Chernivtsi OVA also joined the creation of the center in Chernivtsi, allocating funds from the regional budget, as well as territorial communities of the region. This made it possible to arrange the roof, the entrance group according to accessibility norms and to insulate the premises. — Thanks to the work of a powerful multidisciplinary team and modern equipment, we expect not only a doubling of the possibilities of providing rehabilitation assistance, but also a high level of its provision. Today, it is extremely important that the military personnel who defend our country receive timely rehabilitation assistance, - noted Vitaliy Polataychuk, head of the medical institution on the basis of which the RECOVERY center operates in Chernivtsi. RECOVERY's multidisciplinary teams consist of physical rehabilitation medicine specialists, physical therapists, occupational therapists, massage therapists, assistants, speech and language therapists, and psychologists. An individual rehabilitation plan is developed here for each injured person, and thanks to innovative equipment, patients receive high-quality and evidence-based rehabilitation care at the highest level. RECOVERY is a national network of rehabilitation centers for wounded soldiers. Today, in addition to Chernivtsi, RECOVERY rehabilitation centers provide free services in Kyiv (two facilities), Lviv, Chernivtsi, Rivne, Lutsk, Vinnytsia, Cherkassy, ​​Poltava, Khmelnytskyi, Odesa (two facilities) and in the Dnipro region (three facilities).

Medical collapse and cold batteries: the realities of Luhansk region after the occupation	This was reported by Artem Lysohor, the head of the Luhansk Regional Military Administration. According to him, residents of the region, from Kreminnaya to Sorokino, are forced to turn to medical facilities in Luhansk. The situation is complicated by the lack of doctors, especially narrow-profile specialists, which leads to the formation of long queues. In Seversko-Donetsk, problems with centralized heat supply continue. The occupation administration promises to provide heating only in the houses located near the STKE boiler house, but even in these areas, not all apartments have heat. Due to the mass absence of residents in many houses, technical difficulties arise with the supply of heat, which confirms the absence of the promised return of people to the city. As of the end of November, most of the high-rise buildings in Seversko-Donetsk remain without heating. As reported by ArmyInform, opening of a -patriotic education center- in occupied Siverskodonetsk , which the Russian occupiers planned for September 1, is postponed again. The reason for this was the delay in repair work due to the embezzlement of funds.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/27/medychnyj-kolaps-i-holodni-batareyi-realiyi-luganshhyny-pislya-okupacziyi/	2024-11-27T05:31:44-08:00

Oleksandr, the spokesman of the Third Assault Brigade, told about this on the -Suspilne Novosti- broadcast. Borodin According to Oleksandr Borodin, mass armored assaults from the Russians are not being observed. All because the fighters of the Third Assault Brigade learned quite well how to destroy the mechanized formations of the enemy even on the approaches. The enemy usually does not take risks with technology. -I think that it is one thing to restore even infantry regiments, and another thing to restore 3-4 T-90 tanks.

AviaHerostrat — in Kirovohrad Oblast, a Russian agent wanted to leave a military airfield without el...	The Security Service of Ukraine reported this on November 27. The detainee turned out to be a 21-year-old local resident who was remotely recruited by the FSB in August 2024. The young man came to the attention of the occupiers because of his pro-Kremlin comments in the Telegram channels of the aggressor country. To perform -verification- tasks, the agent collected information about the technical condition of power plants, as well as monitored the locations of military hospitals and TCC buildings. The traitor transmitted the received information to his Russian curator via messenger in the form of text messages and marking objects on Google maps. Later, the agent received a new task: to penetrate the territory of the key power station of the region and set it on fire with a flammable mixture, and then extinguish the fire. In the event of the destruction of the power facility, the occupiers promised their henchmen a monetary reward of 200 thousand. Russian rubles. SBU employees exposed the traitor in time, documented his crimes and arrested him -red-handed- when he was conducting reconnaissance near the target. At the same time, comprehensive measures were taken to secure the locations of the Defense Forces in the areas of the agent's intelligence activity. At the place of detention, a mobile phone with an anonymous chat in the messenger, which he used to communicate with the FSB, was seized from him. Investigators of the Security Service informed the defendant of the suspicion under part. 2 Art. 111 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (treason committed under martial law).

Capture or suicide: the ZSU described a portrait of a typical Russian with a white flag	Lt. Col. Nazar Voloshyn, spokesman for the Khortytsia operational-strategic group of troops, said this in a comment to ArmyInform. According to him, most of the Russian prisoners are newly mobilized. Many of them have recently undergone training on training grounds, and some are involved in assault operations and conducting reconnaissance of Ukrainian positions. Previously, a significant part of the prisoners were former prisoners who, in exchange for amnesty, joined the ranks of the Russian army, but now their number has decreased - many of them will no longer be able to return to the battlefield. In some cases, there are special forces soldiers among the prisoners. However, in general, the Russian army compensates for losses by recruiting people with financial difficulties - many new recruits and mobilized are motivated by promises of money to pay off debts or mortgages. In the Kupyan direction, as Lt. Col. Nazar Voloshyn noted, Russian units are replenished mainly with prisoners and mobilized. At the same time, cases of suicide among the occupiers due to fear of being captured were recorded. This is the result of Russian propaganda, which spreads lies about brutal torture by Ukrainians. Despite this, the zone of responsibility of the -Khortytsia- OSU is marked by numerous cases of surrender. One of the latest is the story of a Russian soldier who surrendered, saying that -it is better to live in captivity than to die at the hands of his commanders.- He reported that the Russian command threatened him with reprisals for refusing to follow orders. According to Nazar Voloshin, such cases demonstrate the demoralization of the Russian military and the complexity of the situation in their ranks. As reported by ArmyInform, -occupiers turned Bakhmut to a logistics hub-: warehouses and hospitals were placed in the city.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/27/polon-chy-samogubstvo-u-zsu-opysaly-portret-typovogo-rosiyanyna-z-bilym-praporom/	2024-11-27T03:15:37-08:00

Attack -Kedrom-: the expert explained why Putin hit the Dnipro	Oleksandr Musienko, manager, told about this on the broadcast of the -Edyny Novyny- marathon. of the Center for Military Legal Studies. According to Oleksandr Musienko, the Russian dictator's threats are truly unprecedented - this type of weaponry was not used even during the Cold War. However, the Russian dictator still fears a conflict with NATO. -The strike was on the city of Dnipro, that is, away from the borders directly with the North Atlantic Alliance. He did not hit the west of our country, and the missile did not fly there. That is, he was still wary and afraid of provoking a certain reaction from the West,- Oleksandr Musienko is confident. This proves that the launch of a new ballistic missile, states Musienko, is nothing but another element of the Russian dictator's nuclear blackmail. Earlier ArmyInform told that as of October of this year, Russia was supposed to produce two experimental rocket samples from the Kedr missile complex.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/27/ataka-kyedrom-ekspert-poyasnyv-chomu-putin-udaryv-same-po-dnipru/	2024-11-27T01:17:34-08:00

A recidivist and 4 fools — a group of Russian miners-terrorists was detained in Zhytomyr Oblast	The Security Service of Ukraine reported this on November 27. On November 20, agents of the Russian Federation committed a terrorist attack in the central part of Zhytomyr. Then, as a result of the explosion, one law enforcement officer who was at the scene was injured. According to the case materials, the perpetrators acted on the orders of the Russian special services, which recruited them through Telegram channels in search of -quick money.- To commit a terrorist attack, the perpetrators remotely set off an improvised explosive device near the building of the local police district administration. According to the instructions of the Russian curators, they filled the explosives with nails and disguised them in a thermos, and detonated them -remotely- using a mobile phone.

In the trunk to Poland: another illegal voyage failed	About this informs State Border Service of Ukraine. During the inspection of a regular bus bound for Poland, two men were found in the luggage compartment. They were hidden in a specially equipped hiding place to avoid border control. The offenders were a 23-year-old resident of Kharkiv and a 38-year-old resident of Ternopil, who had no legal grounds for leaving Ukraine. Two bus drivers, residents of Volyn, tried to smuggle them across the border illegally. Regarding passengers, administrative protocols were drawn up under Art. 204-1 of the Criminal Procedure Code (-Illegal crossing of the state border of Ukraine-). Criminal proceedings were instituted against the drivers under Art. 332 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (-Illegal transportation of persons across the state border-). Suspicion was announced to them.

Propagandists launched an anti-Ukrainian article in the media: why are they in Greece?	On November 26, the site -Banking news- with a reach of 6.5 million users in Greece published article with just a wild set of Russian narratives. It is dedicated to the so-called -Ukrainian nationalist battalions -Azov-, -Aidar-, -Kraken- and others-, the destruction of which, in the opinion of Greek propagandists this time, is -one of the main goals of the Russian invasion of Ukraine-. In the material, the Greek pseudo-journalists quote the sanctioned ex-deputy of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine Spyridon Kilinkarov, Russian military analysts Oleksandr Sharkovsky and Oleksandr Perendzhiev. They accuse units of the Armed Forces of various war crimes typical of daily Russian propaganda. The material was obviously made at the behest of Russia and is spreading through the Greek-speaking segment of the Internet with the clear aim of discrediting Ukraine, the Defense Forces of our country and specific units. Such publications are made to undermine the confidence of foreigners in Ukraine and to reduce their support. In October, the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyi, and the Prime Minister of Greece, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, signed the Security Cooperation Agreement in Brussels, which confirms Greece's readiness to continue providing the most urgent defense needs of Ukraine. Therefore, such information -leaks- specifically in Greece can be directed against a specific security agreement.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/27/propagandysty-zapustyly-v-media-antyukrayinsku-stattyu-nashho-cze-yim-u-grecziyi/	2024-11-26T21:57:01-08:00

Will South Korea enter the war on the side of Ukraine: expert's opinion	-At the beginning of November, everyone admitted that the North Korean military was on the territory of the Russian Federation and may even have taken part in hostilities. We had first very cautious assessments, then we had positive assessments. Now we will receive them in doses, because this information still has a great political and diplomatic weight. Therefore, it will not appear quickly. Some will try to hide it, but we will try to get it as soon as possible, use it as soon as possible. The question now will be whether international institutions are ready to do something about it. As we can see from the latest reaction of most international organizations, unfortunately, they are not ready to act according to even their own statutes. That is, how they should react to Russian aggression, how they should react to Iran's actions, how they should react to North Korea's actions, no one is reacting. Therefore, now the North Korea factor, most likely, will be the catalyst that the world order that exists, those interstate organizations that exist, will be forced to change their approaches to events and to their activities. As for the reaction of other countries, in particular, South Korea, here it is necessary to know their military doctrine, how it should react to North Korea's indirect aggression against another state. But we are already seeing the -first swallows- appearing in the international space. We know that North Korea will also demand the participation of a Russian contingent in a possible war against South Korea. I don't think South Korea is very excited about that prospect. After all, the Russian army is absolutely different. There are units that we despise, but there are also units that give us a huge amount of trouble. And South Korea, the United States of America, and NATO also understand this very well. So the activity of other countries will depend on how well their doctrinal documents correspond to the existing situation, on the one hand, and on the other hand, how ready the military-political leadership of other countries is to react to the situation that is emerging.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/27/chy-vstupyt-pivdenna-koreya-u-vijnu-na-boczi-ukrayiny-dumka-eksperta/	2024-11-26T21:07:20-08:00
More than 150 shots per day: CAESAR crushes Russians in Donetsk region. Reportage	We arrive at the specified point, where the gunners are already waiting for us. Just like us, in body armor and helmets. Because it can already fly here. - Follow us. We pull into the position, unload, our car drives away. Then you stop by. Here the safety rules are written in blood, so it is better not to break them. Let's go. We will drive past the mines. Some were destroyed by the arrivals, others continue to work, despite the approach of the front. From time to time, towering tericonas are visible from the road. Fields between them. The harvest from them has been collected, but the winter crops have not been planted. Apparently, local farmers are waiting for what will be here in the spring. The road is getting worse, there are more and more potholes, as well as tracks of heavy equipment. We turn around at one of the landings, drive through the field. The front car stops, passengers get out of it, the car starts. Next, we will land. We enter the landing, among the trees we see the CAESAR self-propelled gun, hidden under a canopy made of a metal mesh, on which a camouflage net is draped. We are met by the gun crew. Her commander, sergeant Andrii, is of medium height and wiry. He has a phone and a tablet, necessary for combat work, sticking out behind the automatic stores on his body armor. We welcome you. Andrei says that he is waiting for the goal. If we're lucky and the target is there, we'll go to the fireground and see CAESAR in action. Meanwhile, Andriy talks about his gun. — Before that, I fought on the Soviets: -Hyacinti-B-, D-20, -Vsti-B- and I can say that CAESAR, if compared with them, is like -Mercedes- and -Zhiguli-. - What is its greatest advantage? - It is maneuverable. On CAESAR, you arrive at the firing line, lay down in a minute, quickly work and drive away, and you don’t wait to see if it will fly in response or not, as is the case with trailed guns. And it's coming fast now. Both -Lancets- and FPV drones began to fly far, and enemy artillery, and now also KABs were added. So speed becomes an important advantage. - And what, do you actually have time to spread out in a minute? - You will see for yourself if there is a goal. In this regard, CAESAR works clearly. We arrived at the place, the gunner entered the coordinates, so we are ready to shoot. - And what was the highest rate of fire you had in practice? - The same as in TTX, 6 shots per minute. You can't do it faster than the manufacturer's set, because there are a lot of sensors that you can't fool. But there is no need, because here everything is done for the safety of shooting. And conveniences. The same automatic loader helps a lot, because you don't need to stuff the shells with your hands, and they weigh a lot. Once our CAESAR was under repair and we were working on a domestic gun. I manually loaded 18 rounds and tore a muscle in my stomach. So, if offered, would never change CAESAR to anything else. CAESAR has a crew of four. According to French standards, there should be 5 of them, but then it is too cramped in the cabin, which for the crew is their native home, especially now that it has become cold. They joke that they take off their shoes when they enter the cabin. — When I worked at the towed artillery, we had to constantly dig dugouts nearby so that there was a place to live and hide during shelling. CAESAR with its armored cabin is much more comfortable in this sense. - Have there been such approaches when the armor protected? Ironically, it is at this very moment that a rather loud -babah- is heard. Whether it's a departure or an arrival, I involuntarily bend over, the gunners just look around. — Once a -Lancet- flew at us, hit the roller. We had minor injuries, one of the hoses broke, but the car was not damaged, the damage was quickly repaired and we continued to work. Andriy and his crew work on the older version of CAESAR (produced in 2007), they say that they would not like to switch to the new one. — Because the new one is much larger: there are four axles instead of three, it is longer and higher, it is difficult to hide it in the landing, you have to dig a much larger caponir, and it is not so maneuverable. And there are much more electronics there, which increases the probability of some kind of breakdown. Of course, something can break in us too, because we work actively, and this is iron, it is not eternal. But we repair something on the spot, our repairmen trained in France work with something, and the enterprise that provides maintenance is already engaged in serious repairs. - There is a stereotype that Western equipment is too poor for the conditions of our war. - It all depends on service. If it's serviced well, it works well. CAESAR is a gentle machine. But if you take care of it correctly, follow all the rules for maintenance, then it works well. Andriy finally gets the coordinates of the target. — Two shells, we are working to ban actions. This is when enemy activity is detected, fire is placed on that area to force them to abandon their plans. — We are leaving for the firing position! The crew gets into the cockpit, the CAESAR quickly moves out of hiding and heads to the pre-equipped firing position. There are several such positions, they are constantly changed to confuse the enemy and prevent him from hitting. According to Andrii, his CAESAR often takes part in counter-battery combat, that is, strikes at enemy artillery. — We work on absolutely everything: from jet artillery to barrel artillery. We worked against both -Hyacinta- and -Msty-, we reach everything. We also hit mortars, anti-aircraft guns, even anti-aircraft systems. In the Vugledara area, they once worked on the Strela air defense system. It is clear that we are hitting and being hit, so we need to act quickly. CAESAR unexpectedly pulls into a forest strip. At first it seems that it is going straight to the trees, but then you notice a carefully cut gap in the wall of the trunks. CAESAR fits perfectly into it and falls under the arch of trees that cover from above. The crew leaves the cabin. The gunner turns on the computer and lowers the hydraulic plate, which provides a stop during firing. The driver prepares the gunpowder needed to hit the targets, and the loader programs the detonators, which are wound onto the projectile. The gun commander dictates the coordinates of the target, the gunner enters them into the computer. The barrel of the gun is raised and aimed. The branches in front of him are cut so as not to interfere with the projectile. CAESAR is ready to fire in exactly one minute. Second to second. - Fire! — Shot! If it wasn't for the headphones, it would have been very loud. The next projectile is already on the loading machine, which delivers it into the barrel of the gun. Followed by gunpowder, shutter closes. - Fire! — Shot! Another -babah-. Already dry leaves begin to fall picturesquely from the trees. However, the crew is not into romance. The plate rises, the barrel lowers, the computer near the gun turns off. And now CAESAR is rapidly leaving the firing position. The enemy has almost no chance to hit him in response. They just don't have time. —Mr. Andriy, what is the record for shots per day? — The maximum shot per day was 153 shots. But it is very difficult. Health minus 1. Now we are steadily firing 60 shells a day, sometimes up to 90. — But CAESAR ammunition is only 18 shells. — Yes. So we shot them, drove off and reloaded, we continue to work. — But 153 shells, that’s 9 rounds per day! — I mean, it’s difficult. — And how often do you have to change the barrel with such intensity of shooting? — It all depends on its condition. This barrel has already fired 4,000 rounds. But its condition is normal, we just take into account the correction for wear. We have such barrels that fired 6,000 shells each. Our specialists will check for wear, if it is significant, then the barrel is replaced with a new one provided by the French manufacturer. - This is the first barrel on your car? - What about you, the barrels of all the guns have already been changed three or even four times. Because we work every day, without days off. - And what is the maximum firing range? - We had 41 kilometers, it is an active-reactive projectile. Usually, we work on targets at a distance of 14 to 36 kilometers. - Have you been working with cluster ammunition for a long time? - Yes, a few days ago. We shoot them regularly. - What about the famous American -Excaliburs-? - Many used to work. And worked very well. In 2023, when the enemy was advancing on Vugledar in the winter, we fired 52 Excaliburs in one day. This is a very good projectile. Because if you work with ordinary projectiles, you need 2-3 shots for close range. And -excalibur- shot one - and it hit the target exactly. CAESAR returns to its hideout in the landing area, where it will await new targets. During the day, the guys can rest a bit, because most of their shooting is at night. I ask for permission to hold the projectile in my hands. It weighs over 40 kilograms. I take it in my hands and understand that, even with the presence of a charging mechanism, the work of the charger is not easy. We photograph the crew against the background of his car: Andriy is the commander, Yevgeny is the gunner, Kyrylo is the driver, Bohdan is the loader. For those who don't know, CAESAR is an acronym for the French CAmion Equipé d'un Système d'ARtillerie, meaning -truck equipped with an artillery system.- This truck causes a lot of trouble for the enemy and helps our infantry a lot. We wish the boys success and good luck in their difficult but necessary combat work. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/27/ponad-150-postriliv-za-dobu-caesar-troshhyt-rosiyan-na-donechchyni-reportazh/	2024-11-26T20:57:56-08:00
Autocivilka for UBD: what will change in 2025	According to article 13 of the Law, participants in hostilities, persons with disabilities as a result of the war, who personally drive their own vehicles, are exempted from mandatory civil liability insurance on the territory of Ukraine. That is, it is not necessary to issue anything. There must be documents for a car and a UBD certificate or a person with a disability due to war. But already from January 1, 2025, you will have to issue a driver's license. Article 13 of the Law suffered certain changes. And now there are no categories of citizens who are exempt from compulsory insurance. In return, combatants will receive a discount. In particular, for them, -the amount of the insurance premium under the domestic insurance contract is reduced by 50 percent.- But there are also certain nuances. The discount is provided for a vehicle that has an engine displacement of up to 2500 cubic centimeters or an electric motor power of up to and including 100 kilowatts and is owned by a combatant /strong>, provided that such vehicle is driven exclusively by the insured or by a person who also owns to preferential categories, and using a vehicle without the purpose of providing paid services for the transportation of passengers and/or cargo. Another important point is that the amendments to the Law indicate that the reduction of the insurance premium can be applied at the same time only regarding one vehicle of the insured.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/27/avtoczyvilka-dlya-ubd-shho-zminytsya-u-2025-roczi/	2024-11-26T20:46:59-08:00
Seven years to the goal: in Turkey, the development of a mortar system with the possibility of 360° ...	As indicates the official portal of the manufacturer, this advanced system combines high accuracy, mobility and versatility, which makes it an effective weapon for various types of combat missions, ArmiyaInform reports. The SM-81 Keskin mortar is equipped with an 81 mm barrel with a length of 1.453 meters and a manual vertical slide. The system provides full circular horizontal firing (360 degrees) and an elevation range of −5 to +82 degrees, which is manually controlled by pointers. A hydropneumatic recoil system is installed above the barrel to soften recoil. Depending on the type of ammunition, the firing range is from 100 to 6,000 meters. Shots are fired through the trigger mechanism, which allows precise control of fire. The SM-81 Keskin mortar supports both direct and indirect guidance. For direct fire, the system is equipped with a six-fold day sight, a thermal imaging camera and a laser rangefinder, which ensures accuracy of aiming at distances up to 6 thousand. meters Experts of the defense portal Army Recognition note that when firing with an indirect with guidance, the system is loaded from the muzzle and supports two options for firing: the normal mode, when the projectile falls on the fixed trigger pin, and the trigger fire, in which the striker is activated by the trigger. If the angle of the barrel is less than 30 degrees when firing with a direct aim, the system allows loading from the breech, which expands its tactical capabilities. The SM-81 Keskin is compatible with various types of standard 81mm ammunition, including high-explosive, smoke, and illumination rounds. To improve shooting accuracy and simplify control, the system has a 10.1-inch screen that displays a digital map and ballistic calculations for elevation correction and horizontal guidance. In addition, GPS/INS technologies are implemented in the system, which ensure more accurate hitting of targets even in difficult conditions. The total weight of the mortar system is 450 kg, which allows it to be installed on light trucks for high mobility on the battlefield. The diameter of the system's pedestal is 770 mm, and its height varies from 1005 mm to 1980 mm depending on the position of the barrel. In addition to being mounted on vehicles, the SM-81 Keskin mortar can be used for stationary defense of bases or other key facilities. One of the main advantages of the SM-81 Keskin is the ability to fire 360 ​​degrees without reorientation between shots. This significantly reduces the time to prepare for firing and reduces vulnerability to counter-battery fire. The system is optimized for mobile deployment and high rate of fire, making it an essential element for modern warfare that requires flexibility and precision. Specialists of the iNEWS portal underline the fact that at the level of SM-81 localization Keskin is a cost-effective solution. More than 90% of the parts and components of the mortar system were designed and manufactured by Turkish contractors. The SM-81 Keskin system is an important addition to the arsenal of today's armed forces, providing high firepower, flexibility and reliability. Its mobility, accuracy and ability to be used in various scenarios make it an effective tool for both defensive and offensive operations. SM-81 Keskin 81mm Mortar System.

MARCH is on the march: the cadets underwent an intensive 16-hour training in takmed	All conditions are created here for high-quality and fast training of combat medics, paramedics and soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. -The cadets take the basic ASM (All service members) course with us, which is coordinated with the current Ukrainian standard of providing first aid. Here, they have the opportunity to hone their knowledge and skills directly during simulations of injuries and combat injuries, taking into account all the stress factors that accompany them,- says Diana, head of the tactical medicine center. Training takes place in full compliance with the MARCH first aid protocol (Massive bleeding, Airway Management, Respiration, Circulation, Head injury / Hypothermia / Hypovolemia) in all possible phases: -red-, -shelter-, -evacuation-. The training itself lasts 16 hours over two days. Each cadet practices this protocol independently. For this, models are used, or another cadet plays the role of the wounded. Certain marks simulate wounds (injuries) of varying complexity, according to the nature of which certain methods and means of assistance are used. Simulation of combat conditions helps cadets feel real responsibility and practice the skills of using various auxiliary medical devices (tourniquets, decompression needles, occlusive stickers, hemostatic bandages, etc.). It is also extremely important to take coordinated actions in the shortest possible time during the organization and evacuation of the wounded. In general, during the training, future officers must master the CLS (Combat Life Savior) level, which corresponds to the functionality of a medical marksman. Training takes place under the supervision of experienced combat medics. The principle -train as you will fight- applies - it educates the cadets' endurance and prepares them for actions in extreme combat situations, where the ability to save one's life and the life of a comrade is one of the most important tasks. -We work according to the MARCH protocol. First, we examine for the presence of massive bleeding, then we work with consciousness and breathing problems, tamponate, glue and carry out evacuation,- says cadet Mykola about the basic course of tactical medicine. Testing and awarding of certificates are ahead. And one more step towards receiving the rank of -lieutenant- will be taken.

What are the advantages of the corps-brigade system: an expert on the new concept of reorganization ...	This may also mean how much the military management system will improve, said military expert Petro Chernyk: -We have a major combat unit, a brigade. However, we understand that the brigade does not fight by itself, considering the fact that we have a huge section of the front with a total length of about a thousand kilometers. Some number of brigades are fighting. The next control body that appears is the so-called tactical group, which can include 7-8 combat brigades. This is where the first problem appears. The command of the tactical group is a collective mess. This is not a permanent unit, it is temporary. There is a constant rotation of officers, which can actually reduce the quality of combat management of such large units. Therefore, we came to the conclusion that a full-time corps should be organized.- A corps can be anywhere from 4 to 7 brigades with the entire command network deployed. Why did they bypass the division link? A divisional unit is 3-4 brigades and is a duplicating body. There, again, a bunch of commanders, a bunch of operatives are needed there, they will be engaged in nothing but dubbing of the corps link. Could it have gone the divisional route? No. In my opinion, this is counterproductive. The conditional corps is 6-7 brigades. These are two divisions. So, instead of one corps level, there would be two divisional levels, which in the end creates a shortage of officers for such a large number of troops. What is the world practice? And so and so. Let's say the United States has the 101st Scalloping Eagles. But it is more of a historical character, because the divisional system justified itself well in the Second World War. But there are nuances. Both the Soviet Union, Nazi Germany, and the Allies had such a gigantic number of troops, so they could afford it. We cannot afford it. Plus, we understand that this is also funding for a potential division link.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/26/u-chomu-plyusy-systemy-korpus-brygada-ekspert-pro-novu-konczepcziyu-reorganizacziyi-zbrojnyh-syl-ukrayiny/	2024-11-25T21:03:16-08:00
From the police to the Armed Forces: the instructor - Oak - told why every policeman should pass the...	ArmyInform, a military officer spoke about the choice of each police officer, the danger of a logical trap due to euphoria or despair when consuming information about the war from the media, as well as why every adult citizen of Ukraine is obliged to pass the BZVP. Dub met the large-scale invasion in the ranks of the National Police. Took part in military operations on the territory of Zhytomyr and Kyiv regions. After the enemy was pushed beyond the borders of Zhytomyr and Kyiv regions, he resigned from the National Police and joined the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Subsequently, -Dub- took part in military operations in the Zaporizhzhia, Kherson, and Donetsk regions. In particular, he fought in the Bakhmut direction in the areas of Avdiivka, Klishchiivka, and Kurdyumivka. — I was injured there, after which I learned to walk again. And after rehabilitation, I was offered a position at a training center so that I could share my practical experience and teach as many new recruits as possible to perform their duties well, says the instructor. He adds that at that time he was not sure that he would be able to perform combat tasks due to his health, so he decided to transfer. Now, after recovery, he again submitted a report for transfer to a combat unit. — Some of my former police colleagues also joined the ranks of the Armed Forces, others continue to serve in the National Police. This is a worthy choice, because if all police officers resign and go to the Armed Forces, then there will be chaos in the rear. -Policemen in the rear are necessary,- says the soldier, answering a question about whether all police officers should go to war. He adds that training as a police officer is not enough to immediately become a soldier. -Oak- points out that the specifics of the work of the National Police in the rear, and even of the special police officers, are the detention of small groups of criminals armed with small arms and the release of hostages, and not at all combat operations inherent in modern warfare. — The level of training of National Police employees is not comparable to the level required in the Armed Forces. The skills and abilities of a police officer are not enough to participate in combat operations using FPV drones, artillery, tanks and other numerous means of fire damage that they want to kill you with, the military emphasizes. He is convinced that police officers need just as much intensive training during BZVP as anyone else. After all, modern war requires fundamentally different knowledge, abilities and skills than even special police officers from specialized units have. So police officers have to retrain and relearn a lot. — Being -at zero-, I would not want to worry that something bad might happen to my family. Therefore, I rely on my police colleagues who continue to serve in the rear. Their work and labor is also needed, -Dub- emphasizes. However, at the same time, he notes that rear-line policemen must be trained for combat operations even if they continue to serve in the rear. — In my personal opinion, it may well happen when they will also have to become servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, will have to take up weapons, not just automatic weapons. Therefore, all Ukrainians should receive at least minimal military training, the instructor is convinced. Similarly, he believes, basic general military training of all civilians should be provided. This does not mean that everyone who has it will go to the front or even serve in the Armed Forces. However, everyone should have a minimum set of knowledge and skills in order to be able to defend Ukraine in case of need. -Oak- explains its position with personal experience. He is convinced that the availability of basic knowledge helped him a lot in the first months of the great war, becoming the basis for the further acquisition and improvement of the abilities and skills of a serviceman. — I expected that I would have to defend Ukraine with weapons in my hands, and I was preparing for it, because I understood that a big war would definitely happen. He tried to learn, learn information about weapons, about the tactics of action in small groups, studied topography, orientation on the terrain. He prepared little by little, he says. That is why everyone should be at least minimally prepared for hostilities, because with such a neighbor as the Russian Federation, there will always be a danger of new aggression and renewed hostilities. - Now our population has relaxed, started to lose the sense of danger that was in the first months of the large-scale invasion. It seems to many that the war is somewhere far away, and therefore will not affect them personally. It is very dangerous to think like that, - the former policeman is convinced, because the war is actually very close, and has already affected, and continues to determine the life of every Ukrainian. -Dub- puts a significant share of responsibility for this attitude of Ukrainians towards the war on the media and the state information policy aimed at reassuring people and the promise of a quick end to the war and easy victories. — -Two or three weeks, two or three months - and we will win. We have liberated Kherson and will soon enter the Crimea!-. After hearing this, people began to believe that they are no longer needed in the army, because what is the point of changing your life, joining the army, if victory will soon come without you? he asks rhetorically. Due to excessive optimism in the presentation of information about the war, Ukrainians began to distance themselves from the topic of the war and stopped following what was happening at the front. Because they believed that the Armed Forces of Ukraine would handle everything perfectly without their personal involvement. And then there was a -distortion- in the opposite direction - they began to tell that everything was bad and that Russia was still winning. Therefore, people began to get the impression that their participation would not change anything. In fact, the military man is convinced, only the joint efforts of the entire society, the entire country — all Ukrainians and women need to make efforts to win. - Many people are afraid to join the army because they believe that they will be thrown into the trenches, and they will, let's say, always sit in the trenches - in the mud, in the mud, in the cold. It's not like the army is functioning at all, a lot of specialists are needed, including logistics, clerks, cooks, drivers, and repairmen, the instructor explains. Therefore, in the Armed Forces there will be a place for everyone within the limits of his specialty and abilities. The decision to join the army, he believes, does not mean the end of life, but rather becomes a new stage in it. The extent to which a recruit will be able to realize himself in the Armed Forces will depend on him. - This is what I tell the servicemen who come to our unit for training - that they need to learn, to be able to do everything. But I draw their attention to the fact that not all of them will necessarily become stormtroopers or fight on the front lines, the instructor explains. At the same time, everyone who joins the army must pass the BZVP, because there can always be an urgent need to join the battle for everyone - as it was in February 2022, when everyone stood in lines for weapons, regardless of civilian profession and having military experience. - In 2022, no one paid attention to the civilian profession - it was necessary to take up arms and defend one's land. Because of this, basic general military training is now conducted to ensure that everyone has general combat skills. Then the fighters are sent to professional training depending on where they will be assigned, -Dub- explains. He emphasizes that, already during the BZVP at the training center, the instructors find out what education, skills and skills the recruits have from their previous civilian experience. This allows them to be recommended for exactly those positions where they can be most effective in the ranks of the Armed Forces, and therefore useful for the defense of Ukraine. — We can make recommendations to which position to assign a particular serviceman in order to make the most effective use of their skills that they have acquired throughout their lives working in civilian professions, so that they can be as effective as possible in the ranks of the Armed Forces, the instructor says. — We communicate directly with the brigades of the airborne assault troops that are on the front line, we exchange training recommendations. They make certain corrections, recommendations on training, on the necessary practical or theoretical knowledge that is actually needed on the front line, - says -Dub-. Thanks to this, the training is structured in such a way as to give the maximum necessary knowledge and not to overload the cadet with secondary information, not to take his time and energy for unnecessary things that will not be needed during the service. - From the statutes, we study only the most necessary, and we almost completely reject military training, since there is no practical need for it. We have instructors and officers with combat experience, they understand very well what is needed, what knowledge needs to be invested, - explains the instructor. He notes that the BZVP is the foundation on which each soldier will then be able to build his knowledge depending on the needs of his future position in the ranks of the Armed Forces. - My conscience does not allow me to teach them badly, because their lives depend on how I teach them. If one of them gets injured or dies in the future, I take it on my own account in the sense that I did not teach them well, that I did not give them a certain amount of information, a certain amount of theoretical or practical skills, did not motivate, did not brought something necessary, - says -Oak-. Currently, the soldier is already completing rehabilitation and has submitted a report for transfer to a combat position, because he believes that soon he will be able to be more effective on the front line. — My rehabilitation is already coming to an end, I understand for myself that I am ready to perform combat tasks, that I can lead people with me. Therefore, I am preparing to be transferred or seconded to a combat brigade in the near future, and there to perform my duties directly on the battlefield.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/26/z-policziyi-do-zsu-instruktor-dub-rozpoviv-chomu-kozhen-policziyant-maye-projty-bzvp/	2024-11-25T20:50:12-08:00
All-weather beam-protector: a high-energy laser weapon system was presented to the US Army	As stated in the annotation to this project, the text of which posted on the official portal of the developer firm, FIREFLY is designed to combat the growing asymmetric threats associated with with unmanned systems, and is a significant technological breakthrough in the field of air defense, ArmyInform reports. The system has a mobile and pallet (for stationary deployment) design with a modular architecture and scalable power (from 5 kW to 40 kW), specially designed to protect forward positions and critical infrastructure. The FIREFLY combat mechanism (-Svitlyak-, -Svitlyachok- in Ukrainian) is designed on the basis of a universal open architecture, optimized to balance performance, reliability, serviceability and portability. Thanks to modular replaceable units (LRUs), the system adapts to a wide range of operational applications and provides the flexibility to configure, customize and upgrade its capabilities as needs arise. This design allows FIREFLY to interact with C3S computer systems, such as FAAD (Forward Area Air Defense, -Forward Area Air Defense- - Ukrainian) and MEDUSA (Advanced Technology System for Small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) and other autonomous detection systems (such as radars and optical sensors). The modular structure also facilitates maintenance at the intermediate and field levels, reducing operating costs by using low-cost, commercially available components. To provide target tracking, FIREFLY is equipped with an ISR (surveillance systems) payload, which includes independent visible and infrared surveillance systems, as well as advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities for remote threat detection and classification. One of the key advantages of this system, according to the experts of the Army Recognition defense portal, is its ability to work continuously for a long time. This allows the FIREFLY to neutralize multiple targets without the need for frequent reloads or reloads. Such indicators are critical when fending off massive attacks from multiple drones or other similar aerial threats. FIREFLY's functionality has undergone 34 months of rigorous testing, demonstrating its adaptability in challenging environments, including testing in temperatures from −15°C to 35°C, as well as challenging weather conditions such as heavy rain, snow, and sandstorms. The weapon was deployed on both fixed and unprepared sites, which confirmed its adaptability and ease of transport and deployment. This high-energy laser system is designed to be cost-effective with minimal logistical support thanks to simplified maintenance processes. KORD specialists focused on reducing production costs and delivery times by using commercially available components, ensuring increased reliability and rapid availability of fully ready-to-deploy units. FIREFLY is offered on competitive commercial terms, making it the perfect solution for armed forces that require modern, ready-to-deploy defense technology. The increasing use of drones in modern warfare is radically changing the battlefield, creating new threats that require innovative countermeasures. These include directed energy (DE) weapons, particularly lasers, which stand out for their accuracy and effectiveness. These technologies are becoming important tools to counter unmanned aerial systems (UAS), which play an increasingly important role in today's conflicts. UAVs pose a significant threat to military personnel and equipment. Their low production cost, ability to transport various payloads, and reduced risk of injury to operators make them particularly attractive to both state and non-state actors. Recent conflicts, such as those in Ukraine, Yemen and Gaza, have highlighted the growing importance of drones in military operations. In response to this growing threat, the military is investing heavily in counter-UAS systems (CUAS), where laser technologies, with their rapid target neutralization capabilities and long-term cost-effectiveness, will play a central role in defense strategies.

The fifth wave — higher than two meters: - Book flood - will sweep through Ukraine and distribute mo...	This is the fifth wave of the initiative launched in 2015, shortly after the beginning of the open armed aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine. As before, it is aimed at popularizing reading and supporting libraries from different regions of Ukraine - both front-line and those that sheltered many forced migrants. This time, as part of the -Book Rush-, more than 31,000 books will be transferred to Ukrainian libraries, including books for children and teenagers, Ukrainian classics and modern literature of various genres, translations of foreign authors, popular science literature and books about the war experience, works of veterans and volunteers. The co-organizers of the -Book Rush- told the correspondent of ArmiyaInform about the action. — The National Military Historical Museum of Ukraine is a museum of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine system, a military museum. When we learned that the fifth wave of the -Book Rush- action would take place, we offered to join it, says Yuriy Bilous, deputy director of the National Military Historical Museum of Ukraine. In particular, a small exhibition was placed at the entrance to the museum, which presents all the books that will be transferred to libraries within the initiative. - This is necessary so that anyone can see the total volume of collected books. After all, there will be 300 sets of 100 books each, which will be distributed to the libraries of Kharkiv, Sumy, Poltava, Mykolaiv, Ivano-Frankivsk and Volyn regions, he explains. It is important for people to see this volume visually, because the information about 100 books that will be transferred to each library is a certain abstraction. When you collect the books together on one shelf or put them in a stack, it is already a small library of modern Ukrainian literature. - One hundred books is a lot. If it is conventionally assumed that each book is at least two centimeters thick, then the height of a column of stacked books will be more than two meters, says the deputy director of the National Military Historical Museum. Several books from the collected list relate in one way or another to military topics, talk about the modern Russian-Ukrainian war - an aggressive war on the part of the Russian Federation and a just defensive war on the part of Ukraine. - Since we are a military museum, together with the organizers of -Book Rush- we paid special attention to this, - explains Yuriy Bilous. However, since the selection is intended primarily for the average mass Ukrainian reader, the share of books on military topics is not decisive in it. In view of this, in addition to the basic standard set of books for libraries, the organizers plan to create a special selection of books specifically for the military. — There are many children's books, books for teenagers, which are less needed by the military. Therefore, there will be a separate list specifically for adults, for the military, he says. The museum owner invites everyone to visit the National Military History Museum of Ukraine, because in it you can not only see with your own eyes books from the fifth wave of the -Book Flood-, but also get acquainted with unique exhibits from the history of the Ukrainian military. — This is the fifth wave of the -Book Rush- launched by the -Information Resistance- group. The first took place back in 2015. Then, in addition to our usual activities - monitoring the situation, identifying and investigating security risks, countering aggression against Ukraine in the information sphere, we also decided to pay more attention to communication with people -on the ground-, - says the coordinator of the -Information Resistance- group. historian and museum expert Oleksiy Kopytko. One of the effective options was cooperation with libraries and the dissemination of modern Ukrainian literature, organization of scientific and educational events. — At first, emphasis was placed on literature of a historical profile. Our first waves of actions were connected with books about the Holodomor, with the distribution of the ten-volume popular science book -History without censorship- from the public educational project to popularize the history of Ukraine -likbez. Historical front-. Instead, we have now put together a universal kit aimed at popularizing Ukrainian books and reading in general, he explains. The demand from libraries for new literature, which is catastrophically lacking, is very high. Books are needed by all readers of all ages, so in the fifth wave of the -Book Rush- they tried to please every taste and preference. - This is children's literature, which includes both new classics and works on the school curriculum. It is also scientific popular literature, including several encyclopedias of a natural nature. This is literature for teenagers, this is what is called -non-fiction- - modern and classic Ukrainian and translated literature, says Oleksiy Kopytko. — A separate block consists of books related to understanding the experience of modern war. This is an experience of different regions - there are books about Okhtyrka, several books about Kharkiv, about Kherson. We want to collect such a palette of books that make up a certain -military- kit for any reader, - explains the coordinator of -Information Resistance-. Having received such a universal set, the library will be able to offer different groups of readers the latest Ukrainian publications that will be of interest to them. — Since the resources are quite limited and, so to speak, not comparable to the need, we decided to focus primarily on several regions from the East and South of Ukraine. First of all, these are Kharkiv, Sumy, Poltava and Mykolaiv regions. We also included two regions of Western Ukraine — Volynsk and Ivano-Frankivsk, because many people moved from the East and found shelter that way, as well as in the central regions, he says. Also, the -Information Resistance- group establishes contacts with the training centers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. There you need literature for conducting classes - about weapons, about battle tactics, publication of motivational and psychological content, etc. — We are now preparing to form a certain set of books that will go to educational centers with an orientation primarily to instructors. We started a certain dialogue in order to understand what they specifically need and what is needed as a priority, because the needs are huge and it is necessary to understand the best way to ensure them, Oleksiy Kopytko said. public libraries, is already rolling across Ukraine. Organizers have completed accepting and selecting applications and are starting to ship books to selected libraries. The libraries of the Sumy region will be the first. — We had the following approach: formally, there are more than 10,000 public libraries in Ukraine. Unfortunately, some of them are, to put it mildly, -inanimate-. We wanted to find those libraries of various levels that are important to their communities. They can be small, but if there is life in the village around the library, some events are taking place, children come or people of all ages come - then we wanted to strengthen such libraries within the boundaries of -Book Crowd-, - explains Oleksiy Kopytko. For this review, the organizers, in addition to reviewing applications, also looked at library websites, pages and groups in social networks, which show how active and important the library is to the local community. So far, the -Information Resistance- group has collected more than 31,000 books from 26 publishing houses, more than 40 books from the set were published in the book capital of Ukraine — near the frontline, Kharkiv. Three sets of 101 books each have already gone to the first three libraries.

In the swamps, counterfeiters attack computer games: why is this the enemy	Plots from video games see them everywhere. For example, propagandists are spreading information on social networks that the German TV channel allegedly used footage from the American video game -Call of Duty- in the video of the assault on Russian positions by soldiers of the Azov brigade in the Pokrovsky direction. But in fact, this is not Pokrovsky direction, but Serebryansk forestry in Luhansk region. The video was shot in first person and is divided into three sections: advancing through positions, mopping up, and securing after the assault. There are no computer graphics on it. Apparently, the Russians still cannot believe that the Ukrainians are capable of defending their native land so selflessly. For them, the heroism of the military is beyond reality, so they believe in the fictions of their fakers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/26/na-bolotah-fejkoroby-atakuyut-kompyuterni-igry-navishho-cze-vorogu/	2024-11-25T20:06:10-08:00

A video of the combat operation appearedon the unit's page on November 25. -Thanks to the coordinated work of our units, we stopped the enemy, inflicting significant losses on him. Footage from drones, on which every moment of the battle is recorded, resembles scenes from Hollywood action movies. But this is not a movie. This is the harsh reality of today's war in Ukraine,- the fighters commented. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the 60th mechanized Ingulets brigade showed destruction of Russians who decided to attack on -Niva- passenger cars, protected only by camouflage and electronic radar.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/25/kadry-z-droniv-nagaduyut-sczeny-z-gollivudskyh-bojovykiv-bijczi-pro-vidbyttya-drugoyi-hvyli-rosijskogo-shturmu/	2024-11-25T12:01:05-08:00

Pavlo -Beton- is the commander of the mortar unit of the 60th separate mechanized Ingulets brigade. He repels enemy assaults almost every day, covering his comrades. Pavlo strikes at enemy concentrations and equipment, despite continuous fire from enemy artillery and tanks. -During one of the battles, -Beton- deliberately destroyed a stationary BMP of the enemy, under which enemy infantry was hiding. Two 120-mm mines were enough for this - the technicians tore off the tower, and the infantrymen were burned,- said the Ground Forces. Pavel admits that he wants even more such results. His main motivation is to protect his fellow vanguards. For his courage and skill, Pavlo was awarded the Golden Cross. -Beton- was born in the city of Kryvyi Rih. Before the full-scale invasion, he worked as a locksmith. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the 60th mechanized Ingulets brigade showed destruction of the Russians who decided to attack in Niva cars protected only by camouflage and REB.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/25/znyshhyly-rosijsku-bmp-i-pihotu-dvoma-minamy-istoriya-kolyshnogo-slyusarya-betona/	2024-11-25T11:58:24-08:00

Rustem Umyerov: We expect that partners will take the initiative in equipping our brigades	This is stated in the minister's message on the Facebook page. -Allies' support will become faster and more effective. The defenders of Ukraine must be provided with everything necessary to put an end to Russian aggression,- said Rustem Umyerov. The ministers discussed the urgent needs of the Defense Forces, as well as the priority areas of assistance to Ukraine. -We count on the fact that partners will take the initiative in equipping our brigades and battalions. We have a successful experience of cooperation with France, which provided training for one of the Ukrainian brigades and also provided it with armored vehicles,- said Rustem Umyerov. Another area of ​​support is strengthening our anti-aircraft defenses ahead of winter. The enemy does not stop trying to destroy our critical infrastructure, so we need more air defense systems and ammunition for them. The next important issue is artillery ammunition. Rustem Umyerov thanked our European partners for providing Ukraine with 1 million artillery shells, but noted that Ukraine needs more to achieve parity with the enemy. -Together with its allies, Ukraine is already building the potential of the domestic defense industry. We invite the countries of the free world to transfer technology to us and start strategic partnerships with our industry,- he said. The minister informed the partners about the areas in which we see significant opportunities for cooperation: At the same time, it is planned to conduct an audit with the allied states of the aid provided during 2022, 2023 and 2024 in order to determine which models of support to Ukraine worked best and scale them up. Ukraine is also open to new initiatives that will help quickly meet the needs of our soldiers in 2025. -We must act boldly and coherently. Only in this way will we be able to achieve a just and lasting peace in Europe,- Rustem Umyerov stressed. As reported by ArmyInform, Ukraine reached specific agreements with Norway, Denmark, Sweden and Lithuania on investing directly in Ukrainian production.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/25/rustem-umyerov-rozrahovuyemo-shho-partnery-vizmut-na-sebe-inicziatyvu-v-osnashhenni-nashyh-brygad/	2024-11-25T11:09:24-08:00

Yevhenii Romanov, told about this on the broadcast of the Suspilne Novosti marathon. -It was immediately partially destroyed, partially retreated to the territory of the Russian Federation,- he said. The spokesman explained that the actions of the DRG in border areas are a common practice. - Subversive intelligence groups are a common Russian practice. They try to enter in small groups in order to find out where there is some opening for them - an opportunity to enter, start a fight or advance somewhere. But these efforts always end in the same way - with the corpses of Russians, - assured Yevhenii Romanov. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that the Defense Forces stopped the breakthrough of Russian saboteurs in Kharkiv Oblast.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/25/vorozhu-drg-zupynyly-na-pivnochi-harkivshhyny-chastynu-rosijskyh-dyversantiv-likvidovano/	2024-11-25T10:57:16-08:00

Major Anastasia Bobovnikova, spokeswoman of Luhansk OTU, told about this on the air of the national telethon -Yedini Novyni- . The depressed mood among Russian soldiers is due to the extremely high level of casualties and the lack of success in the Siversk region. -Already now we can say about unsuccessful operations, unsuccessful assaults in the previous period of time - for about a month they tried to storm with equipment using a large amount of equipment that was completely broken and destroyed,- the spokeswoman said. In an attempt to rectify the situation, the Russians replaced the command staff here, and deployed military police on the ranks. — As a result of this, there were big changes in the enemy group standing in the Seversky direction: the brigade commander was changed, the combatants were changed. The military police came, as far as we know, in order to -motivate- the personnel to go into battle, the officer said. However, even this does not give the desired result to the Russian invaders - the soldiers of the Russian army refuse to perform combat tasks. ArmyInform previously reported that propagandystiv/->in OTU -Luhansk- denied the statements of Russian propagandists about the advance of the occupiers to the northern part Toretska.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/25/u-bij-na-zabij-chy-pid-trybunal-na-siverskomu-napryamku-rosiyan-motyvuye-vijskova-policziya/	2024-11-25T10:21:55-08:00
The escape attempt ended with a call to the rescuers: three men barely survived in Tisza	About this notifies November 25 State Border Service of Ukraine. -The men used the services of traders who promised to help them cross the border by land, but after paying for the -service- they were told that they would still have to go into the water,- the report said. It is noted that the shippers, traditionally disregarding the lives of their customers, directed them to the Tisza after dark, lying that the water there was knee-deep, the river itself was not wide, and therefore they would cross it with ease and would not even have time to freeze. No flotation devices or life jackets were offered to the men. -Taking off their shoes and slightly rolling up their pants, the divers went into an unknown body of water,- said the DPSU. In just a few minutes, all three were washed away by a powerful current and carried away in an unknown direction. According to the border guards, the only thing that saved the men was the fact that there was a washed-up tree in the water, which they were able to grab onto and get to the shallows in the middle of the river. Then they called the rescuers and reported that they needed help. Military personnel of the -Vylok- and -Dyakovo- border service departments of the Mukachevo border detachment were involved in the search for offenders. As a result of using a drone, the -islanders- were discovered. All three were taken to a border unit, where servicemen gave them hot tea and allowed them to warm up and dry their clothes and shoes. For an attempt to violate the state border, administrative offenses were filed against the men. -The water level in the Tisza River, which runs along the border with Hungary and Romania, has risen significantly at the moment. The water temperature is very low, which causes muscle cramps in those who try to dive into the river. Under such conditions, the human body becomes uncontrollable, which can lead to death,- the DPSU emphasized. ArmyInform reminds that it is better not to break the law or risk your life, but to use the aggregator of vacancies in the Armed Forces and recruiting centers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/25/sproba-vtechi-zavershylas-dzvinkom-do-ryatuvalnykiv-troye-cholovikiv-ledve-vyzhyly-u-tysi/	2024-11-25T10:08:16-08:00

Major Anastasia Bobovnikova, spokeswoman of Luhansk OTU, told about this on the air of the national telethon -Yedini Novyni- . — In the Toretsk direction, the number of assaults did not decrease, accordingly, the losses of Russians in manpower in this direction did not decrease either. They remain consistently high, she said. The spokeswoman did not confirm the information of Russian propagandists about the advance of Russians in the northern part of the city. — In the northern part of the city, they have not yet appeared. Although I must also repeat that urban battles are one of the most difficult battles in military practice, military science. They are characterized by dynamism and require constant attention from servicemen and constant tension, she said. At the same time, the military woman noted that during battles in the city it is difficult to talk about the details of the situation, because the enemy may unexpectedly appear on a neighboring street for a while and will be forced to leave it or be destroyed just as suddenly. — It is difficult to say what the situation is in the city itself, specifically on this or that street. The enemy may run into the neighboring street, but this does not mean that he is entrenched there. They immediately destroy him, immediately make it impossible for him to move or take him prisoner, - explained Anastasia Bobovnikova. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in Toretsk, the enemy loses 100 soldiers per day.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/25/u-pivnichnij-chastyni-toreczka-okupantiv-nemaye-v-otu-lugansk-sprostuvaly-zayavy-rosijskyh-propagandystiv/	2024-11-25T09:39:11-08:00

He said this in his evening address. -We will definitely respond to Russia for everything it does. And it is important that such blows, each of them, do not remain without a proper response, not only ours. There should not be even a hint of normalization of Russian terror — of getting used to it,- the President said. The head of state noted the new decision of Britain regarding sanctions against the shadow tanker fleet of the Russian Federation, according to which 30 tankers came under restrictions. -This is an important step. And it would be right for European partners — at the level of the entire EU — as well as other partners to support such sanctions. The less Russian excess profits from oil, the less Russia will be able to wage war. This is an obvious connection. A relationship that must work for real peace,- he said. Volodymyr Zelenskyi also announced that today at the meeting Bets were relevant reports and analysis of experience in repelling Russian strikes on energy. -The best results of specific units should be spread to all objects, to everyone who carries out protective work,- he emphasized.

Britain introduced large-scale sanctions against the shadow fleet of the Russian Federation	This is stated in the message at sites of the British government. -With half of the vessels sanctioned today carrying more than $4.3 billion worth of oil and petroleum products such as gasoline in the last year alone, this is the UK's largest sanctions package of its kind,- the statement said. It said the move would further limit the Kremlin's ability to finance its illegal war in Ukraine and its malicious activities around the world, and would also bring the total number of oil tankers under UK sanctions to 73, more than any other another country 46 countries and the EU signed the call to action against the shadow fleet, announced by the Prime Minister of Great Britain at the summit of the European Political Community in July. Revenues from oil sales are a key source of funding for the Kremlin's illegal war in Ukraine. The -shadow fleet- also poses significant risks to global trade. Many of these vessels use deceptive transportation methods and pose an environmental hazard—many tankers blatantly ignore basic safety standards, increasing the likelihood of catastrophic oil spills.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/25/brytaniya-zaprovadyla-masshtabni-sankcziyi-shhodo-tinovogo-flotu-rf/	2024-11-25T05:57:46-08:00
RAROG breathes fire: how to get to the 24th OMBr named after King Danylo	The windows of high-rise buildings are sometimes covered with fiberboard boards, film or other material, reminding that some people left their native homes and were forced to become internally displaced persons or refugees in other countries. Evacuation offers from the Donetsk regional military administration constantly come to the phone of everyone who enters the territory of the region. A typical picture of a front-line city. It is young, energetic, focused on results. This result is the destruction of the occupiers, day and night, under all circumstances and weather conditions. The fact that unmanned systems are becoming the main means of fire damage to the enemy significantly increases the role of such units in combat military units. Everyone flies: reconnaissance units, artillery fire adjusters, UAV units of mechanized and rifle battalions, and even EW units and RKBZ. But the main striking force of the brigade in the conditions of the enemy's superiority in ammunition over artillery is the battalions of unmanned systems created in the brigades. Why -RAROG- in particular? The mythical falcon of the ancient Slavs, which flies out of a fiery whirlwind and spews fire, a whirlwind, a storm on its own - isn't this a literal description of a deadly attack on the enemy from an unmanned aerial vehicle? 24th -royal- separate mechanized brigade named after King Danylo, since the beginning of the war in 2014, has already entered into its history the glorious pages of the battles for Liman, Popasna, Lysychansk, the liberation of the right bank of southern Ukraine. Today, it holds the defense of Chasovoy Yar. The brigade's arm badge depicts a Galician lion with the motto -milites regum- — royal infantry. The eidetics of the new Ukrainian army organically connects the generations of our ancestors with modern heroes who defend their country from the next invaders. -Rarog- is also from those times. Only a person rooted in the history of his kind, who is aware of his responsibility both to the past and to the future, is able to consciously and effectively destroy the enemy. - We do it effectively,- the combatant claims. Some episodes of battles are particularly ostentatious. Thus, the road Verkhne Toretske - Avdiyivka was jokingly called -RAROG road- in the brigade. The enemy tried to advance along it with combat equipment at night. The operators of the battalion carried out 12 sorties with mining of advance routes. As a result, we received 11 detonations of the enemy's equipment. -After all, this is not just mining. It's practically a piece of jewelry when a mine is dropped after detonating the previous car on the likely bypass path. Sometimes almost under the tracks of an enemy tank,- explains the combatant. Service in the battalion is no less difficult than in mechanized or rifle units. Permanent shifts of UAV operators at positions with a continuous change of drones in the air; logistics and delivery of goods for infantry in positions; repair, modernization and improvement of unmanned aerial vehicles; own logistics and production of discharges and other ammunition. After all, up to 1 thousand can be dropped on the enemy during the night. kg of -surprises-. On the Facebook page of the battalion, there are photos with the latest results of defeating the enemy. From military equipment to individual invaders who met their death on Ukrainian soil. Destroyed dugouts, bridges, shelters, firing positions. Such results are comparable to the achievements of the most successful battalions of unmanned systems: Magyar Birds (deployed to a regiment), Achilles, K-2, Wild Hornets, Magura brigade battalion and others. This is the result not only of state support for capacity building The forces of unmanned systems, but also significant volunteer funds and the battalion's own funds. In a new kind of military, real development comes ahead of changes to states, state-contracted drones and typical munitions. And the constant change of the situation and the actions of the enemy force us to be more and more resourceful in order to resist and, in the end, see Victory . Up to 10 million hryvnias are spent every month on the modernization of drones received in the battalion alone. The unit needs its own cargo transport, solutions for the rapid movement of control points, modern computer equipment and drones, drones, drones... span> Everyone can become the embodiment of the power of the fiery vortex and destroy the enemy personally. This requires: &#8211; choose a position that matches your skills and abilities; &#8211; constantly learn and grow professionally; &#8211; fight for victory with ideological and motivated comrades.

Foreign components of 2023 detected in North Korean KN-23/KN-24 missile — GUR	This was reported by the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine on November 25. The aggressor state Russia received more than 100 such missiles from the DPRK. The enemy used this weapon for the first time in the war against Ukraine at the end of 2023. Together with the missiles, Pyongyang then sent its military specialists to Russia, who serviced the launchers and actually participated in war crimes against Ukraine. The victims of KN-23/KN-24 strikes were Ukrainian civilians both in front-line communities and in settlements far from the battle line. In particular, on January 2, 2024, four people died as a result of a North Korean missile hitting a Kyiv high-rise building. On August 11, 2024, a four-year-old boy and his father were killed by KN-23/KN-24 debris in the Kyiv region, and three more citizens were injured. The KN-23/KN-24 missile used by Russia against Ukraine contained foreign components produced by companies from five countries — China, the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland. At least one of them, a voltage converter labeled -XP Power- by a British manufacturer, was made in February 2023, after the full-scale invasion had begun. In order to obtain technologies for their weapons programs, the aggressor state of Russia and its allies - the DPRK and Iran - use joint schemes to circumvent international sanctions, which requires an appropriate response, in particular - the strengthening of export control mechanisms. As reported by ArmyInform, in the GUR we talked about the tactics of using the Magura V5 attack marine drones.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/25/u-pivnichnokorejskij-raketi-kn-23-kn-24-vyyavleno-inozemni-komponenty-2023-roku-gur/	2024-11-24T22:57:52-08:00

Enemy cesspools were dug somewhere in Odessa -Nikolai Fyodorovich-: what are you lying about	However, all his words are a standard set of Kremlin narratives and clichés used by propagandists every day. It in no way reflects the opinion of the residents of all of Odessa. After all, the only country that makes the residents of Odessa and other cities and villages of Ukraine suffer is terrorist Russia and its dictator Putin. It is the Russians who launch attack drones and missiles over Ukraine every night and every day. According to social survey of the Rozumkov Center, as of September In 2024, 94% of Ukrainian citizens have a negative attitude towards the Russian Federation. By the way, as a result of a Russian missile attack on the city on November 18, 11 people died. A total of 55 people were injured, 23 of them are still in hospitals.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/25/vorozhi-pomyjky-vykopaly-des-v-odesi-nikolaya-fodorovicha-pro-shho-breshe/	2024-11-24T21:10:28-08:00
Help has arrived: how recruits are being prepared for a real war in Donetsk region	We asked who and what is taught before being sent to combat positions. The training ground is somewhere in the steppes of Donetsk region. An infantry division moves between barricades made of old tires. They keep their distance, keep their weapons at the ready. — A grenade! The instructor shouts and throws a mock-up of a hand grenade to the side of the compartment. Fighters fall amicably to the ground. They are waiting — Explosion! And we're moving! Let's move! He who does not move will die! The instructor shouts, the fighters pick themselves up and advance further. In general, all recruits have undergone a month's training in training centers, but the battalion believes that it is not enough. -Military personnel come from training centers with a low level of training. They have a small shot, weak tactical skills, everything has to be learned almost from scratch. Currently, 90 percent of the recruitment is without experience of military service. Which, after all, gave at least some initial skills,- says the commander of the department with the call sign Psych, a calm man in his 50s with a beard. According to him, 12-15 bullets are given in training centers, in the best case, up to a hundred. -We give much more. Weapons are attached to military personnel so that they get used to them. This weapon is being fired. We also allow shooting with RPGs, disposable grenade launchers, and various machine guns. Here we are already undergoing disassembly and assembly. We try to prepare as much as possible,- says Psych. -Here, a fighter can shoot more in one day than in a whole month at the training center. This is a fact. We shoot from automatic weapons, from machine guns, from RPGs, throw grenades of various types,- says the senior sergeant with the call sign Romeo, black and cheerful. -There are almost no veterans among the recruits. We have succumbed to this misconception that the army must be professional. In fact, an army can only be professional if it has to fight against a bunch of savages. And against an enemy equal in strength, a common army is needed. After all, the protection of Ukraine is the constitutional duty of its citizens. And I don't have time for civilians now. They can't even line up and march in formation. That's why they have to be taught fast,- says Norman, who is tall and looks like a wrestler. He was just throwing dummy grenades at the soldiers to teach them to immediately lie down and then move quickly. The time that the unit allocates for the training of new recruits depends on the situation at the front. -There were cases when fighters arrived by bus after training, received weapons and immediately went into battle, because the enemy was attacking and it was necessary to hold the front. Now we try to cook for at least a week,- says Romeo. Next, according to the plan, the fighters will have training on conducting combat operations in urban conditions. The department enters the site of the landfill, on which there are models of urban development. Fighters learn to sweep, cover each other, act as a team. -Tactical fighting skills in urban development, which we really need now, none. We are now teaching them this, because there is no way without it. Because what is Donbas? This is an agglomeration! More than five hundred settlements! They flow into each other! In some places, the boundaries of settlements pass along the streets! It is a continuous development. And the war in solid construction has its differences. Here, the offense requires a one-to-seven power advantage, while the field requires a one-to-three power advantage. Considering that Donetsk is almost one continuous population center, it is necessary to sharpen the preparation for this. Because if we surrender Donbas, it will be trouble. Operational space begins behind Donbas, that is, space not occupied by troops and without prepared fortifications. That's it, they go to Dnipropetrovsk region and spread in any direction like a plague or a locust. That's why we need to focus on Donbas!- says Norman. Military personnel move from wall to wall, working in pairs. One takes a position and shouts, -I'm hiding!- The second shouts: -I'm coming- and runs forward, takes the position: -I'm hiding!-. Everyone else watches the pair, the instructor explains and points out mistakes. Another couple starts working. Some try harder, some less. Someone falls when necessary, and someone just kneels so as not to get dirty. -We are trying to teach them so that they don't die stupidly on the first day. The reason some people don't give their all is because people don't fully understand where they are and what they're here for. It has not yet been understood that in war any mistake, wrong step, untimely movement can cost lives,- says Romeo. -There's nothing to do in urban combat without grenades! You should carry at least a dozen with you! And when entering the premises, do not spare a grenade for each room, but rather a few! To make sure that there is no enemy waiting for you! -Raise your hands, who doesn't have combat experience?- Norman looks at the recruits. Everyone raises their hands. This is another example of the quality of training in educational centers. You will have to learn this too. When the exercise is over, the fighters are given time to rest a little. Someone smokes, someone sits down directly on the ground to rest. Everyone is breathing heavily, because the training takes place in full equipment: body armor, helmet, discharge, first-aid kit, weapons, ammunition. A total of at least 15 kilograms. Try to run with a kettlebell, fall, stand up, squat, see if you can last long. I look at the fighters. Most are somewhere around fifty and they don't look like athletes. Fall asleep after exercises. I approach a fighter who was very active in training, did not feel sorry for himself, worked out to the full, and also caught up with his brothers who were lazy. Mykola is of medium height, thin, sinewy, from the city of Gulyaipole in Zaporozhye. Since the beginning of the large-scale invasion, a front has been passing there nearby. Mykola knows what war is. Especially since he did not work anywhere, but in a funeral service. -I saw different things. People also had to be collected in parts. We are in a war zone, shelled every day: mortars, guns, tanks. It happened that you were digging a grave, and then the shelling began, and you jumped into the hole yourself to wait. Then you dig further. He was wounded twice. Once in the head a fragment, but only -combed-. The second time in the stomach, but saved the phone, a mortar fragment got stuck in it. That phone is still lying at home,- says Mykola. His family left for Zhytomyr, and he stayed to help the old and sick who remained in his hometown. In 2022, he was summoned three times to the TCC, but each time he was not taken to the army. Only now it was his turn. Mykola underwent basic military training in the Poltava region, but he says that here, in the battalion, the occupations were more intense. -We didn't have such movement in urban conditions with weapons there. It was mostly medicine, some more lectures. Well, maybe 5 times in a month they stormed the trenches. And then they tried to storm more. So that it was not so much, truly, as here, in the textbook. And here, of course, it is difficult, especially on the first day. But we are taught to go to the positions and not stay there on the first day,- says Mykola. Sergey stands a little aside. He is from Bohodukhov, Kharkiv region. I was driving from work, stood at a bus stop, the police drove up, and in a couple of days I already went to the educational center. -There's a lot of useful stuff here, it's hard to remember everything. But something must be done, because this is the army,- says Serhiy. Fighters rest before a new exercise. In the battalion, problems are recognized both with the age of recruitment and with its motivation. -Well, what could be the motivation if he was going to work and was taken to the TCC? Will he have motivation? But hardly. It was at the beginning of a large scale motivated guys, but they have either run out or there are few left. That's why you have to fight with the people who are there,- says Romeo. And Norman says that it's not about age, it's about your attitude. -I myself am already under sixty. You just don't need to drink and smoke, you need to do sports. And the boys, of course, complain that it is difficult for them. They often come here already with some kind of clinic,- sighs Norman. He himself was withdrawn from the combat team after a serious injury and has been the head of the battalion's combat training for a year. To his credit, he looks younger than most recruits. The battalion's aerial scouts raise two drones. The next point of training: work under enemy copters. The detachment moves through the territory in pairs, when a drone appears overhead, then the fighter drops to the ground, necessarily in a straight line, to maintain visual contact with the drone. If earlier the training program for new recruits included a run-in with a tank, now it is a drone flight. Because the recruits may not see an enemy tank, but an enemy drone - for sure. -The Kalashnikov assault rifle does not change, but the war has changed very much: both methods and tactics. At the beginning of the war, who would have thought that drones would play such a role? And now it is a technological war, a war of drones. Now they attach to them -lighters- and other ammunition. Drones perform very different tasks and you have to be prepared for them,- says Romeo. -We currently have the biggest losses from enemy drones. Moreover, they already have standard ammunition, thermobaric, cumulative, which allow them to perform any task on the battlefield. Because what is mortar or art? Shot and hit or missed. Because the flight of a mine or a projectile is affected by a large number of factors: the quality of ammunition, wear of the muzzle channel, wind, weather. And the drone is all about it, it can fly up and accurately drop its ammunition on the target. So the focus has now shifted and countering drones is now the main thing,- says Norman. He remembers the year 2022, when he fought near Lysychansk, and the main striking force was artillery. Shows photos on the phone of positions that look like a lunar landscape: dozens and hundreds of craters from artillery shells. -We did not see a live opponent, we were simply destroyed by his arta. A platoon entered the position, and only half left. Or simply ran away in a panic due to continuous fire exposure. But now everything has changed and it is the drones that are making the decisive fire impact. That's why we teach recruits to get used to the idea that they will constantly be in front of our eyes and the enemy's eyes,- says Norman. The copters dive at the fighters, and they learn to notice them in time and not to panic. Vlad is the youngest in the entire department. On September 2, he turned 25, it is from this age that mobilization now begins, and already on September 3 he had a summons. Vlad himself is from Cherkasy, says that since 2022 he has received summons several times, but he was not taken because of his age. -I was told that you are still young, go for a walk for now. I updated my details and waited. September 3 came, I was sent to the VLK, I passed it in two days. In two, because the tests had to be taken the next day. In the TCC, I met with a representative of the battalion, and he offered me to serve in it. I agreed, got the attitude and went to the training center, after which I got into the battalion, everything was as it should be. Is it difficult? It is difficult, but useful. I listen a lot, I try to remember everything,- says Vlad. According to Oleg, deputy chief of staff of the battalion for mobilization work, Vlad's case is not an isolated one. -Our vacancies are on many sites. Now they have also appeared on Army+. If a person is interested in them, write to us. I contact her, ask questions, send a questionnaire. A person is filling it out, and at this time I am checking it on the website of court decisions to weed out people who want to hide in the army from some administrative or criminal cases. If the person is suitable for us, then we will provide them with a letter of recommendation. This is an official document with a registration number and seal. With it, a person goes to the TCC. If he is going to sign a contract, then he will 100% come to us. As for mobilization, there are options, because the General Staff can decide that some brigade needs more replenishment. That's why I always recommend a contract. For the most part, the positions of clerks, UAV operators, and drivers are filled with us through recruiting. There are less snipers or shooters,- said Oleg. Training on the range ends with firing from a Browning machine gun. The guys come two by two, squat down, the instructors show how to prepare the machine gun for battle, how to aim and how to fire. Short bursts fly towards the targets. Some of the cartridges are tracers to make it easier to adjust the fire. -Browning- shoots loudly, out of habit it can cover your ears a little. But the work of the machine gun, it is far from the loudest thing that can happen in the positions. Recruits are animated, they are interested in shooting with a machine gun. Someone sits on a box, someone kneels, short queues, shell casings fly. Fighters listen to the advice of instructors, adjust their fire. Today they still have grenade throwing here at the training ground. And in the evening, classes on tactical medicine. The battalion tries to give its soldiers maximum skills that will help them in battle. And in just a week or two, the boys will be in combat positions. Hold the front and do not let the enemy into the operational space.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/25/pidmoga-pryjshla-yak-na-donechchyni-gotuyut-novobrancziv-do-realnoyi-vijny/	2024-11-24T20:55:44-08:00
Getting Closer to the Assault Rifle: Introducing the US Army's Newest 30mm Grenade Launcher	As said in a release posted on the Barrett portal, the new Squad Support Rifle System (SSRS) is designed to revolutionize the battlefield with its advanced capabilities and innovative design. This marks a significant step forward in the evolution of soldier protection systems, ArmyInform reports. Manufacturers classify the weapon as a -support rifle-, which is designed to fire both at enemy infantry and vehicles, as well as at drones. -We are pleased to partner with Barrett, the world's leading manufacturer of military weapons, to further advance our 30mm support rifle for the US Army's PGS program,- said Michael Merino, president of MARS Inc. Merino added that the companies are developing a solution that will significantly improve a soldier's ability to counter a wide range of threats on the battlefield. The PGS is a magazine-fed semi-automatic weapon that provides soldiers with greater accuracy and firepower. The grenade launcher is designed to engage targets at a distance of 35 meters to over half a kilometer, including enemy manpower hiding behind shelters. The PGS aims to offer a flat firing trajectory for faster and more accurate target engagement, reducing flight time for long-range shots. In addition, the PGS will include a sophisticated fire control system capable of programming shots and ammunition families for different tactical situations. The arsenal can include rounds for counter-defilade, close combat, and even armor-piercing charges or anti-drone (Counter-UAS) munitions. As inform the authors of the defense portal Army Recognition, the program reached its final stage when several companies such as FN America and Plumb Precision Products, submitted their own projects for evaluation by military experts. The new weapon is designed to participate in the PGS (Precision Grenadier System) tender, which is expected in fiscal year 2026, when the US Army will select the final candidate after a successful technology demonstration. The key to the design of the Barrett SSRS is its comfortable assault rifle-based design. The weapon has a stock in the rear, a magazine with five cartridges in the center and a barrel length of 305 mm. The grenade launcher is compact and versatile with a total length of 861 mm and a weight of only 6.3 kg. It can fire a variety of ammunition, including anti-aircraft shells, giving soldiers a decisive advantage on the battlefield. The weapon is also equipped with a Vortex Optics XM-157 scope, similar to the sight installed on the 6.8 mm machine gun XM7 army USA. This sight is used in the marksmanship developed under the Next Generation Squad Weapons (NGSW) program. This optical enhancement further strengthens SSRS's ability to deliver precision in combat, aligning with the US Army's modernization goals. With Barrett leading a team of industry-leading partners, this next-generation grenade launcher will be a key component of future lethality systems in the U.S. Army soldier's arsenal, combining firepower, accuracy and safety on the modern battlefield. The US Army announced the launch of the PGS program in August 2024. It is worth reminding, as reported ArmyInform , the products of the arms company Barrett Firearms are on the list of about 20 samples of sniper and anti-materiel rifles, which from the beginning of the large-scale invasion of the Russian Federation by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine were codified and accepted for use in the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

Should we give up propaganda: a military historian on the world experience of working with human con...	-We do not like to mention either the Soviet experience or the experience of other totalitarian states. But in reality, propaganda always works the same way. She worked in the same way in Ancient Rome, in European states, when the Crusades were being prepared. It worked like this in Europe during the 30 Years War. She worked like this during the First and Second World Wars. At the moment, certain democratic circles believe that the use of propaganda is unacceptable, although we see that no country in the world shies away from using propaganda. The only difference is that now the word -propaganda- has been replaced by the construct -strategic communications-. But the essence and methods have not changed from this. We can call them whatever we want, but these principles are absolutely constant, they have always worked the same way. And I don't think that Ukraine should give up on this, it's just that in the end we have to get used to the fact that evil should be called evil, and not the phrase -not everything is so clear-cut.- Good should be called good, struggle should be called struggle, one should go precisely to Victory. And then propaganda turns into just a tool. She is neither good nor bad. It is simply a tool for working with human consciousness. Likewise, someone may not like a scalpel. But the scalpel during surgery cannot be replaced by anything else. In the same way, nothing else can replace propaganda in working with consciousness.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/25/chy-varto-vidmovytys-vid-propagandy-militarnyj-istoryk-pro-svitovyj-dosvid-roboty-z-lyudskoyu-svidomistyu/	2024-11-24T20:29:15-08:00

Serhii, the spokesman of the volunteer Ukrainian army -South- told about this in ArmiyaTV stream Bratchuk -The week is passing... under the sign of a certain hysteria in the media that the enemy is preparing a large-scale massive offensive on the regional center of Zaporizhzhia. It was again necessary, as they say, to throw the fire information team to explain to people that today the biggest threat to the Zaporizhzhia agglomeration is, of course, the actions of enemy aviation, which is engaged in terrorizing the civilian population: they drop anti-aircraft missiles, use unguided air missiles...-, - Serhii Bratchuk explained. In addition, according to him, separate enemy units are withdrawn from the Zaporizhzhia direction and transferred to the Donetsk front, the Pokrovskoe-Kurakhov direction. The spokesman also emphasized that Velika Novosilka is an important logistics point, because it is actually located on the border of three regions: Donetsk, Zaporizhzhya, and Dnipropetrovsk, although administratively it belongs to Donetsk region. -With the questions that arise around Velika Novosilka, we are talking about the fact that then the enemy will be able to become more active and threaten the Orihiv and Gulyaipil directions more,- Serhiy Bratchuk said. As reported by ArmyInform, the Russians are using all possible forces in the South of Ukraine, from convicts to marines.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/24/okupanty-pogrozhuyut-nastupom-na-pivdni-a-sami-perekydayut-vijska-na-inshi-napryamky/	2024-11-24T10:58:16-08:00
All documents are burnt! — the Russians confirmed that our drones were hit	Footage from the cameras of the Russians and from our drones was combined and made public on the channel of the unit. In the video, Russians drive along the road in the Pokrovsky direction and observe a pile of destroyed equipment. At some point, they notice our FPV drone, try to run away or shoot it, but they don't succeed. They are forced to run away from the car. Which is destroyed by our drone, along with weapons and documents. There are the same videos from the cameras of our drones. -The enemy fixes one of the torn -Hrads- and shows the path of death. On that day, we burned 1 -hail-, 5 -loaves-, 2 -Urals-, 3 buggies and hit 2 tanks. This is all the result of one TPO group working 24/7 to 'improve' enemy logistics,- Muramasa commented on the video. As reported by ArmyInform, the pilots of the Muramasa 109th separate brigades of the Armed Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces destroy enemy logistics in the Pokrovsky direction.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/24/vsye-dakumyenty-sgaryeli-rosiyany-pidtverdyly-vluchannya-nashyh-dronariv/	2024-11-24T10:37:52-08:00
Lithuania transferred a new batch of military aid to Ukraine	This is stated in messages of the Ministry of Defense of Lithuania. In response to Ukraine's requests this year, Lithuania has already transferred 155 mm ammunition, M113 armored personnel carriers, anti-drone systems to Ukraine. Ukraine also received winter equipment and sets of warm clothing, ammunition for the -Karl Gustav- anti-tank grenade launcher, RISE-1 remote detonation systems, generators, loaders, trailers, folding cabins and other auxiliary equipment. Since the beginning of the war, Lithuania has provided military aid to Ukraine in the amount of more than 705 million euros. Lithuania's overall support to Ukraine is long-term and has exceeded 1 billion euros. As reported by ArmyInform, Ukraine reached specific agreements with Norway, Denmark, Sweden and Lithuania on investing directly in Ukrainian defense production.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/24/lytva-peredala-novu-partiyu-vijskovoyi-dopomogy-ukrayini/	2024-11-24T10:21:38-08:00
Three thermobars for the dugout of the dead! — our stormtroopers showed the old school	The video of the battle was released on the battalion channel. -Skaly- fighters conducted a successful assault in the Mykolaivka village area in the Pokrovsky direction. First, the Bradley infantry fighting vehicle went to the positions where the enemy was located. She brought the landing party to the positions, landed and covered our attack aircraft, mowing down the nearby landing from the cannon. Our fighters started clearing the trenches. It turned out that the occupiers were entrenched in one dugout. Ours tried to smoke them out with a smoke grenade. When the smoke did not penetrate the Russians, our fighter threw three grenades into the dugout at once, thereby contributing to the urgent demobilization of two Russian soldiers. As reported by ArmyInform, our attack aircraft arranged a whole performance for the sake of a successful assault.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/24/try-termobary-na-blindazh-mercziv-nashi-shturmovyky-pokazala-staru-shkolu/	2024-11-24T10:18:24-08:00
President: Putin cannot be given a week to adapt and find a countermeasure	This was stated by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in his evening address. He emphasized that it is necessary to focus on the supply of these systems and Russia should feel that every step it takes to expand the war has consequences for it. -The consequences are in our actions at the front, our soldiers, our units. And also — consequences in the actions of the world. In how the world responds. You can't give Putin a week to adapt and find a countermeasure. It is necessary to constantly do everything so that Russia is forced to look for the possibility of peace. Real peace. And this can only be achieved by two things — aid to Ukraine and pressure on Russia,- the President said. Volodymyr Zelenskyi reported that today the Security Service of Ukraine, the Ministry of Internal Affairs showed news agencies the fragments of a Russian missile that hit our Dnipro. -Examinations, work with partners to establish all the details and all the characteristics of this missile are ongoing now. And in order to find an answer to this Russian escalating step together,- the head of state added. As ArmiyaInform reported, on November 21, the Russians hit the Dnipro with a medium-range ballistic missile based on the older Rubezh ICBM, which is a potential carrier of a nuclear warhead. GUR IOU reported that Russia struck by using a ballistic missile, probably from the -Kedr- missile complex.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/24/prezydent-ne-mozhna-davaty-putinu-zhodnogo-tyzhnya-shhob-adaptuvatys-ta-znajty-protydiyu/	2024-11-24T10:04:48-08:00

How is preparation for takmed: a master class from instructors -Kabana- and-Puma-	Such training of fighters already after arriving from the training center to the battalion is a mandatory element of continued training. No soldier will go on combat missions until he has received additional training, including tactical medicine. The instructors told the correspondents of ArmiyaInform how the training in the technical field takes place and why it is necessary for every fighter newly arrived in the battalion. During training, those who have well mastered the basics of tactical medicine during BZVP have the opportunity and will be able to refresh and consolidate their knowledge. Those who were less attentive and diligent must make up for lost time. — Such training takes place with all newcomers. We work in small groups - from 4‒6 to a maximum of 10 fighters in order to be able to pay attention to everyone, says Vladyslava. Medics must firmly make sure that newly arrived fighters at a sufficient level have mastered the necessary set of knowledge, abilities and skills in order to be able to provide first aid to themselves or a brother in case of injury. To do this, with each successive group of replenishment, they go through the same set of classes, exercises and training again and again. After all, as the Ukrainian proverb says: -Until you try, you won't know how.- — With beginners, we always go through the MARCH algorithm and consolidate knowledge and practice skills in practice. This is necessary so that they do not get lost in the position and during combat, so that everything is done as correctly as possible, she says. — When newcomers come, we treat them as if they know absolutely nothing. We understand that they have already received training at the BZVP, but we need to make sure of the level of their knowledge acquisition, - explains the head of the medical center, Senior Lieutenant Yuriy Faustus. This is why medics work in small groups, which, moreover, can be divided into pairs in such a way that the fighters train on each other and check each other. — Today they listen with interest, work responsibly. Therefore, it was easy to train them - they helped each other, applied tourniquets, made bandages. They themselves checked whether the tourniquet was put on properly, -Puma- says with satisfaction. New arrivals are different, doctors explain. It is easier for someone to explain everything and to teach what is necessary, but for someone it is necessary to force. It's not so bad when a person can't do something, they note - it's much worse if he doesn't want to learn. Not everyone immediately understands where they got to, that they are really at war. Therefore, sometimes it is necessary to force. It is very bad when a person himself does not realize how terrible the consequences of his negligence can be, doctors are convinced. — We must teach all those who come to us so that they do not get lost in combat conditions. Of course, they are not seeing these tourniquets and bandages for the first time, but we understand very well that time and opportunities to bring knowledge and skills to a perfect level are not always enough, - explains Vladyslava. She does not hide that not only the attitude of the fighters, but also the level of their training after passing the BZVP can be different. There are those who after the training center really have a sufficient level of knowledge and skills, but there are also those who wasted their time and did not learn even the most necessary minimum at a sufficient level. — There are cases when they think that they only have to learn how to shoot from an automatic machine, and they don't really need everything else. I encountered this quite often. Because of this, we make sure to train all new arrivals and then try to repeat them every time the opportunity arises, says Yuriy. Because of this attitude, some have to be forced to learn through disciplinary measures. Instead, it's always nice to have one or two motivated fighters in a training group who set the tone and become an example for others to follow. — What is important for us is what we have taught them now, what we have taught them right here. Because we understand that from now on the responsibility for their training lies with us, emphasizes Puma. The truth of these words is confirmed by intensive training, during which Yuriy and Vladislava give 100%, either working with the whole group of fighters at the same time, or by dividing them into pairs or singling out someone alone. It is noticeable that doctors treat their mission extremely responsibly and diligently.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/24/yak-vidbuvayetsya-pidgotovka-z-takmedu-majsterklas-vid-instruktoriv-kabana-tapumy/	2024-11-23T21:02:26-08:00
Barrage -Jackal-: a new high-precision missile with a turbojet engine was presented in the USA	As stated in the abstract of this project on the official portal of this corporation with headquarters in Virginia, the Jackal multi-purpose missile (-Шакал- in Ukrainian) can use both lethal and non-lethal payloads for a range of functions such as electronic warfare and reconnaissance, surveillance and intelligence (ISR), ArmyInform reported. Developed in cooperation with AeroVironment, this rocket uses the technological developments of the Switchblade series, a family of ammunition that has already proven itself well in practical applications. It should be noted that the Switchblade barrage drones (-Ejection Knife- in Ukrainian) have repeatedly dopomogy-na-13-mlrd/->included in the packages of weapons that were transferred to the Defense Forces as part of the foreign partnerships and about which our editors in detail she told in her publications. The Jackal missile features a modular configuration that allows integration of lethal and non-lethal payloads suitable for complex military operations. Thanks to its turbojet engine running on JP-10 fuel, the Jackal missile can reach a speed of more than 644 km/h, has a flight range of 100 kilometers and can stay in the air for about 15 minutes. Its useful load capacity is 4.5 kilograms. The open architecture of the Jackal missile allows for flexible integration of various payloads, including electronic warfare (EW) systems, reconnaissance, surveillance and intelligence (ISR) equipment. This missile can be deployed on air, land and sea platforms. The Jackal missile was first presented at the Special Operations Forces Industry Conference (SOFIC) in Tampa, Florida. in May 2022. As the manufacturer explains, the purpose of the Jackal missile was to fill the gap between existing ammunition, such as the Switchblade 300 and Switchblade 600, thanks to increased range, speed and versatility. While the Switchblade 300 is ideal for precision strikes at short ranges and is adept at dealing with armor, the Jackal strikes a balance between speed and payload as it can carry heavy warheads and other essential equipment over long distances while maintaining the flexibility needed to dynamic combat conditions. Moreover, as Northrop Grumman points out, the Jackal missile is an excellent choice for counter-terrorism missions, allowing it to gather valuable information in difficult environments for a long time before striking. As emphasize defense market researchers from the profile portal Army Recognition, this high-precision strike missile combines advanced avionics and flight control systems, designed for navigation in conditions where GPS is unavailable, ensuring operational reliability even when conventional navigation systems fail. The Jackal missile's next-generation flight control system offers advanced capabilities such as GPS-disabled navigation and an automatic targeting mechanism that is fine-tuned for target recognition, detection and enhanced situational awareness. Thanks to its high-speed turbojet engine, the Jackal missile quickly reaches targets, providing the necessary response to emerging threats, which is an important feature for maintaining tactical superiority in changing combat scenarios. Due to its modular design, the Jackal missile provides a variety of effects, both lethal and non-lethal. It autonomously follows set waypoints and can be reconfigured in flight depending on tactical tasks. Once a target is detected, the warhead reactively accelerates to intercept the target, setting new standards for tactical superiority in range, accuracy and speed. -Today's rapidly changing landscape requires multi-domain solutions that are flexible, resilient, and able to respond quickly to tactical demands to meet these demands. The Jackal missile is a next-generation high-precision strike missile that provides critical countermeasures in high-stress conditions when launched from air, land and sea platforms at a range of more than 100 km,- says a new video about this munition posted by Northrop Grumman on YouTube . According to Northrop Grumman, the Jackal missile has attracted a lot of military interest since its initial presentation. In November 2022, the system completed a series of successful test flights, and additional demonstrations are planned for 2024 to further improve its capabilities and bring it into line with potential US military missions. In the ever-changing conditions of warfare, the Jackal missile offers a cost-effective and versatile solution for modern armed forces, capable of delivering high-precision strikes and strategic surveillance at the same time, emphasizes Northrop Grumman.

How to become a reckless UAV pilot: tips from an instructor	- What qualities should a UAV operator have? - Let's start with the fact that UAVs are different. The main division is copters and -wings-. And, for example, the skills and mental toughness of FPV strike drone pilots and wing operators are exactly the opposite. Because, relatively speaking, if a person is determined to shoot videos for TikTok, scouting is not an option for him, because there will never be any interesting stories. To shoot such videos, you need to be either an FPV shooter or a fixer. And these are different professions. A scout actually needs a certain amount of boredom and a normal education. That is, if a person does not understand how radio waves work, he will not be able to fly an airplane. It is also necessary to understand that he will not have any spectacular heroism, but will stupidly and methodically perform the same work every day. And not everyone can stand it. I know that people have tried to switch from scouting boards to strike boards or tried to be transferred to artillery by adjusters. This also has to be done by someone, and if the person's character is more suited to it, this is the right decision. - What qualities do an FPV drone operator need? - FPV drone operator is probably one of the most difficult professions in terms of training. A pilot needs a certain recklessness. They are closer than anyone to the front line. It is necessary to dig a lot, to be able to quickly collect and assemble your household, to haul it, because it is a question of their survival, and you need to calmly treat the spectacle of human bodies torn to pieces. In fact, they are probably the last fighters in modern warfare who look the enemy in the eye before he dies. And I know that many people dream about it at night. - What should a person who wants to become a reconnaissance drone operator know? - The cadet should know that he will receive, as a rule, the task of scouting a specific area. That is, either to walk along such and such landings, or to explore such and such a settlement, or simply to conduct preliminary reconnaissance. Here, for example, we know that something was or can be at such and such coordinates. You fly everything again and find out - it's still there, or it's gone, or in that place where it was empty, something has appeared, or confirm the target has been hit. That is, we know that the REB was there, and you take off and find out why it turned off - or it died, or it left, or it is just silent. For his part, the -wings- operator must know the entire terrain of his unit in depth, in fact, reconnaissance, and another 20-30 percent, must clearly know the map in order to anchor at any moment and understand where he is. Simply because the Western fantasy that we will go to war for GPS has little to do with reality. You need to understand where you place your point so that, firstly, you are found as the latest, and secondly, so that you have time to leave this point in time. In other words, the scout does not sit in one place, unlike the adjuster. The task of a scout is to arrive, set up, and it is good if there is a shelter nearby, if there is not and there is no way to prepare it in advance, which, unfortunately, happens often, then he started from the ground, worked, quickly gathered and changed the location. It is advisable to make the second departure in a day from another place. - So that's all you teach your cadets? - Yes, that's exactly it. Here, for example, is the question of how to choose a position for an airplane. It should have many factors, in contrast to vertical take-off boards, such as -quadricopters-. You are tied not only to how to place the antennae, not only to how to place yourself so that you don't get killed. You are still tied to how you will raise and lower your plane based on today's wind. The position may be perfect for everyone, but you either can't raise the plane or you can't lower it. — What other qualities do cadets need? — Let me remind you that -wing- scouts need perseverance and attention, and FPV-schneiders need recklessness. These are incompatible qualities, so we divide the cadets immediately. Well, you need the ability to turn nuts, solder circuits, glue, etc. That is why people of working specialties who can fix something, if necessary, show themselves best in training. If a person still has some imagination to come up with a field upgrade on the plane, this is also a plus, because the shortcomings of the boards are compensated solely by the skills of the crew. — What percentage of cadets drop out during training? — There is a general rule: the cheaper and simpler the plane, the more difficult it is to learn to fly. The number of people who could not finish the course is quite large among the same FPV pilots, there are very difficult piloting skills. That is, what in more expensive boards is partly taken over by automation, you do everything yourself. The control complexity is about the same as that of World War II fighter jets. But overall, not very much. - What are the age restrictions for cadets? - I will say yes. For -wings-, age is not a critical factor. For FPV, this is actually more critical because, once again, there is no automation, and the speed of reaction is very important. That's why people often don't pull because of their age, people with concussions don't pull, people with a bad vestibular apparatus don't pull. Simply because, when you look at this screen, where everything swings around you at full height, it can really make you feel sick and sick. - How long does the training take? - Currently one and a half months. It is possible to train a person from zero to a pilot who will perform the task in that time, and it is almost always successful.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/24/yak-staty-bezshabashnym-pilotom-bpla-porady-instruktora/	2024-11-23T20:33:19-08:00
The Ministry of Defense named the most popular combat specialties for which women entered in 2024	The Department of Military Education and Science of the Ministry of Defense informed ArmiyaInform about this. -The most popular among women were the majors and specializations that prepare commanders of mechanized units, units of Airborne Assault Forces and Special Operations Forces,- the department noted. In 2024, the number of women enrolled in higher military educational institutions, military educational units of higher education institutions, and professional advanced military education institutions of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine system was 31.5%, which is 3.2% more than last year. Earlier ArmyInform reported that at the National Academy of Land Forces named after Hetman Petr Sahaidachny, many women study such combat specializations, as -Complexes, devices and devices of artillery reconnaissance-, -Management of the actions of artillery units- and -Management of the actions of mechanized troops units-.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/24/u-minoborony-nazvaly-najpopulyarnishi-bojovi-speczialnosti-na-yaki-vstupaly-zhinky-u-2024-roczi/	2024-11-23T20:21:40-08:00
The enemy spreads lies about -provocations- in the capital	The training of all structures, forces and departments, which are working out measures to counter provocations that Putin's fakers are constantly seeing, has really begun in Kyiv. As noted the head of KMVA Serhii Popko, these trainings are conducted with the aim of increasing the level of skills, interaction and combat capabilities of all structures that ensure the defense of the capital. Such trainings will continue to be held systematically in Kyiv. They are needed to better prepare for the important task of protecting Kyiv and its residents from potential threats. Therefore, for everyone who works for the enemy in Kyiv, they definitely pose a danger. After all, sooner or later all separatists and collaborators will be discovered and severely punished. But the purpose of the lies spread by faikomets is to sow distrust of the population in the authorities and the Defense Forces. Such -throwbacks- are a typical reaction of the enemy to the strengthening of Ukraine's defense capabilities.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/24/vorog-poshyryuye-brehnyu-shhodo-provokaczij-u-stolyczi/	2024-11-23T20:05:23-08:00
Falling drones due to the work of friendly EW: how to solve the problem	He told this in an interview with Grunt media. -We all understand very well that our EW, at a short distance to the battle line, is fighting enemy UAVs, anti-aircraft missiles, other types of enemy missiles and vehicles. Therefore, in order to work, we always have to personally establish interaction with such units on horizontal lines,- he noted. According to him, it sometimes happens that their groups directly in the execution area come into contact with each neighboring unit, and only then use their means. As reported by ArmyInform, Charlie previously told that over the past year and a half, Russian invaders have learned to quickly adapt and modernize drones.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/23/__trashed-3/	2024-11-23T11:27:05-08:00
Volodymyr Zelensky criticized the G20 summit because of weak support for Ukraine	He said about this while communicating with journalists within the framework of the Third Grain from Ukraine International Conference. The head of state noted that the majority of the Brazilian people support Ukraine, and thanked him for that. At the same time, in his opinion, President Lula da Silva of Brazil, the country that currently chairs the G20 and hosted the summit, has shown a weak stance on the war. -If we want good, normal relations between our nations, between our peoples, then we should probably support people first of all, and not aggressors, leaders of aggression in the world, such as Putin, such as today's, modern Russia,- explained the President of Ukraine . According to him, the weakness shown during the G20 summit gave the Russian dictator the opportunity to hit Ukraine with new missiles during the meeting of the G20 leaders. -I don't think that populism can stop Putin. I don't think cheap energy is going to protect your freedom in the long run. I believe that this is a wrong move,- the head of state noted. Volodymyr Zelenskyy also emphasized: when there will be strong statements, calls and steps, the Russian dictator will not be able to behave as he is doing now. In addition, the President noted that Ukraine raised the issue of reforming the UN Security Council due to its ineffectiveness. -Everyone is talking about this, but the reform of the UN Security Council is not taking place. There are players who do not want any reforms, because otherwise their influence will be less,- said the head of state. The President of Ukraine added that every two or three months, Putin escalates on the front in order to raise the stakes and not sit down at the negotiating table. Without a clear position of the major countries - the United States, Brazil, Asian and African countries - the agreement with Putin will be a delay and a continuation of Russian intimidation. At the same time, all steps proposed by Ukraine to end the war are based on the UN Charter. Our country hopes that its partners will support them. As reported by ArmyInform, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky supports the transition to the corps control system in the ZSU, if it reduces bureaucracy.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/23/volodymyr-zelenskyj-rozkrytykuvav-samit-g20-cherez-slabku-pidtrymku-ukrayiny/	2024-11-23T11:17:17-08:00

Col. Maxim Kayola. -It is staffed by military personnel and civil servants with a history major. We also have an Honored Artist of Ukraine. We try to move away from the specialization of the military for which we produce awards. We also introduce our Ukrainian traditions to encourage soldiers to study history,- he said. According to Maxim Kayol, their task is to make such an award so that the serviceman, when receiving it, feels that the state appreciated what he did. -It's a war right now, so it's very important. And all of this also happens immediately upon contact with the relevant type of troops. They look, we definitely agree with them. If they don't like something, we do it so that everyone is satisfied, there are standards, and our Ukrainian symbols are deployed in the Armed Forces of Ukraine,- he summarized. As reported by ArmyInform, previously the head of the Central Department for the Development of Material Support of the Military Intelligence Servicetold about food standards in the army and the developments that are currently being implemented.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/23/yak-vidbuvayetsya-rozrobka-nagorod-detali-vid-minoborony/	2024-11-23T11:07:54-08:00

-Generals should be in the trenches-: Volodymyr Zelenskyy supports the transition to a corps managem...	About this head of state said during a meeting with media representatives within the framework of the Third International Conference on Food Security Grain from Ukraine. -This is for the military to decide. If the corps system they are proposing today will reduce the distance between the general and the soldier, if this bureaucracy will be reduced, let them do so to reduce it,- the head of state noted. The president emphasized that the task now is to reduce bureaucracy in the army. In particular, this should be taken care of by the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, General Oleksandr Syrskyi. -An officer must see a soldier. A general who has not been in the trenches is not a general for me personally. Despite the experience. With all due respect. Today, the most difficult situation is on the front line, in the trenches,- Volodymyr Zelenskyi noted. According to the President, it is necessary not only to talk about problematic issues at Stavka or in the command headquarters, but also to communicate directly with the soldiers. -That's why Syrsky is always at the front, always traveling. We communicate with him every day, twice a day. He has a morning and evening report. But still this is not enough. The generals must be in the trenches. This is the war. The morale of the military is the most important,- the President emphasized. He also emphasized that Putin's main task now is to oust the Ukrainian military from the Kursk region, and by January 20. -It is very important for him to demonstrate that he is in control of the situation. He is not in control of the situation. The Kursk operation is not a toy. We have shown that Putin is unable to fully defend his state. He threw everything at the occupation and destruction of Ukraine,- the head of state said. In addition, as the President of Ukraine noted, the Russian dictator wants to show that he will allegedly achieve the stated goal of occupying the entire Donbas. -From this and our respective results. Difficulties in the East, yes. Not enough armed forces there, yes. Understaffing exists for a variety of reasons. Specifically, delayed delivery, yes. But nevertheless we are there. We are defending our homeland. And under Putin, there have never been such losses as today in the Kursk direction,- the President summarized. As reported by ArmyInform, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy during the Third International Summit on Food Security Grain from Ukraine metwith the minister of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic Jan Lipavsky and discussed cooperation between Ukraine and the Czech Republic.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/23/generaly-mayut-buty-v-okopah-volodymyr-zelenskyj-pidtrymuye-perehid-na-korpusnu-systemu-upravlinnya-v-zsu/	2024-11-23T10:25:41-08:00
Dodgers in rubber flip-flops were looking for safe shallow water on the Tisza in the snow	About this informs the State Border Service of Ukraine. According to law enforcement officials, the organizers of the illegal crossing offered a rubber boat and instructions on -safe shallow water- for 10,000 US dollars each. The total amount that the violators paid amounted to more than 400 thousand hryvnias. Four men, three from Donetsk region and one from Ivano-Frankivsk region, agreed to these risky conditions. Their plans were destroyed by the border guards who spotted the trespassers. After several warning shots were fired, the offenders left the boat and tried to escape, but were apprehended. The detainees were taken to the border unit, where administrative protocols were drawn up on them under Art. 204-1 of the Criminal Procedure Code (-Illegal crossing or attempted illegal crossing of the state border of Ukraine-) and Art. 185-10 of the Criminal Procedure Code (-Malicious disobedience to a lawful order or demand of a military serviceman or an employee of the State Border Service-). The court will soon evaluate the actions of the detainees. In the meantime, operatives continue their investigation to identify the individuals involved in the organization of this illegal border crossing attempt. ArmyInform reminds that it is better not to break the law or risk your life, but to use the aggregator of vacancies in the Armed Forces and recruiting centers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/23/uhylyanty-v-rezynovyh-shlopanczyah-na-snigu-shukaly-bezpechne-milkovoddya-na-tysi/	2024-11-23T10:13:22-08:00
The Ministry of Defense reported how corruption is prevented	This was told by the head of the Central Directorate for the Development of Material Support of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, Lieutenant Colonel Maksym Kayola. -I had the opportunity to sort employees, both military and civil servants. We have established requirements for their reliability. They were being tested. We have a desire to contribute to our Victory,- he said. The Ministry of Defense also created the Internet platform -Partner MOU-. -Through this platform we work. All requests, all submissions of documents for acts, for military experimental tests must be made through the -MoU Partner-. Why? Because this program is tracked, no applications, no documents will be lost,- he explained. In addition, a technical committee consisting of 11 specialists was established in the MOU for each sector. -They investigate each issue, then meet and make a decision as to compliance or non-compliance. Does this product go to military trials or not; or maybe it needs to be refined. That is, we have created a system that is as transparent as possible, we involve the maximum number of people,- he noted. According to him, in order to prevent corruption, they also involve the Command of the Logistics Forces, the Central Office of Quality Control, the State Rear Operator, so that everyone is in the process and understands what is happening in the MOU. Earlier, the Minister of Defense Rustem Umyerov emphasized the priority of the struggle with corruption in all areas for which his department is responsible. As reported by ArmyInform, the National Agency for the Prevention of Corruption (NACP) together with the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine presented a new study, which identifies the main corruption risks in the rear procurement system for the Armed Forces of Ukraine and offers recommendations for their elimination.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/23/korupczijni-skandaly-yak-u-minoborony-zapobigayut-korupcziyi/	2024-11-23T09:51:59-08:00

About this told the head of the Central Directorate for the Development of Material Support of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, Lieutenant Colonel Maksym Caiola during SMALL TALK. According to him, there will be very big changes in material support, the wishes of the fighters -from the fields- were taken into account. -They have requests to make normal pants with built-in knee pads. The combat shirt will be made of -Coolmax- fabric for moisture removal. Now we are fruitfully working on means of personal protection, such as bulletproof vests and helmets. We have already developed and implemented 8 samples of bulletproof vests and 8 samples of helmets,- said Maxim Kayola. He also reported that a -special ballistic suit- with better protection against shrapnel is currently under development, as shrapnel damage is the predominant one. In addition, a -universal awning- and a -special suit to provide protection against thermal imaging systems- are under development. According to him, this is what our army needs very much. And the task of the management of the development of material support to implement this by the end of the year will be fulfilled. -Also, we are currently developing a women's bulletproof vest. This is very important, because the anthropometric data of women must be taken into account. This is necessary so that it is a little lighter, fits well. So that a woman can perform her tasks like a military serviceman,- emphasized Maxim Kayola. Currently, a -summer special suit- has been developed for women with requirements for their figure. This suit has already been purchased, it is in stock, it is already issued. Management is currently working on underwear for cool and cold winter, winter jacket and pants. -We have anticipated everything our servicewomen want. We will now conduct military experiments, both in the war zone and in the rear areas. After all, before developing something, we always communicate with people from different families, types of troops, to understand what they need, what they want. And they should make what they will use, not what they receive and put somewhere in the closet,- explained Maxim Kayola. As reported by ArmiyaInform, previously the head of the Central Department for the Development of Material Support of the IOM told about the food standards in the army and the developments that are currently being introduced to them.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/23/kostyumy-iz-zahystom-vid-oskolkiv-ta-teplovizijnyh-system-zhinochyj-bronezhylet-novi-rozrobky-minoborony/	2024-11-23T09:02:54-08:00

Decoy drones, repeaters, new enemy tactics: how the occupiers are modernizing UAVs	the commander of the 14th separate regiment of unmanned aviation complexes of the SBS of the Armed Forces of Ukraine told about it under the pseudonym -Charlie- in an interview with -Grunt- media. -For example, a year ago they used exclusively their -geranium-shaheds-, and now they have changed their tactics a little: they put various types of equipment on their shaheds, put video communication channels that help them detect various moments on our territory,- he noted . According to him, the first few drones are -going for detection-, other drones are already directed directly to the target. -They use baits, this was not the case before. That is, decoy drones are launched in front of the Shaheds, which discharge our air defense system,- explained Charlie. As he noted, if we talk about Russian intelligence tools, they are modernizing visual surveillance systems that allow them to work in different weather conditions, time of day and observe at a greater distance. They also use different types of repeaters that allow them to fly over long distances. -Today, we see that their reconnaissance drones directly fly to such cities as Dnipro, Poltava. Therefore, unfortunately, they are not in place,- Charlie emphasized. However, according to him, thanks to caring people and organizations that help the Defense Forces, an effective system for countering the enemy's reconnaissance UAVs is currently set up. In addition, the commander of the 14th separate regiment of the BpAK spoke about providing his unit with -wings-. -50 percent is provided by measures from the side of partners, if we are talking specifically about intelligence wings. 50% are partners, 30% are the state and 20% are volunteers,- he said. We will remind, the Armed Forces of Ukraine have started work first training school for operators of unmanned ground robotic complexes (BpNK). As reported by ArmyInform, in the Forces of unmanned systems name the specialists who are in the greatest need: drivers of various categories, clerks, repairmen of various electrical appliances.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/23/drony-prymanky-retranslyatory-nova-taktyka-voroga-yak-okupanty-modernizuyut-bpla/	2024-11-23T08:08:17-08:00
Torture, abuse and training -specialists-: the GUR spoke about the torture system of the Russian Fed...	told this during a speech at the forum -Genocidal practices of the Russian Federation in Ukraine: from the Holodomor to Russian-Ukrainian War- representative of the State Department of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine Andriy Yusov. He cited the facts about the system of violating the rights of prisoners built in the Russian Federation. -In most cases, it was not about the use of force to obtain information. These are intentional tortures to break a person's resistance, break their personality, degrade their dignity and force them to give up everything that is valuable to that person. Or to break someone who is close to him,- said Andriy Yusov. According to him, a whole system of torture operates in the aggressor country. -Individuals are responsible for this. This is how individual -specialists- are trained - the types of torture are described, and they learn from them. This is something that cannot be imagined by any representative of a Western civilized country,- he noted. Andriy Yusov also noted that the structures responsible for monitoring the observance and protection of the Geneva Conventions and humanitarian law do not actually work. -Yes, we are talking about the International Committee of the Red Cross, which Russia, on the one hand, is effectively depriving it of the opportunity to work: it does not allow access to places of detention, does not involve it in training and exchanges. At the same time, the position of the ICRC, frankly speaking, in many cases should be much more proactive,- stressed Andriy Yusov. He emphasized that it is not Ukraine as a victim that should talk about the recorded -absolutely flagrant- examples of violations of the Geneva Conventions on the part of the Russian Federation, but those structures that are responsible for monitoring their observance and implementation. He reminded that even in these difficult conditions, Ukraine continues to work on the return from captivity of our captured defenders and kidnapped civilians. During the full-scale invasion, 58 exchanges already took place: almost 4 thousand Ukrainians managed to return home. -Unfortunately, thousands of others are still in question. And it is necessary to fight for them: both for the military and for the civilians,- emphasized Andriy Yusov. We will remind you that in October-November of this year 13 criminal proceedings were registered /a> according to the facts of the shooting of 54 Ukrainian prisoners of war. This is a third of all proceedings initiated in 2024 on such facts. As reported by ArmyInform, the Prosecutor General's Office reported on the initiated investigation into the fact shooting by Russian servicemen of five captured soldiers of the Armed Forces near Vugledar.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/23/tortury-znushhannya-i-pidgotovka-speczialistiv-u-gur-rozpovily-pro-systemu-katuvan-rf/	2024-11-23T07:54:50-08:00

Before the assault - 12 km on foot: why in Kharkiv Oblast the occupiers have no other choice	The commander of the battalion of strike unmanned aviation complexes of the 92nd separate brigade named after Koshovo told about this on the air of -Suspilne Novosti- chieftain of Ivan Sirk, Yury Fedorenko. — In Kupyan region, in some areas, they go to the front line of a combat clash up to 12 km away. -Imagine - 12 km carrying everything, in order to then switch to shock-assault actions,- he said. The officer explained why the Russian military is forced to act in this way. — Why exactly such a shade? Because everything that appears from transport on the battlefield - two-wheeled motorcycles, buggies, lightly armored and armored vehicles - is immediately taken under fire control by our guns, anti-tank weapons and, accordingly, UAVs. As a result, it is being destroyed, the military said. The drone commander reported what percentage of Russian equipment is destroyed on the battlefield. -Statistics say that 90-95% of lightly armored and armored vehicles that end up in the affected area burn up on the battlefield or are seriously damaged,- he said.

According to the investigation, during the capture of the village of Dvorichna by Russian troops, the policeman voluntarily began working for the Russian occupation authorities.

Shooting lists and mobile crematoria: Russia planned the genocide of Ukrainians long before the inva...	This was announced the head of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, Lieutenant General Kyrylo Budanov, during the forum -Genocidal Practices Russian Federation in Ukraine: from the Holodomor to the Russian-Ukrainian War-, which took place on November 22, 2024. According to Kirill Budanov, the preparation included the creation of firing lists, the deployment of mobile mobile crematoria and the organization of mass burials. Russian propaganda and the state machine called for the destruction of Ukrainians, based on theses voiced in Putin's article published in July 2021. In this article, the Russian dictator denied the right of Ukrainians to exist, which became the ideological basis of future crimes. Kyrylo Budanov noted that total Ukrainophobia has become not only the policy of the Russian authorities, but also a mandatory public conviction. Before the start of the invasion, the occupiers were briefed on the location of mass graves and the compilation of firing lists. They planned to include Ukrainian language and literature teachers, ATO veterans, journalists, priests, public figures and others who supported Ukrainian statehood. The head of the GUR MOU emphasized that the mass crimes of the Russian military in Buch, Borodyanka, Gostomel, Izyum, Mariupol and other cities were not chaotic, but planned and synchronous. These actions were based on the doctrinal provisions of the Russian genocidal policy. The forum, in addition to military experts, was attended by Holodomor researchers, historians, public representatives and foreign guests, who discussed the crimes of the Russian government against the Ukrainian people, which have continued since the Holodomor until today. As reported by ArmyInform, the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Rustem Umyerov addressed Ukrainians on the Holodomor Memorial Day, emphasizing the importance of preserving historical memory and countering Russian aggression.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/23/rozstrilni-spysky-ta-mobilni-krematoriyi-rosiya-planuvala-genoczyd-ukrayincziv-zadovgo-do-vijny/	2024-11-23T01:33:07-08:00
An ambulance that will not come: Russia has brought a decline in the medicine of the occupied Luhans...	This was reported by Artem Lysohor, the head of the Luhansk Regional Military Administration. In many cities, even before, only one ambulance crew was on duty per shift, as a result of which calls often went unanswered, and patients waited for hours. Tragic cases when people did not wait for a doctor have repeatedly become a reason for criticism. Although the number of special vehicles allegedly increased on paper, the real ambulances provided by Russia disappeared without a trace. Instead, doctors, paramedics and drivers are now being cut. In Starobilsk, air alerts are regularly announced, even when there is no threat in the neighboring areas or in the entire -rear- part of the -LNR-. During such events, propaganda meetings are held in schools, during which children are moved to damp, unfurnished basements, where anti-Ukrainian lectures are organized. In addition, the occupation administration regularly organizes meetings of children with the Russian military, using them to plant propaganda. These actions of the occupiers cause increasing indignation among the population, which is faced with the decline of the medical field and aggressive propaganda in educational institutions. As reported by ArmyInform, in Alchevsk, as well as in other settlements of the temporarily occupied Luhansk region, the situation with the removal of garbage has remained critical for more than ten years. Spontaneous landfills continue to grow, and instead of solving the problem the occupation administration chose the path of repression, installing more than 100 video surveillance cameras to fine citizens for littering.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/23/shvydka-shho-ne-pryyide-rosiya-prynesla-zanepad-u-medyczyni-okupovanoyi-luganshhyny/	2024-11-23T01:11:12-08:00

These groups, although penetrating the rear, remain blocked - unable to bring up ammunition, receive reinforcements or establish supplies. Groups reveal themselves over time and are destroyed. -Against our boys are regular units of the Russian Armed Forces - fighters who are being trained for combat operations in the conditions of urban development and drone warfare. They are well equipped and ready to carry out assaults,- noted the representative of the 24th OMBr. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that the occupiers near Chasovoy Yar are blocking themselves.

The officer explained the purpose of the Russian invaders. - They are there in a certain waiting mode, while the strike group is assembled, which begins active operations from the front. And that's when they step up to destabilize the situation, damage our reserves, mortars and other firepower, the military said. However, the Defense Forces are well aware of this insidious enemy tactic and effectively counter it. — Since we are talking about this with you, the Defense Forces are very well aware of such tactics of the enemy, since he has been using them since the beginning of an essentially full-scale war. Only now it is gaining a larger volume, said the commander of the Ukrainian drones. Ukrainian defenders timely detect the occupiers hidden in the pixel and eliminate them or capture them. - The vast majority of these groups are detected by the Defense Forces, eliminated and captured when the opportunity arises. But not all of them surrender, so they are mostly liquidated, said Yuriy Fedorenko. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that occupiers dressed in Ukrainian uniforms are effectively detected on the field battle.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/23/aktyvizuyutsya-shhob-destabilizuvaty-sytuacziyu-yak-diyut-perevdyagnuti-u-piksel-okupanty/	2024-11-22T23:57:11-08:00

Kupyan adventure in kamikaze mode: the Armed Forces explained how the Russians managed to jump into ...	told the commander of the battalion of strike unmanned aviation complexes of the 92nd separate brigade named after the Kosh Ataman Ivan Sirk Yuriy Fedorenko told about this. — The situation unfolded as follows: taking advantage of the unfavorable weather conditions - the fog, which was thick enough, the enemy in kamikaze mode used one unit of armored equipment, such as a tank with trawls that removes mine barriers, and two MTLB. These are combat armored vehicles for transporting, in particular, infantry units, he said. For the place of an unexpected attack, the enemy chose an area least suitable for the use of armored vehicles. -At high speed, [the Russians] jumped in at the place that is the least passable for lightly armored and armored vehicles,- explained the soldier. However, as soon as the equipment and manpower of the occupiers were discovered by the fighters of the Defense Forces, the enemy was inflicted with fire damage. The equipment was burned, and the landing party was partly destroyed, partly captured. - As soon as they crossed this line, they were detected by the Defense Forces, after which a fire was inflicted, as a result of which the tank was burned, two MTLBs were burned, and the enemy's assault infantry was eliminated, - Yuriy Fedorenko said. Those of the Russian military who were lucky enough to be captured provided important intelligence.

Is it possible to freeze the war: the expert told when the new phase of the conflict will begin	-There will be a great truce after all. We will not miss it. Why? In order for it not to exist, the Russian Federation must lose the war. The loss in the war of the Russian Federation, if we go to the borders of 1991, is its disintegration. It is reinforced concrete. But there is no solution to its disintegration. If there is no such solution, then in some part there will be a frozen conflict - exit from the phase of hostilities. As soon as this -freeze- or suspension of hostilities takes place, both we and they will go into military capacity building. It will be so without fail. And if at this moment of the historic truce a decision is not taken on the collapse of the Russian Federation, then the next Russian-Ukrainian war is only a matter of time. It can be in half a year, it can be in a year. I am a fan of the version that is at least five years old. Because they still have to recover. At this moment, the Russian Federation has lost within 50% of its convention potential. With the exception of nuclear. It is still very powerful - the second on the planet Earth. Because this war will only end when they are defeated or get their way. That is, they will join Ukraine to Russia. But, in my opinion, this is already impossible in this historical context. For two simple reasons. First, we are supported by the entire civilized world. And primarily the Anglo-Saxons. This is very fundamental. And the second important point is that we managed to keep the capital. There is even such a historical saying: -who owns Kyiv, owns Ukraine.- They are doomed to defeat. The only question is when this defeat will come. But they cannot refuse us, because it is part of their social ideology. Lenin has a brilliant saying for this case: -losing Ukraine is the same as losing one's head.- State identity is the most powerful feature of any human community. And their state identity sprouts from the concept of our Kyivan Rus. That's how everything will be. I am sure that in the next phase of the war we will achieve a historic victory.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/23/chy-mozhlyva-zamorozka-vijny-ekspert-rozpoviv-koly-rozpochnetsya-nova-faza-konfliktu/	2024-11-22T21:12:50-08:00
Ready for any mission: a surveillance drone with ultra-fast transformation properties was presented ...	Presenting its aircraft, this firm, headquartered in Arlington, Virginia, on the official portal said's Group 2 eVTOL autonomous drone, the P550, redefines battlefield adaptability, setting a new standard for rapid deployment in any environment, ArmyInform reports. The goal of the new P550 project was to create an unmanned aircraft with high flight and operational characteristics. Representatives of AeroVironment note that there are already UAVs on the market that are equipped with effective reconnaissance and/or weapons, as well as devices capable of flying for several hours. Within the framework of the new project, the company sought to combine all these qualities in one drone. To simplify the design process, the design of the P550 used many ideas and components from existing products. The main sources were drones well-known in the United States military Puma and Raven by AeroVironment. At the same time, it was not possible without the introduction of new solutions and components. As a result, a medium-sized UAV was created, capable of vertical takeoff and landing, as well as a horizontal flight lasting several hours. The P550 may carry reconnaissance equipment, a communications relay, light weapons, or other equipment. Currently, the new UAV is undergoing flight tests, during which it demonstrates its capabilities and confirms the correctness of the applied technical solutions. After the tests are completed, the company will be able to offer this drone to potential customers. For obvious reasons, the main commercial hopes are tied to the Pentagon. The P550 product is an unmanned aircraft with a classic aerodynamic scheme. At the same time, its design has some features due to which additional working and operational capabilities are achieved, as well as important advantages are provided. The P550 UAV has a torpedo-shaped fuselage, complemented by a thin tubular tail beam. A mid-positioned wing with a slight sweep is combined with the fuselage. Near the centerplane on the wing are two compact nacelles of marching engines. At a distance from them, longer gondolas with lifting propeller groups are placed. Tail feathers are traditional, with stabilizer and keel. For transportation, the drone is separated into several units. All of them fit into three containers that can be transported by any vehicle. Pre-launch assembly takes minutes and is done without any tools: it takes less than 10 minutes to prepare for flight after unpacking. The total length of such a drone reaches 2.7 m, the wingspan is 4.25 m. The maximum take-off weight is set at 25 kg and includes a significant payload. For example, a drone can carry up to 7 kilograms of explosives. The AeroVironment company classifies the P550 as the 2nd group of UAVs according to the Pentagon's classification. The drone has six traction electric motors with propellers. Four are placed on wing nacelles and provide vertical take-off, landing and hovering. Two more are on the wing and provide horizontal flight. Engine types and specifications are not disclosed. The flight data of the UAV is also still unknown. It was only reported that the P550 will be able to stay in the air for up to 5 hours. The communication range is 40 km, but can be increased to 60 km. In all configurations and configurations, the drone has an autopilot and a remote control system. They must interact with the operator and carry out his commands, as well as control the payload of all types in solving any assigned tasks. The control panel reportedly has software to automatically process intelligence data. A special program based on artificial intelligence should study the picture from the cameras and look for potential targets to hit on it. Such software should simplify the operator's work and increase the speed of the entire unmanned intelligence system. The issue of installing and replacing the payload is solved in a rather interesting way. A removable part of the fuselage, which includes the nose fairing and part of the bottom, is designated for the placement of various devices. The module with the necessary equipment is attached to the centerplane of the wing, and the UAV receives the necessary functions. All module variants are equipped with optical-electronic systems. -Bullets- of various types carry video cameras, thermal imagers and/or laser rangefinders. It is possible to use other equipment. So, at the AUSA 2024 exhibition, as the Shephard publication informs, showed modules with a radio signal repeater and a weapons carrier module. The combat variant of the P550 carries a swappable module with a pair of pylons on the bottom. At the exhibition UAV on them placed Shryke-type small-scale guided bombs. The principle possibility of using other ammunition is reported. AeroVironment is currently studying such possibilities and plans to expand its range of repellents. The company AeroVironment proposes to use its new P550 UAV in military units at the tactical level. With its help, the army units will be able to effectively solve several basic tasks, and it is expected that the efficiency of such processes will increase. The successful application of the new UAV should be facilitated by its high characteristics as an aerial platform. This drone is easy to operate, able to take off from small areas and stay in the air for several hours. Not all modern drones of this class can boast of such capabilities. Three variants of variable payload modules have already been created for the P550. With their help, the drone can perform various tasks: conduct reconnaissance, target guidance, relay signals or use weapons. The ability to solve various tasks with one UAV as such is a plus. In addition, they have their own capabilities and advantages of various modules, devices and weapons. The automation of intelligence processes is of great interest. It is claimed that the software of the unmanned complex is capable of analyzing images from optical-electronic systems and finding various objects. If this feature is fully implemented, the P550 will become a much more user-friendly reconnaissance tool and give it a significant advantage over the competition. However, the P550 has its drawbacks. Its main problems are common to all such UAVs. First of all, this is the dependence on radio communication and vulnerability for modern air defense. In addition, this project implements several bold ideas that may have some technical risk. Therefore, the AeroVironment company continues to develop existing UAVs and create new models based on them. During these processes, innovative solutions and technologies are developed and implemented, aimed at improving the main characteristics and expanding working capabilities. Another result of such activity was shown in October at the exhibition AUSA 2024 . Now the new UAV P550 must go through all the necessary tests and confirm the declared potential. And even after that, future customers have to decide whether they need such a smart and versatile new drone. Reconnaissance and strike unmanned aerial vehicle P550.

- Adrenaline is going through the roof. Class!-: paintball training was included in the combat train...	According to the plan of the institute's management, the training was supposed to stimulate team actions of cadets in combat groups during search and sweep in an urbanized area. Practical training is based on the scenarios of real combat experience of teachers. Reconciliation, cohesion, mutual support and mutual assistance are the main priorities in the training of future officers. -Alone in the field is not a warrior! Only the team wins. This should be the philosophy of the signalman's victory,- says the deputy head of the institute for psychological support of personnel, Colonel Oleg Petrovskyi. He is convinced that only practical work on training grounds can form a new quality of servicemen, give them the necessary skills to handle weapons in extreme combat conditions. Almost an hour of grueling confrontation between yellow and blue: conventional opponents, but with real physical and psycho-emotional stress. In addition to the tasks of destroying a hypothetical enemy, the cadets practiced the basics of first aid in the area under fire in the scope of self and mutual aid. -For the first few minutes, I couldn't calm myself down, then I was panting, I remembered what was taught at the institute during combat and psychological training, and - I rushed! - says one of the cadets. The guys willingly share their thoughts: -And even though you understand the conventionality of the fight, the adrenaline still goes through the roof. Class!- Military psychologists call this method operational stress sensitization. It is the best practical method of entering the military profession and forming combat readiness. Practicing tactical actions by cadets in the conditions of intense training combat also ensures the development of critically needed marksmanship skills. Paintball training has already been included in the combat training program of the institute and consistently arouses great interest among cadets.

Rams interfere the most in combat shootings: about the features of BZVP at Interflex in Britain	ArmyInform correspondent tells about the firing of live cartridges during the BZVP within the framework of the Interflex multinational training mission in Great Britain. Firing live rounds is the final element of the entire training course of basic general military training. By this time, the soldiers have been regularly dealing with weapons for several weeks and have fired at least 700−800, and some even 1000−1200 blank cartridges during training exercises. While we fire blanks during tactical exercises, practice changing magazines, and cleaning our assault rifles, the instructors keep a close eye on how we treat weapons and follow safety rules. Even though the grades are not reported to us, it is clear from the comments themselves that the instructors grade us quite meticulously. It is noticeable that they observe and record all our actions, discuss us among themselves and inform each other about the positive features and problematic points in the training of each cadet. So when it comes to combat shooting, no one causes I am surprised that one soldier from the platoon is not allowed to join them. Systematic indiscipline and inattention to weapons take their toll - he does not go to the range on any of the following days, during which there is intense firing with live ammunition. of us For some, they also related to the handling of weapons, but everyone tried to correct mistakes and eliminate shortcomings. It seems that he is the only one not only for the entire first platoon, but also for the entire company, because everyone else has well learned the basic rules of behavior with weapons. Some may be less skilled or accurate than others, but they certainly won't pose a danger through carelessness or sloppiness. Safety rules at British shooting ranges are quite strict and foreign instructors strictly enforce them. At the same time, the control is triple. We are watched by the British, as representatives of the host country, the instructors of the country that conduct the training, as well as the Ukrainian instructors and the platoon leader. Every time we receive a full briefing from the responsible instructor, we are in the waiting area in full protective equipment , and stores equipped with cartridges are obtained only when entering the firing line. We set up a store, load and open fire only under individual commands of instructors. Extreme responsibility and vigilance will eventually give the desired result - during the entire time of combat firing, not a single problematic, but even unfortunate incident will happen. And this is despite the fact that we shoot a lot, especially when we move from -stationary- shooting to simulated combat. During the entire time of firing live cartridges, each of us shoots at least 500−600 bullets. Those who showed increased activity easily increase this indicator to 750−800 cartridges or even double to 1000. Starting to count shots from the first day, I am already losing count on the second day. And in the last three training days, I generally shoot more than 200, 250, and 300 rounds during exercises, respectively. I will not be surprised if some of the cadets have even higher scores. — asks the instructor in the evening of the penultimate day. -Can you still shoot? Then shoot,- I answer. -Great, but this is already the last store, it has 20 cartridges,- he says and hands me the rest of today's ammunition. In 15 minutes I will regret my decision, because I will be forced to catch up with my brothers, who have already started disassembling and cleaning weapons But not now - another rehearsal of fire contact with a hypothetical enemy is ahead while patrolling the territory. Despite the fact that by the end of the evening I had already managed to get exhausted, this time everything works out as best as possible - it is difficult to do something for the tenth time and not correct the mistakes made during the first few attempts. This is one of the exercises during the execution which we shoot or the most bullets, moving between trees and changing position. More interesting and more difficult than it is only work in pairs or fours, when we alternately cover each other, firing at a hypothetical enemy at the time when the partner changes position. It is easier to practice this exercise on the training ground, however, after all, we are given the same task in the forest, where it is impossible to move in a straight line and maintain eye contact between all fighters. Forced to run between trees, we inevitably break the interval and straight line set from the beginning, and also lose sight of the other members of the group. It remains to be guided by voice commands. -Hide, hide!- — I hear from somewhere to the left. -I'm running!- - I shout back with all my might and make a dash for 20 meters forward to a rhizome that is convenient as a cover. Shots are heard on the left, but in a few seconds I, having fallen under a tree trunk, shoot and shout: -Hide, hide!- Constantly maintaining communication between fighters and duplicating commands is one of the most important requirements of instructors, and completion of training in our -small infantry groups-, we already do it without thinking. -Drone!-, -arta!-, -grenade!- - the one who first reacted to the danger shouts the loudest. Others pick up and repeat the shout, confirming that they have heard and understood the warning and passing it on. This skill will be most needed on the last day of training, when we simulate a defensive battle and must maintain contact with our nearest neighbors in the chances and between two adjacent chances. Then you have to shout very loudly, especially to the commanders of the units who have to coordinate the actions of the fighters. The simulation of mortar -arrivals-, especially when the charges explode very close, is quite convincing, and the crackle of live rounds is as loud as in real combat. It is difficult to shout over the roar of explosions and the numerous sounds of gunfire, but it is necessary , because the completion of the task and the survival of the unit depend on it. We give our all, and we do it also because we know that today is the final day of training. It was on that day that each of us managed to shoot the most rounds in one training day - sometimes by chance and along with with them, the casings lay in several layers and crunched under the berets. The number of rounds fired is the best evidence that training firings are combat rounds during BZVP at Interflex in Great Britain are extremely tense and intense. Only two circumstances can stop them. The first is a problem with one of the fighters or his weapon. Then, loudly repeated three times by the instructor or any of the participants, the command -Stop, stop, stop!- must immediately stop the shooting. This never happened during the training of our platoon. On the other hand, the second circumstance occurred several times and made us wait for several tens of minutes until the problem was solved. It concerned local residents — sheep and rams, whose herds grazed near the shooting site and occasionally wandered into the zone of possible damage. As soon as the observers noticed that the rams again approached the dangerous zone for them, the command was immediately sounded. stop shooting Soon, a specially trained dog was brought on a pickup truck, which flew out of the car window in a flash and rushed towards the violators, driving them to a safe place. From several minutes to half an hour passed, and the four-legged commander of the rams returned, jumped into the pickup truck and with the look of a winner left to return in the event of the next security breach. We, having received an unexpected break thanks to the rams, resumed shooting.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/23/barany-na-bojovyh-strilbah-zavazhayut-najbilshe-pro-osoblyvosti-bzvp-na-interflex-u-brytaniyi/	2024-11-22T20:31:01-08:00
Today, Ukraine commemorates the victims of the Holodomor	In 1932–1933, the communist totalitarian regime committed the crime of genocide against the Ukrainian people. Today, the Rashists, as the heirs of that regime, are once again committing crimes against humanity and genocidal acts on Ukrainian soil. This year, for the third time, we honor the victims of the communist genocide in the context of the large-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine. The tragic events that we are going through testify that living memory is extremely important. Those who commit crimes against humanity must be condemned by the world community and the victims must be honored. Then, as now, the enemy's goal was to destroy the Ukrainian people as a national group. The communist totalitarian regime, due to the forcible withdrawal of food, the blockade of villages and entire districts, the ban on travel outside the borders of famine-stricken Ukraine, the curtailment of rural trade, and repression against dissenters created conditions for Ukrainians incompatible with life. The Holodomor became possible because, during the Liberation Struggle, Ukrainians could not withstand the large-scale invasion of Russian troops and establish the democratic Ukrainian People's Republic, proclaimed in 1917 in Kyiv. the Russian Bolsheviks seized the territory of the Ukrainian People's Republic by direct occupation and proclaimed the creation of their own quasi-state of the USSR with the center in Kharkiv. In the USSR, which included the territory of the Ukrainian state captured by the Bolsheviks, a totalitarian communist regime with a strict social hierarchy was established. Any expression of dissent was immediately brutally punished and suppressed. Because of this, almost the entire Ukrainian nation, which had a huge cultural and historical heritage, its own glorious traditions of state-building, and the experience of the national liberation struggle, immediately found itself -outlawed.- The occupation of Ukraine led to numerous crimes, mass repressions, terror, deportations. But the primary goal was the destruction of Ukrainians as a political nation that could raise the question of creating an independent state. To achieve this goal, the horrible tool chosen was starvation. The mechanism of forcible procurement of bread, which led to the Holodomor, was set in motion from Moscow. In less than a calendar year (1932–1933), millions of people died in Ukraine. Mortality exceeded the average level by 8-9 or more times, especially many children died. To this day, the terrible circumstances of the crime and the deliberate ban on keeping death statistics make it impossible to establish the exact number of dead. The Holodomor led to moral and psychological changes in the nation's consciousness. The consequence of the crime of genocide was the destruction of the traditional Ukrainian way of life. The year 1933 was a time of national catastrophe for Ukraine, the consequences of which are felt to this day. Today, the Russians are once again using genocidal methods against Ukrainians to destroy our identity, culture, and language. Therefore, the modern Russian-Ukrainian war is aimed not only at destroying the independence of the Ukrainian state, but also at destroying Ukrainians as an independent people, as a nation. Putin in the 21st century, like Stalin in the 20th, resorted to genocide because other methods of subjugating the Ukrainian people did not work. Stalin organized a total confiscation of food, a blockade, mass terror. Putin used a full-scale military invasion with atrocities, violations of international laws and customs of war. Terror, mass murders, deliberate attacks on shelters, evacuation routes and humanitarian corridors, bombing of residential areas, sexual violence, military sieges, deportations (forcible displacement of Ukrainians, in particular children) became the components of the genocidal policy of the Russian Federation against Ukraine. During the Holodomor, the leadership of the USSR deliberately disoriented the world public, made special statements about the absence of hunger in the country. The regime refused foreign aid, and the totalitarian Moscow government sold seized bread to other countries for foreign currency, which was used to purchase machine tools and other equipment for industrial enterprises. Today, the democratic world is well aware of what is happening in Ukraine and supports us. The security and defense forces of Ukraine are heroically resisting the enemy. And each of us, remembering the crimes of the Moscow totalitarian regime in the 20th century, directs all our efforts to support our defenders. In the conditions of ongoing Russian aggression, our memory of the Holodomor of 1932-1933 is a factor in the social mobilization of Ukrainians and the world community to oppose the aggressor. So let's remember in the National Minute of Silence on November 23 at 4:00 p.m. the millions of human lives that Ukraine lost due to the Holodomor and massive artificial famines organized on orders from Moscow. Let's visit the places of memory of the Holodomor victims in our locality, and with the onset of darkness, let's light candles of memory wherever we are. After all, every light is a manifestation of our sorrow, memory and faith in the future inevitable Victory over the aggressor.

Rospropaganda spreads a false video: a photo helped to expose the fake	As -evidence-, a video is shown where a woman, presenting herself as the wife of the deceased, claims that her husband is not on the lists of military personnel. For specialists StopFake was able to identify the person in the photo and find out the circumstances that contradict the information provided in the video. In the fake video, which is a hostile production, the woman says that she cannot receive the benefits promised by the state. According to her, she allegedly -called the headquarters-, where she was told that the man -is not on the lists-. At the same time, she does not mention her name, her husband's name, or the headquarters to which she addressed. The photograph that the woman in the video was holding helped to expose this fake. It depicts the defender of Azovstal Andriy Kainara, who was captured by the Russians in Mariupol. After a year and a half in captivity, Kainar was exchanged and he returned to serve in the 56th brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. On the website of the non-governmental organization Polygon 56 Berdyansk, which takes care of the families of missing prisoners and fallen soldiers, a photo of Andrii Kainara, taken on the occasion of his return from captivity, was found. On it, he is depicted with Olena Dobycha, the head of this organization. On September 18, 2024, she announced his death on her personal Facebook page. The photo featured in the fake video was published by the Ukrainian mass media in a report on the death of Andrii Kainara near Bakhmut in September 2024. StopFake contacted Olena Dobycha to view the video being circulated and to comment on the -delisting- situation. According to her, this video is an -absolute fake-, primarily because Kainara did not have a wife, but only a sister. The obvious goal of this and similar fakes is to undermine the trust of Ukrainian citizens in state institutions, in particular in the Armed Forces and authorities. Propaganda seeks to create the impression that the state allegedly does not fulfill its obligations to the families of fallen soldiers, which can sow despair and demoralization among the population.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/23/rospropaganda-poshyryuye-nepravdyve-video-vykryty-fejk-dopomogla-fotografiya/	2024-11-22T20:01:27-08:00

Thanks for the rescue: Tauri paratroopers captured two Russians	This is stated in a message on the Facebook page of the 79th separate Airborne Assault Brigade of the Tavriya Brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. One of the prisoners from the Moscow region, 41 years old. The second is from Dagestan, 56 years old. They say they joined the army not for an idea, but for money, which in the end they never got. The occupying army deceived them here as well. Despite complaints about their health, both of them were thrown to the front line and given the order to -fortify- in the forest lane. Instead, they were quickly -fixed- by Ukrainian soldiers. Both are afraid: at the front - less than a month, and at the positions - for the first time. They did not shoot and had no intention of fighting. When they heard the explosion of a grenade, they immediately decided to surrender. The captives thank the Taurian paratroopers for saving their lives, providing medical care and normal treatment.

People know everything, they have been notified, Serhiy Gorbunov explains. Such security measures are fully justified, because earlier in many settlements near the line of combat, the Russian occupiers repeatedly resorted to insidious tactics of repeated strikes. The military armies of the Russian Federation attacked the emergency rescue services, medics, energy workers and utility workers when they arrived at the site of the preliminary shelling to provide aid to the victims and eliminate the consequences of the shelling. At the site of the previous shelling, which On November 20, utility workers are also working, dismantling debris and removing construction debris. Here, as a result of the Russian strike, six people were injured, and 10 multi-story buildings were damaged. Local residents are trying to reach half-destroyed homes, where it is safe to do so, hoping to save the remains of destroyed property. A few dogs try to flatter anyone who pays attention to them. They used to live together with other people in these destroyed houses, and now, together with their owners, they became homeless as a result of another Russian shelling.

The Military Law and Order Service talked about three options for returning to service after the SZH	About this in an interview with ArmiyaInform, the deputy chief of the Main Department of the Military Law and Order Service, Colonel Oleksandr Grynchuk, said. The first option concerns servicemen, about whom information has already been entered in the Unified Register of Pretrial Investigations. In such a case, the serviceman can independently, at the stage of the pre-trial investigation, apply in writing to the investigator, the prosecutor, directly to the court or come to the nearest administrative body of the VSP. But there are still certain conditions. In particular, this applies to servicemen who have committed FGM for the first time. There must also be a written consent of the commander of the military unit to continue his military service. The second most common return option. It applies to servicemen who have committed a felony, the duration of which did not exceed three days. That is, before the acquisition of signs of a criminal offense. In this case, this serviceman can independently return to the military unit to continue his service. The commander has to find out the circumstances why the serviceman committed the SZH. And then disciplinary responsibility is applied to him. The third option is when a serviceman who has committed a criminal offense wants to return to service, and at the same time, the information about the offense is not entered in the EDPR. That is, 3 days have already passed, according to the disciplinary statute, the commander of the military unit has appointed an official investigation, which can last a month, but there are also different situations. If the official investigation has not been completed or the investigator has sent the materials for revision, and the information has not yet been entered into the ERDR, such a serviceman with the participation of the VSP is delivered to the reserve battalions that are part of the Armed Forces. There is an algorithm approved by the Commander-in-Chief, and in reserve battalions such a serviceman is transferred to military units and units of the Armed Forces. Depending on the situation, a decision is made to return him to service: either to the place where he served, or to another place.

Ukrainian companies are leading in international tenders for the production of drones	About this informs the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. In addition, in terms of the number of applications for the production of interceptor drones, Ukrainian UAV manufacturers became the first - submitting 32% of the total number. In advanced FPV drones, our companies were second with a result of 26% of submitted proposals. Kateryna Chernogorenko emphasized that such a number of proposals from our companies proves that we are achieving the goal of scaling drone production in Ukraine. -It is already helping to create an asymmetric advantage in technology over the enemy. Especially in the context of interceptor drones, as our companies have the best expertise in the manufacture and application of such technologies. We want to push the world industry so that such drones go into mass production,- said the Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine for Digitalization. Applications for the production of advanced FPV drones ended in October. The call for proposals for the interceptor drones ended on November 11. Companies that win the tenders will receive orders for drones that will be tested and evaluated. If their designs show good results at this stage, larger orders for FPV drones from the winning manufacturers are planned. The agency recalled that the Drone Coalition was created in February 2024 during the 19th Ramstein-style meeting. The initiative was proposed by Latvia and is jointly coordinated with Great Britain. Currently, the Drone Coalition includes 16 partner countries. Ukraine has already received thousands of drones as part of the initiative. It is expected that another 20,000 to 30,000 drones will be purchased and delivered on top of the joint procurement funds already accumulated by the Coalition (€71 million). As ArmiyaInform reported, Ukrainian FPV drones developed by Brave1 teams successfully tested for resistance to work in conditions of active radio electronic suppression (REB).	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/22/ukrayinski-kompaniyi-lidyruyut-na-mizhnarodnyh-tenderah-na-vyrobnycztvo-droniv/	2024-11-22T00:34:12-08:00

Ukraine is looking for innovative technologies to combat the aggressor's drones	Mykhailo Fedorov wrote about this in his Telegram channel. Drones play a key role in modern warfare, and Russian forces actively use them for large-scale operations. To counter this threat, the initiative platform Brave1 together with the investment fund D3 is organizing the Jammer Hackathon, the goal of which is to create innovative systems to combat UAVs. Basic development requirements: Hackathon participants can be programmers, engineers, mathematicians, researchers, students, and startups. Teams will have the opportunity to develop their projects and present them to a professional jury. The best solutions will receive funding for further implementation. Registration is open until November 25. -Your decision can be decisive in the fight for our victory,- Mykhailo Fedorov emphasized.

Notarial isolation: documents in the occupied Luhansk region became unreachable	This was reported by Artem Lysohor, the head of the Luhansk Regional Military Administration. In Severodonetsk, the occupation authorities limited the possibility of applying to notaries. Previously, services were provided by a notary from Lysychansk, who came once or twice a week. However, after the prohibition of the so-called -extraterritorial principle- of service, citizens from Severodonetsk are prohibited from using the services of notaries in other cities of the -LNR-. Currently, one notary has been appointed in the city, but the documents pending in other settlements have not yet been handed over. The queue for a notary is scheduled until the spring of 2025, which creates significant difficulties for the population, forcing them to wait for months. In Starobilsk there is an increase in control over the school process. Teachers, cooperating with the occupying power structures, conduct informal surveys among the parents of students, finding out their attitude to the teaching of the Ukrainian language. Despite this, the return of the Ukrainian language to the school curriculum in the occupied territories is not foreseen. Such actions are aimed at identifying residents who are -disloyal- to the Russian authorities. According to Artem Lysohor, these cases are another example of oppression of the local population in the temporarily occupied territories of Luhansk region. As reported by ArmyInform, to the temporarily occupied territories of the Luhansk region /->funds for the implementation of the housing restoration program have arrived. However, in three years, from 2024 to 2026, only the roofs and foundations of about 200 apartment buildings are planned to be restored.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/22/notarialna-izolyacziya-dokumenty-na-okupovanij-luganshhyni-staly-nedosyazhnymy/	2024-11-21T23:23:46-08:00

What will be the result of lowering the age and enlisting women in the army: the historian spoke abo...	Should we be afraid of mobilization measures? What will reducing the mobilization age, conscription of women, or the introduction of other mechanisms operating in the world bring to Ukraine? A military historian, head of the Center for Military History, Vasyl Pavlov, told the ArmiyaInform correspondent about this: -If we talk about mobilization, we will not find any other recipes for effective resistance to the aggressor. The only question is that until 2014 Ukrainian society was generally in a certain -lethargic- state, no one was preparing for war. From 2014 to 2021, the Ukrainian authorities, the Ukrainian state, managed to minimize the impact of the war on society, which led to the fact that the war and its feeling ended at the administrative borders of the anti-terrorist operation or the operation of the joint forces, while the rest of the country did not feel it. And when the question of mobilization arose, it became clear that the population was absolutely not ready to participate in the war. I don't know how to rate it. Is it very bad or not. We are very fond of saying, -I was not born for war.- Indeed, no one is born for war, no one is born for murder. Most likely, people are born to realize higher, more beautiful goals. But life works out the way it does. And if we talk about mobilization, then sooner or later Ukraine will go through all the stages that states that found themselves in a state of total war went through. We are now in a state of total war, that is, it is taking place on the entire territory of our state, regardless of whether there are military actions on the ground, or rocket attacks, or daily night attacks by Shaheds, or whether there is a threat of actions by subversive and intelligence groups. That is, we now have a situation where the entire population of the state is in one way or another related to the war. But a certain part of the population does not believe that this is their war. And the reason here is that for 30 years, the youth education policy was not carried out properly, the society education policy was not carried out, the state was not preparing for war. We constantly mentioned that it would be good for Ukraine to become Israel, but in the end we became Israel. But then we have to accept all those norms that exist in Israel itself. This is a certain mobilization age, this is the mobilization of women, this is the participation of all strata and strata of the population in the war. Therefore, I hope that just as Ukrainian society has overcome many problems of its growth since 1991, we will also overcome the problem of mobilization. Sooner or later it will all be evened out, because in a state of war, and everyone should understand this, we still have a long, long time to live. And again, here the question will be that the state should take a proactive position in the matter of the formation of a mobilization resource. We very often make fun of Russians that they are trying to do something from kindergarten. But we have to understand a very simple thing: they have been preparing for war for several generations. And the Russians have been openly talking about this since 2015. That they have the mobilization resource to wage war for one to two generations, that is, for 25 to 50 years. In other words, the Russians completely deliberately moved to a war of attrition, to a long-term war. In the same way, we need to prepare for this: prepare society physically, technologically and mentally.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/22/shho-dast-zmenshennya-viku-ta-pryzov-zhinok-u-vijsko-istoryk-rozpoviv-pro-svitovyj-dosvid-mobilizacziyi/	2024-11-21T20:57:07-08:00
How to return from the SZCH correctly: about the search, reserve battalions and transfer to another ...	— Not so long ago, changes were made to the Criminal Code of Ukraine in relation to SZH. From now on, there is an opportunity for military personnel to return to service, avoiding criminal punishment. So, what is the legal way to return from the SZH now? - Currently, there are several options for returning to military service. Everything depends on the categories of servicemen. There are three in total. If we talk about changes in the Criminal Code, then this applies to military personnel, about whom information has already been entered into the Unified Register of Pretrial Investigations. In such a case, a military serviceman can independently, at the stage of the pre-trial investigation, submit a written request to the investigator, the prosecutor, directly to the court or come to the nearest administrative body of the VSP. If, at this stage, criminal proceedings are ongoing against such a serviceman and his military service is suspended, the prosecutor may submit a motion to the court to release him from criminal responsibility to continue his service. But there are still certain conditions. In particular, this applies to servicemen who have committed FGM for the first time. There must also be written consent of the commander of the military unit for his continuation of military service. Accordingly, the court may decide to close the criminal proceedings and release the serviceman from criminal liability. In this case, the serviceman is given three days to arrive at the military unit or at the place of service, and already the unit is obliged to reinstate this serviceman in the service. At the same time, it should be noted that there may be certain circumstances that will not allow a serviceman to return to the military unit where he served, for example, the commander's refusal to give consent. In this case, he can return to service in another military unit. The list of these parts is determined by the General Staff of the Armed Forces. There is a different category of servicemen, and a correspondingly different return option. It is usually the most common. Up to 45% of the cases when servicemen committed a SZH, the duration of which did not exceed three days. That is, before acquiring signs of a criminal offense. In this case, this serviceman can independently return to the military unit to continue his service. Of course, the commander has to find out the circumstances why the serviceman committed the SZH. And then disciplinary responsibility is applied to him. And there is a third category. This is when a serviceman who has committed a criminal offense wants to return to service, and at the same time, the information about the offense is not entered into the ERDR. That is, 3 days have already passed, according to the disciplinary statute, the commander of the military unit has appointed an official investigation, which can last a month, but there are also different situations. Perhaps the serviceman fell ill or was insulted by someone in the service, or there were certain family circumstances, and he was not heard and was not given leave. entered in the EDPR, such a serviceman with the participation of the VSP is delivered to the reserve battalions, which is in the Armed Forces. There is an algorithm approved by the Commander-in-Chief, and in reserve battalions such a serviceman is transferred to military units and units of the Armed Forces. Depending on the situation, a decision is made to return him to service: either to the place where he served, or to another place. For example, there are task forces, let's say -buyers-, who carry out the recruitment of military personnel. — Tell us more about these reserve battalions. What is their function? - Every operational command has reserve battalions. And now the initiative to increase the staff and the number of these battalions has started. This was done in order to go to a meeting and receive servicemen who decided to return to service. True, there are also certain nuances here. First of all, we are talking about the return to the units identified as a priority for completion. It is intended that the soldier return to the combat unit, and not just to the rear. It is important not to legalize the process of transferring servicemen through the SZH. But, of course, each case must be considered separately. If a serviceman is medically unfit to serve in combat units, then other options are considered. Someone can't be an attack fighter, but can be, for example, a UAV operator, a signalman, or an IT person. That is, efforts are focused on what is most needed now and on human capabilities. — Let's take a closer look at the issue of returning to service in another unit. And how does it work in practice? Is only the consent of the commander of the unit where the serviceman wants to serve sufficient? -According to Article 401 of the Criminal Code, the written consent of the commander of the military unit to which the serviceman wants to return to continue his service is sufficient. Today, this mechanism is implemented in reserve battalions. You can find out more about this in any department of the VSP. But this applies to those servicemen against whom criminal proceedings have been opened and there is information in the EDPR. If we consider the option when the information is not entered in the ERA, then the general norms of departmental regulatory and administrative acts of the Ministry of Defense and the Armed Forces of Ukraine on issues of military service, according to which the consent of the commander of the military unit where the serviceman served, and the commander of the military unit to which the serviceman is transferred. And here, as I have already said, a special action algorithm has been developed. In particular, working groups have been created in the reserve battalions to speed up decision-making. There are also medical workers, and employees of personnel agencies, and psychological support, and Law Enforcement Services. To process documents, in addition to mail, messengers are used so as not to wait for the documents to arrive. In particular, servicemen submit reports, commanders confirm their approvals. This working group then considers the expediency of moving the serviceman, and a relocation plan is developed within a day and submitted to the Commander-in-Chief for review. Transfers may be approved within the Armed Forces. In the case of a positive decision on the transfer of a serviceman, an order is issued for personnel. The personnel center of the Armed Forces of Ukraine sends an electronic notification of the adoption of a personnel decision to the unit where the serviceman is serving and to the unit where the commander agreed to the transfer. Also, within three days, the senior group informs the serviceman about the adopted or unadopted personnel decision. Decisions may not be made, for example, due to health, profession, presence or lack of certain experience. It is possible that the serviceman needs to be sent for additional training or retraining. There may be cases when it needs to be sent to the VLK. There are medical companies in the new staff of reserve battalions. Because this is not only an entry into the Armed Forces, but to some extent also an exit from them. If the serviceman needs additional examination. There are such flagrant socially unjust cases when a person has lost a limb, but for some reason is listed in the SZH. Therefore, we make an appropriate decision and report such situations to the command. —Are there any units that are interested in sending those who went to the SZH to them? Perhaps some brigades have approached you? — Many military units are interested in being equipped, in particular, at the expense of servicemen who have completed SZH and wish to return to service. Therefore, in reserve battalions, conditions have been created for the selection of such servicemen, which is carried out by representatives of military units. They come there, study personal files, documents, and in accordance with this, the units carry out selection. Someone is looking for certain specialists, for example: signalmen, REB officers, engineers, sappers or drivers, because there is a shortage of them. The interest is there, and so is the action algorithm. That is, something like recruiting is conducted. Only in this case, not the civilian population, but active servicemen. And it is even better, because the military serviceman is already trained, was in the formation, performed tasks. — Has the number of those who voluntarily return to the army increased due to the introduction of changes to the law? —The rate of servicemen who voluntarily return to military units and show willingness to serve, increased, and a positive trend is observed in the future. Other measures also contribute to this. For example, the Commander-in-Chief decided on a large-scale search. When we'll peak, I can't say. But we predict that growth will continue. Courts consider the petitions of military personnel. The return algorithm works. Working offices have been created in the battalions. In fact, we are now going down the path of selecting a category of parolees who have volunteered to serve. They made study rooms. Online court sessions were held, decisions were made, decisions were sent to the battalions. There are also additional places for working groups of pre-trial investigation bodies and procedural heads from the prosecutor's office. These meetings are scheduled daily. There was also a decision of the Supreme Court, which appointed certain judges to hear these very cases in order to speed up the processes of returning servicemen to service. Next, we will look at the dynamics. — You said a large-scale search. How is the search for those who have committed FIR or desertion generally carried out? -The search is carried out in cooperation with many authorities. We work with the SBU, the National Police, the TCC and SP, the SBU, the Border Service. The case is being investigated, and a search is being made for all possible locations or hiding places of servicemen. For example, by the place of residence of parents, family, close relatives, loved one; by the place of recruitment or work. In addition, data are transferred to general registers that are relevant to the search. Operational information exchange is carried out. Our search system is constantly being improved. An interaction manual has been developed, where the processes are defined by the direction of work. According to the result of the search, servicemen are delivered either to the reserve battalions, if the information is not entered in the EDPR, or to the nearest pre-trial investigation body. You should not think that no one is looking for anyone. There are already many examples when servicemen received real sentences. But we also understand and emphasize that there is no single main problem of the implementation of the SDF or the desertion of servicemen. Each case should be considered only individually and the circumstances of the offense should be studied. In individual cases, appoint additional investigations and inspections. In particular, regarding the activity or inaction of the officials of the management structure, which forces the serviceman to commit the specified offenses.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/22/yak-povernutys-iz-szch-pravylno-pro-rozshuk-bataljony-rezervu-ta-perevedennya-v-inshu-chastynu/	2024-11-21T20:48:12-08:00
Autonomous anti-ship symbiosis: the US announced the transfer of unmanned ground vehicles to the KMP...	As stated in to the official release posted on the Oshkosh Defense portal, ROGUE-Fires (Remotely Operated Ground Unit for Expeditionary Fires fire action-) is an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) that uses the extreme off-road mobility and cargo capacity of the Oshkosh JLTV off-road vehicle, as well as advanced autonomous vehicle technologies to support ground-based anti-ship missile (GBASM) operations, ArmyInform reports. ROGUE-Fires have two modes of operation: tele-controlled and fully autonomous. This allows effective performance of combat missions in conditions of minimal operator intervention. The platform is capable of carrying a wide range of warheads, including the Naval Strike Missile (NSM), a modern missile designed to engage sea targets at a distance of up to 185 kilometers. One of the key advantages of ROGUE-Fires is the ability to conduct distributed logistics operations, which makes it not only a weapon platform, but also a versatile machine to support operations in the rear. ROGUE-Fires is also integrated into the NMESIS (Navy Marine Expeditionary Ship Interdiction System), which includes proven remote control technologies and the Naval Strike Missile. One of the key tactics used with NMESIS is the -scoot-and-shoot- method (quick movement after a shot), which allows you to minimize the possibility of receiving hits from the enemy in response. The NSM is a high-precision missile developed by Kongsberg Defense. Its feature is the ability to fly at low altitudes, avoiding radar detection, and hit both stationary and moving targets with maximum accuracy. To create the missile body, composite materials are used to reduce the radar signature. The NSM has a high-explosive high-explosive warhead made of a high-strength titanium alloy, filled with an insensitive explosive with a reduced probability of detonation when the missile is fired. One launcher accommodates 4 missiles, after firing, the NSM can travel a long distance over land, and then go to a target in the sea. This is followed by recognition and selection of an object for destruction, the missile hits the ship in the waterline area and uses a programmable detonator to inflict maximum damage on heavily armored targets. SUV JLTV, about which ArmyInform details told in one of her materials, was developed for the US Army and Marine Corps as a replacement for HMMWV (Hummer) military vehicles. In August 2015, the first contract for the supply of 16,901 vehicles to the armed forces was signed. JLTVs provide better protection than HMMWVs, comparable to the level of heavier and larger MRAP-type armored vehicles. The Gale Banks Engineering 866T diesel engine is capable of accelerating the armored car to a speed of 110 km/h. In total, the Pentagon plans to deploy 14 such batteries. By 2025, the Marine Corps wants to have four NMESIS batteries, which will allow it to achieve initial operational readiness. Full combat readiness is planned for 2030. The appearance of such ground-based unmanned systems as ROGUE-Fires demonstrates the rapid development of technologies of autonomous combat vehicles. This machine not only increases the flexibility and mobility of the troops, but also reduces the risks to the personnel by allowing tasks to be carried out remotely. The ability to adapt the platform for different tasks makes it valuable in the changing nature of modern warfare, where flexibility and speed of reaction play a crucial role.

Telegram channels of the Russian Federation spread a fake about the supply of dozens of mobile morgu...	The disinformation post is accompanied by a photo showing mobile containers with what appears to be the English inscription -Mobile Morgue-. As reports the Countering Disinformation Center, in fact this is another fake of Russian propaganda, and mobile containers, about in question are mobile boiler houses that the Ukrainian Red Cross, in cooperation with Coca-Cola, delivers to local communities to support the population of Ukraine. The theme of -use of crematoriums in the Armed Forces- is strongly supported throughout the full-scale invasion. For example, in September 2023, propaganda -brought- such crematoria in the amount of 200 units from Germany, and in August 2024 - from Sweden and Italy. Judging by the pace of propaganda, there will soon be no mobile crematoria left in Europe. At the same time, it is Russia that actively uses them, and there is corresponding evidence for this. Thus, as of April 2022, according to the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, 13 mobile crematoria were operating in the temporarily occupied Mariupol to clear the streets of the bodies of dead civilians. The use of such crematoria was also recorded in the territory of Chernihiv region and in the city of Novoaidar, Luhansk region.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/22/telegram-kanaly-rf-poshyryuyut-fejk-pro-postachannya-desyatkiv-mobilnyh-morgiv-do-sum/	2024-11-21T20:13:33-08:00

-Grandfather brought his grandchildren from a neighboring village-: the occupiers killed a boy in Do...	About the war crime of the Russian invaders reported in the Donetsk regional prosecutor's office. Correspondents of ArmiyaInform recorded the devastating consequences of the criminal shelling committed by the Russian military and spoke with local residents. The peaceful village of Pershomariivka was fired upon by the Russian invaders from the Tornado-S salvo missile system. Cluster munitions of indiscriminate action covered a large area within the residential buildings of the village, hitting residential buildings, yards and streets of the settlement.

The occupiers deliberately terrorize local residents, destroying residential buildings and civil infrastructure. Despite the civilian casualties, including children, women and the elderly, the Russians do not hide their crimes and even flaunt them.

The next phase of intimidation: a strike on the Dnipro as an element of the Russian game	A military and political commentator told about this on the broadcast of the -Edyny Novyny- telethon Oleksandr Kovalenko of the -Information Resistance- group.

The Kh-22, Kh-101, Kh-555 missile - they can also carry a warhead with a nuclear component. Kh-47M2 -Dagger-. Why launch an ICBM to deliver a nuclear strike, if there is already a nomenclature that can be a carrier of a nuclear warhead?-, Oleksandr Kovalenko notes. The expert believes that all these are elements of the Russian -game-. And this -game- is connected with one thing - intimidation of the West. -They understand that Ukraine, one way or another, received permission to strike the territory of the Russian Federation with Western weapons. And in order to disrupt the obtaining of this permission, to postpone it, they introduced this general doctrine,- the military-political observer of the -Information Resistance- group assures.

For example, the media cites the position of Polish President Andrzej Duda, who says that this could be a turning point on the front. But military expert Petro Chernyk has a different position. He explained to the correspondent of ArmiyaInform why the possible US permission for Ukraine will not be a turning point. -Permission for ATACMS strikes deep into Russian territory cannot and will not be a turning point in the war. With one single exception, if these missiles are given several thousand, and this is a fantasy. There will be no fiction,- says the military expert. And he adds that our country was given somewhere in the range of a couple of hundred of these missiles: -We used a certain amount, if they give a couple of hundred more, it will be very good. ATACMS will help to really hold the Kursk bridgehead. Because it is they who are called to destroy warehouses with ammunition, warehouses with fuel and lubricants: this is if we are talking about the cassette part. And the high-explosive part is the control points and communication nodes. Chernyk emphasizes that if everything goes like this, then everything will be complicated for the enemy in terms of knocking us out of Kurshchyna. -And this is already a big geopolitics. Our task is to hold out until next year's dry weather cycle,- the expert noted.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/21/atacms-kurskyj-placzdarm-ta-dozvil-ssha-ekspert-pro-te-chy-bude-zaraz-perelam-na-fronti/	2024-11-20T23:27:28-08:00

Crocodile tears of prisoners near Kupyansk: what the captured occupiers are crying about	About this informs State Border Service of Ukraine. One of them said that on the Russian side, mostly Zeks are fighting in this direction. He clearly saw through it and began to complain about the leadership of the Russian Federation. -Nobody here understands why we are fighting against the Ukrainians, it's just that Uncle Vovochka wanted to grab more land,- said the occupier and added that it is time to end this war. -I hope that what was taken from Ukraine will be returned to Ukraine,- said the Russian, but he could not clearly answer the elementary question: -Whose Crimea?- The Russian also complained about the conditions of his stay in the occupation army. -You sit in dugouts, and we sit in damp, cold pits that look like latrines,- the invader wailed. Another prisoner turned out to be a native of the Samara region. He was sent to the assault even without identification marks. -They don't give us anything, they spit on us like they threw meat, I don't even know how to shoot,- cried the Russian invader to the Ukrainian border guards. He says that he did not serve in the army, and before being sent to attack, he was not even shown how to use a machine gun. The occupier admitted that he was going to the positions under duress, because there were blocking units behind him. The State Border Service of Ukraine is an integral part of the Defense Forces of Ukraine, which adheres to international humanitarian law and guarantees the preservation of life, the provision of medical assistance and the provision of other rights to representatives of the Russian armed forces who choose the right decision - to surrender.

Encircled battles, destruction of alligators and revenge against the marines of the 155th brigade: a...	ArmiyaInform journalists visited the 82nd Bukovinsk Airborne Assault Brigade, which broke through the Russian border and is still performing tasks on enemy territory. In more detail about the participation of paratroopers in this operation, its commander Colonel Dmytro Voloshyn said: -In my opinion, there were several key aspects. First of all, secrecy in the planning and preparation of the operation. And also the secret movement of troops. We had several interactions with the Commander-in-Chief and were instructed to move to a new area. We moved to the Sumy region in three days at night. But they did it in such a way that even some of our units, which should have known about it, did not know. I even had a conflict with the head of the VSP, who should have known that I was moving and should have provided me with an escort. And he found out when we moved, about three days after that. It is a real skill to move unnoticed by an organism like a brigade. You yourself understand that personnel, heavy equipment, and shells were being moved. Already on the territory of the Sumy region, we disguised ourselves as much as possible. There was no -shuffling-. No one knew that the 82nd Brigade had appeared there. And this continued for about a week after the operation began. For example, Russian media reported that the 22nd Mechanized Brigade broke through the front line and went deep. For understanding, the 22nd brigade was moving behind me. She was in our second echelon. The second aspect is who was bet on to carry out such an operation. And I think the airborne assault troops did it for once. The third aspect is the territory on which we fought. If you look at it, it is a rough terrain, full of difficult sections. I do not think that the enemy saw it as suitable for large-scale operations. And it is necessary to hit where it is weak, where the enemy does not expect. Yes, it was difficult. But we coped with it. Of course, another aspect of success was provisioning. Sometimes I think that if the Commander-in-Chief had raised problematic issues at some regular interaction, then I would have said that I need some kind of intergalactic blaster, I think that it would have been found for us somewhere within a week. To be honest, they gave literally everything. So that you only perform tasks properly. He attacked, destroyed the enemy, took possession of certain areas and borders. And all this, in fact, was successful. After all, the credo of the airborne assault troops is that we do not back down in the face of difficulties, we move to the end. And the main aspect why we have succeeded in all this is the belief in what we are doing. My immediate, faith of my subordinates. No one said: -we have to go to Russian territory anyway.- When the soldiers were told that they had to go and fight in enemy territory, the reaction was quite expected: -finally we will go and slander these bastards on their territory.- Why not? Our country is destroyed every day, children die. So let them also feel what war is like, but for them it is somewhere far away. The first day was probably the most difficult, you had to overcome a barrier in your head. After all, the introduction of such large-scale offensive actions is a very difficult task, taking into account the enemy's use of various means of fire damage. These are high-precision weapons, anti-aircraft missiles, anti-aircraft missiles, military aviation, FPV drones, and Lancets. Of course, it is like that everywhere now. It stands on the stream in them. So I had to overcome this barrier in my head. Somewhere he adjusted himself to some extent, somewhere he adjusted the commanders. There was anxiety, but they went to perform the task. I thought that if we break through the front edge now, then everything should go according to plan. And we broke through the front edge. It was something with something, how we crossed the border. The entire brigade passed through one passage made in the mine-explosive barriers by the 225th assault battalion assigned to me. The car is moving, and I am thinking: now it should be hit by ATGMs, or now the Lancet should fly into it. And nothing comes flying in&#8230; troops enter in huge columns. The noise was so loud that probably the whole of Sumy shuddered. I was puzzled, because there is such a sign that when everything is going according to plan, somewhere ahead, the enemy has prepared something. The Wisent barrier machine was the first to pass. It has no weapons, just an armored car with a big bucket. He crossed the border and went to the enemy stronghold. I think, well, that's all for him. And he turned around and drove back. I had even more questions than I had. But the units went further deep into the enemy's defenses. Why we managed to break through the border in such a way became clear when I was already on the territory of Russia. They did not see us, because, as they say, no one mowed the grass in front of their positions. Literally. The grass was taller than my Hummer. And they just didn't see what was happening. They heard explosions, the rumble of equipment, but did not see. So we slipped past them and did not storm those positions. It was also nonsense for them that we do not storm positions where the enemy is, but move on. I'll be honest, when the actions started, everything just went, and we completed the tasks as I set them for myself. The tasks of the first, second, third day, we still did. They occupied certain areas, surrounded the enemy. Somewhere they bypassed him. And perhaps one of the key decisions that led to rapid success was that I did not task my units to enter populated areas. Before that, I spoke with the participants of the campaigns on Russian territory - RDK, GUR. They said that when they entered populated areas and knocked out the enemy, then they were simply mixed up with aircraft and that was it. That's why it was a failure. I decided that the enemy would build defense nodes in populated areas. Therefore, we simply bypassed them, and it was already incomprehensible to the enemy. As we passed through the front end, we thought there were maybe 200 people at most. It is clear that there were pre-prepared positions, but they looked uninhabited. And then, when the enemy was in our rear, it turned out that there were much more of them. Apparently, on the seventh or eighth day, I think you heard, the SBU special unit -Alfa- took about 120 prisoners at just one stronghold. And just so you understand, there were 30 to 40, sometimes 50 enemy military personnel at each stronghold. That is, in general, there were about two thousand servicemen in our rear. Yes, there were mostly conscripts who did not cause us much harm, and they were then taken prisoner. But such a number of personnel were in our rear, and, in fact, our soldier did not pay attention to this, but moved forward and performed his task. Of course, there were also some -slips-. The 225th battalion fulfilled its task, entered and blocked a number of settlements. In particular, the route that went from Korenev to Suja. The second battalion was supposed to go at the same time with it, but it was not possible to make passages in it. There were failures of engineering equipment. So while we were redeploying this battalion to a neighboring route, I decided to immediately bring the second echelon into battle. These units overcame the combat formations of the 225th battalion and immediately went to the first line of enemy defense. The first is because, according to the operational construction, we first overcame the echelon of the state border cover. And behind it, at a depth of 10-12 km, there was already another boundary. Again there were -dragon's teeth-, again an anti-tank ditch, again mines. Two battalions slipped through and went all the way to Novoivanivka, where they pressed the enemy and prevented him from occupying strong points on this line. With this, I set myself the task of the day - to get behind these -dragon's teeth-. If we did not do this, there would be no point in moving forward. Overcoming such barriers under enemy fire&#8230; it would be Zaporizhzhia number two. But the staff did not disappoint. &nbsp; Strong resistance was put up by the enemy's army aviation. Helicopters flew over the columns at a height of 50-100 meters. They fired from cannons, anti-tank missiles, unguided missiles. We immediately deployed anti-aircraft defenses. The first Ka-52 was destroyed with Strela MANPADS. We also damaged the Mi-8 with small arms fire. He fumed. As it turned out later, he flew a little further and also fell. That is, on the first day, we destroyed two enemy rotorcraft. They didn't fly the next day. Then they started working again. On one of these days, we destroyed another Ka-52. A paratrooper hit him with a Stinger MANPADS. The entire crew was destroyed there (ArmyInform already wrote about this episode. Read more can be read here - Ed.). About two weeks after the operation began, a large number of drones appeared here. Serious units arrived with trained crews who know how to use all this. They were constantly working on technology. Here, by the way, they encountered FPV drones in the 330 MHz frequency range for the first time. And at that time we did not have EW tools against them. But we found options. Their points were detected, fire damage was inflicted, and at this time they slipped wherever they needed. There were many different solutions that we constantly combined. While we were advancing, the enemy tried to throw at least someone to stop us. In fact, they threw their units into the tiger's mouth. The -scoop- once had such a thing as marching companies. Literally, from the wheels, they threw themselves at some boundaries with only small arms. We met such companies. They smashed them to zero. First with combat vehicles. And then the soldiers went to clean up if someone continued to resist and did not want to surrender. There were moments when our advanced units went deep into the defense, and the sweep did not have time. And the units found themselves surrounded by the enemy on all sides. But we are paratroopers. We are always in the rear of the enemy - surrounded. We were preparing for this, for a circular defense. And it does not matter whether it is a department, a company or a battalion. Everyone should be able to conduct an all-round defense. Determine dangerous directions, where to place grenade launchers or anti-tank weapons, how to -close- (mining the terrain. - Ed.). We have been trying to unblock one of the units for about a month. And they kept the defense all this time. The first real resistance was offered by the 810th Marine Corps Brigade. For understanding, its composition includes 13 battalions. And these are not security battalions at all. She arrived only by arrangement. The prisoners said that it was 96% manned and 90% equipped. My third battalion captured their APC. Yes, there was still polyethylene on the seats. New car. Only from the factory. There are also paratroopers here. 83rd, 51st, 56th, 119th Parachute Regiments. 73rd Reconnaissance. This is a Vedevesh battalion. Various -Akhmatians- are also here. Well, the most finished is the 155th Marine Corps Brigade. These are the infamous freaks who cut off heads, cut off ears, knocked out teeth, and shot prisoners. The most interesting thing is that they are so boring when they are all together. And if anything, they are afraid to admit that they are from the 155th brigade. They are called anything. I understand that this is a war. But torturing and killing an unresisting opponent is low. There are certain laws and rules of war. No normal commander would set such a task. But there are no moral boundaries in this swagger. Therefore, there is no mercy for them from our paratroopers either. We are trying to destroy them. An eye for an eye, as they say. In a certain period, units were withdrawn to rest a little. But as soon as they came out, literally in a day and a half, the enemy started his offensive actions. Of course, we were quickly brought back into battle. And so we fought for another month. For example, one of the battalions defended Lyubimivka. The enemy tried to drive in with 12 vehicles. I thought that he would just drive in and sell en masse, as was the case in some other settlements. But they immediately made mine barriers, put up a -jagoza-. The enemy blew up somewhere, started to turn around somewhere and blew up again. And the paratroopers have already finished off everyone with automatic weapons. Everything, -I wish you health-, as they say. Later, we still went for a short rest, to regroup. At that time, new personnel also arrived, because, of course, there were also losses. And we were preparing for new offensive actions. The enemy began offensive actions again to dislodge the Defense Forces from Kurshchyna. And my units returned there to carry out assault operations to dislodge the enemy from those territories where he managed to wedge himself in. Of course, it doesn't happen so fast these days. The enemy has accumulated a lot. We retook three settlements. And for the fourth one, we are -getting excited- now. Half of it has been cleared, and the enemy has been trying to attack us here all day today. In the airborne assault troops, the main thing is training and motivation. Some people say that we have some special fighters. That's not true. We take these servicemen from the same training centers as the others. We just have such an ideology - we teach them not to survive, but to kill the enemy. And we will fight to the last.

How much is paid for the destruction of enemy equipment: it's all about the monetary reward	According to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, our defenders destroyed almost 100,000 units of enemy equipment during almost 3 years of large-scale invasion. The purpose of the survey is to understand how this is implemented in practice and what difficulties military personnel face. ArmyInform reminds how this reward should be paid and how much can be received, for example, for a destroyed tank or a downed plane. The payment of such remuneration is regulated by a special procedure, approved order Ministry of Defense of Ukraine dated September 18, 2020 No. 340. Yes, military personnel are paid a reward in the amount from 12,180 to 243,600 hryvnias, depending on the type of equipment. The decision to recognize the equipment as destroyed or captured is made on the basis of at least three documents. Next, a conclusion is made about the destruction (capture) of enemy equipment, and it is formalized in an administrative document (order) of the head of the troop group (forces). Confirmation of the destruction (capture) of the equipment is: An increase in the reward for the destroyed (captured) equipment is distributed by the commander's decision among the servicemen who took a direct part in the destruction (capture) of the equipment, depending on their personal contribution. Remuneration is paid to military personnel from the place of service on the basis of the orders of the commanders of military administration bodies and military units. We remind you that not only a monetary reward is provided for the destruction of enemy equipment. Also, from this year, it became possible to get additional vacation days. More about this can be read here.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/21/vynagoroda-za-znyshhenu-j-poshkodzhenu-tehniku-voroga-skilky-otrymuyut-zahysnyky/	2024-11-20T21:11:31-08:00
-Malyuk- Challenger in the service of DSHV: how a British tank beats Russians on their territory	These tanks were handed over to Ukraine by Great Britain in 2023. And now they serve in the 82nd Bukovyna Assault Brigade, which operates in the Kursk direction. Tank commander Oleksandr worked as an electric and gas welder almost all his life. After BZVP, he was offered to become a tanker, and he immediately got on the Challenger II tank. That is, he did not have experience working on other machines, so it is difficult for him to compare. But he does not have such a desire: -I once sat in Abrams.- I didn't like him. It is much smaller. In my homeland, I'll be honest, I didn't even climb. I looked at the driver's seat, looked into the tower and realized that there wasn't even enough room for me,- Oleksandr says. One of the main advantages of the Challenger II tank, the commander calls its accuracy, which is achieved thanks to the 120-mm rifled gun and the fire control system, which itself, depending on the conditions, makes all the necessary corrections: -It can work at a distance of up to 10 km inclusive. But it depends on the area. He works as a sniper. For example, if you shoot at a distance of 5 kilometers from a T-shka (a series of Soviet tanks - ed.), Abrams and Challenger, then it will hit the most accurately. It has a weather sensor that transmits information about wind, humidity and other factors to the computer. And he makes these corrections himself.- In general, the on-board computer is the brain of this tank, adds Stanislav with the call sign -Patron-, who is a loader in the crew: -He programs everything himself. For example, if two tanks leave. One at 1,800 meters, the other at 2,300. The laser is aimed at both tanks and the computer remembers two targets. And when the commander decides which one to hit, the gunner can switch between targets with just one button.- The loader is the fourth crew member, which is characteristic of most Western tanks. After all, the Soviet ones have a charging machine, so there are fewer crew members there. Here, although you have to charge manually, it is not difficult. -There is nothing complicated. Yes, everything is done manually for the first shot. I lower the shutter wedge, load everything, close it and move it to the right position. And after the first shot, everything happens automatically. You just need to throw in another projectile,- Patron says. And this tank is very strong and safe for the crew, says the commander of the vehicle Oleksandr. After all, even after significant damage, it can be driven. And it already saved the boys' lives: -Somehow he withstood the impact of a cumulative projectile during missile fire by Russian helicopters. The depth of damage was 720 mm. And the boys survived. They were the ones inside. There was another commander with them at that time.- The loading -Cartridge- was just in the tank during that shelling. He remembers that it was during the approach to Kurshchyna. -As soon as we crossed the border, 2-3 helicopters were already flying over us. And we had to take a stand. They drove and shot on the go. The distance to them was about 4 km. It is quite difficult to hit a helicopter. But something had to be done,- Patron recalls. Already when the tank was in position, the first rocket arrived. -It flew into the tower. Triplexes flew at the commander and the mechanic-driver. And when they -rolled away-, they were already driving along my triplex. I told where to go. Then there were a few more hits. They knocked out 2 rinks for us, punctured a tank. We drove through it at about 30 kilometers per hour.- Despite the damage, the tank was able to drive to a safe zone. He accomplished his mission, saving the lives of the crew. And already after the repair, he returned to the line and is again destroying the enemy on his own territory. First of all, the enemy is trying to hunt for Western weapons. That's why these tanks are the No. 1 target, says driver-mechanic Maksym with the call sign -Kalyna-. -As soon as we are spotted somewhere, all the fire is directed at us. Therefore, you need to constantly maneuver. All in all, it's a very powerful machine. And her defense is cool. But there are nuances of the engine - it needs constant maintenance. If it is done on time, then everything is fine. But this is not always possible because of the intensity of the action. And it would be possible to put an even more powerful engine here. Now it has 1,200 horsepower, but it would be great if they put 1,500.- Currently, the intensity of hostilities in the direction is very high. The enemy is trying to knock our units out of Kurshchyna. Constantly deploys large amounts of vehicles and infantry to attack. This is also felt by the tankers, who almost constantly have to advance to the task - to work both on equipment and on the enemy's manpower, covering our units. -We worked on the Zaporizhzhia and Vovchansky directions before this. I can say that every time it becomes more difficult. After all, the enemy is constantly studying us, our actions. Constantly introduces something new. But thanks to the interaction between departments, we manage everything. The result is mostly positive,- says tank commander Oleksandr. He also talks about his main fear when performing tasks. -I'll be honest, it's always a little scary before leaving. And this is a normal phenomenon. Everyone has it. But when you start working, you focus on the task at hand. Adrenaline is also on the rise. And the main fear is to let the team down. Failing to do something or doing it wrong. But then, when you see the results - how many enemies we destroyed, you already feel proud. That they didn't just leave to work, but also have a result,- adds Oleksandr. The guys' motivation is simple - it's better to stop the enemy here than when he gets to your house. Because then it will be too late.

Combat duo: what is known about the new UAV that will work together with French fighters	How informs The War Zone website, this project promises to increase the effectiveness of the French Air Force by 2033, ArmyInform reports. The industrial part of the drone program will be led by Dassault Aviation, building on its previous UAV prototype nEUROn UCAV already used in trials with manned combat aircraft. The program was announced by the French Minister of the Armed Forces, Sébastien Lecornu, during a ceremony to mark the 60th anniversary of the French Strategic Air Force (FAS) at the Saint-Dizier air base. The new UCAV, which is being developed by Dassault Aviation in collaboration with the French Defense Procurement Agency (DGA), will have a number of unique characteristics, including stealth technologies, autonomous control with the participation of the operator (man-in-the-loop) and internal weapons loading. These features will allow the drone to adapt to a variety of threats, as well as perform complex combat missions in support of the French Aerospace Forces. The basis of the project is the development of the nEUROn program — the first prototype of an unmanned aerial vehicle with stealth functions in Europe. The program, launched in 2003 under the leadership of Dassault Aviation, brought together industrial partners from six European countries. nEUROn demonstrated key technologies such as stealth, autonomous flight and the ability to use internal weapons such as laser-guided bombs GBU-12. As note analysts of the defense portal Army Recognition, nEUROn weighing 7 tons, with a wingspan of 12.5 meters and a length of 9.2 meters powered by Rolls-Royce Turbomeca Adour Mk. 951, which provides a speed of up to Mach 0.8 at an altitude of 14,000. meters Since its first flight in 2012, this demonstrator has completed more than 170 test flights, which allowed to confirm its technological and financial efficiency. The experience gained within the framework of the nEUROn program will be directly used in the development of a new combat drone. For now, the drone remains nameless, but its specs are already sparking interest. It will have stealth, which will allow it to effectively perform tasks in difficult conditions. The War Zone reports that the drone will operate in tandem with a Rafale fighter jet, which will be operated by a pilot. This interaction between manned and unmanned aerial vehicles opens up new horizons for combat tactics. Dassault has already stated that the drone will be versatile and able to adapt to future threats. Experts assume that this device will be able to perform a wide range of tasks, from reconnaissance to strikes on targets. Its internal payload space also promises to be substantial, allowing for the integration of various weapon systems. As for the Rafale Standard F5, which is expected to support the new drone, the plan is to keep the multi-role combat aircraft in the forefront until 2060. Initial research for the F5 Standard began last year, and full-scale development will begin in 2026-2027. Experts of the IKK Defense Express publication reminded that the law on defense planning of France for the period from From 2024 to 2030, the upgrade of the Rafale attack aircraft to the F5 standard, which should act as a carrier of a promising cruise missile of the type ASN4G as a means of delivery nuclear weapons. The French military stipulates that the Rafale F5 must be able to overcome various prospective threats, and accordingly this aircraft must have the necessary technological options to perform its tasks. In turn, researchers from the Opex360 portal indicate that as early as 2023 the French the military has recognized one interesting point about upgrading the Rafale to the F5 standard - for this aircraft to be able to independently perform all its intended tasks, it is necessary to increase the power of the computing equipment on board, which must process -hundreds of thousands of pieces of data-. But to achieve this, it is necessary to increase the length of the cables for various types of equipment so much that they literally will not fit in the plane itself with its current geometry. It seems, according to Opex experts, that it is against this background that the French Ministry of Defense came up with the concept of -tying together- the promising Rafale F5 and guided stealth UAV. nEUROn made its first flight in 2012 and has since completed more than 170 test flights, demonstrating its ability to remain undetected by modern air defense systems. During one of the tests in 2016, the drone successfully penetrated the defenses of the Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier, demonstrating its unique stealth capabilities. This experience will form the basis of the development of the new UCAV, which will play a key role in future joint operations. Presentation of the combat unmanned aerial vehicle nEUROn.

How many Ukrainians are actually against territorial concessions of the Russian Federation: the enem...	According to polls, the majority of Ukrainians oppose Russia's territorial concessions. As is well known, Russian and pro-Russian sources cannot be considered a reliable source of information. However, the propagandists are trying to convince that they are citing the data of a real, and not a -bought and painted- sociological survey, despite the fact that they do not indicate any source of origin of this -insider-. At the same time, the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) has been regularly conducting surveys since May 2022 on the readiness of Ukrainians to make territorial concessions in order to achieve peace as soon as possible. According to results a poll conducted from September 20 to October 3, 2024, the majority of Ukrainians oppose Russia's territorial concessions. 58% of respondents answered that Ukraine should not give up any of its territories, even if because of this the war would last longer and there would be threats to the preservation of independence. Sociologists note that the share of the Russian Federation ready to make concessions has not changed since May of this year - it is 32%. Instead, the share of those who oppose concessions increased from 55% to 58% from May to October this year. According to another KMIS survey conducted in the same period, 63% of Ukrainians are ready to endure the war as long as necessary. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/21/skilky-naspravdi-ukrayincziv-proty-terytorialnyh-postupok-rf-vorog-statystyku-perekrutyv/	2024-11-20T20:15:07-08:00

Posing as locals: in Toretsk, the occupiers change into civilian clothes	Major Anastasia Bobovnikova, spokeswoman of Luhansk OTU, told about this on the air of the Suspilne Novosti telethon. — In Toretsk, the situation is difficult now, there are very heavy urban battles. The enemy lost about 70 killed and wounded [last day]. You can imagine the intensity of these hostilities. That is, the enemy literally attacks our servicemen with meaty assaults, she said. The spokeswoman said that local residents remain in the city, and Russian servicemen change into civilian clothes to mislead Ukrainian soldiers. — As for the civilians, they still remain there. This makes the job of our military members incredibly difficult. Because the enemy disguises himself in civilian clothes, trying to deceive our servicemen in this way, she said. Fighters of the Defense Forces try to identify and counter the enemy. — We are trying to detect such attempts, but it is very difficult both from a moral and military point of view. Because a military serviceman has to think twice every time who is in front of him - a civilian or an enemy disguised in civilian clothes, - explained Anastasia Bobovnikova. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in Chasovoy Yar, Russians run to -meat- intelligence under the threat of being shot.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/20/vydayut-sebe-za-misczevyh-u-toreczku-okupanty-perevdyagayutsya-v-czyvilnyj-odyag/	2024-11-20T10:53:07-08:00
The information injection that took place today helps the enemy - the President	About this declared on November 20 Volodymyr Zelenskyi in his evening address. -Today there were a lot of nerves and questions about some special danger. Although we have already experienced how many cruel and vile blows from Russia during this time... We must always pay attention to the air alarm. We have such a neighbor who is crazy. Today, on the 1001st day of full-scale war, Russia is just as crazy as it was on the 1000th day, and on February 24th. The information injection that took place today, some panic messages that were sent - all this only helps Russia. Please take care of yourself, help our army and make sure, in particular, that no one can use your emotions for their own interests. And we continue to strengthen air defense,- the President assured. He announced a new support package from America in the amount of $275 million. -The package includes drones, highmars shells and artillery, and very importantly, mines to stop Russian assaults. It will really strengthen our guys at the front. And this is already the 70th defense package from the United States of America. Ukraine appreciates America's bipartisan support and President Biden's decision. Thank you!- Volodymyr Zelenskyi said. He said that he spoke today with the Prime Minister of Poland, Donald Tusk. -Thanked for all the support provided since the first days of the invasion. We discussed the preparation of a new package from Poland for Ukraine. And also — the presidency of Poland in the European Union, which will begin in the new year.

Transport froze, garbage does not disappear: communal collapse in -lnr-	This was reported by Artem Lysohor, the head of the Luhansk Regional Military Administration. According to him, the occupation authorities found a way to make a profit even from their own inaction - to fine local residents for garbage dumps that arose due to the failure of communal services. The crisis also affected transport. The buses that the Russian Federation handed over to Luhansk are parked in garages under the pretext of a lack of drivers — most of them have been forcibly mobilized. Local residents suspect that the equipment may have been partially returned to Russia, as private transporters with dilapidated vehicles that barely work have increased on the streets. The occupation administration demonstrates an inability to provide basic communal services, which only worsens the living conditions of local residents. As reported by ArmyInform, from December 1, 2024, the passports of the so-called LNR, which the Russians have been forcing residents to receive since 2014 will be invalidated.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/20/transport-zavmer-smittya-ne-znykaye-komunalnyj-kolaps-u-lnr/	2024-11-19T23:51:44-08:00

Will the armistice save Ukraine: a military historian on a 100% repeat of Russian aggression in the ...	-In this situation, only we can save us. Neither Euro-Atlantic integration nor even the return of territories will save us. We must clearly understand that as long as the Russian Federation exists, it will be an existential threat to us. And, accordingly, it will not disappear even in the event of a truce. I don't say -end of hostilities- because it's not likely to be a peace treaty, it's going to be an armistice. The truce, everyone should understand, is temporary in nature and can be broken for both objective and subjective reasons at any moment. Here it is necessary to understand and immediately prepare for how and for what we will use this truce, because we must clearly understand that any truce ends in the next war. Therefore, in this situation, the Ukrainian population, the Ukrainian political community, and the world community must understand that the time that will appear in our country after the conclusion of the armistice should be used to make the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the military-industrial complex of Ukraine even more powerful Because only this is a guarantee of avoiding possible future aggression of the Russian Federation. It must be said right away that the future aggression of the Russian Federation, or at least an attempt at aggression, is actually a 100% option. And the Russians will not hide even that. They will say that they have completed the objectives of their 1st and then they will start their 2nd. We have already seen this on the example of the anti-terrorist operation that was completed by the Minsk agreements. We know this because the Russians never keep their word and are proud of it. All diplomats in the world know about this. It is written about in all history and diplomatic textbooks, everyone studies it, but no one draws any conclusions. The Victory Plan is the requirements of the President of Ukraine, which are the requirements of the Ukrainian State and are the requirements of the Ukrainian people. There is nothing surprising in these requirements. We simply demand ours back. The question is how we will succeed, how the world community will help us in this. The Victory Plan, most likely, is not an attempt to issue an ultimatum, but actions so that the issue of Ukraine does not disappear from the agenda, so that it is constantly in the circle of interests and in the sphere of interests of the leading states of the world, so that we could continue to resist. No more and no less.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/20/chy-vryatuye-ukrayinu-peremyrya-militarnyj-istoryk-pro-stovidsotkovyj-povtor-agresiyi-rf-v-majbutnomu/	2024-11-19T22:02:07-08:00

In a flock or alone: ​​Israeli aircraft manufacturers are promoting an unmanned missile-carrying hel...	How emphasized in their statement posted on the company's official portal, representatives of the company, this project is an example of unique cooperation between Steadicopter and Rafael and provides fast, maneuverable, accurate capabilities for striking heavy targets for tactical air operations, ArmyInform reports. The Golden Eagle HS unmanned rotorcraft is armed with powerful Spike missiles, which ArmyInform reported in one of its materials, designed for precision strike missions in a variety of environments, from tactical conflict zones to border protection, regional perimeter protection, and urban operations. These capabilities allow the wielder of this weapon to dominate the battlefield, providing an advantage, particularly in difficult or overcrowded areas. Experts of the defense portal Army Recognition point to the fact that, thanks to the integration of the Spike missile, the Golden Eagle HS helicopter ensures prompt and precise strikes on particularly important targets, allowing ground forces to operate from safe positions, regardless of time of day and visibility conditions. The Golden Eagle HS armament uses high-precision Spike missiles with the possibility of using -fire and forget- tactics. Equipped with a powerful warhead, this platform combines enhanced stealth with high combat effectiveness, expanding the tactical capabilities of assault forces. With a total take-off weight of 50 kilograms, Golden Eagle HS is compatible with Spike-SR missiles with a firing range of 2.5 kilometers and Spike-LR2 with a firing range of 5.5 kilometers, providing flexible applications thanks to a data link between the missile's homing head and the operator. These missiles belong to the sixth generation, capable of self-targeting with the help of an infrared homing head. As soon as the missile reaches the target, it destroys it with a powerful anti-tank high-explosive warhead capable of penetrating up to 70 cm of rolled armor. The Golden Eagle HS unmanned aerial vehicle is equipped with an advanced suite of sensors, including a high definition EO/IR tele/thermal imaging system for day and night use with target tracking capability. Integrated with advanced SightX artificial intelligence (AI) technology, the system can seamlessly detect, track and classify targets even in adverse weather conditions or difficult terrain. This advanced method of applying AI can distinguish between different types of targets, whether people or vehicles, providing ground forces with real-time situational awareness. -The launch of Golden Eagle HS in partnership with Rafael Advanced Defense Systems Ltd is an important milestone for Steadicopter,- said Itai Toren, CEO of Steadicopter. This unmanned aerial vehicle meets modern operational requirements, providing exceptional accuracy and the ability to launch strikes in autonomous mode. -Combining experience in the field of unmanned aerial vehicles of the helicopter type with Rafael's extensive experience provides the military with a solution that increases the effectiveness of its use on the battlefield.- In turn, a representative of the Rafael Corporation added: -Our collaboration with Steadicopter in the creation of this unmanned aerial vehicle meets the changing needs of modern warfare, where innovation and advanced capabilities are critical. This partnership will allow current and future users of Spike missiles to be more versatile and effective, potentially game-changing on the modern battlefield.- Golden Eagle HS is capable of operating both independently and as part of inconspicuous swarm groups launched from different points for combined attacks on important targets.

F-16 as an air defense tool: how effective were the Fighting Falcons during the recent shelling of U...	Is it a lot or a little within the limits of the general statistics of Russian air weapons used by the enemy and shot down by the Defense Forces of Ukraine? What enemy munitions could not be shot down by F-16 pilots? How effective are the -Battle Falcons- as a component of air defense assets? ArmyInform answers these questions based on official data of the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. As reported President of Ukraine, on the night of November 17, with the help of F-16s, about 10 enemy air targets were shot down, without detailing which exactly the aircraft managed to shoot down the pilots of the Ukrainian -Battle Falcons-. Volodymyr Zelenskyi also noted that, in total, during the previous week, Russia used more than 900 guided aerial bombs, more than 600 attack drones and almost 140 missiles against Ukraine. Of this number, about 120 missiles of various types, including Zircon, Iskander, and Kinjal, as well as about 90 drones, including Shahed, were used by the Russian invaders on the night of November 17. The President informed, that during a massive combined strike on November 17, Ukrainian air defense forces destroyed more than 140 enemy air targets - missiles and drones, and thanked to Ukrainian defenders, separately mentioning military aviation pilots who piloted various types of aircraft, including F -16: -We are grateful to all our air defenses, which were involved in repelling this attack: anti-aircraft missile troops, our aviation - pilots F-16, -susok- and MiGs, mobile fire groups, EW - all worked out in an organized manner. Thank you for the reliable protection!- Official statistics of the results of the combat work of the Air Defense Forces in repelling the record-breaking Russian combined air attack reported in Air The forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces - defenders of the Ukrainian sky shot down 102 missiles of various types and 42 unmanned aerial vehicles. If we take the number of aircraft shot down with the help of F-16 aircraft mentioned by the President - about 10 units - as a basis, we find out that the pilots of the Ukrainian -Fighting Falcons- shot down about 7% of all enemy air targets destroyed on November 17. Is it a lot or a little? Depends on what data we can operate on and what factors should be taken into account. Back in the summer of 2023, the then spokesman of the Air Force Command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Colonel Yuriy Ignat noted that the F-16 as an air defense vehicle has limitations - fighter jets cannot shoot down ballistic missiles: -It can cover the sky from kamikaze drones and cruise missiles, that is, bring the percentage of shooting down closer to 100, now we have 70-80% - this is with strong Russian attacks, with the F-16 this figure can increase to the maximum Plus, it will allow us to use cheaper missiles.- In view of this, from the general list of munitions used by the enemy, those that the F-16 cannot shoot down should be excluded. These are ballistic, aeroballistic and hypersonic missiles. There are at least 10 of them: It should also be taken into account that a significant proportion of the air strikes used by the enemy on November 17 - 85 units - were Kh-101 and Kalibr cruise missiles. Kh-101 missiles can fire dipole reflectors as obstacles against radar-guided missiles. Missiles with infrared (thermal contrast) guidance on such small targets, equipped with a compact turbojet engine, work much worse than on airplanes and helicopters. One should also take into account the share of F-16 used to repel an enemy attack among other means of the Ukrainian air defense forces, which cannot be significant. In view of the above, the estimated 7% of enemy air targets shot down by F-16s during the massive combined strike of the Russians on Ukraine on November 17 is a significant indicator. It testifies to the high efficiency of the -Battle Falcons- as an air defense vehicle.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/20/f-16-yak-zasib-ppo-naskilky-efektyvnymy-buly-bojovi-sokoly-pid-chas-neshhodavnogo-obstrilu-ukrayiny/	2024-11-19T20:43:06-08:00
A gun from Afghanistan, a 30-grade gunner and dreams of victory: how the calculation of the M777 gun...	While they were waiting, a large shaggy sheepdog came out of the darkness very quietly. The dog sat silently next to us, looked up somewhere. Then he left as silently as the shadow of sadness of a small village of Donetsk region, not far from the front. Here, at night, only the constant cannonade of explosions from the front line and the sound of the engines of military vehicles can be heard. We get into a pickup truck, a car with a night vision camera drives us in the dark to the position of the artillery calculation of the 148th separate artillery brigade of the Zhytomyr Airborne Assault Troops of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. We are met by the commander of the calculation on landing, we quickly move to the shelter, highlighting a red flashlight. A large, tidy dugout welcomes you with warmth and light. Two-story beds with dark army mattresses are lined up along one of the walls of the underground shelter. On one of the beds, everything lights up and shines, it is the equipment of a signalman - 45-year-old Taras with the call sign -Tarik-. He himself is from the Poltava region. In civilian life, he worked as a construction worker, installing gas pipelines and heating. He has been serving in the 148th brigade since April 2023. He speaks simply about his duties: there must be communication and light at the position, maintenance of equipment, batteries, generators, and transmitters. - A lot of work. Why might there be no connection? The reasons are different. Something can fly in, fragments can damage the generator, the walkie-talkie will break, the equipment sometimes fails, my job is to make sure everything works properly, - Tarik explains. He adds that civilian work is almost no different from army work. . -It's the same, only a little scarier,- says the operator with a smile. At home, Taras is waiting for his wife and two schoolboy sons. They often talk on the phone, the family supports. He recently returned from vacation, he says that everything is fine, but not enough, he would like to spend more time with his family. - The only wish is for the war to end as soon as possible and to return home. I have many dreams, but the biggest one is victory. Taras's brother approaches us and sits down next to us. He has a gray beard, a red flashlight sparkles on his head, cheerful eyes, as they say, -with beads-, he smiles and introduces himself. Anton is 44 years old, call sign -Baker-, a senior soldier, has the position of senior howitzer gunner M777A1. He has been in positions and performing combat missions for over a year. I joined the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in April 2023, from the city of Berdychiv. — In 2022, I was not drafted into the army, because I have four children, and in 2023, when my eldest son turned 18, according to the first the summons went to the military commissariat. I have an older son and a daughter from my first marriage and two more sons. At the time when I was drafted, my wife and I had not yet been registered, - says the artilleryman. He says that he likes to serve in the artillery. Training with work on this Pekar gun took place in Germany. — The training lasted 10 days. Why so fast? Howitzer M777A1 is easy to maintain. After completing the courses, he received a 30-grade gunner's certificate, he says jokingly. He recalls that he really liked Germany for its order and cleanliness, as well as food for the military. And they were also impressed by the roads. -The baker- was abroad for the first time. He is a bricklayer-plaster by profession, but he was a baker for many years, hence the nickname: -Peak bread, buns, cakes in Berdychiv in a restaurant-. Pekar speaks with pride about the Pekar gun, a very powerful and accurate weapon, everything depends on the gunner and the accuracy of the coordinates. — Zaporizhzhia is beautiful worked, a little less in Donetsk region. It happens differently: mostly 40-50 shots, but when it’s 10. Here you can’t guess how the enemy will attack, there’s an assault, if it’s -forbidden- so that they don’t climb, don’t forget who we are, then a few shots are enough, he explains he. It is admitted that the first time was terrible in the war. Now he already easily distinguishes where the projectile flies, how it flies and where. - At first it was scary. Now it's just flying in, it's commonplace. The hardest part of the job is carrying shells, and also moving from place to place, it's several days with almost no sleep, says the gunner. silhouettes The boys are stomping, because the morning autumn coolness gives the first breaths of the coming winter frosts. A quiet conversation, almost in a whisper, over coffee and a cigarette while waiting for the team to fight. The first, first pink, then more and more saturated yellow rays of dawn. Suddenly, the command: -To battle!- The gunners run to the gun, with coordinated movements everyone does their job: remove the masking, get the coordinates of the target, aim, load — -Shot!- , so as not to interfere with the calculation. Within a minute the gun is cloaked again, everyone goes back to the dugout to talk and finally see each other's faces and take some pictures. One of the guys looks like Jesus from the painting, the other looks like an athlete. They are smoking again, smiling, drinking coffee. 42-year-old sergeant Dmytro with the call sign -Lion- from the city of Dnipro commands the cannon. On May 19, 2022, he went to the Military Commissariat with his brother and best man, applied for the elite troops and got into the DSHV. — I thought that victory would come sooner. I had no idea what it would be like. And everything turned out as it should be, I became the gun commander. First, I got the position of a gunner after training, and then I was in the 95th artillery brigade, which was disbanded, and I was transferred to the 148th brigade. He passed sergeant courses, then training in Germany, he says. -Lev- proudly mentions that the Germans and Americans were shocked that in such a short period the Ukrainians learned everything so quickly. - We have a war, there is no time to study for half a year. We are -rexes- of the DSHV, he says. This is already the third gun of the crew. They worked on the first boy for a long time and even gave her the name -Lyalya-. - She worked like a clock mechanism. She never let me down, unfortunately, she stayed in another unit, that's how it happened. This one is a little cranky. I know that this gun fought in Afghanistan. The barrel was changed, and, consider it as new, some mechanisms were updated, then it will work as it should, says -Lev-. They have been fighting with this team for a year, they went through training in Zhytomyr Oblast. - There is also a young addition, Oleg came to us a week ago, the main thing is that he is motivated, he learned everything quickly. Currently, I can choose people for the team, only those who are needed here. Because an unmotivated person does not have time or energy to shout, argue, explain. This is a war, everyone must clearly understand why he is here, - the commander proves his position. He controls the entire process, records the coordinates, gives orders. The gunner Viktor directs the gun to the target according to the coordinates, Oleg and Andrii load the projectile, Oleksandr loads the gunpowder and brings the gun into combat order. Anton gives the gunpowder, and the commander fires. - Our calculation is one iron fist. Everyone knows what they are doing here and they have no questions about who is doing what, we are all working to win. Everyone knows their job. How do we hold on? The main thing is respect for each other. In general, we are already here as a family, - assures -Lev-. Before the large-scale invasion, Dmytro worked at a power plant. After the end of the war, he wants to return home, to civilian life, he misses his family. — What do I dream about, except victory? My wife really wants to go to Italy. They are waiting for me at home, the children go to school. We talk on the phone, via video. I take a photo of the boys in farewell, and we run to the car. We leave the position in the morning fog, -Candy- constantly beeps on the road...

Propagandists invented a fake about the surrender: what is Trump doing here	This time, they spread, with reference to the Institute, a fake about the fact that the Ukrainian military allegedly began to surrender eight times more often after the victory of Donald Trump in the elections. This -news- was also allegedly commented on by the editor-in-chief of Euronews, Klaus Strunz, who called it an -absolutely natural- development of events, saying that now -it is finally clear to everyone that Ukraine is doomed.- However, this news and everything related to it was invented by propagandists. The Institute for the Study of War did not publish such information either on its website or in social networks. There is also no reaction to this hoax in any of the reputable Western media, including Euronews - obviously because it is a poor fake. In fact, there are no independent and reliable data on how many Ukrainian soldiers surrender as prisoners, because such statistics are available only to the Russian side, and it is difficult to trust them. At the same time, the Human Rights Commissioner of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, Dmytro Lubinets, said that the government is aware of more than 100 executions of Ukrainian military personnel by the Russians, who have surrendered or are being captured. There may be many more real cases, but such crimes are difficult to verify and legally record.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/20/propagandysty-vygadaly-fejk-pro-zdachu-u-polon-do-chogo-tut-tramp/	2024-11-19T20:04:19-08:00
Syndrome of the Kursk operation: the troops of the Russian Federation are sick with Kursk - the symp...	told about this on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- a> spokesman of OTU -Siversk-, Colonel Vadym Mysnyk. — Hundreds of kilometers [along] the northern state border, the enemy is [mining], increasing his minefields. They also carry out such defensive measures, and this says something - we call it the syndrome of the Kursk operation, he said. In the Kursk region itself, the Russian command is building up its forces and throwing its soldiers into reckless assaults with the aim of knocking out the Defense Forces of Ukraine from the territory of the Russian Federation as soon as possible. — The rest of the [Russians] forces were concentrated in the Kursk region. Here they are both in a hurry and nervous. They throw everything they can into the battle, transfer new units, new forces here to continue the onslaught, he said. The officer said that during the day, the fighters of the Defense Forces repelled more than 20 enemy assaults without losing a single controlled settlement. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that 5 drones destroyed a Russian assault group in Kurshchyna.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/19/syndrom-kurskoyi-operacziyi-vijska-rf-hvoriyut-kurshhynoyu-u-zsu-diagnostuvaly-symptomy/	2024-11-19T12:08:23-08:00
PereREBilo — the enemy drone could not reach our tank	Unique footage appeared on November 19 on the brigade channel. Our tank led a raid in the forest, where it destroyed enemy positions. As the tankers began to turn around, an enemy FPV drone appeared above it and attempted to dive on the tank. But due to the action of the WB, it lost controllability and exploded on the ground a few meters from the tank. -A very rare shot is a clear example of how EW works... Valuable equipment and the lives of our soldiers were saved,- the brigade commented on the video. &nbsp; As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the 63rd mechanized brigade showed risky raid of his tank, which destroyed the trenches of the invaders in the forest.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/19/pererebylo-vorozhyj-dron-ne-zmig-doletity-do-nashogo-tanka/	2024-11-19T11:56:48-08:00

Russian stormtroopers demined the road to our positions near Kurakhovo. By myself	The video of the battle was released on November 19 on the battalion channel. A Russian armored fighting vehicle, together with the landing party, was quickly driving towards our positions. But she didn't make it, because she exploded on a mine. Smoke billowed from the car and the invaders began to climb out. They were also smoking. Some of them remained lying down, and some tried to hide in the landing. But here our bomber drones flew in and carried out a sweep with the help of drops. -Not a single racist creature from this video survived, not even the one that ran into the landing!- - assured the battalion. &nbsp; As reported by ArmiyaInform, fighters of the 214th special OPFOR battalion of the Armed Forces of Ukraine ambushed enemy armored vehicles at the landing site and -znyshhyly-na-kurahivskomu-napryamku/->started immediately to bomb. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/19/shturmovyky-rf-rozminuvaly-pid-kurahovo-dorogu-do-nashyh-pozyczij-soboyu/	2024-11-19T11:37:51-08:00
Mortals in Chasovoy Yar: Russians run to -meat-reconnaissance under fear of being shot	told about this on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- a> spokeswoman of OTU -Luhansk-, Major Anastasia Bobovnikova. — On the Toretsk direction, the enemy constantly storms the city of Toretsk. In addition, battles are taking place near Nelipivka and near Toretsk is the village of Shcherbynivka. In the Kramatorsk direction in the area of ​​Chasovoy Yar, the enemy is accumulating its forces, and in the Seversky direction literally today, the enemy has already shelled 13 times with anti-aircraft guns, she said. The officer said that despite constant assaults, the occupiers are not succeeding either in Toretsk or in Chasovoy Yar. — The enemy is not advancing. We will stop all his attempts, all assaults, both in Toretsk and in Chasovoy Yar, the military woman assured. The spokeswoman denied information about the advance of the occupiers in Chasovoy Yar. — I know you probably want to ask about the alleged advancement in the Rift of Time. However, I will say that this is not an advance, but rather a situation where the enemy is running across the channel and scouting our positions, she explained. Anastasia Bobovnikova described the tactics of the enemy. — They just run forward and whoever has caught up has caught up, and whoever has not caught up has not caught up. It is more like a -meat- reconnaissance, when the units just throw and try to feel where there are weak points, where there are strong points, where the enemy cannot come, said the military woman. The spokeswoman assured that the enemy's attempts to advance are detected and stopped. — Such attempts, of course, are revealed. The enemy is destroyed, the groups are hit and the enemy does not advance, the officer said. At the same time, the morale and psychological spirit of the occupiers, according to her, is very low - they run forward due to fear of punishment - up to and including physical execution - from their command. - Their moral and psychological spirit is very low. They do not want to run into such -meat- assaults. These are rather suicide bombers who were driven to certain death under the threat of being shot. Because we recorded such statements in our intercepts, when the leaders, commanders of the enemies simply told them that if they go into battle, they will be shot,- said the spokeswoman of Luhansk OTU. Anastasia Bobovnikova said that many such cases are recorded - sometimes whole units of the Russian occupation forces refuse to obey the order. — There are many such people. There are entire units that refused to go on assaults. However, unfortunately, they are forced to do just that. Of course, they are afraid of being shot, and in this way they have a chance to run and get captured and save their lives in captivity, the military woman explained. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that up to a hundred occupiers are killed in Toretsk every day.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/19/smertnyky-u-chasovomu-yari-rosiyany-bizhat-u-myasnu-rozvidku-pid-strahom-rozstrilu/	2024-11-19T11:08:55-08:00

Denmark will provide Ukraine with 130 million euros for the development of the defense industry	About this President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky reported on November 19 based on the results of a meeting with the Prime Minister of Denmark, Mette Frederiksen, who came to Ukraine on a visit. The head of state thanked Denmark, the entire Danish people and personally Mette Frederiksen and her team for helping Ukraine. In total, Denmark has already provided more than 20 packages of defense support, and together with Ukraine created a special model for the development of Ukrainian industry. -It makes it possible to unite other countries around investments in the production of weapons in Ukraine. These are artillery, our -Bogdans-, also missiles, long-range drones. We will continue to develop such cooperation,- said the President. One of the main topics of the negotiations is the key areas of relations: bilateral and with partners. Particular attention is paid to joint work at the level of European institutions, because in the second half of next year Denmark will preside over the EU. -Our Ukrainian policy is to be as fast as possible in integrating into Europe. And finally, we all in the Euro-Atlantic community have to admit that we have to be quick. And every day, obviously, decisions are needed for Ukraine. In the entire Alliance, there is a decision on the invitation to Ukraine. The sooner it happens, the sooner Russia will realize, come to an understanding and make a decision that the war against Ukraine does not and will not make sense for them,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. Separately, the President emphasized that the world needs to put pressure on the Russian shadow tanker fleet, as well as react to the involvement of North Korean troops in Russia's war against Ukraine. Mette Frederiksen said that Ukraine should win this war, so Denmark provided and will provide assistance and support the defense industry. -We already see what your defense industry is capable of. We understand that these investments lead to real impact on the battlefield,- said the Danish Prime Minister. She also added that the outcome of this war will determine the future not only of Ukraine, but also of Europe. -You belong to our Euro-Atlantic family, you belong to the NATO space, the EU, and we will support you in your next steps during Denmark's EU presidency, where the main priority will be EU enlargement,- concluded Mette Frederiksen. As reported by ArmyInform, Volodymyr Zelenskyy together with the Prime Minister of Denmark Mette Frederiksen met with Ukrainian manufacturers of long-range drones and soldiers who use them.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/19/daniya-nadast-ukrayini-130-mln-yevro-na-rozvytok-oboronnoyi-promyslovosti/	2024-11-19T09:31:15-08:00

In the Kyiv region, a dealer with fake documents on unfitness went to court	This was announced on November 19 by the Prosecutor's Office of the Kyiv Region. According to the investigation, the accused ensured that Ukrainian citizens conscripted into military service received forged military registration documents regarding their unfitness for military service, as well as forged decisions of the local self-government body. These documents gave the latter the possibility of unimpeded travel abroad in wartime conditions. The man valued his services at $4,000 to $5,000. ArmyInform reminds that it is better not to break the law or risk your life, but to use the aggregator of vacancies in the Armed Forces and recruiting centers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/19/na-kyyivshhyni-pid-sud-pishov-torgivecz-falshyvymy-dokumentamy-pro-neprydatnist/	2024-11-19T08:55:14-08:00
They do not deserve mercy - the presidential pilots looked into the eyes of the occupiers	The video was released on November 19 on the battalion channel. The occupier is running away, our FPV drone is approaching, the Russian is looking around in panic, stop, shot! A new occupier is already fleeing and a new kamikaze drone is flying after him. -Our soldiers decided to look into the eyes of the occupiers, and there &#8230;. nothing, darkness! For your attention, a selection called -photo album — the last look of the occupier!-, commented the video in the battalion. &nbsp; As reported by ArmyInform, the pilots of the 4th mechanized battalion of the Separate Presidential Brigade named after Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky gathered a selection of well-hit drops on enemy attack aircraft.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/19/na-poshhadu-ne-zaslugovuyut-prezydentski-piloty-zazyrnuly-v-ochi-okupantam/	2024-11-19T08:42:39-08:00
Having lied, the Russian propagandists buried our rocketmen, and they escaped	Footage of combat work and non-trivial rescue was made public by the State Border Service of Ukraine. A few days ago, Russian propagandists began to brag about the shots of their FPV drone of our RAK-SA-12 installation, which was installed on a Humvee armored vehicle. The invaders boasted that they destroyed not only the car, but also the entire crew. But it turned out that the Russians lied. As usual. Our rocketmen told the story of their amazing rescue, when not only they themselves survived, but also their equipment, which is very annoying to the Russians. What it's like to be in the crosshairs of a Russian FPV drone - see in the video: ArmyInform told how RSZV RAK destroys enemy infantry .	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/19/zbrehavshy-rosijski-propagandysty-pohovaly-nashyh-raketnykiv-a-ti-vryatuvalysya/	2024-11-19T08:36:13-08:00
More than 1,500 transfer reports have already been processed — the Ministry of Defense	About this reported on November 19 by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. -The number of reports shows that the military was waiting for the opportunity to change the place of service without lengthy approvals, bureaucracy and groundless refusals. Instead, the number of agreed shows that the service works effectively. Digitization continues to transform our army into the army of the future, where any service is received simply, transparently and quickly,- said Kateryna Chernogorenko, deputy minister for digitalization. Changing the place of service through Army+ has a fairly simple algorithm. It is necessary to submit a report, attach to it a military card or an officer's certificate, a letter of recommendation from another unit. In some cases, a VLK opinion is required, for example, if a soldier wants to transfer from a combat unit to the rear. Then the report goes to the Personnel Center of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. If there are no grounds for refusal, an order is prepared, which is subsequently signed by either the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces or the Chief of the General Staff. -Also, what makes this service unique is that the place of service can be changed without the approval of the commander. It is needed only in certain cases and it will be received by the Personnel Center of the Armed Forces, not the military. We are doing everything to free people's time for efficient service as much as possible,- added Kateryna Chernogorenko. In addition to being simple, the new algorithm for changing the place of service is also transparent. If the serviceman is refused, he will receive the reason why it happened. Currently, the most frequent reasons for refusals are as follows: — the report is submitted by military personnel who do not serve in the Armed Forces; — lack of a conclusion of the VLK for transfer to the rear from the combat unit; — copies of all pages of the military document with records of service are missing. As reported by ArmyInform, the Ministry of Defense in 2024 secured the supply of clothing for female defenders at 158 million hryvnias	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/19/opraczovano-vzhe-ponad-pivtory-tysyachi-raportiv-na-perevedennya-minoborony/	2024-11-19T08:07:48-08:00

In Sumy Oblast, 4 Russian servicemen received prison terms for theft	This was reported on November 19 by the prosecutor's office of the Sumy region. During the occupation of the village of Vorozhba of the Lebedyn territorial community in March 2022, four Russian servicemen broke into the house of civilians and, threatening them with weapons, forced them to leave their homes.

Punished for violation of personal distance — 5 drones destroyed a Russian assault group in Kurshchy...	The video of the battle was released on November 19 on the battalion channel. The enemy advanced an assault group on buggies and motorcycles. But the Russians were spotted in time by our reconnaissance drones, and kamikaze drones also flew in their wake. -FPV-drones, precisely according to the coordinates, began the destruction even before the attack aircraft could approach our infantry. In a few minutes, the attacking group was simply dismantled. This is what reconnaissance drones are for: they find the enemy in time, giving the opportunity to organize a precise response. It is not just a technique - it is a synergy of the human mind and technology. And thanks to such coordination, the attack was stopped at an early stage,- the battalion commented on the video. &nbsp; As reported by ArmyInform, the pilots of the 225th assault battalion filmed the consequences of the defeat of the armored assault group of the occupiers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/19/pokaraly-za-porushennya-osobystoyi-dystancziyi-5-droniv-znyshhyly-rosijsku-shturmovu-grupu-na-kurshhyni/	2024-11-19T06:57:57-08:00

A thousand days of resistance: the struggle for Gostomel, Zmiiny, Kharkiv... How it was: memories on...	Gostomel airport was considered a strategic object even before the war. Capable of receiving cargo planes, located only 25 kilometers from Kyiv, it became a key point in an attempt to quickly capture the Ukrainian capital. The airport was guarded by a brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine, but most of its soldiers and equipment were in the east at the time of the invasion. And it seems that the enemy knew. What he did not count on was that even with small forces the National Guardsmen would take the fight. Trying to delay the landing of the Russian landing force as much as possible and prevent transporters with heavy equipment and main forces from landing at the airport. Armed essentially only with -needles- and small arms, the Ukrainian fighters held out for several hours, shot down several helicopters and disrupted the enemy's first plan. But the ammunition eventually ran out. I had to retreat from the airport. However, the National Guardsmen won the time during which the artillery from Bila Tserkva managed to pull up to the position. Which began to fire at the Russians, trying to disable their equipment, and most importantly, the landing strip. Or at least demonstrate that any attempt to land transporters still expected by the enemy on it will end fatally for the planes - they will come under direct fire. The Russians, who managed to report on the seizure of the airport, tried to expand the control zone, pushing the Ukrainians further, but they did not succeed. The defense forces counterattacked, and most importantly, they did not stop shelling in order to prevent the already damaged lane from being repaired. In the end, the invaders were forced to abandon the amphibious operation and wait for the arrival of their main forces by land. They captured Gostomel in a few days. However, they could not advance further. And on April 1, they left the city and the airport under threat of encirclement. Already on February 24, the Russian troops approached Kharkiv close, and on the 27th, one of their special forces groups with ten -Tigers- and several KAMAZ trucks broke into the city itself. When the breakthrough was stopped, they decided to seize the school closest to them at that moment - 134 school. But turn it into your stronghold, because it was located on higher ground. The Russians were blocked by the forces of the military, security forces and volunteers. But they did not dare to storm the building at first - in the first days, the usual experience was not enough. After some time, the invaders recovered and began to retaliate with sniper fire. It seems that reinforcements were also waiting. Wasting time was simply dangerous. So the brave men who volunteered to attack went to the school under the cover of fire from an armored personnel carrier. Later, the tank also pulled up - but it was able to fire only one shot. The melee was fierce. The Russians fought back desperately. However, the grenades they used to throw at the Ukrainian fighters soon ran out. They refused to surrender. However, in the end, two were captured. And these were the last invaders who set foot on the land of the city with weapons. The Russians were never able to break into Kharkiv again - in almost three years of war. Maybe that's why they continue to take revenge on him - destroying from a distance, Mariupol was threatened by the encirclement already a week after the full-scale invasion. The defenders turned the -Azovstal- plant into their citadel, in the bunkers of which both civilians and wounded soldiers were hiding. The sky above the city was controlled by enemy aircraft, the sea &#8211; fleet. The occupiers attacked the city with the heaviest bombs they had at hand - three-ton fabs. The Russians expected that the forces of the defenders would quickly be exhausted without support from the -big land-. But in the military intelligence of Ukraine, they decided on a desperate operation. Having information about the location of enemy units and their weapons, try to lay out a route for the helicopters. The risk was deadly - that's why only volunteer pilots were involved in the operation. Almost all weapons were removed from the sides. The cargo was more important - provisions, medicines, ammunition and means of communication for the defenders of Azovstal. They flew at maximum speed, but at a minimum height. They entered from the side of the sea, because of the smoke over the constantly shelled city, they simply could not break through. Defenders say that at first they did not even believe that it was theirs. Five minutes to unload, and how much will it cost to load the wounded. The engines were not silenced to take off at any moment. At first, the Russians did not even understand what had happened. But then the hunt for Ukrainian helicopters began. However, all 16 ships will deliver their cargo to Mariupol. Three helicopters were shot down on the way back, one was hit by a missile, but he made it with all the wounded on board. Thanks to the defenders of -Azovstal- and the helicopter crews that helped them, Ukraine won a month to equip the defense system. Mariupol shackled the enemy's forces and did not allow him to move immediately to the east - to Zaporozhye and the Dnipro. Okhtyrka is a border town. The enemy was near him already five hours after the start of the invasion. The sappers took the first blow. They had almost no anti-tank weapons, but they still organized a circular defense, set up positions on the roofs, ambushes, mine barriers&#8230; The advanced enemy group managed to break through to the city, but the Ukrainian fighters destroyed one of the tanks and a car with ammunition, which began to explode. The attackers were forced to retreat, abandoning their equipment. During this time, fighters from the Kholodny Yar brigade came to the aid of the defenders. It was they who repelled the second, tank attack. The battle lasted half a day - and the Russians withdrew again. with heavy losses. Convinced that they would not be able to take Okhtyrk from the move, the occupiers began mass bombardment of the city with -hurricanes-. The kindergarten, where civilians tried to hide, was not the first to suffer. The next day, thermobaric weapons were used for the first time. A direct hit to the location of the unit cost the Ukrainian military 70 lives. And then the systematic destruction of the city's infrastructure began. After the oil depot, they took on the CHP plant. When the -hurricanes- and rockets failed to cope with the task, bombs were dropped. 20 thousand citizens were left without heat. The next day, the water supply and sewage system were disabled. They deliberately tried to punish Okhtyr residents for their persistence - and the mayor is still confident. A doctor by profession, on the most critical days he himself performed operations - under enemy fire. The defenders, of course, answered the enemy with everything they could. The Russians soon realized that their planes could also be targeted and were already wary of bombing from low altitudes and during the day. Assault attempts did not stop. On March 16, the enemy even managed to enter the outskirts of the city, but at the cost of heavy losses. He was never able to break through the Ukrainian defense. And within a week he was forced to start withdrawing troops from Sumy Oblast. The strategic importance of the Snake Island is difficult to overestimate. The only island in the entire Black Sea at a great distance from the coast, it allows you to control the approaches to Odessa and the mouth of the Danube - and in fact all shipping between mainland Ukraine and neighboring countries - including Turkey. It is not surprising that the Russians were in a hurry to capture Zmeinyi as soon as possible. Already on the morning of February 24, 2022, it was blocked both from the sea and from the air. Communication with the border guards was lost. The enemy tried to intimidate the Ukrainian defenders, but they responded with an expression that became one of the symbols of this war. Annoyed by the response, the Russians subjected Zmiiny to a frenzied shelling, destroying all the buildings on the island. But the border guards continued to defend themselves, repelled two attacks, and only because of a lack of ammunition, the invaders managed to capture them. The defenders were freed on March 24 - during the first exchange of prisoners. The enemy tried to turn the island into his stronghold. But the Armed Forces did not allow it to be done. On April 14, two Neptune missiles hit the Moscow cruiser &#8211; the same one that was -sent- by the border guards and shelled the island. In two weeks, the Russian control post on Zmiiny itself was destroyed. Then they -thinned out- the personnel of the occupiers and sank the boats with which the enemy tried to maintain communication with the island. The tugboat carrying the TOR anti-aircraft complex also went to the bottom. The blows to the enemy became stronger and more regular. And the Russians understood that they were doomed. On June 30, they evacuated their soldiers from Zmiyny with two speedboats. And the remains of the equipment that they left on the island were destroyed by Ukrainian drones and ... Russian aircraft. On July 4, 2022, Zmiiny returned to the control of Ukraine. And the yellow-blue flag flew over him again. Before the large-scale invasion, it seemed that Bashtanka was located deep in the Ukrainian rear. And if the war comes to her, then not quickly. However, the locals did not sit idly by. Territorial defense and formation of volunteers were created. They even prepared -molotov cocktails- - it turned out that it was on time. Because already on March 1, the Russians were in nearby Yavkin. It was near him that peaceful residents came to the road. It seems that the invaders simply did not expect this. But they stopped in embarrassment. Not for long, of course. They listened to the people in silence for fifteen minutes - and after firing a machine gun over their heads, they moved on, past them. But even a short stop helped the defenders better prepare for the -meeting-. As soon as the first invaders entered the city, bottles with -cocktails- flew at them. The machines caught fire, the ammunition began to detonate almost immediately. The Russians were shocked, but continued to move. However, the deeper they broke through, the fiercer resistance they met. The forces of the defenders were not so large, but small groups were scattered throughout the city. Thus it was possible to create the appearance of a large garrison. When the Russians drove up and stopped, their column was cut up and began to be destroyed piece by piece. The end of the rout was put by a plane that appeared unexpectedly for the enemy and struck two devastating blows. The invaders finally realized that they had fallen into a trap and ran away to save their lives. Twenty-one Russians were captured. They -captured- more than four dozen units of enemy equipment, but most of it was burned during the battle. The second column of Russians was ambushed. And decided not to tempt fate and retreated. In the future, the Russians did not dare to attack Bashtanka -head on-. They dug in on distant slopes. And they tried to destroy the city with shelling. Or maybe they were just taking revenge for the defeat. Until the Ukrainian army went on the offensive and repelled the enemy as far as the Dnipro. And Bashtanka was not in the rear again. Control over the Black Sea is one of the strategic tasks of the Kremlin in this war. And at the beginning of the invasion, she was close to fulfilling this task. The initial balance of naval forces was also in favor of the Russians - the aggressor had more of them by an order of magnitude, and the quick destruction of the ships of the Ukrainian Navy. Even the disabling of the flagship of the fleet - the cruiser -Moscow- - did not seem like a critical loss. But everything changed already in the summer of 2022. It was then that Ukraine made a bet on the use of surface drones. And conducted their first tests - then it was about devices on hydrocycle platforms with high-explosive bombs. In September, they already tried to use them in a real battle. The operation failed due to communication problems. But the very fact of the attack forced the Russians to reduce the number of ships on the external raid and retreat to the port of Sevastopol. However, this was only the beginning. At the end of October, drones reached the Sevastopol Bay itself, damaging two ships and an oil filling station. The following spring, the attacks became regular, and in the summer, drones attacked the Kremlin dictator's favorite brainchild, the Kerch bridge. Within a month, Ukrainian drones caused noise on the approaches to Novorossiysk. The targets were ships capable of transporting military cargo to the occupied peninsula. In August 2023, a separate naval drone brigade was formed as part of the Ukrainian Navy - the first unit of this type in the world. A real hunt for Russian ships began - in most cases quite successful. Among the trophies were boats, and tugboats, and large landing ships. And the Russians... began to simply hide their fleet. The presence of ships in the open sea has decreased tenfold. Most of them were taken from the Crimea to the Caucasian coast. Moscow can still use its fleet to launch -calibres- over Ukraine, but the entire western part of the Black Sea is currently free. And this is a truly unique achievement – ​​no country in the world has yet managed to defeat the enemy fleet with the help of unmanned remotely controlled vessels. The Russian occupation of part of the Kharkiv region in 2022 ended with the Ukrainian offensive. The occupiers fled from the territories they occupied. One of the last they left was the city of Vovchansk, which is located very close to the Russian border. In May 2024, the enemy returned. Vovchansk again became one of the directions of his attack. The direction to Lipka became different. The calculation was obvious – while the Ukrainian defenders, dripping with blood, hold back the onslaught of the main Russian forces in Donbas, hit their flank and try to break through to Kharkiv again. Or at least get closer to the city at a distance that would allow it to be shelled at close range with artillery. The situation was really difficult. Ukrainian units were still waiting for reinforcements from the new mobilization, defensive structures in the border strip were not built. However, within a few days, having encountered resistance, the enemy's offensive stalled, and by the end of the month it was stopped. In Vovchansk, the Russians were never able to cross the Vovcha River. There was no question of an attack on Kharkiv - and the Kremlin leader even stated that this was not in the plans. However, the tactics of the Russians remained unchanged, not being able to completely capture the city, they destroyed Vovchansk with shelling. The bombing of Kharkiv also intensified. Ukraine's partners could not help but react to the aggressor's next war crimes - they lifted the restrictions on the use of their weapons against military targets in the border regions of Russia - from where, in fact, Ukrainian cities are shelled. Attempts of enemy breakthroughs in the north of Kharkiv region continue to this day. However, Ukrainian fighters managed to recapture some settlements from the invaders, and Russian soldiers blocked at the aggregate plant were eventually taken prisoner. Since the first days of the full-scale invasion, Russia has constantly bombarded Ukraine with missiles and attacked with drones - there is not a single area to which it does not -fly- from time to time. Instead, the possibilities of retaliatory strikes were limited - if only because the Defense Forces were inferior to the enemy from the beginning in terms of the number of long-range weapons and the -range-. Partners could help, but it took a long time to coordinate and deliver already agreed packages. In addition, in many cases, weapons were transferred with the condition not to strike deep into Russian territory. Without denying Ukraine's right to active defense, the allies made it clear more than once that there would be no restrictions on the use of their own, Ukrainian means of destruction, and domestic manufacturers accepted the challenge. The bet was made primarily on drones - they are cheaper, but often even more effective than missiles. The first strikes on objects deep in Russia were already carried out in 2022. The target was primarily the airfields on which the planes that launched the missiles over Ukraine were based. In the following year, the appearance of drones in one or another Russian city ceased to be perceived as a surprise or coincidence. In May, a drone exploded just above the Kremlin, causing a real commotion in the Russian capital. Since the beginning of 2024, strikes on Russian territory have become systematic. Russian oil refineries and related infrastructure were the first to feel it. Since March, they have been joined by enterprises of the Russian military industry - manufacturers of jet engines for aircraft, assemblers of drones, etc. The range of attacks also increased constantly - Ukrainian drones flew to the Volga region, the Urals and the Russian North. However, the most daring were the attacks on enemy arsenals, the loudest of which was the destruction of warehouses in Toropka, near Tver. And in the summer of 2024, for the first time, the number of Ukrainian drones launched on Russian territory exceeded the number of Russian drones that struck Ukraine. And this is certainly a success. What to be proud of. The operation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Kursk region is called the most unexpected and perhaps the loudest event of the war in 2024. Until now, the defense forces conducted combat operations only on their territory. Raids on Russian territory were carried out only by fighters of foreign volunteer formations that support the struggle of Ukraine, and they usually lasted only a few days. Now the war has come to the land of the enemy for a long time. The success of the operation was ensured, in particular, by careful preparation and the fact that it was managed to be kept a secret until the last. The large-scale movement of troops was disguised as military exercises - the enemy was sure that the Armed Forces of Ukraine were preparing to repel their own offensive in Sumy Oblast. Only a narrow circle of those involved knew that it was an offensive on Russian territory: the officers were informed three days before the start of the operation, and the private soldiers - a day before the offensive. The offensive began on August 6, 2024 - and Ukrainian troops managed not only to crush the Russian forces near the border, but also to go deep into Russian territory. Initially, the enemy did not even understand what was happening, and I try to diminish the successes of the Armed Forces, even more disoriented with its soldiers. Many of which quickly realized that they had thrown and hurried to surrender. Without deciding to talk about the war in its territory, Moscow continued to pretend to be a small raid. Instead, Ukrainian fighters managed to take control of thousands of square kilometers in hostile territory in a week and to become entrenched in Sudzh and surrounding settlements. In fact, a buffer zone was created, which should not allow the enemy to fire the Ukrainian territory close. Equally important are the tasks of the operation - to cause maximum damage to the enemy, the intersection of his forces and the destruction of logistics. The transfer of hostilities to the Russian territory had a significant psychological effect. First of all, because she demonstrated the possibilities of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The partners, for whom the offensive also became unexpected, supported the right of Ukraine to active self -defense. It took the enemy to take a long time to get together with the forces, then to start attempting to counter -offensive in Kurkh. But most of these attempts were not successful. The situation on the collision line remains difficult, but the armed forces continue to fulfill their tasks.

Rustem Umyerov: The power of Ukrainian developments has already been felt by the enemy's military ai...	This stated the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Rustem Umyerov. -3,925 days of Russian aggression against Ukraine, which began with the temporary occupation of Crimea. 1000 days of full scale invasion. Our answer to the occupiers is the language of strength. It is the only language the dictator understands. And this force is, in particular, our Ukrainian long-range drones,- the minister said. He recalled that a year and a half ago, the President set the task of creating and scaling modern means of long-range destruction. -Today, the capabilities of our DeepStrike have become obvious to the whole world. The force of Ukrainian developments has already been felt by the enemy's military airfields, bases, and fuel depots hundreds and thousands of kilometers deep into Russia. We do not stop at what we have achieved,- Rustem Umyerov said. The minister took part in a meeting with manufacturers of long-range weapons. They discussed prospects, plans, conclusion of long-term contracts and approaches to strengthening the efficiency of the entire industry. -Our goal is to create means capable of hitting targets at the maximum possible distance with maximum accuracy. DeepStrike is a contribution to our victory. Thank you to everyone who works daily to strengthen the defense potential of Ukraine. We remain in touch with each manufacturer in order to promptly resolve issues and bring our victory closer together,- said Rustem Umyerov. As reported by ArmyInform, the main guarantor of Ukraine's stability should become a weapon — 30,000 long-range drones, 3,000 cruise missiles and a wave of technological innovations.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/19/rustem-umyerov-sylu-ukrayinskyh-rozrobok-vzhe-vidchuly-na-sobi-vijskovi-aerodromy-i-bazy-voroga/	2024-11-19T04:14:13-08:00

-Neptunes-, drones and innovations - the head of state defined what guarantees the country's stabili...	This was announced by President Zelensky, who presented in the Verkhovna Rada Internal stability plan. According to President Volodymyr Zelenskyi, the country is developing military production as much as possible. So, more than 2.5 million mortar rounds and artillery shells were fired this year. The next goal is 30,000 long-range drones and 3,000 missiles. In addition, according to the President, it is necessary to be ahead of Russia in technologies. -For this reason, the format of the Technological Stavka is being implemented in Ukraine. In this format, on a regular basis, we will collect the best specialists and the most useful technological ideas. The first meeting of our Stavka will take place at the beginning of December,- said the President. According to the head of state, it is the strong defense and industrial complex of Ukraine that is able to ensure our state's independence in choosing a military strategy. Even without nuclear weapons, Ukraine can find conventional means of deterring the Russian Federation. As ArmyInform reported, Volodymyr Zelenskyi said on the need to appoint a military ombudsman.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/19/neptuny-drony-ta-innovacziyi-glava-derzhavy-vyznachyv-te-shho-garantuye-krayini-stijkist/	2024-11-19T03:48:13-08:00
Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated the need to appoint a military ombudsman	The President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyi, said this while presenting the Internal Stability Plan of Ukraine in the Verkhovna Rada. -A person who will enjoy, first of all, the trust of the military and the entire society. I expect this in the near future,- said Volodymyr Zelenskyi. He emphasized that within the Defense Forces there should be confidential opportunities for soldiers to resolve issues arising from violations of their rights. -Changing approaches to people management in the Armed Forces, in the National Guard of Ukraine, as well as spreading the best management practices in units. Each commander now answers the same question - -What is needed first of all?-. It's the personnel, it's people, the composition of teams, effective real training,- said the President. Volodymyr Zelenskyi also emphasized that it is necessary to talk about difficult things in our army, because effective solutions are possible only if there is an honest conversation about mobilization, reservation, and the system of military personnel. -Problems should be solved, not silenced. The reasons are to be found out and removed,- he said.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/19/volodymyr-zelenskyj-zayavyv-pro-neobhidnist-pryznachyty-vijskovogo-ombudsmena/	2024-11-19T03:26:16-08:00
They are dumping in Lviv, and they are brazen in the Kyiv region - the General Prosecutor's Office r...	This was announced on November 19 by the Office of the Prosecutor General of Ukraine. Criminal schemes related to the illegal acquisition of disabilities allowed conscripts to avoid mobilization and illegally travel abroad. In Lviv, four doctors of one of the inter-district medical and social expert commissions were informed of the suspicion. They falsified medical documentation, on the basis of which men of military age were unjustly given disability. In this way, at least five people left the country. The cost of -services- was from $1,300. In the Kyiv region, two doctors of a district hospital were exposed, who for $12,000 offered a man to organize influence on MSEK members to obtain a disability group. The doctors started a fictitious treatment of the patient, but were exposed while receiving a part of the bribe in the amount of 3 thousand euros. A criminal group of seven people was exposed in Odesa, which included the head of the trauma department, a neuropathologist, an official of the regional center of MSEK and four civilians. Doctors produced fake medical documents that allowed them to evade military service, and an employee of MSEK ensured positive decisions of the commission. The remuneration for such -services- ranged from $4,500 to $6,000. During the searches, a significant amount of material evidence, including forged documents, accounting journals and other materials confirming illegal activity, and cash was seized from the suspects. All participants of the schemes were notified of the suspicion. Depending on the crimes committed, they are charged with abusing influence, obstructing the legal activities of the Armed Forces, assisting in the illegal transportation of persons across the border, and issuing a knowingly false official document (Article 2, Part 2, Article 369-2, Part 1, Article 114- 1, part 3 of article 332, part 1 of article 366 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine). The question of choosing preventive measures for them is being resolved. Investigative actions are ongoing, the circle of involved persons is being established. ArmyInform reminds that it is better not to break the law or risk your life, but to use the aggregator of vacancies in the Armed Forces and recruiting centers. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/19/u-lvovi-dempinguyut-a-na-kyyivshhyni-nahabniyut-u-genprokuratury-povidomyly-rozczinky-na-medychni-shemy-uhylyannya/	2024-11-19T03:19:37-08:00

Then I had to run to Romania and build a new life there, I had to move my relatives there. I have a father, he is already retired. I was in Bakhmut, during the period when it was completely bombed,- said Alina, a resident of Donetsk. Adapting to new realities was probably the most difficult, shared Alina from Odessa. It remains the most difficult even now. -Of course, I would like the situation in the country to stabilize and the war to end as soon as possible. As it was before the beginning, it was not at all full-scale, as it was before the beginning of the war in 2014,- said Alina. Meanwhile, Odessans are in pain and it is difficult. -It is very painful that they are dying, they are bombing us to this day. We very much believe that it will all stop soon,- Anastasia noted in her turn. True, not everyone is optimistic. As for the end of the war, Kateryna from Odesa says that -not surrender- would be a good option for war. -To be honest, I don't think it will be more than 5 years from now. I think it will take a lot of time,- Kateryna said. In general, the people of Odessa state, the final can only be one - we will win. One way or another. After all, there is simply no other way out. How reported ArmyInform, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy shared a video dedicated to 1000 days of heroic struggle of Ukrainians against aggression and for the freedom of his state.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/19/my-peremozhemo-inshogo-vyhodu-prosto-nemaye-vijskovi-zhurnalisty-zapytaly-odesytiv-pro-1000-dniv-vijny/	2024-11-19T03:06:07-08:00
The President instructed to present a new system of contracts for service in the Armed Forces	The President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said this while presenting the Internal Stability Plan of Ukraine in the Verkhovna Rada. According to him, these contracts will have a tangible, very specific motivational component. -And there is no need for any speculation: our state is not preparing to lower the mobilization age. On the basis of new contractual approaches, we should gradually move to the formation of the army to a greater extent thanks to contracts, and not only mobilization,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. As reported by ArmyInform, currently 44 recruiting centers operate in the regions and 3 operating centers in the vertical of the General Staff of the Armed Forces. Tens of thousands of people have already applied to recruiting centers. The number of volunteers in the total number of those who join the army every month is 20-30 percent. The new procedure for recruiting started working on October 1 citizens of Ukraine in electronic form. According to the new rules, the military unit selected by the candidate must clarify his intentions regarding the conclusion of the contract. This happens through the use of a recruiting platform and includes an interview. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/19/prezydent-doruchyv-predstavyty-novu-systemu-kontraktiv-dlya-sluzhby-v-zsu/	2024-11-19T03:03:36-08:00

The criminal was caught red-handed when he was transporting -evaders- in his vehicle to the border, having previously agreed with them on the details of the illegal operation. During the pre-trial investigation, it became known that the shipper is a resident of the Sarnen region. He had previously been convicted of property crimes and committed a new crime while on probation.

Digital transformation of defense: the Armed Forces are testing the latest IT solutions	The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine informs about this. During a joint briefing with the Minister of Defense Rustem Umerov and the Deputy Minister of Defense Kateryna Chernogorenko, dedicated to the results of digitalization in 2024, Anatolii Bargylevych stated that our goal is the continuous development and implementation of effective IT solutions for the needs of the state's defense. -This year, the Armed Forces together with the Ministry of Defense are already testing a number of IT products that will allow them to perform combat tasks more efficiently and, most importantly, save the lives of Ukrainian soldiers,- he added. Anatoliy Bargylevych emphasized that the speed of introduction of new technologies is a key success factor in modern wars. According to him, automated control systems are aimed at increasing situational awareness, promptness of decision-making, planning of operations and management of troops and weapons in real time. About 16 projects related to combat information systems are currently in operation and actively developing. Among them are the automated control systems -AS Tsok-, -VIRAZH-tablet-, -Kropyva-D- and others. All these solutions have proven their effectiveness in practice. In addition, new information and communication systems, software and hardware complexes and specialized software solutions are being actively implemented. They make it possible to significantly reduce bureaucratic processes and automate administrative work in the troops.

Natural selection in the Luhansk region: only the heat-resistant will survive	the head of the Luhansk OVA, Artem Lysogor, told about it. At the same time, those who do not issue a Russian passport by the beginning of 2025 will be significantly limited in their access to social, medical and administrative services. This is another stage of forced passporting of the local population. The occupiers also acknowledged the disruption of the heating season in Siverskodonetsk, Lysychansk, Hirsky and Zoloty. In these cities, people remain without heat and centralized water supply. The lack of repair of damaged infrastructure systems since the time of active hostilities leads to an aggravation of the humanitarian crisis. Local residents found themselves on the edge of survival, relying only on their own strength. Broken water and heat supply systems make winter especially difficult for people.

He invented some breakthroughs for himself: what the Russian commanders are lying about	This is reported by the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. The commander of the 67th Motorized Rifle Division of the Russian Federation recently provided Major General Yusupov, the commander of the 25th Army of the Moscow Military District, with false information about the events on the battle line in the Lyman area, Donetsk region. In particular, in his report, the Russian commander announced the alleged fighting in the vicinity of Yampolivka and the breakthrough of occupiers to Torsky. However, this information is not true. Probably, in this way, the commander tried to hide significant losses from the strikes of the Security and Defense Forces of Ukraine. Distorted or false reports on the state of affairs at the front are common practice at all levels of command of the Russian occupation forces. This once again emphasizes systemic incompetence and disorganization in the ranks of the Russian army.

The anti-drone regiment has arrived: how the American system neutralizes UAVs	In the official release from this manufacturing company from Virginia (USA) emphasizes that this system is the latest development, combining both kinetic and non-kinetic threat neutralization methods, providing a powerful and mobile solution for airspace protection, ArmiyaInform notes. The AirShield architecture is based on a multi-layered structure capable of operating in both stationary and mobile positions, covering all critical stages of protection: detection, tracking, classification, identification, prioritization and neutralization of threats. This complex chain of destruction allows the latest equipment to seamlessly integrate into existing air defense systems. -The threat posed by drones is rapidly evolving,- said Derrick Birdsell, AirShield Program Manager at Leidos. AirShield is designed to adapt to current systems and keep up with technological advances, allowing the addition of effectors for different types of weapons.- Once identified, the system prioritizes the threat and activates the appropriate effectors, which may include kinetic weapons such as missiles or non-kinetic effectors such as lasers or electronic jamming systems. This rapid and adaptive response not only neutralizes UAVs, but also includes cyber security strategies to counter any attempt to disrupt AirShield systems, providing comprehensive protection against emerging threats. Among the key elements of the system is the CUGAR (Co-axial Unmanned Guided Autonomous Rotorcraft) effector. This unmanned vehicle already demonstrates significant capabilities in the field of combating threats, but the company plans to expand its potential by integrating the APKWS (Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System) missile system. This will increase the accuracy and effectiveness of hitting targets. AirShield is easily compatible with a number of other technologies: high-energy lasers, turret guns, and powerful microwave systems. Such flexibility makes the system a versatile solution for combating a wide range of air threats. Leidos is actively exploring the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning to further improve the AirShield system. These technologies can improve the system's ability to adapt and make independent decisions under complex combat conditions. An important aspect of AirShield's development is ensuring its resistance to cyber attacks, for which both offensive and defensive strategies are being developed. This project continues Leidos' work on C-UAS systems initiated by the US Defense Advanced Projects Agency's Mobile Force Protection (MFP) program (DARPA). After a successful demonstration, the program was transferred to the Air and Missile Development Center of the US Army Combat Capabilities Command (DEVCOM). Leidos plans to begin production of the AirShield in 2025, with initial deployment expected to the US Southern Command (SOUTHCOM), which will be a significant advance for this innovative technology. As note analysts of the defense portal Army Recognition, the development of the AirShield system by Leidos is crucial due to the rapid growth of threats posed by unmanned aerial vehicles aerial systems (UAVs). As the use of drones for military operations and hostilities increases, the need for an effective and adaptive defense response becomes critical. AirShield is not only designed to protect military and civilian facilities from potential drone incursions, but also to provide an integrated solution that can adapt to new technologies and combat tactics. This positions Leidos as a leader in a growing market where air safety is a top priority. In addition, as geopolitical conflicts escalate and asymmetric threats grow, countries are looking for ways to protect their critical infrastructure and armed forces. As a versatile air defense system, AirShield offers real-time threat detection, tracking and neutralization capabilities that are vital to maintaining operational superiority. By integrating advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence and various effectors, Leidos positions its system as an important response to the complex security environment, thereby helping to protect the strategic interests of its customers. At the international level, US allies that have problems with enemy UAVs, especially those participating in coalition operations, have expressed interest in acquiring such advanced C-UAS systems to strengthen their air defense capabilities. However, specific details about other foreign military forces interested in the AirShield system may not be publicly available at this time. AirShield is an advanced anti-drone system.

Winter is near. We check dugouts, prepare firewood and pet cats together with soldiers of the 44th O...	ArmyInform visited the soldiers of 44 separate mechanized brigades, who are fighting in one of the hot areas, to ask how they prepare for winter and adjust their life in conditions of constant danger of airstrikes. Do the dugouts leak, how much do mice interfere, how to wash in the field and how much firewood should be prepared for the winter - you will find out in the ArmyInform photo report below. We start our conversation in the field kitchen - this is where they gather to talk about life, to pet cats and dogs that nail themselves to positions, and to prepare food and even wash their hair. Recently, the soldiers insulated it for the winter - oilcloth around the perimeter was enough, because the -burzuyka- heats here almost 24 hours a day. There is an entrance to the dugout from the kitchen, which additionally makes it warmer and more protected. - The dugout was made by those who live here. There are five of us. Well, did Oleg -move- because he stayed in the forest alone in his dugout. He moved to live with us, the boys say. When asked if water does not flow from the kitchen down to the dugout during rains or when the snow melts, they explain that once it could collect at the entrance, but everything was still dry and warm below. At the beginning of the day, a bucket with water is left on the stove, it can stand like this all day long - so that, on occasion, someone who needs it can wash his head or take water for a trip to the bath. We go down from the kitchen to the dugout. From the conversation, it is felt that the guys made a good effort when they built their -housing-: the height here is about 2.3 meters, then there is a 50 cm -roll- and the ground. They show -heating- - the volume that can be placed under one -bunch- is enough for the winter. They say that there are stocks and they have time to chop more firewood. The immediate answer to the question of who is cutting down is everyone who lives. They do it when they are in the mood: -You know, sometimes you want to physically do something. So you take an ax and go chop wood.- They emphasize that they do not do any exceptional things about the dugout on the eve of winter, because it is already warm. Unless you often have to open the door to ventilate, but in general you can breathe normally. — The main thing is to periodically clean the pipe of the -burzuika- from soot. We clean once a week, because we smoke intensively in winter, - they explain. — We sleep in thermal baths, in the winter the -burzhujika- may take a little more firewood. But we did everything in such a way that on the eve of winter there is no need to prepare anything in particular, - says the soldier Valeriy. To avoid leaks, oilcloth is used everywhere. In general, this is a very useful thing in everyday life - it is also used to insulate the toilet and bath. All the remaining gaps are blown with mounting foam, which also helps retain heat. We ask the -Artist- about some features of everyday life that are not found in other of their peers. He immediately shows us a kitchen cabinet, which was made from a box from BC, as well as a -mashed- for potatoes with a grenade tip. Next, -Bob- picks us up - takes us outside and shows us an improvised refrigerator. At first glance, it's just a BC box stuck in the ground, but it's not. The technology, until the frosts hit, is as follows: the box is buried in the ground and the inside is decorated with a foil lining, which should keep the temperature. But in order to ensure the minimum temperature inside, bottles of frozen water are needed - the guys -order- them in advance at the store, and take them when they manage to go to the city. This is not all of the -chips- in these positions. Oleg and I leave the kitchen to see what the boys themselves say - -take a picture, because they won't believe it.- Indeed, it is hard to believe, but at the end of October, tomatoes grow here. The fighters do not know who planted them here and how, but nevertheless they tied up these tomatoes and visit from time to time to check if they have not withered. When asked whether it is realistic to harvest from this bush, he shakes his head in denial, but adds with a smile that the point is not to eat that tomato, but to take care of it as long as it is physically possible. The problem with electricity is solved by the battery, which was hidden under the -hole- in the dugout. A simple one, from a car, is enough for about a week. Guys have two of these: while one is working, the other is charging. Gadgets are -powered- by power banks. Also, the fighters emphasize that when it gets dark, they try not to use any light, they put the -airplane- mode on their phones. Starlinks are also not used, so as not to -burn- positions. At that moment, a dog runs past us, and the guys from the kitchen are yelling to keep an eye on things. Indeed, the dog wanted to chew on the pixel shoulder bag, which later would not be so easy to find in the yellow-green sheet. - They are always dragging around here - yesterday they grabbed a knife and hid it somewhere in the thicket. The other day, a stapler was taken and stolen. So why? Puppies love to cause harm, but once I hung up underwear and T-shirts, they gnawed some, and -dragged- the rest somewhere, - says Oleg. On the way to the next dugout, the fighter tells us about a woodpecker, who was not prevented by oilcloth from finding the desired log: he was so busy that he tore the -roof- at the entrance to the dugout for the boys. He also points to the forest road and says: -This is Festival Street, and over there on the side is Tykha Street.- This is how fighters jokingly call the combination between positions. The guys say that camouflage and distraction are very important in these places. By the way, the -swamp- camouflage net will soon be replaced by a -gray- one. Two brothers live in the second dugout. It is made somewhat differently: the entrance here is directly from the street, the dugout itself is three meters high, and the perimeter is covered with foil insulation. Heating is still the same -burzuyka-. There is an improvised -summer house- nearby. In this part of the forest, it replaces the field kitchen, because here people are going to make coffee, smoke and chat. It's getting dark. We have to gather, so to say goodbye to the boys, we return to the field kitchen. -The forester- says that we must see the bathhouse, which the fighters built in literally three days. - We don't have the conditions to wash properly. -They made a summer shower first, and now it's cold, then they wrapped that shower nicely with cellophane, and put a stove in the middle,- he says with delight. The soldier then explains to us the rules of use: 15 minutes before taking a shower, you must come and throw a few logs into the stove. While they are burning, you go to get water (the one that is heated in a bucket in the kitchen). — That is, the system is like this — you stand in this single bath, warm water pours from above little by little, you wash, drops of water fall from you onto a heated -bottle-, which creates the effect of a sauna in a cellophane-insulated cabin, -explains -The Forester.- -Perhaps what fairy tale will you tell as parting?- - we ask the soldiers. In response, there is a conversation about black army humor and the fact that lately the enemy is making a breakthrough on this part of the front, which is why the number of shelling has increased sharply. - Here the sky is very dangerous - everything is flying, and KABs, and -Lancets-, and artillery. It happened that for three or four days in a row, every hour, some kind of flight arrived somewhere nearby. And if it's quiet, it means that they're waiting for a -lift- and it's about to start again, says -Bob-. The boys add that there used to be a -Saharok- in the dugout, but over time it squealed more and more often. So, when enemy UAVs began to fly very often, it was simply turned off, because it interfered with sleep. They still remember a funny story in farewell. About mice. They say that there were a lot of them here in the beginning. Ants, mosquitoes, flies and ground fleas also bothered. So, over time, the local kittens began to be nailed to the positions, and, as it turned out, this was the best way to get rid of the mice. - It happened that the cat caught a mouse and brought it to bed. Like, look what I caught you, - says one of the fighters and immediately adds: - Anyway, it's better than when I was wearing a -burka-: I put my foot in, I feel something there, I look, I crushed three mice. After that, he constantly checks the shoes before putting them on. And in general, the boys say, there are many different animals here - for example, herds of wild goats run around at night. After that, we say our goodbyes and leave the position in near darkness, hoping that there will never be any more wild animals from the northeast.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/19/zyma-blyzko-pereviryayemo-blindazhi-gotuyemo-drova-ta-gladymo-kotiv-razom-z-bijczyamy-44-ombr-fotoreportazh/	2024-11-18T21:07:24-08:00
-The highest degree of danger when I say -Svetka, pray--: the story of a professor who changed her j...	Oksana Chorna told the correspondent of ArmiyaInform about what she had to experience during these years. Oksana herself recalls these days with a smile: - I tried to return to civilian life in 2017. I was demobilized, started working at the Academy of Sciences, but I was never able to transition from military to civilian life. It is really difficult: here you save people, take out the wounded, and there is paperwork&#8230; I decided that I had to change something. Oksana started volunteering - she went to visit her boyfriends who were stationed near Volnovakha. Since she had a category C license, she drove trucks and took out the wounded. It so happened that she was invited to a university in Oman. Since the summer of 2017, she worked there as a professor of economics at the Modern College of Business and Science in Muscat. And in March 2022, she returned to Ukraine after the start of a large-scale invasion, abandoning everything. — My husband went to serve in his unit, and I am a combat medic in the 57th brigade. At that time, fighting continued near the settlements of Toshkivka, Novotoshkivka, and Lysychansk. I took out the wounded. In my opinion, these were the most terrible battles during the entire time of the large-scale invasion. Then there was the defense of Kherson, Bakhmut, and later Avdiivka. It was very difficult. There were very few of our artillery there, while everything was firing at them - tanks, -barrel-, jet systems. True, there were no KABs yet, but -nurses- (unguided air missile (NAR) - the outdated designation of air missiles as NURS from the Russian -unguided rocket-. - Author) were constantly arriving. And this thing is unpleasant: thin, long, like a needle, flies and sticks at 80 degrees. Oksana then drove a white Mercedes Sprinter. It was an ordinary -fast- brought from Poland, painted in white-red-blue color: - At first I thought of repainting, but I realized that there is no point, because everything is just scattered there. We had a corner where we parked our cars. I remember that when I served in 2014-2016, I had a nice gurney. We put the wounded on it, and everything was fine. But during the battles near Lysychansk, Oksana had to throw away that gurney, because there were always so many wounded that they were stuffed into the car. She found sofa cushions in destroyed houses, threw them in the -ambulance- so that the boys could comfortably sit and lie on them. There was no connection anywhere - only in Lysychansk hospital: Starlink was there. — I came to the hospital, handed over the wounded. They tell me: -don't come back, there is heavy shelling.- But I'm leaving. The thought flashed through my mind that the road was under fire. I hesitated for a while. She left I'm coming Terrible shelling, it is clear that everything there is exploding, burning, as usual - the Russians then threw magnesium bombs at us, which did not extinguish in any way. You can only throw them off the car if you have time, of course. You take the wounded, go back, all the couch cushions are soaked in blood. You throw it away, you take others. It's all difficult&#8230; Oksana constantly mentions the courage of our defenders. She remembered one girl the most: - We took her out with a concussion, gave her to the doctors. And in two days, when I came to pick up the wounded, I saw her again. She simply returned to her own. However, this time she was seriously wounded by shrapnel. We took her out then. I don't know what happened to her next. But I still remember her — One of our positions was shot by a Russian tank. We thought they were all dead. No one made contact from there, the position was lost. Ours retreated. However, within a day, a guy from this position came directly to our medical center from there. He was all dressed in white, so white: face, uniform. He came out with a weapon. He said that he dug himself out because it was buried. In order to survive, he drank water from the battery in the building where they were hiding. He passed without a fight to our positions, reached the first aid station. The doctor examined him, he had an injury only from chest compression. He had no serious injuries, fractures or such open wounds. He slept for two days because he was under a lot of stress. Later, he returned to his position with his boys. He didn't even want to be evacuated&#8230; Oksana also remembered abandoned pets - dogs, cats&#8230; People were moving out and simply leaving their dogs or cats behind. She recalls that there were a lot of injured animals and how doctor Svitlana tried to treat one of them. — But during the Kherson operation, in the fall of 2022, there were already FABs (high-explosive aerial bombs. — Author). They were dropped with parachutes&#8230; And when we searched the fields there and took away our dead, I flew a drone, because there were mines everywhere. So, we flew a -mavik- over the fields to look for our dead, and at first I thought that these were bodies, as white as a body in appearance, but parachutes. There, all the fields were strewn with parachutes from FABs, she recalls. Oksana talks about her trips on the front roads as if it were about ordinary work: - I remember the roads very well. And also, when I drove the -fast-, I started convoys of armored vehicles, that is, I was followed by BMP. We stayed in Avdiivka for almost a year, then I knew every path where you can drive, I knew all the detours. If there was a battle or shelling going on, or just something burning there, I always had a -plan B-. To my question, what Oksana felt during these trips, she answers frankly without hesitation: - It was very scary. The greatest fear was when you arrived at a position and the Russians were already there. We had another girl there, a doctor at the medical center, Svitlana Balenko. And she and I went to the positions in Bakhmut together. We were so scared that we held hands, I was driving, she was next to me. I tell her: -Sveta, the cap is on- - this is the first degree of fear. Then, when it has already arrived, the second stage begins - -the cap is fastened-. And then, when you drive and everything is on fire, burning, you drive there, we had the highest degree of danger when I say -Svetka, pray.- And she began to read some prayer aloud. I say: -give me another one, you've already read this one.- And she knew a lot of prayers, and judging by the fact that we are sitting and talking, it probably helped. In 2024, the situation has changed a lot. Now, taking out the wounded is a very difficult and one hundred percent man's job, because you have to pull them out, carry them to the car. And just sitting in the medical center and not making trips, in Oksana's opinion, made no sense. - I can be useful in other areas of military life. Then she moved to the position of public relations officer. I am talking about my brothers. And recently I made a calendar. The guy whose photo illustrates -January- died. His brothers still have it hanging on the wall. They don't turn it over&#8230; P.S. Currently, Lieutenant Oksana Chorna has received a new assignment in another brigade. Her war continues&#8230; Photo by Olena Khudyakova and from the archive of Oksana Chornaya	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/19/najvyshhyj-stupin-nebezpeky-koly-kazhu-svyetka-molys-istoriya-profesorky-yaka-prominyala-robotu-v-omani-na-sluzhbu-v-zsu/	2024-11-18T20:58:13-08:00
1000 days of the great war: about victory without illusions and despair. ArmiyaInform interview with...	And he also talked about why he chose the -Charter- brigade in particular, what the victory should be and what he plans to do the next day after it. — What is the greatest achievement of Ukraine to 1000 days of the great war? — The achievement, it seems to me, is that we hold on, that we did not give up, that we did not capitulate, despite the fact that at the beginning the balance of forces was not at all in our favor. I think this should be seen as positive. And some disadvantages - there are many of them. I think they should be talked about by specialists, experts who know more about military affairs. - And what is the biggest problem of Ukraine before 1000 days of the great war? - The problem of resources. Still, it is limited in our country. And if we talk about people who are ready to continue fighting, ready to continue to hold on and defend their country, then purely resource-wise, financially or, say, technically, or in the sense of the weapons that we have. But it seems to me that what we focus on is much more important. Do we focus on the positive without any excessive illusions, or do we still focus on the negative to the point of complete despair. — What is the most important question that Ukraine, the Ukrainian state and every citizen of Ukraine must answer now before 1000 days of a large-scale invasion? Is it the same question for all mentioned or can it be different, so, accordingly, different answers? — I think there are questions that further unite us. This is a question of what we are ready for for the sake of our country, for the sake of our future, how much we are ready to unite and what we are ready to do in this aspect. But I understand that the question is quite difficult, especially today, because now, as far as I can see, many people are emotionally tired. In addition, even the worldview is terribly misinformed, because our enemy works very skillfully and very effectively on our consciousness. — What advice would you give today to yourself 1000 days ago? Would you then and then for 1000 days do the same thing or would you do something different and different? - But in general the same. Perhaps I would advise myself to work more purposefully and in a more targeted way, after all, from then on, I should immediately set myself up for a long distance. I, like many compatriots, also experienced some emotional swings from falling into a certain euphoria when something was going well for us, to some dark days of despair. It takes a lot of effort. But hindsight is easy to be smart about. In fact, we all go through this path together, step by step. To make some mistakes, it seems to me, is natural. The main thing is to be able to draw some conclusions from them. — Since the first day of the war, since 2014, you have been volunteering, engaged in public activities. Why did you ultimately decide to join the Defense Forces as a serviceman?- I have always tried to be as efficient as possible. As long as there was an opportunity to work effectively as a volunteer - worked as a volunteer. But the law on mobilization was passed. I am a man of conscription age, a citizen of Ukraine of conscription age. As a law-abiding citizen, it was not even in my thoughts to dodge, hide or look for other options. Therefore, I immediately began to prepare for mobilization when I learned that such a law would be passed. —You have chosen the National Guard of Ukraine and the -Charter- brigade. Why NSU in particular and why -Charter- in particular? — The question of one's own effectiveness, one's own rational involvement was important to me and will remain important in the future. I know this unit, my friends and I created it, we saw how the unit was formed, how it grew, how it first turned from the DFTG into a full-fledged battalion, and then, actually, into a brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine. I know the leadership, the command of the brigade very well, I know many fighters personally. Thanks to this, I knew how I could contribute, how I could be useful, where I could be involved and where I could be effective. Therefore, for me, there was no special question regarding the -Charter-. —The experience of -Charter- is very positive, it is very media. How can this successful experience of -Charter- and other brigades be scaled to the entire Defense Forces of Ukraine? What should be done for this? - In fact, the -Charter- is not the only one. We have several divisions that perfectly understand that today both the autonomy of the division and the medialness of the division are important. And it's not about PR, it's definitely about efficiency. When you know how to build communications inside the unit and outside - both with business representatives and with representatives of the public - you have much more opportunities to provide your unit, to provide the soldiers with everything they need. It seems to me that this is definitely a positive thing, and it is probably not necessary to look for any negative here. It's important for Charter, it's a feature of Charter, and we actually try to be quite open in communication with society and to be honest. In my opinion, this creates a rather positive image of the brigade. Thanks to this, many people want to join the -Charter- today, in particular, fighters from other units are applying. I think this shows that the team is doing everything right. And how to transfer it to the experience of other divisions, is it possible to do it? I think it has to be done and, obviously, it cannot be done by the unit itself. It should still be an initiative on the part of the command, because, indeed, in many respects our Defense Forces need changes, need development, improvement. This should not be feared, it should be worked on, understanding that this is an improvement, that these changes will increase our efficiency, will make life easier for the fighter. — What should a real victory look like? What should we preserve in order to remain Ukraine? — Ukraine must preserve its statehood. Ukraine must preserve its citizens. This is the most valuable thing that can be - every human life, because every human loss, every human death is something irreversible, it is something that cannot be compensated in any way. And victory will be, it seems to me, future security, when the threat of defeat actually disappears, when the threat of human or territorial losses disappears. Therefore, I think that the issue of victory is not only purely physical, but also metaphysical. Here much will depend on what can be expected after the moment when the end of the war is announced. — Did you plan the day after the victory? What will you do after the war is over? - I have a lot of plans. In fact, I think it will somehow be further connected to the unit. -Charter- is not just a company of people who randomly got together, took up arms, and are going to disperse after the war is over. We create an environment, we create a community, a society. Regardless of whether this war ends, we will continue to have a lot of joint work, because we are united by our values, united by some common idea, common principles. Therefore, I think that I will meet this day in the company of my friends, with whom we are currently serving in the ranks of the brigade.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/19/1000-dniv-velykoyi-vijny-pro-peremogu-bez-ilyuzij-ta-zneviry-intervyu-armiyainform-z-sergiyem-zhadanom/	2024-11-18T20:32:00-08:00
Darknet in Russian: fakers spread lies about mercenary bodies	The Russians are also spreading information that they are allegedly selling the heart of a murdered 31-year-old German mercenary who served in the Armed Forces on the darknet. The price of such an organ is allegedly $70,000. Propagandists assure that the organ is in -good condition- and is sold exclusively to Germans. The -proof- is a screenshot of an ad from the darknet. The darknet (dark web) is a network of encrypted online content that cannot be accessed through conventional search engines. To access the darknet, users install a private browser and a virtual network that helps hide their identity and location. Because of this anonymity, this network is often used to sell drugs, share stolen data, and conduct other illegal activities. But Russian fakers faked not only the darknet announcement about the sale of the heart, but even the photo. It is not a human organ, but the powerful drug opium. -Black transplantology- is a favorite topic of Russian propagandists. They constantly lie that the military's organs are -illegally- removed in hospitals. Although in reality no such case has been recorded. In the fake about the sale of the heart, the Russians combined two narratives at once - about -black transplant specialists- and so-called mercenaries. In this way, they wanted to assert that foreign military personnel in Ukraine are treated as cannon fodder, and after that they will also -sell- them for organs. The goal is to undermine the confidence of foreigners in Ukraine and reduce their support. We emphasize once again that there are no -mercenaries- in Ukraine. Foreigners serve in the Defense Forces under a contract and have the full status of military personnel.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/19/darknet-po-rosijsky-fejkoroby-poshyryuyut-brehnyu-pro-organy-najmancziv/	2024-11-18T20:12:21-08:00
1000 Days of All-out War: A Timeline of Evil	1,000 days of time, during which Ukraine etched its name on the world map with blood and iron, cultivated respect and admiration for the colors of its flag, the flawless geometric forms of the national coat of arms, and the chivalry of the Warriors of Light — the Armed Forces of Ukraine throughout the globe. 1000 days that established us as a monolithic nation — ethnically, politically, spiritually. Of course, in a war that has lasted 10 years and 9 months, more than a quarter of which is already large-scale, it is somehow no longer commilfo to speak such pathetic meanings. After all, on the 1000th day, one feels general fatigue from what is happening: from the daily statistics of losses, shelling, destruction, from the enemy's advances in the populated areas of eastern Ukraine that have been wiped off the face of the earth. In addition, every day everyone has to filter out hostile IPSOs from objective news in the information space, which is imposed on those who are mostly awake due to constant -shakhed- attacks of the night&#8230; But even though there is a war, life goes on. And everyone who lives this thousandth day will certainly remember all those stages of confrontation, which cause not only sadness, but also pride, respect, inspiration for further struggle towards our inevitable Victory. Let's remember and try to systematize the periods of the Russian-Ukrainian war and we, together with the military historian, head of the NGO -Military History Center- Vasyl Pavlov. -This war is the most informational of all the wars Ukraine has waged throughout its history. In connection with this, we have a large number of materials, information, testimonies that have completely different origins. These are official documents and unofficial videos on Facebook, TikTok, YouTube, etc. These are scientific studies, journalistic studies, articles in information resources, documentaries, stories in the news. All this creates a huge array of information that really needs to be systematized,- says Vasyl Pavlov. It is very important to remember and understand how a war develops, because every war has its stages. The large-scale one was preceded by a -hybrid- phase that began with the occupation of Crimea. Then, from July 2021, there was preparation for the -great war-, which, unfortunately, was inevitable. And when on February 24, 2022, the Russian Federation carried out an open, large-scale attack on Ukraine, a new period of Russian aggression against Ukraine began, which scientists also divide into parts. In particular, specialists of the National Defense University of Ukraine single out several strategic defensive and offensive operations, and Vasyl Pavlov prefers periodization by years. -Since we are in a new information society, where events develop faster, are analyzed faster, even history is written faster, then ordinary people, and information resources, and even scientists need much faster periodization. We de facto periodize this war by years, or by campaigns: the campaign of the 22nd year, the campaign of the 23rd year, the campaign of the 24th. Yes, the 2024 campaign can be conventionally divided, as is traditionally done, into winter-spring, spring-summer, summer-autumn, and now we have already entered the autumn-winter campaign. Each of these periods has its own peculiarities and characteristic features related to the climate, the territory, and nature, but at the same time they have features related, for example, to the mobilization campaign in our country, the completion or opening of hidden mobilization in Russia. They coincide with the provision or non-provision of military-technical assistance to us. That is, there are a lot of factors that can affect one or another periodization, no matter what it is - whether it will be calendar, or event, or symbolic, that is, it will be based on some individual symbolic events, from which we will count. For example, the periodization of 2022 was significant. In fact, it was all based not so much on the calendar as on significant events that could be celebrated (the Battle for Kyiv, the escape of the occupiers from Zmiiny Island, the Kharkiv and Kherson offensive operations.— Author). But such periodization is possible only during the active phase of hostilities, when both opponents are active. At the moment, due to a number of factors, we are forced to respond to Russia's actions. If we talk about the 2024 campaign, then the question of any war arises here: how do we write its history? Do we write history through our actions or do we write history through the actions of the adversary? I want to explain this. The description of any war is that it can be done in different ways: how the enemy acted and how we countered him, or how we acted and the enemy responded to our actions. And there is a significant difference in this. It consists in who sets the initiative, who describes and how he describes. They say that history is written by the victors (and in this war, I hope, we will win), but the situation demands that the history of this war be written before its end. And we do it, but the Russians do it too,- Vasyl Pavlov explains. In particular, the destruction of the Russian A-50U long-range radar detection aircraft over the Sea of ​​Azov and the Krasnodar Territory, the signing of Security Agreements and the Global Peace Summit, battles in the north of Kharkiv region and in the Kursk region of the Russian Federation were significant for us in the current year. -The Kursk operation is really a completely new milestone, a new element. This is not the liberation of the occupied territories, but the transfer of hostilities to the official territory of the enemy, which is recognized as international borders. But, as in our case, no international organization could influence these actions. Frankly speaking, Ukraine committed an act of aggression. There is nothing wrong with that. We committed an act of aggression in response to an act of aggression. But we did do something that is very difficult to do in defensive wars — we moved the fighting into the enemy's territory. In this way, as they like to say, we turned the board upside down. That is, we changed the rules of the game, changed the approaches to them. And thus, many plans of the Russians for the summer-autumn campaign, for the second part or for the end of the summer, were fundamentally confused. After all, they were forced to respond to this, and to respond, perhaps, not so much on the front line itself, but in the information plane, for their citizens. They can advance as much as they want on the territory of Ukraine, but they still cannot get rid of the fact that Ukrainian troops are on the territory of Russia itself. This territory is quite large. And what to do with these troops, Russia has not invented at the moment,- Vasyl Pavlov notes. Historically, people remember the -last blood- - the war closest to them in time. Such was the Second World War for many of us before the events of 2014, and then in 2022. Once, when I was a schoolboy and learned that the period of German occupation of Kyiv lasted 778 days, I thought for a long time about what it was like to live in prison for so long, without rights and freedoms, under the threat of being shot at any moment. Old people in the 1990s, recalling the -last war- — the Second World War, said that any troubles can be survived if there was no war. But she is. Every day for 1000 days, the enemy has been trying to destroy us. Mariupol, for example, has been under occupation longer than during World War II. Now the collective memory of Ukrainians is building a grandiose canvas of images and symbols, events and phenomena, heroes and anti-heroes, which became decisive in the Ukrainian resistance to Russian aggression and will form the image of the -last blood-, the -last war- for future generations. Therefore, the Russian-Ukrainian war and the Victory in it will remain the core of the national memory of Ukrainians for a long time. I want them to stay like this forever.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/19/1000-dniv-shyrokomasshtabnoyi-vijny-hronologiya-zla/	2024-11-18T20:00:23-08:00
The navies of Ukraine and Great Britain will improve unmanned technologies	This was announced on November 18 by the Naval Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Among the main topics of the conversation are the results of the work of the Coalition on the development of maritime capabilities of Ukraine, the strengthening of the defense potential of our Navy and the development of promising directions, in particular, unmanned technologies. -Thanks to the support of Great Britain and other partners, we continue to improve our capabilities,- said Oleksiy Neizhpapa. He also informed his British colleague about the operational situation in the Black Sea, the participation of marines in combat operations on key areas of the front and the consequences of today's Russian attack on Odesa. Admiral Ben Key expressed his condolences to the victims of the Russian aggressor and assured that the partners will continue to do everything possible for Ukrainian victory. As reported by ArmyInform, the Commander of the Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Vice Admiral Oleksii Neizhpapa met with the commander of the Royal Danish Naval Forces Rear Admiral Henrik Rüberg.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/18/vms-ukrayiny-ta-velykoyi-brytaniyi-budut-vdoskonalyuvaty-bezpilotni-tehnologiyi/	2024-11-18T12:08:16-08:00
The Armed Forces reported the number of shells spent in 2023	About this in interv& #8217;yu RBC-Ukraine said the Deputy Commander of Missile Forces and Artillery of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Colonel Serhii Musienko. He said that the Soviet caliber of 152 mm is currently being superseded. -However, first of all, there is still production of these ammunitions in the world. And there are quite modern artillery systems that are currently in use in our troops of this caliber, and they are supplied with 152 mm shots. These are Czech DANA-M2 self-propelled guns and a Soviet Msta-B howitzer, Serhii Musienko reported. In 2022, the Defense Forces used about 1.5 million artillery munitions, ranging from 120 mm mines to rockets to MLRS. Half of them are of 152 mm and 122 mm caliber. A third were 155 mm shots. According to him, at the beginning of the full-scale invasion of Russia, the Armed Forces of Ukraine used 152 mm and 122 mm guns at the front. And starting from the middle of 2022, 155 mm and 105 mm howitzers, which were transferred by partners, began to appear in the Ukrainian troops. &#8220;Already in 2023, we spent more than 3 million shells. Of these, 1.6-1.7 million were 155 mm ammunition. That is, half of the ammunition we used &#8211; it is 155 mm. By 2024, the ratio of 152 mm and 155 mm will be 1 to 10, respectively,- noted Serhii Musienko. According to him, along with the 155 mm caliber, the 105 mm caliber ammunition has proven itself well.

Doctors of last hope - a plastic surgeon and a pediatric oncologist save wounded soldiers	The video was released on November 18 on the brigade's channel. The headquarters of the brigade is a place where wounded, bleeding, shocked and contused soldiers from the front are taken after heavy battles, shelling, and explosions. If they're here, it means they've been through hell, but still have a chance at life. At the headquarters, the wounded are given medical assistance, their condition is stabilized, and then they are taken to the hospital. Currently, the medical team of the 93rd brigade employs military surgeons who have proven themselves to be among the most experienced. They know how to deal with critical bleeding, lacerations, multiple debris and military stress. But they did not always have such special skills. One of the surgeons, Oleg Kolomiets, in civilian life was a pediatric surgeon and oncologist, treating children from cancer. And Viktor Rodin was a plastic surgeon before the war: he reduced noses and bellies, rejuvenated the face, enlarged breasts and performed other operations in the field of aesthetic medicine. About how the brigade headquarters works, whether it was difficult to switch from civilian to military specialization, which periods of the war were most memorable, what keeps the mentality of medics in the army afloat, see the story of the brigade: As reported by ArmyInform, the pilot with the call sign Lyolik from the Black Raven 93 unit of the mechanized brigade -Holodny Yar- kyyevi/->won the first competition in the history of Ukraine among fpv pilots, in which 15 combat brigades and units took part.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/18/likari-ostannoyi-nadiyi-plastychnyj-hirurg-ta-dytyachyj-onkolog-ryatuyut-poranenyh-bijcziv/	2024-11-18T11:32:15-08:00

How our tank tricked an enemy drone — a unique maneuver near Kurakhov	The video of the duel was released on November 18 on the unit's channel. Two of our tanks entered an occupied village near the city of Kurakhovo and with direct fire destroyed several houses with a concentration of enemy manpower. Having worked on the targets, the first tank released a smoke screen and began to move away. All of a sudden, an enemy FPV drone appeared and tried to attack the second tank standing in cover. But it turned out that our tankers were ready for an uninvited guest. First, they stopped in the lowlands, which provided a radio shadow for controlling the kamikaze drone. Secondly, the most vulnerable part of the tank - the stern - was covered by bushes. Enemy drones made several unsuccessful attempts to attack the tank, after which it hung up and began to wait for our tankers to come out of their hiding place. Our tank made a deceptive maneuver, gave smoke, with which it deceived the invaders. Enemy pilots began to look for a tank where it was no longer there. At this time, both tanks took cover with their EW and went to their positions. And the enemy drone lost control and flew up, only to fall. &nbsp; As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the -Sharp Cartouches- unit of the National Guard /->destroyed Russian attack aircraft, which were traveling on two golf carts.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/18/yak-nash-tank-obduryv-vorozhyj-dron-unikalnyj-manevr-pid-kurahovym/	2024-11-18T08:19:39-08:00

Enemy activation is possible: Russian airstrikes have increased in Kharkiv Oblast	About this on the air of -Social News- spoken the spokesman of OTU -Kharkiv- lieutenant colonel Yevgeny Romanov. According to Yevgeny Romanov, the tactics of the invaders in the north of Kharkiv region have not changed, they still attack in small groups. However, the active involvement of aviation can prepare the ground for escalation. -The number of bombings indicates that activation is possible here. Because it's a distraction. But this does not significantly affect the state and position of our troops,- said the spokesman of the Kharkiv OTU. However, Yevgeny Romanov notes, one of the enemy's most common needs is to replenish the current set of troops. Because the ZSU is effectively destroying Russian manpower and equipment. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that the enemy assaults in Kharkiv Oblast were choked, in just one day the defenders' -deeds- amounted to 81 wounded and 53 killed enemies.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/18/mozhlyva-aktyvizacziya-voroga-na-harkivshhyni-pobilshalo-rosijskyh-aviaudariv/	2024-11-18T07:44:13-08:00

Ukrainian fighters, according to the UAV platoon commander, are helped by artificial intelligence and the latest technologies - without it, it would be very difficult to notice the movement of small groups of attack aircraft. -The enemy is conducting assaults from the lowlands. If it seems that this is a very positive factor for us, but in fact it turns out that there is a reservoir in the lowlands and in the -gray- part of the day we have fog.

-Gerbery- made of plywood and foreign electronics: the GUR told about a drone that imitates -Shahedy...	This is stated in message GUR MOU. The aggressor state of Russia assembles such multi-tasking UAVs at a factory in the city of Yelabuga. -Gerbera- can carry a combat unit as a kamikaze and carry out radio-electronic reconnaissance, in particular, to detect air defense positions and record the hits of other strike drones. This UAV imitates the Shahed-136/Geran-2 and is widely used by Russia to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses. Due to the use of simple materials (plywood, foam), -Gerbera- is ten times cheaper than -Shakhed-. However, the structure of this drone contains a set of components of foreign manufacturers, which is already familiar for Russian weapons. The research of the downed samples proved that the Russians are making these UAVs according to the Chinese prototype using foreign components imported from China. The developer of the UAV is the Chinese model aircraft manufacturer Skywalker Technology Co., Ltd., which also produces fuselages and organizes the delivery of kits to Russia. Delivery is carried out through third-party companies. The anti-interference antenna (CRPA) contains chips from Analog Devices and Texas Instruments (USA), NXP Semiconductors (Netherlands). The universal flight controller also includes components manufactured by Texas Instruments, Atmel (USA), STMicroelectronics, U-Blox (Switzerland), NXP Semiconductors (Netherlands), XLSEMI (China). For targeting by the pilot (according to the FPV-drone principle) of the barrage version of the UAV and conducting aerial reconnaissance, the Gerbera is equipped with a Chinese camera with a three-axis suspension Topotek KHY10S90 and a Xingkai Tech Mesh Network XK-F358 modem. The DLE60 engine is manufactured by the Chinese Mile Hao Xiang Technology Co., Ltd. In the summer of 2024, this company came under US sanctions for supplies to Russia.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/18/gerbery-z-fanery-ta-inozemnoyi-elektroniky-u-gur-rozpovily-pro-dron-shho-imituye-shahedy/	2024-11-17T23:17:44-08:00

Junior Sergeant -Hunger-: the story of an anti-aircraft gunner from the DSHV who destroyed an enemy ...	— I'm -Hunger- because that's what the boys like, and to be honest, I'm always hungry for everything - movement and adrenaline. Well, sometimes I don't finish my meal or overeat, as happens on duty,- Ivan jokes. A paratrooper from Bila Tserkva, he has been serving in the brigade for the second year, which he calls his second family. And when he is asked what he does in the service, Ivan simply answers: -Everything — training of personnel, and inspection of property, ammunition, missiles, weapons. And, of course, I motivate the boys. Sometimes with a word, sometimes with a pronoun. The main thing is to set them up so that they don't want to die, but want to kill and come back.- One of Ivan's major achievements was the 2024 raid on Kurshchyna, during which he shot down a Russian Ka-52 Alligator. -The third day of the operation. The guys broadcast on the radio: pinwheels are flying, running for destruction. I'm in position, taking the Stinger MANPADS. The helicopter was flying straight at me. Only the power grid got in the way - I was afraid that the rocket might catch on. But everything went smoothly. A shot, and in a few seconds I hide in the landing so that the enemy does not capture the position. I hear on the radio: -Hit!- The guys are happier than I am, because I'm in shock. Then came the feeling of maximum joy and satisfaction. After that, the enemy did not fly so brazenly,- he says. -Hunger- emphasizes that the -Stinger- is a powerful tool, but not all MANPADS are so -smooth-: -I had 4 missiles for the older MANPADS that simply did not fly - old equipment. You want to cover the infantry, but you can't. Therefore, Stinger is a solution to many problems for us. Everything is simple there: the target in the crosshairs - a second and a half - a shot. There is no time to think.- Now there are slightly fewer combat missions, because the enemy has realized that it is dangerous to fly in. But, according to Ivan, they are always ready. -If it is a UAV of the Zala or SuperCam type, we are working on the situation. If it just flies by, we don't waste the resource and don't -burn- the position. If it flies specifically at us, then we shoot it down with small arms. With MANPADS, we only go for the -big fish-. When Ivan joined the service, at first he planned to join the 95th Brigade of the Military Police, because his friends served there. But he got into the 82nd and did not regret it: -When I started studying, many of my fellow students wanted to study art or be tank drivers. I thought and realized that it would be cool for me to destroy enemy aircraft as much as possible. And so it happened. I am constantly learning, improving my qualifications. I dream of becoming the chief sergeant of the platoon and not only teaching the boys, but also running with them, destroying enemy turntables.- Ivan's words resonate in hearts. He lives for Victory and does everything so that the enemy is afraid to even appear in the sky over Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/18/molodshyj-serzhant-golod-istoriya-zenitnyka-z-dshv-yakyj-znyshhyv-vorozhyj-ka-52-na-kurshhyni/	2024-11-17T21:00:05-08:00
Sergeant's Day of the Armed Forces of Ukraine: about military art, refusal of officer positions and ...	Why do sergeants sometimes have to act as officers at the front? How many sergeants have received state awards since 2014? And in general, how is the sergeant corps living in the third year of a large-scale invasion? Chief Sergeant of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Oleksandr Kosynskyi told ArmyInform about this. — Sergeants’ tasks today essentially remained the same: preparing personnel for combat, keeping weapons in constant readiness, preparing positions, managing people during combat, their moral support, maintaining discipline, says the chief sergeant of the Armed Forces. According to him, quite often sergeants and senior officers perform the duties of officers. This is sometimes due to the absence or inability of such persons to manage the personnel, to manage the battle. After all, some of these officers were drafted into the army only because they have a higher education. — Sergeants, who perform the duties of platoon commanders, manage the unit during the battle. Some even serve as company commanders. So war is not about education, it is about ability, training and experience. Oleksandr Kosynsky claims that sergeants and senior officers are practitioners. Because they were all soldiers, they know how to work with them. Sergeants are always closer to people, and therefore they manage to adapt faster to the conditions of the constantly changing environment. — The main thing is that there should be support, interaction and freedom of action, choice of methods and ways of completing tasks. As for the challenges, one of the most critical for us sergeants is the lack of entry into the personnel units, as well as the physical and moral qualities of those who come. He explains this by the fact that during the fighting of such intensity as now, servicemen fall out of formation every day. First of all, due to injuries and contusions. Many return to duty after being wounded, but it takes time: - Even after some wounds, no matter how motivated a sergeant is, he can no longer physically perform the combat tasks he used to perform. — The sergeants in the units are also today accepting newcomers who come from the training centers. Who after BZVP, who after professional training. The sergeants carry out their additional training and adaptation, Kosynskyi says. And he adds that this training is conducted by sergeants with combat experience, specifically for the types of weapons that are in the unit. And these are not only automatic rifles and submachine guns, these are also machine guns and portable anti-tank vehicles: - Sergeants teach the art of survival on the battlefield, train for the type of combat that is relevant in this area of ​​the front. But many of those who are called -young recruits- often lack the proper physical shape, endurance, have diseases and injuries, or are morally weak, not warriors. The chief sergeant of the Armed Forces claims that during the training of recruits, both motivation and confidence increase, skills and abilities increase. But you cannot go against certain physical or psychological limitations. And to carry out a combat mission, strong and brave men are needed. — And they are a potential for filling sergeant positions. After all, sergeants also fall out of the ranks. Or they go to higher positions, after the detachment - to the positions of chief sergeants of platoons, companies, battalions. This is important so that they can apply their experience at the highest levels of military management. But sergeant positions must be constantly replenished, and there are difficulties with this. There is no soldier - there will be no sergeant, says Kosynskyi. Separately, he notes that many sergeants and foremen are appointed to officer positions: - Why do they take the best of the best. Yes, it is important to replenish officer positions as well. It is important that there are experienced, adequate military personnel. The success of the battle, the survival and health of personnel, the survivability of the unit itself, and its cohesion depend on them, on their decisions and actions. At the same time, the chief sergeant of the Armed Forces notes that it is very difficult to maintain and grow in these conditions the -bone- of professional, experienced and motivated sergeants who would form the basis of the foundations of the sergeant corps. Because no one but a sergeant will train a soldier. — We have more than 250,000 non-commissioned officer and sergeant positions, which are approximately four-fifths full. This is what I say for all types and types of troops. -Unfortunately, the worst staffing is precisely in those combat units and units that fight the enemy on the front line every day,- says Oleksandr Kosynskyi. And he clarifies that now about three quarters of sergeants are mobilized. That is, the personnel potential of professional sergeants, who have been raised since 2014, bearers of the -sergeant idea-, is decreasing: - Although I must note that a lot of mobilized servicemen are mastering the sergeant's business, taking over the foundations that were laid in the formation of the modern professional corps of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, reach a level no worse than that of professional sergeants. I meet a lot of such mobilized sergeants and chiefs while working in units, in areas of combat operations. I am often surprised at how quickly some of them are permeated by our sergeant's ideas, values. The master sergeant emphasizes that many of these soldiers have already completed various non-commissioned officer courses, and abroad as well. — I meet many and those who refused to move to officer positions, although they have a higher education, some even more than one. I think, I believe, I know that the future of the sergeant corps lies with such sergeants and chiefs. Because only the faithful are worthy. Our sergeants and senior officers are modern heroes, supermen, those on whose shoulders rests this thin and extremely long battle line of our nation's battle with the evil coming at us from Moscow, Kosinsky notes. Since 2014, more than 25,000 sergeants and officers have received state awards, 105 of them the title of Hero of Ukraine, unfortunately, 76 of them posthumously. — But they are our Heroes forever. Those who inspire us to continue the struggle, those who define the meaning of this struggle, our brothers in arms who are waiting for us and look at us from the sky. We have no right to betray them, must fight, must win. Sergeant Day for us, it is not just a professional holiday&#8230; rather, it is not even a holiday, especially at this time. This is a day when we can pay tribute to our fallen brothers and feel our identity and our unity in this battle.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/18/den-serzhanta-zsu-pro-vijskove-mystecztvo-vidmovu-vid-oficzerskyh-posad-ta-udostoyenyh-zvannya-geroya-ukrayiny/	2024-11-17T20:48:52-08:00
Noah's Ark for Kim: North Korea is likely to build its largest warship	Project details investigated specialists from the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS). As stated in the expert report, North Korea has built a new slipway 170 meters long and 30 meters wide at its shipyard in the city of Nampho. The direct construction of the facility started in May 2024. Such volumes of the construction site are a third larger than the dimensions of the recently launched Amnok and Nampo class corvettes for the DPRK military fleet, which were the largest military ships of the North Korea, built after the Najin-class frigates, delivered in the 1970s. Thanks to the appearance of such an object, the regime of -Rocketman Kim-, as the leader of the DPRK was nicknamed by the newly elected US President Donald Trump, will be able to build a particularly powerful, as according to its dimensions, a ship. However, experts do not yet have an understanding of what kind of combat vessel it might be. Available satellite images show that the North Korean regime is already building some kind of ship on this slipway. In particular, you can see something similar to sections of the hulls painted with a red oxide primer. You can also see two gantry cranes that can be used to move sections of the ship's hull along the slipway. But since the North Koreans have stretched a frame with a camouflage net over this slipway, it is impossible to see the construction of this ship in more detail on satellite images. Researchers from the IKK defense portal Defense Express (DE) singled out an interesting detail, which is that the shipyard in the North Korean city of Nampo essentially has a -dual purpose-: civilian vessels were also built there. However, it was at this shipyard that two missile corvettes under the Amnok project were also built, which are currently the most powerful warships of the DPRK Navy. that these ships have a displacement of up to 1.5 thousand tons and a hull length of 80 meters. And it is on this comparative basis that the two versions are further based on which task North Korea could build a huge, considering its scale, a slipway as long as 170 meters. The first version - the North Korean regime has the ambition to build a more powerful surface ship for its Navy, for example, a &#8220;missile frigate&#8221; class. The second version is that the DPRK wants to use this facility to build a new ballistic missile carrier submarine. On this background, ICC DE mentions the report that North Korea and Russia may work, including segment of technologies for the construction of nuclear submarines. Which, in turn, leads to the conclusion that in this story, Pyongyang's new project was not without Moscow's advice and help. While Nampo Ship yard can produce a vessel with a larger hull, which in mirrors the design of a modern warship, North Korea is unlikely to be able to single-handedly reproduce the relevant modern combat systems and capabilities. This is another proof of the presence of the -hand of Moscow-. kp/en/article/q/bb7704b49447dd80b52c60420f45e9dc.kcmsf->reported that during a September 2024 visit to a new naval base under construction, dictator Kim said , that the country's Navy -will soon receive large surface warships and submarines that cannot be anchored at existing warship mooring facilities. And the construction of a naval base for the operation of the latest large warships has become an urgent task.- One of the possible explanations for what kind of ship may be under construction is that a floating shock platform is being built with placing cruise missiles of a certain type on it. Also, in September 2023, Pyongyang test-launched long-range cruise missiles from an Amnok-class corvette. Thus, a larger platform will allow the transportation of more cruise missiles and will also potentially allow short-range ballistic missiles to be included in its arsenal. At the same time, experts note that although the North Korean fleet is formally large enough in terms of the number of vessels, it mainly consists of from small patrol and coastal ships, which have extremely limited combat capabilities. Thus, the hypothetical -frigate- (if it really is) will be a giant step forward for North Korea's military ambitions. A visual presentation of the North Korean missile project.

Human shield tactics in Kurshchyna: the enemy mirrors its own crimes	Thus, Russian and Belarusian propaganda resources coordinatedly disseminated false information, arguing that the Armed Forces in Kur Region allegedly use a live shield tactics. In fact, the tactic of a live shield is typical for the Russian army, which since 2014 has been repeatedly covered by civilians in occupied territories and prisoners of war. For example, in December 2023, the Ukrainian Prosecutor's Office opened criminal proceedings on the use of Ukrainian prisoners as a living shield in the Zaporozhye region. The Kremlin's propaganda resources are also spreading excerpts from an interview with a Ukrainian prisoner of war about the threats of -shooting in the back- that he heard from the commanders. Ukrainian prisoners are forced to fulfill the requirements of the invaders: confess to the crimes invented or committed by the Russians themselves, to speak under a record of frank lies, etc. The torture and murder of prisoners, other violations of the rules and customs of war is a common practice for Russians. Like the practice of thighs, invented by Stalin and revived in the Russian army. This function is currently performed by the Kadyrov special unit -Akhmat-. Back in March 2022, the SBU published intercepted negotiations by the Chechen language of Rosgvardia's fighter with his wife, where he confesses that his key task is to restrain the Russian military: -Our task is to drive back of those east soldiers who begin to run away from the blows of Ukrainian artillery.- Therefore, the current accusations of the Ukrainian military are another attempt by Russian propaganda to erase reality and justify their own crimes.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/18/taktyka-zhyvogo-shhyta-na-kurshhyni-vorog-viddzerkalyuye-vlasni-zlochyny/	2024-11-17T20:03:48-08:00

-Plus or minus 30 years- - the Russians are throwing young fighters into the offensive	Andriy Otchenash, a serviceman of the 4th operational brigade of the National Guard -Rubizh-, told about this on ArmyTV stream. -When we destroy the enemy, we try to fly around and see how the enemy is equipped and stuff. We can see that quite young guys are really going into battle. And this youth gives them many chances to survive. Because, objectively, it is much more difficult to destroy a young enemy than to destroy some grandfather who will be half fatter and half slower,- Andrii Otchenash said. According to him, captured Russians of this age group explain that they went to fight because of money. Added to this are the consequences of propaganda, because Russians believe that they are defending their country on foreign land. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the -Svoboda- battalions of the 4th operational brigade of the National Guard -Rubizh- caused great losses to the occupiers who tried to break through our defenses.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/17/plyus-minus-30-rokiv-rosiyany-kydayut-v-nastup-molodyh-bijcziv/	2024-11-17T10:57:09-08:00

-It blew so much that everything in the world sparkled-: Druzhkivka in Donetsk region suffered a ter...	reported this by the head of the Donetsk OVA Vadym Filashkin. Correspondents of ArmiyaInform recorded the consequences of the occupiers' devastating attack on civilian residential buildings and infrastructure. Local residents say that the shelling took place at night around 11:30 p.m. - 11:35 p.m. The impact of the enemy ammunition was extremely powerful. - It blew so much that everything in the world sparkled! - says one of the women. — God had mercy that there were no dead or seriously wounded, they all sigh together, answering questions about the victims. It was the hardest for a 90-year-old woman, whose house is located closest to the epicenter of the explosion - she has numerous bruises and stress. - On the head, on the hands, on the knees, fragments fell, the leg was completely blue, - says her daughter. After providing help, the children took their mother to their home. — She is 90 years old, it is very difficult for her mother, — adds the son. The impact was so powerful that, in addition to the place of impact, it destroyed dozens of residential and commercial buildings on three nearby streets. Even in buildings several tens of meters away from the place where the ammunition was hit, the roofs were damaged and the panes in the windows were broken. The destruction of buildings near the impact site is catastrophic. In them, as well as in the house of a 90-year-old woman, not only the roofs were demolished and the windows and doors were knocked out along with the frames, but also the ceiling and walls were moved. Some of them are already unrecoverable. Despite Sunday being a day off, representatives of the Salvation Angels Charitable Foundation, which works with the support of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, arrived at the site of the explosion early in the morning. — Just as an -arrival-, we immediately arrive, help so that people can be repaired. We will find out about the need for help from the local administration, says Oleksandr, a representative of the foundation. Boards, chipboard, plastic film, construction foam, nails, screws are unloaded from the arriving trucks - everything necessary for quick installation and temporary repairs capable of protecting the buildings damaged by the explosion from the weather. Residents of destroyed houses are queuing for registration and receiving materials. Difficult days are ahead of them, because the received materials still require skilled workers - if almost anyone can cover shutters with a film, even temporary roofing requires a skilled worker. No less than the most damaged private houses, the enterprise located in the building of the former school suffered. — All 36 windows were broken, the roof was demolished, the doors in the offices were smashed. This building is over 90 years old. There used to be a stable here, after the war there was a school, says the director of the enterprise, Volodymyr. The destruction inside the building is no less than outside. Of particular concern is the equipment - will it be possible to restore it, will it work after such an impact and damage? The company's production was important for the Ukrainian energy system, which is under regular attacks from the Russian occupiers, so its shutdown would cause significant damage. The occupiers once again struck a blow at the civil infrastructure and housing development. Without any military purpose, it is purely designed to continue to terrorize the civilian population, both directly through the destruction of residential buildings and indirectly through the destruction of an enterprise that produced important products.

The church was not hit: about the Good News after the shelling of Sloviansk	Summary of the devastating consequences of the enemy strike reported by the head of the Slavyansk City Military Administration Vadim Lyakh. Chaplain Oleksandr told ArmyInform correspondents more about the destruction caused by Russian shelling. From 10 a.m. in the main hall of the -Good News- Church in Sloviansk, the service is already underway. The pastor talks about today's shelling and the Lord's will. Citing the -Epistle to the Romans- (8:28), the apostle Paul emphasizes several times that God supports those who love Him in everything, so according to His Will, -all things work together for good- for them. It is hard not to agree with this - during today's shelling, an enemy ammunition hit the road asphalt a few meters from the Church building, due to which there were no victims, wounded and injured. As a pastor at the service, Chaplain Oleksandr agrees to talk about the explosion and its consequences. — This morning, at seven o'clock in the morning, it -flew- near the road to Shevchenko. We thank God that at that time there were almost no people in the building and that the Lord saved those who were here, they were not hurt. Maybe they were scared, but everyone is alive, healthy, unharmed, he says. -Road to Shevchenko- is Mir Street, the asphalt pavement of which was hit by a Russian munition. A little further, it adjoins Taras Shevchenko Street, at the beginning of which there is a monument to the poet. The building of the -Good News- Church was less fortunate - the explosion occurred just a few meters away from it. Debris and the blast wave destroyed part of the roof and floors, broke the panes in the windows, mutilated the doors. The destruction inside the building is also significant. Oleksandr says with comfort that before the service, many believers who live nearby responded to the request to come early and clean up the debris, put things in order in front of the church and in its mutilated premises. — Many thanks to the members of the church, people who come here to praise God. We just gave a little cry that help was needed, and people came. At 7 o'clock in the morning it -flew in- - and by 9 o'clock in the morning we had already removed the garbage. We have restored order in the hall, closed some broken windows on the floors and are conducting services, he says. The chaplain says that the -Good News- Church is an important center for the local community, which helps and supports the needy and internally displaced persons during the difficult times of the war. — When there is an opportunity, we provide humanitarian aid. We are trying to somehow influence the community, to help, because times are difficult and it is necessary to stick together, help each other, says the chaplain. The Good News Church played an important role in the life of the community even before the large-scale invasion. As early as 2020, an elementary school started working in its premises, and a Sunday school operated. The main impact of the powerful blast wave after today's impact came precisely on the wing of the church building in which the children's classes are located. Alexander shows mutilated classrooms with books scattered about. — Today we have a Sunday school, we provided them with another room, but those rooms intended for children suffered the most, he says without hiding his sadness. The blackboards in the classrooms have the same inscription: -February 23. Cool job.- It has not been erased since 2022 as a reminder of when the day school was suspended until a solid peace. Since then, classes with children took place only on Sundays within the Sunday school. Now they too are under threat, because many children, frightened by the shelling, did not come today. This is how the Russian occupiers continue to destroy centers of peaceful life in Ukraine - hitting children and adults, school classrooms and the Church. However, the way the believers rallied to eliminate the consequences of the enemy shelling testifies to the strength of the Slavic community, and the expeditious filling of the hole from the explosion by local utility workers shows the responsibility and effectiveness of the local authorities. &nbsp; This is good news from Donetsk region.

Huge losses of the Russians, IPSO and whether Pokrovsk will fall: an expert on possible scenarios of...	&#8220;The general characteristics of the situation at the front should be considered in the context of major geopolitics and the outcome of the presidential election in the United States. It really is. The front line of the Russian-Ukrainian war now has three large complex sections. The first is the Kurakhiv direction. Is a tactical withdrawal of the Defense Forces of Ukraine possible from there? It is possible, you should not be afraid of this, because battles can be lost, the main thing is to win the war. I really like historical parallels. Napoleon brilliantly won the Battle of Borodino, but lost the war. Ukrainians were heartbroken when our soldiers left Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, and especially Bakhmut. But the war is not lost on this. Indeed, this is a very difficult and difficult direction, but nevertheless such a scenario can be. Pokrovsk is next. There is a lot of speculation here that, they say, the city will fall, and then Donetsk will fall. This is not true. After all, Pokrovsk is a rather complex agglomeration, dense urban development and so on. Let's turn to illustrative examples. Avdiivka, in the active phase of a large-scale war, was stormed by the Rashists from October 7 last year, that is, they took it for more than six months. The enemy could not capture Bakhmut for more than 10 months. At the same time, they advanced beyond the city itself, there, the main hills, and could not. Reaching Pokrovsk does not mean taking it. The battle itself can be very long and not necessarily successful for the enemy. There will be huge enemy losses. Reconcentration of the enemy's forces and means in the Zaporozhye direction is logical. There is a very fundamental rule of war: the attacking side, if it slips at some point, must inevitably change the vector of the blow. Because if this does not happen, then a moment of balance occurs and the defending party gets a chance for counter-offensive actions. the Russians cannot allow this. According to their logic, the Zaporozhye direction is also a working one. Now speculation about the borders of Dnipropetrovsk region. It is very unfortunate that all this is happening in the information space. It is at least 30 km to the administrative borders, well, that's a lot. Indeed, according to the results of this year, the Russian Federation has the highest indicators of captured territory of Ukraine. But if these indicators are compared with the losses, then this is something incredible. According to the results of 2022, the losses of the enemy amount to 90 thousand, in 2023 more than 220 thousand, and this year I estimate them in the perspective of more than 350 thousand occupiers, because there are already 300 thousand, 21,940 people in October alone. This is simply a phenomenal figure. Therefore, it is still necessary to go 30 km to Dnipropetrovsk region. And this is a very serious distance, wet weather must also be taken into account, so you can only move on roads. The Ukrainian defenders are shelling large columns of firecrackers like nuts. The enemy from IPSO actively joined these speculations around the Dnipropetrovsk region, dispersing panic, betrayal and fakes. Why do we associate the situation on the Russian-Ukrainian war front with the victory of Donald Trump in the USA? Trump really declares a quick freezing of the conflict. But only after his inauguration on January 20 will any concrete conversation begin. A brief historical example: the Taliban and the Americans have been talking for more than a year, these are very low geopolitical stakes. And with such huge geopolitical stakes, which are now in the Russian-Ukrainian war, God forbid that in six months they would find some points of contact. Moreover, in these two months before Trump's inauguration, world geopolitics may turn around more than once. Let's not forget, Iran threatens to strike Israel already in the land part. This can really make a big difference. And if this happens conditionally, then the Russian Federation will experience a colossal reduction in the supply of explosives. The Iranians provide the Rashists with unmanned systems and ammunition. In my personal opinion, the front is moving towards a fiery equilibrium. Wet weather sets in, a cycle of rain and sleet. There will be, as in the previous two winters, endless counter-battery artillery duels. And here the Defense Forces of Ukraine are head and shoulders above the enemy. That is why he is raging now, he wants to capture as many kilometers of our land as possible.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/17/velychezni-vtraty-rosiyan-ipso-ta-chy-vpade-pokrovsk-ekspert-pro-mozhlyvi-sczenariyi-rozvytku-podij/	2024-11-16T21:04:06-08:00
Almost like SpaceX: Israel has developed a vertical takeoff barrage munition	In a brief description of the ammunition, the Israeli arms manufacturer positions ROC-X Weapon System as a hand-launched VTOL (vertical take-off and landing) electro-optical missile that provides troops with new opportunities for attack and maneuvering, ArmyInform reports. This innovative munition is designed to increase the accuracy and speed of hitting a wide range of targets, both stationary and moving, providing new opportunities for quick response on the battlefield. As indicate analysts of the defense publication Army Recognition, ROC-X stands out against the background of others of ammunition as the world's first VTOL missile that can be manually launched by a single soldier. The device is designed to solve tactical tasks, allowing the operator to independently control the flight, select targets and return it safely after completing the mission. The ROC-X design includes a one-meter-long fuselage and X-shaped wings with a span of 0.8 meters. An innovative system of engines with a channel screw without moving parts provides the product with silence, stealth and high maneuverability, which makes it practically invisible in combat conditions. Particular attention should be paid to the accuracy of the device: the probable deviation from the point of impact is only one meter, which makes the ROC-X an effective tool for destroying targets at a distance of up to 10 kilometers. Such accuracy is achieved thanks to advanced electro-optical and GPS guidance systems, which allows the operator to do without special launchers. One of the key advantages of the ROC-X is its ability for rapid manual launch, which allows it to respond instantly to changing combat conditions. This feature makes it a versatile tool for modern tactical applications where speed and flexibility play a crucial role. In combat conditions, the ROC-X demonstrates high maneuverability and rapid readiness for deployment, and also has features that reduce acoustic and thermal signatures, facilitating covert operations in enemy territory. The device weighs only 6.8 kg and is equipped with a warhead weighing 2 kg, with the possibility of using shock and non-contact detonators, which allows to effectively hit targets. ROC-X can stay in flight for up to 20 minutes, supporting both manual and automatic control modes, giving the operator the ability to adapt to changing combat conditions. Thus, this device is a versatile and highly effective tool that significantly improves the capabilities of ground troops in the conditions of modern combat conflict. The development of systems similar to the ROC-X by other defense companies is aimed at creating accurate and versatile munitions that can be controlled by individual soldiers. However, the ROC-X stands out for its true portability as it is fully manually operated, unlike other systems such as the US-based Switchblade 300 previously reported told our agency, or the Chinese CH-901, which require special launchers for use. This feature makes the ROC-X particularly suitable for dynamic environments, providing quick response and flexible operation in the field, giving soldiers greater autonomy compared to similar systems. It should be noted that in January 2023 the US Department of Defense concluded with the Israeli company Israel Aerospace Industries a contract for the development and delivery of a new portable barrage drone with electro-optical guidance. IAI, as a prime contractor, received a multimillion-dollar contract from the Office of Irregular Warfare Technical Support (IWTSD) of the US Department of Defense for the rapid development and delivery of POINT BLANK systems in the ROC-X version.

-They drove to -Otchenashi--: 2 thousand km along the front line to -Funtyk-. How the driver took th...	Artem, a senior soldier of the 21st separate special purpose battalion of the Separate Presidential Brigade named after Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytskyi, with the call sign -Pavlyk- at the front since March 2024. Since then, he has driven more than two thousand kilometers on the front lines in a Hummer with the call sign -Funtik- and -rolled- more than 60 thousand km in pickup trucks. And there was a rapid mission on an armored Ford and experience on a Turkish Kirpi. The driver Artyom -Pavlyk- told ArmyInform correspondents about why being a driver on the front line is important and honorable, but dangerous, how fear helps to fulfill the mission and about the heroic rescue of Ukrainian drones from a semicircle. Artem has been in the Armed Forces for over 20 months. He went to serve without hesitation as soon as the summons came. But he did not get to the front right away, at first he guarded the administration of the Pechersk District of Kyiv. However, he then transferred to a combat brigade and has been on the front line for more than half a year since then. In civilian life, -Pavlyk- worked as a tractor driver, and not so long ago he served his term as a driver. The acquired experience came in handy during the service - Artem was appointed to the position of a driver. Since then, -Pavlik- had to perform numerous logistical and rescue missions, delivering fighters and cargo for them to the front line and taking the wounded from there. - Driving in, bringing in, taking out - all this is my work, my tasks. I fly -to the point-, drop off or pick up guys, deliver them water, food, etc., he says. It was possible to drive -Pavlik- on different vehicles, but most of all - on a pickup truck and a Hummer. The pickup truck, he says, is faster and has higher cross-country ability, but it has virtually no protection. - You can drive at a speed of 100-120 kilometers per hour, even on mud, but there is no protection - except that you can install a REBchik, - says Artem. On the other hand, the Hummer is slower, its cross-country ability is worse. The driver explains that this armored personnel carrier is more suitable for the desert plains than for the Donbas mud, where the ground is viscous and sticky, like plasticine. But instead, this armor has powerful protection. — -Hummer- drives slower - 80-90 km/h, and -guzzles- a lot - 35 liters per 100 kilometers, and the passability is worse. And here the ground is like plasticine - such that the car simply floats, not on the ground, but floats on it. But -Funtyk- is strong, withstands many -arrivals-, protects against debris and even a direct hit, it has a good armored capsule, - explains Artem. — I had to relearn a little, because the car is like a car, but the dimensions are wider. And it is very heavy - five tons, says -Pavlyk- about -Funtyk-. And it also shows the padlock on the door. The Hummer does not have a standard factory lock, so it is impossible to lock it. The ignition key is also unnecessary - the car starts with half a turn of the toggle switch. -There were cases when Hammers were stolen, so we came up with a way out - to lock the door with a padlock,- explains Artem. An unusual device on the door of an American armored personnel carrier makes it look like the entrance to a basement converted into a bunker - armored doors were installed, and a lock was attached to them forgot to mount. As evidence -Pavlyk- shows the impact sites of debris from the explosions of grenades, mines and the explosive charge of the FPV drone. Deep scars in the armored doors and the body of the -Hummer- testify to the force of the explosions, and the laminated glass, apparently, withstood a direct hit from an automatic grenade launcher. — They said that -Funtyk- also traveled to Bakhmut. And the FPV shot flew behind me under the frame and exploded there. But the car survived, I hit the gas and drove away with two flat tires, Artem says. At that time, it was necessary to drive on a -docket- - pressed rubber inside the wheels, which allows you to move even after the road has -eaten- the rubber of the tires. The driver explains that under fire the main thing is not to get confused, not to reduce speed and to maneuver sharply. Then the chances that they will be able to hit the car with precision drop sharply. To do this, you need to be a true specialist in your field, a skilled driver. And yet&#8230; — Fear helps. Because when there is fear, the reaction is sharper - you understand everything faster, assess the situation, maneuver. In a calm environment, you drive relaxed. And there you go - -whoosh-whoosh-whoosh!- - run! Reaction, maneuvers, more gas - you know, you feel what you need to do, how to leave - explains the driver. You also need to be very fast and not linger anywhere, not stop longer than a couple of minutes, and even better - a few tens of seconds. That's why he always drives the guys, especially those who come out of positions, because when they load into the car for the trip, they often calm down and relax too much. — He who is not afraid will drive slowly, relaxed. And everything will catch up with him, motherfucker. Need more reaction to everything. Guys need to be coached to load and unload faster, because they lose their fear when they get out of position. And you need to be afraid until you leave, says -Pavlyk-. However, fear and adrenaline alone will not get you far - you must always carefully prepare for each mission and never violate the basic rules - drive only at night or at dusk, in no case turn on the headlights, carefully study the driving route. — I ride in a -night lamp- so as not to reveal myself. I drive very fast, at the maximum possible speed on this road. Also, before leaving, I carefully study the map in order to remember the route, I count the number of turns, says Artem. He does not have a navigator, so he carefully studies the entire route before leaving on a map, keeps it in his memory and orients himself to the local area at breakneck speed. Accidentally, due to oversight, jumping into a -turn that is not there- is deadly, because there may not be time to turn around and take the correct route. — In half an hour you have to -get stuck in.- And it is better to drive, unload and load in 20-25 minutes, and return, Artem explains. -Pavlyk- recalls that during his missions he had to take out the bodies of three dead and more than 30 wounded fighters. The mission was the most difficult, when one dead and three wounded had to be taken out at the same time, but the driver coped with it as well. — I had to drive by three -300s- and one -200- on a road where I had never driven. I looked at the map for almost two hours thinking about how to do all this, how to bypass the dangerous section. And, in the end, everything worked out - drove in, picked up, took out, - recalls the fighter. He recalls that he had to drive along a broken country road, on one of the sections of which a mortar often hit. However, in the end, skill, experience and thorough training helped accomplish the mission. Artem says that a car on the front line is the main target for all the enemy's weapons, because everyone is interested in aiming at a car. But it is not possible without it, because the infantrymen -at ground zero- are critically dependent on -last kilometer- logistics. — The car that goes! Everyone is interested in knocking her down, destroying her, because she is carrying someone or something - fighters, supplies. That is, the idea that a driver is such a safe profession in the army is false - on the -front- we are the first target, he explains. However, -Pavlyk- only partially agrees with the definition of himself as a -special purpose- driver. He emphasizes that not all of us are made for war, but someone has to do this hard work - and he does it. — It is necessary to protect, because who else will protect? And if you are smart, fast, and know how to do something, then you will simply be able to do it well, says Artem. Artem can have from one to 3-4 departures per night. Sometimes you have to wait for hours for a mission, being in full readiness to start the same second the order is received. Even after completing the mission, the driver says, he can wait for several hours until the fighters delivered by him reach their positions and report their arrival. - They can go for 3 or 4 hours - during this time I don't sleep because I'm worried about them. I understand that nothing depends on my waiting, but I'm still waiting for a message, he says. This attitude of Artyom was noticed by the fighters themselves, among whom -Pavlyk- gained extreme respect, because they know that he will never leave them to their own devices and will do everything possible to help. Artyom recalls one of his many missions, during which he had to take out drones from a semicircle in an unfamiliar car - an armored Ford. The enemy had already appeared behind their positions, so if they were not taken out before morning, they would inevitably have to engage in a direct shooting battle. The driver of the Ford then refused to go, and Pavlyk and the commander drove in an unfamiliar car, flew to the position of the drones and pulled the boys out. All this took about 40 minutes. — For forty minutes there and back, loaded in about a minute. The guys were very pleased, everyone thanked us for coming. They were already waiting for the car to arrive, they had already packed their things, and I turned around. They jumped in - and we chased them, - says Artem. Later, the drone operators told how relieved they felt not even when they broke out of the semi-encirclement, but also when they received a message that Pavlyk was coming after them: -If Pavlyk is coming after us, then we will leave!- Photo by Ruslan Tarasov	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/17/pognaly-na-otchenashi-2-tysyachi-km-po-peredovij-na-funtyku-yak-vodij-vyvozyv-dronariv-z-otochennya/	2024-11-16T20:29:14-08:00

It was the Russians who faked the video, because the Institute for the Study of War has never released such information. Such statistics were not disseminated by Ukrainian officials and the media either. Fakeness is also indicated by the fact that Russians have traditionally made a lot of grammatical mistakes. In particular, -territorial recruitment and social support centers- were translated into the video as TRSSCs. Whereas in English it is correct TCR and SS (Territorial Centers of Recruitment and Social Support). In addition, they used a fake final frame of the Institute for the Study of War. At the end of each entry, the Institute calls for a donation to their organization (-Donate today-), while the propagandists only have a list of social networks instead. Russian propagandists actively spread such posts to discredit the mobilization in Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/17/rosiyany-znyaly-video-nibyto-vid-instytutu-vyvchennya-vijny-shho-vkazuye-na-fejk/	2024-11-16T20:07:04-08:00

Ministry of Defense: Every defender of Ukraine will receive improved nutrition in medical institutio...	The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine informs about this. The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine has initiated important changes in the system of providing servicemen during treatment and rehabilitation. Thanks to the Resolution adopted by the Cabinet of Ministers, the mechanism of providing improved food to servicemen in health care facilities of all forms of ownership has been improved. The resolution allows to provide our defenders with food according to the standards of military medical institutions of NATO countries even in civilian hospitals. -Every defender who risks their lives for our freedom deserves the best conditions for recovery. Not only do we provide our troops with the care they need, but we also work to ensure that each one of them feels supported and respected. This initiative is our response to their dedication and courage,- said the Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine, Brigadier General Serhiy Melnyk. According to the new regulations, food in civilian hospitals for servicemen will be served according to a specially designed diet, which, in particular, determines the list of products, their quantity and weight required for one serviceman per day, taking into account the specific needs of the body during recovery. -The new standards ensure the complete nutrition needed for a quick recovery. For example, they take into account the increased need for protein, vitamins and calories needed to heal injuries or illnesses. The cost of such food is calculated on the basis of a special product catalog approved by the Ministry of Defense. This Catalog contains current prices for products, and they are taken into account when determining the cost of food for one bed-day in medical facilities,- explains Serhiy Melnyk. According to him, this ensures that each soldier will receive the proper ration for a quick recovery. The resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers also provides for a clear mechanism for compensating costs for civilian medical institutions, which will allow maintaining high standards of service. The new financing mechanism provides for the conclusion of a standard contract that will ensure transparent compensation for the costs of improved nutrition. Thus, civilian medical facilities will receive adequate funding, and military personnel will receive quality treatment and rehabilitation. We remind you that recently in the structure of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine the department for intellectual property issues was launched and the technology of detection of enemy FPV drones -Vitryak-M- was patented.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/16/kozhen-zahysnyk-ukrayiny-otrymaye-pokrashhene-harchuvannya-u-medzakladah-nezalezhno-vid-formy-vlasnosti/	2024-11-16T08:11:42-08:00

The purpose of the Coalition's activity is that by the end of 2027, the Defense Forces of Ukraine should acquire sustainable complex artillery capabilities and interoperability with NATO. This is necessary in order to strengthen the ability of the Ukrainian army to resist Russian attacks and deter potential new invasions, as well as to neutralize Russia's fire superiority, its combat capabilities, and to establish operational interoperability with NATO.

Corresponding warnings were received by the occupying authorities and Russian banking institutions. By January 2026, residents of the occupied Luhansk region must replace their cars with Ukrainian-style state license plates with Russian ones. Otherwise, the documents will become invalid. However, many are stopped by the price of the issue. There are enough cases when the replacement of numbers is preceded by a mandatory procedure for registration of inheritance in the event of the death of the testator. If the car is not new, then it costs more than the vehicle itself. Therefore, they continue to travel by proxy, without the ability and sense to fulfill Russian whims.

The Ministry of Defense explained the tasks of the new intellectual property department	About this told Ilya Kostin, Head of the Intellectual Property Department of the Main Department of Military Justice of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. According to him, this is the first time that the state, represented by the Ministry of Defense, has received the rights to a technological product. -This has never been done before in the Ministry - when the manufacturer, a specialized military unit (Center for Scaling of Technological solutions) invented this product. This technological solution is of very high quality. And this was confirmed by state registration and a patent for a useful model was issued. This happened only in the MOU system. I repeat: this has never happened before. Thus, the state, represented by the MoU, has obtained the rights to this product and will now give permission to manufacturers to scale this product. But the fact that state money was invested — it remained with the state,- said Ilya Kostin. Vitryak-M is a detector that scans different ranges of FPV drones, automatically turning on EW systems. -This allows the fighter to know that there is an FPV drone nearby and to turn on the EW only when it is needed, instead of creating a dome curtain that prevents not only the enemy from working, but also us.- - explained the head of the intellectual property department.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/16/u-minoborony-poyasnyly-zavdannya-novogo-viddilu-z-pytan-intelektualnoyi-vlasnosti/	2024-11-16T03:52:53-08:00

Rustem Umyerov: The Ministry of Defense has created a new system of patenting military technologies	This was reported by the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Rustem Umyerov. Thanks to this, clear rules of cooperation with Ukrainian and international partners appeared, and innovations are now protected by patents. -The future of war and defense is not only the power of weapons, but also the power of innovation. It is important not only to create new technologies, but also to form a sustainable system that protects and supports their development,- the minister noted. For our partners, this system is a signal that Ukraine is ready for responsible cooperation. Their technologies are protected here, and the support of the defense sector gives them guarantees of development and security. An example of this approach is the patent on Vitryak-M FPV drone detector developed by our Technology Scaling Center. This development helps the Armed Forces to detect enemy drones and warn of their approach. -Thus, patenting is a feeling of protection of our inventors' developments, the confidence of partners and the foundation of a new defense culture, where every discovery becomes a step towards victory,- added Rustem Umyerov.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/16/rustem-umyerov-minoborony-stvorylo-novu-systemu-patentuvannya-vijskovyh-tehnologij/	2024-11-16T02:02:22-08:00

To implement the plans, the enemy created the -time of heroes- program, which was supposed to select a sufficient number of -veterans- who should have at least a secondary education and desire. However, even such a low level of requirements became an obstacle, because most Russian fighters do not have even the minimum skills for training.

And that's why we see what this number is: several units drop by every day. Both tracked and wheeled vehicles,- Petro Andryushchenko said. At the same time, according to him, there is no increase in the number of Russian troops in the temporarily occupied Mariupol, but on the contrary - their decrease. -The Russians currently do not have enough new contract workers to fill all camps (from Mariupol to Berdyansk) by 100%. I am referring to those camps that serve to train units that leave for replenishment, rotations, etc. Currently, these camps are filled with new contract workers by about 70%, and by 30% — those who are assigned to rotation from the front line. This is the first time, because before that the camps were filled to 100%, and those allocated for rotation were located either in the north of the Mariupol district or on the territory of the Ilyich plant. Now the trend is different, and this means that the Russians do not have time to replenish their manpower in accordance with the losses they are suffering,- Petro Andryushchenko summarized.

We see that all kinds of military equipment (tanks, armored personnel carriers, armored personnel carriers) are being pulled. All of them come from the direction of Berdyansk or Pologiv (from the Zaporizhzhia region). And then, through Mariupol, it moves north, towards Volnovakha,- said Petro Andryushchenko.

He emphasized that a large number of trucks of all kinds, dumping of ammunition were also recorded. -And this is also unusual. Because they dismantle the operational-tactical warehouses located on the territory of the Mariupol, Berdyansky, Rozivsky districts. That is, what they did as reserves when they were preparing for the offensive in the Zaporozhye direction — all this is removed, reformatted and thrown in the direction of Volnovakha and Kurakhovo,- says the adviser to the mayor of Mariupol. As reported by ArmyInform, last day in the Kurakhiv direction The defense forces repelled 35 attacks. The occupiers tried to advance in the areas of Berestki, Novoselidivka, Voznesenka, Novodmytrivka, Maksimilianivka, Dalnyi and Antonivka.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/16/okupanty-pochaly-zavozyty-vijskovu-tehniku-na-kurahivskyj-napryamok-nezvychnym-marshrutom/	2024-11-15T23:59:31-08:00
In Chernihiv Oblast, the Russian tricolor installed by the enemy DRG was destroyed	This was reported to the DPSU. After detecting the Russian symbols, the border guards quickly directed the drones to the target, which destroyed the -rags- with precise strikes. At the same time, the intelligence conducted indicated that the Russian subversive-reconnaissance group left the area before the flags were removed, not daring to take further actions. -The enemy continues to try to impose his -victories- and psychological pressure, without any military sense. We urge you not to succumb to the informational and psychological influences of the enemy,- &#8211; emphasized in DPSU. As ArmiyaInform reported, on November 15, Russian propagandists spread information about the alleged -entry- to the village of Gremyach. The DPSU denied it was noted that the enemy DRG planted a flag near the border on the destroyed bridge over the Sudost River.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/16/na-chernigivshhyni-znyshhyly-rosijskyj-trykolor-vstanovlenyj-vorozhoyu-drg/	2024-11-15T23:27:54-08:00
Driver drill: the GUR told how Russia solves the problem with the shortage of junior officers	This was reported to the GUR of the MOU. On the basis of civilian higher educational institutions, the aggressor state creates military training centers where basic training of platoon commanders, artillery batteries and deputy company commanders is to be conducted. A junior officer of the enemy army primarily performs the function of an infantry chaser for an assault directly on the battlefield, which explains the high level of casualties and, as a result, the acute shortage of lieutenants in Russia. The Kremlin began to establish a mechanism for training and uninterrupted supply of junior officers for the war against Ukraine in the first year of the full-scale invasion. According to the enemy's plans, by the end of 2024, 33 new military training centers were to be launched in Russia in addition to almost a hundred existing ones. Another activation of leaders in Moscow to drill even more fresh lieutenants shows that the personnel crisis of the command staff of the Russian occupation army is deepening.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/16/mushtra-pogonychiv-u-gur-rozpovily-yak-rosiya-vyrishuye-problemu-iz-deficzytom-molodshyh-oficzeriv/	2024-11-15T23:13:24-08:00

Transformers go into battle: the British army was offered a new version of a light protected patrol ...	How howled not without advertising bragging representatives of the manufacturing company in a release on their official portal, thanks to the modular design Foxhound is the best vehicle for light infantry and special operations forces during combat missions. The vehicle provides a high level of field-proven protection, reliability and availability, as well as the ability to adapt, ArmiyaInform reports. This project is under development. And as informed by the company General Dynamics Land Systems - Great Britain, which has been operating since 2012, its enterprises previously supplied the British Army with 400 basic Foxhound models (also known under the global brand of General Dynamics Land Systems - -Ocelot-). About these armored vehicles, reporters of our editorial office mentioned in one from defense industry reviews. The Foxhound GMRV is designed to operate in the most challenging environments, demonstrating a combination of protection, mobility and flexibility. Experts of the defense publication Army Recognition, who got acquainted with the new armored vehicle at the Defense Vehicle Dynamics (DVD) arms exhibition held in the British Millbrook in September of this year, announced that its modular design offers a significant advantage in allowing the vehicle to adapt to different mission requirements. The platform can be configured for multiple roles with the help of a newly developed mission module, which provides, according to the machine's developers, -unparalleled operational efficiency-. The GMRV variant includes a highly secure crew compartment with advanced self-defense weapons that can be controlled directly from the inside, ensuring optimal crew safety. In addition, the vehicle's design has been shaped to accommodate a NATO-standard pallet in the rear, offering endless transformative possibilities for integrating complex mission systems. They can include weapons for short-range air defense (SHORAD) and other mission-critical technologies that go beyond the traditional patrol car. By improving protection and firepower while retaining the core capabilities of the original Foxhound, the GMRV is set to be a game changer for military operations. General Dynamics UK is keen to use this new option for both the British Army and international allies, focusing on export opportunities for partners around the world. The vehicle is entirely designed, engineered and manufactured in the United Kingdom, ensuring quality control and compliance with the national defense industrial strategy. The original Foxhound LPPV has long been renowned for its protection and mobility in high-risk environments. This new variant of the GMRV carries on this legacy, but with significant improvements in operational flexibility and modular integration. The ability to seamlessly switch between roles — from patrol to air defense — without the need for a completely different vehicle underscores its value on the modern battlefield. As military forces around the world face increasingly complex operational landscapes, the Foxhound GMRV is poised to offer a solution that can evolve with these changing requirements. With design and manufacturing firmly rooted in the UK, the car is also a testament to its defense capability and commitment to innovation. A total of 52 new GMRV vehicles will be delivered to UK Army units by March 2025, according to a statement from General Dynamics Land Systems - UK.

Battles in the Kursk region: how the artillerymen of the 82nd brigade of the DSHV organized the Kurs...	A key role in the destruction of the forces and means of the Russian Federation in Kurshchyna is played by the artillery of the ZSU, which works almost 24/7. ArmyInform visited units of the 82nd separate amphibious assault Bukovynia brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which are carrying out combat missions in Kurshchyna. The commander of the artillery division, Major Ivan Bakrev, told our correspondents about the first days of the Kursk operation, how artillery calculations manage to destroy military targets of the Russian Federation, what artillery systems are used by our defenders and what is the most difficult part of the artillerymen's work: -In July, we received a combat mission from the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. In the shortest possible time, planning was carried out, a plan was developed. After that, it was necessary to move the artillery from the concentration area to the future area of ​​combat missions as soon as possible. Artillery was transferred covertly so that the enemy would not find out. One or two cannons at night, so that they did not notice that we were gathering forces here. Before the beginning of the Kursk offensive operation, with the help of aerial reconnaissance, we identified the front edge of the enemy, planned the objects of attack and their detailed fire damage. Everything has been thought through to the smallest detail. The sector of fire of my artillery division was determined. And as further developments showed, the enemy was not ready for this. In the first hours of the offensive of units of our brigade, the enemy was hit by fire. Moreover, it is quite effective, because the enemy retreated, at some points simply ran. Our gunners hit enemy platoon and company strongholds and even individual combat positions very quickly and accurately. The offensive developed quite dynamically. Next, they hit manpower, military equipment, and places of concentration of enemy personnel. The Russians were not given a single chance. Even later, after we started advancing in depth, the enemy did not know where we were exactly. This helped us a lot. Then the enemy began to transfer his reserves. And we, accordingly, destroyed them. They worked in convoys of motor vehicles, where they mainly transported personnel and mortar weapons, hit armored combat vehicles. Our drones very often detected the enemy's field artillery depots. the Russians just accumulated a certain number of shells, and we immediately destroyed them. On the armament of my artillery division is towed artillery. These are Soviet-style D-30 guns (caliber 122 mm) and British M119 howitzers are NATO-style 105 mm. M119 shows good combat capabilities: a very mobile gun, takes up little space, so it is convenient for camouflage and movement. Its most important feature is that it accurately hits the targets. The range of combat use on standard ammunition is 11.7 thousand. m. Also, projectiles can reach the cannon up to 20 km. But the 105-caliber ammunition itself would like better. Unfortunately, it gives few fragments and an impressive effect on the enemy. On the other hand, if working for counter-battery, rockets are a pretty good option. After all, the M119s are located at a short distance from the front edge and, accordingly, they can be used normally at a long range, in the depth of the enemy's battle formations. D-30 cannons are mainly used to destroy the enemy's manpower and firepower located in trenches, trenches, communication passages and strongholds, as well as outside shelters. We also work with them on the accumulation of enemy troops. The effective firing range of these guns is up to 15 km. Here, in Kurshchyna, in the modern conditions of the combat situation, we do not work in the classic version in the composition of platoons and batteries. A reconnaissance fire complex (RVK) is used to destroy the enemy's manpower and equipment. It consists of means of detecting the enemy (quadrocopters, Mavics, outlays, etc. - ed.), artillery means of destruction, and the third element is the management of units, which is carried out during the execution of combat missions. Ideally, this is how it works: there are calculations of UAV operators who conduct reconnaissance of enemy targets and provide through communications means of targeting for use in combat calculations of guns. A fire damage decision is made and boom, shells fly where they need to go. An interesting moment with the movement of the RVC deep into the territory of the Russian Federation. At first, the gunners worked from the border area on targets, then some RVCs remained in their places to cover the units of the airborne assault battalions, and other fire groups have already begun to move deep into the Kursk region. They quickly moved, took up firing positions, disguised themselves and inflicted fire damage. Then, in a chess order, other artillery units that were behind were gradually moved. In this way, it was possible to destroy the enemy quickly, without revealing one's location. At the beginning of the operation, the Starlink system helped us a lot in combat work. This is for general situational awareness, i.e. where the enemy is and transmitting the coordinates of targets to hit them. But Starlink no longer operated on the territory of the Russian Federation. Therefore, there were difficulties with communication, they worked at radio stations. This problem had to be solved as soon as possible. After all, the situation in Kurshchyna was developing quickly and it was necessary to establish cooperation in the battle with other units of the brigade and our neighbors. A system of military communications repeaters of domestic production was deployed. These repeaters then performed quite well in data transmission and situational awareness on the ground. Therefore, already in the process of such intensive hostilities, we solved the issue of communication. There were no problems with the supply of ammunition at all. Art shells were always delivered in plenty. The results of combat work eloquently testify to this. When the enemy performs his actions effectively, I already understand accordingly how I need to improve to reduce his effectiveness. This applies to countering FPV drones, various types of drones, counter-battery. Another important question. Use of EW means against enemy drones. Our priority targets are the enemy's reserves, air defense systems and ROPs, manpower concentrations, combat vehicles used to transport personnel and weapons to the front line. The exact number of enemy vehicles and personnel affected is difficult to determine. Fighting continues. From what is confirmed: our fire groups destroyed five artillery pieces, 4 mortars. This is within the limits of counter-battery only. In terms of manpower and armored vehicles, I can't tell you until the end, because the number of losses of the Rashits is simply huge. We try to destroy the enemy even on the approach to the front edge. We determine in what ways they throw up personnel, plan -meeting points-. The cannons are already aimed at us. If one gun does not have time to work, another joins in the work. The work is very hard, but it is worth it. The other day we discovered about seven or eight enemy armored vehicles. Some cars were driving in a chaotic manner, it was clear that they were lost, while others were moving purposefully. So, in just one day, the consumption of shells on these targets amounted to 270 shells. I think the consumption of ammunition in other artillery units was no less. They worked very powerfully, destroyed everything that moved in our direction. Before the beginning of the Kursk operation, it so happened that in my division, the full-time personnel complement was slightly more than 50%. Completed combat calculations actually from wheels. But the guys who were already here in the art division and those who came to us were very motivated, they all wanted to beat the occupiers on their territory, in a word, they were charged for success. Therefore, those who joined us quickly learned to act as part of calculations, mastered the intricacies of artillery in order to effectively strike the enemy in battle. There is no need to motivate the boys in any way, everyone is conscious and responsible, and most importantly, they are professionals. Personnel training is conducted constantly in concentration areas. If the situation permits, when one gun remains unengaged, the training is conducted by the battery sergeants-majors. We analyze the experience of combat operations, enemy tactics, analyze our shortcomings in combat work. I will give you an example. There are experienced gun commanders in the division who came from other artillery units. And they pleasantly surprised me with their work, their attitude to their duties. So, we give them targets, and they completely perform accurate calculations of data to shoot, adjust fire and, as a result, destroy the enemy and his important objects. Worked with one gun commander who had recently arrived. His guys know everything and are able to do all the necessary measures at firing positions. The main thing: they work exactly according to their goals. Where there is a responsible commander, there is discipline and efficiency. This is very gratifying. Once, enemy FPV drones wanted to hit the cannon of this commander three times. Thanks to the concerted actions of his team, the cannon was kept in operational condition and the soldiers themselves survived. The howitzer was well camouflaged. Countering enemy drones in general is key right now. Well done guys! The hardest part, unfortunately, was the loss of our personnel. The Kursk operation is very hard daily combat work. It's not easy here. At the beginning, of course, there were constant worries and sleepless nights. It was necessary to effectively establish a system of combat control and communication deployment. It was very difficult for the personnel at the firing positions in the Kursk region. There, gunners work at their maximum. Plus, the correct choice of fire positions, adjustment of moments for logistical support. There was a lot of useful information for us. Taking into account the experience of combat operations, we -entrusted- some points in preparation, in the general conduct of combat operations, as well as in the construction of battle orders: what to include in this battle order, what to add, and what, for example, we do not need and the like.

Loss of a combatant's ID card: how to restore it	ArmiyaInform tells how to restore the document. Currently, there are several options for obtaining a new ID. If we are talking about an active serviceman, then a report to the commander of the military unit is required. If you are released from military service, you should contact the TCC and SP in which you are registered. You can also contact the Ministry of Veterans, if you received the status of UBD through the interdepartmental commission created under this ministry. Certain documents must also be attached to the report or application. The type of report, as well as which documents need to be attached to it, depends on the circumstances. In such a case, the following documents should be attached to the report: This happens periodically, taking into account the realities of military life. So, if the certificate has become unusable, then the following documents are attached to the report: This also happens from time to time, because no one and nothing is safe from shelling.

propaganda spreads a fake video calling for a fight against the DPRK military	This animated video is about Ukraine's victory over the Mongol-Tatars.

The Ministry of Defense explained whether a driver's license can be revoked for failure to appear on...	This is reported by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. In practice, a driver's license cannot be revoked due to such non-appearance. However, the law provides for the following: Temporary restriction of the right to drive can be applied to citizens who evade military duty only by a court decision. For this: The procedure for filing a lawsuit must include a detailed description of the requirements that must be met and documentary evidence of the citizen's evasion of duties. After considering the lawsuit, the court makes a decision on the temporary restriction of the right to drive transport only on condition of confirmation of the fact of evasion and non-fulfillment of military duty by a citizen. Therefore, the decision on the temporary restriction of driver's license is made only after the case is considered in court and upon confirmation of the violation of the requirements for the performance of military duty.

Government has updated reservation criteria and criticality criteria: what's changed	Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal reported this . First of all, the regional and industry criticality criteria of enterprises will now be agreed with the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Economy. Secondly, for the private sector, the salary criterion and the absence of debts to the budget are now mandatory points for the reservation of employees. In particular, the accrued average salary in the enterprise and for the booked employee must be at least 2.5 times the minimum salary. This will reduce the risk of abuse where companies employ a person for a -shadow- booking arrangement. All bookings from December 1 will be made through Diya. Monthly monitoring of enterprises and organizations will take place to ensure that they meet all criteria. The new procedure will be effective from December 1. For all those who already have deferrals, there will be a transition period to the new conditions until February 28. By this date, all businesses must renew their employee bookings according to the new terms, regardless of how and when it was made.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/15/uryad-onovyv-kryteriyi-bronyuvannya-ta-kryteriyi-dlya-otrymannya-krytychnosti-shho-zminylosya/	2024-11-15T02:53:47-08:00

He added that this caused significant consequences from the attack in Odesa, as even downed attack UAVs with warheads pose a danger. -Odessa is attacked often - ballistics, anti-aircraft missiles, cruise missiles and attack UAVs. The densely built-up city and the urbanized area significantly complicate the work of anti-aircraft defense, but the percentage of shooting down remains high. Unfortunately, not everything that flies can be shot down over the sea!-, Yuriy Ignat wrote. He noted that the Air Force continues to inform the population about threats from the air on Telegram and WhatApp. -Since the fate of Telegram in Ukraine is uncertain, we have to provide ourselves with additional platforms for communication and information about aerial threats.

The Ministry of Defense allowed the armored car -Zubr- to be used in the Defense Forces	About this reported in MOU. This armored vehicle is multifunctional and distinguished by mobility, maneuverability and compact dimensions. The armored car has a reinforced independent suspension and excellent driving characteristics, which allows it to move at relatively high speeds through difficult terrain. Shallow water obstacles are also not a problem to overcome on this armored car. The armor and design of the -Zubra- ensures the protection of servicemen against damage by small arms and minimizes injuries to the driver and passengers when the car is blown up by a mine or an enemy mine. The design of the car allows you to install additional weapons systems, use it to transport personnel and evacuate the wounded. The Ministry of Defense reminded that manufacturers and developers of samples of weapons and military equipment, who have questions about the codification process, can contact the Main Directorate for Life Cycle Support of Weapons and Military Equipment by e-mail: mdalc@mil.ua.

According to Dmytro Pletenchuk, the enemy is analyzing the situation and has realized that some weapons are ineffective. Yes, Calibers, as a separate type of weapon, are not used for a long time. -Only during combo attacks. When there is an air attack - to supplement it, to load our air defense - they can use Calibers. Knowing perfectly well that in most cases 100% of these missiles will be destroyed,- Dmytro Pletenchuk assured. As reported ArmyInform, Russia is forced to raise large forces for air defense and other military infrastructure to maintain control over the temporary occupied Crimea.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/15/u-bilshosti-vypadkiv-100-bude-znyshheno-v-rosiyi-zrozumily-neefektyvnist-kalibriv/	2024-11-15T00:52:21-08:00
It turned out to be a canned mole: the detained commander of one of the units of the SSO	This is stated in message of the SBU. The attacker turned out to be a lieutenant colonel, commander of one of the units of the Special Operations Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, who was recruited by the occupiers even before the start of a large-scale war. In the spring of 2024, it was remotely -activated- by a personnel employee of the Russian game and defined the task: to transfer the plans of combat operations of the Defense Forces behind enemy lines to the Russians. The aggressor was most interested in intelligence about sabotage and reconnaissance raids by Ukrainian special forces behind the front line in the Zaporizhzhia, Kherson and Crimean directions. To carry out the enemy's task, the -mole- used his official position, thanks to which he received information about the planned routes of movement of the soldiers of the Defense Forces, their weapons and -targets-. The occupiers planned to use this information to eliminate Ukrainian special forces on the front line or outside its borders - in the temporarily captured part of the territory in the south of Ukraine. Also, the agent -leaked- data on other units of the Defense Forces to his Russian curator. As a result of the special operation, the military counter-intelligence of the SBU gradually documented the traitor's crimes and arrested him. At the same time, comprehensive measures were taken to secure the locations of the Defense Forces. According to the investigation, the person involved was recruited by the military intelligence of the Russian Federation through his acquaintances in Russia, with whom he maintained contact. During the searches, conspiratorial means of communication, computer equipment, a mobile phone and data storage devices were seized from the detainee. The investigators of the Security Service informed him of the suspicion under part 2 of Art. 111 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (treason committed under martial law). The perpetrator is in custody. He faces life imprisonment with confiscation of property.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/15/vyyavyvsya-rozkonservovanym-krotom-zatrymanyj-komandyr-odnogo-z-pidrozdiliv-sso/	2024-11-15T00:36:15-08:00

This was told by the commander of the Achilles unmanned aerial systems battalion on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- Captain Yury Fedorenko of the 92nd separate assault brigade named after the Kosh chieftain Ivan Sirk. — There is an algorithm, I will not tell the general public about it. This is always difficult, but it is achieved through negotiations and tactics on the battlefield, directly taking control of this or that representative who is in the form of a -pixel- but unknown to you, he said. The military man emphasized that the insidious tactic of dressing up in the enemy's military uniform is not new for the Russian military. — This tactic for the enemy is not new. It is used by them from other wars in which the Russian Federation took part, the officer said. The commander of the drones explained the main goal of the invaders. - In the last year, we can watch quite richly when the enemy wears a -pixel- and tries to infiltrate into our rear communications in order to sow chaos in the rear and introduce the maximum imbalance as possible, - said Yuriy Fedorenko. However, occupiers who are -red- in the -pixel- are detected quite effectively. - We know the [enemy's] tactics, so such cases are becoming fewer and fewer every day. Systematic work in order to distinguish between -own and foreign- is carried out and sufficiently well implemented in the Defense Forces. It will be different in each aspect, for the sake of truth, but the vast majority of commanders clearly understand and are aware of how it should be done and how to teach the personnel to distinguish between -own and foreign-, - emphasized the commander of -Achilles-. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that under the cover of thick fog, the Russians managed to penetrate to the outskirts of Kupyansk, but all armored vehicles and infantry the enemy landing force in the city destroyed the Defense Forces.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/15/ryadzheni-u-piksel-perevdyagnutyh-v-ukrayinsku-formu-okupantiv-efektyvno-vyyavlyayut-na-poli-boyu/	2024-11-15T00:21:34-08:00

We are making every effort to prevent the illegal alienation of defense lands and other military property belonging to Ukraine. Together with the Ministry of Justice, we are actively working to guarantee the return of these assets to the state,- said Deputy Defense Minister of Ukraine Dmytro Klimenkov. The head of the Anti-Raiding Office of the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine, Ivan Korodyuk, emphasized that the return of state property, especially defense lands, is a fundamental issue for the protection of Ukraine's national interests in the face of Russia's ongoing armed aggression. -We pay special attention to the consideration of complaints regarding registration actions that could lead to illegal alienation of state assets. The Ministry of Justice, together with the Ministry of Defense, actively uses all available legal mechanisms to return property to the state. We stand guard over the interests of the Ukrainian people and will not allow anyone to seize state resources contrary to the law,- Ivan Korodyuk stressed. Previously, the Ministry of Defense, together with the State Geocadaster, restored the state's rights to 69 land plots illegally removed from the state fund. 30 of them were returned thanks to cooperation with the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine.

This was told by the commander of the Achilles unmanned aerial systems battalion on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- Captain Yury Fedorenko of the 92nd separate assault brigade named after the Kosh chieftain Ivan Sirk. — The defense forces, in a united and coordinated work, manage to significantly destroy the enemy's shock-assault potential. In one of the landings, its length is up to 200 meters, 139 occupants were killed during a certain period of time, he said. The military emphasized that such losses of the occupiers are completely disproportionate to the minor tactical successes they manage to achieve. — Now the plantings are very clearly visible, because the leaves have fallen. Imagine what the enemy is suffering while trying to achieve tactical results and tactical successes on the battlefield. The losses are disproportionate to the results the enemy got, the officer emphasized. It should be noted that in the calculation carried out, it is only about the bodies of those dead enemy soldiers that the occupiers did not manage to evacuate. The number of wounded is also not taken into account. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that under the cover of thick fog, the Russians managed to penetrate to the outskirts of Kupyansk, but all armored vehicles and infantry the enemy in the city was destroyed by the Defense Forces.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/15/skilky-rosiyan-gyne-v-lisoposadczi-kilkist-vorozhyh-trupiv-na-200-metriv-porahuvaly-u-sylah-oborony/	2024-11-14T23:52:49-08:00
The Navy of the Ukrainian Armed Forces told how the Russians collect resources for their defense in ...	This was told by the spokesman of the Armed Forces Navy, captain 3rd rank Dmytro Pletenchuk on the air -Public Radio-. Dmytro Pletenchuk noted that in connection with this, the Russians are even diverting resources from other directions, trying to protect their strategic infrastructure in Crimea. -They constantly, especially before the period of storms, maximize all means. These are hydrotechnical structures, these are pontoons, these are various extensions. Last year, for example, 10 to 14 ships and boats were guarding the bridge at the same time. Now there are zero of them. They translate that into the aerial component,- he said. According to him, for defense against unmanned boats, the occupiers use, for example, helicopters, first of all. Because they have approximately the same speed and, accordingly, it is easier to patrol such an area on them than on an airplane. Ukrainian troops also continue to work actively to block Russian warships trying to pass through the Kerch Strait. Although Ukraine has officially closed the area to civilian shipping, Russian ports on the Sea of ​​Azov continue to operate, providing international trade. Ukraine, in turn, does not touch civilian vessels that comply with international standards. -This is also an important case, which for some reason is not often mentioned. But trading ports, for example, in the same Temryuk, in Azov, continue to work. Yes, the occupied ports of Berdyansk and Mariupol are illegal, as are the Crimean ports, of course, but those ports on Azov, which officially belong to the Russian Federation, continue international trade. And you see, we do not touch the civilian vessels that enter there. Although it is actually the Kerch Strait, it is officially closed by Ukraine, which had the right to do so,- Dmytro Pletenchuk said. As reported by ArmyInform, the ships of the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation >do not enter the waters of the Black Sea due to a number of factors, the enemy uses only aviation.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/15/u-vms-zsu-rozpovily-yak-rosiyany-styaguyut-resursy-dlya-svogo-zahystu-v-okupovanomu-krymu/	2024-11-14T23:35:04-08:00

Up to 70 magnetic -strays- per night: remote mining from a UAV is carried out by -Achilles-	About how mines with magnetic sensors work on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyvi- the commander of the unit told Captain Yury Fedorenko. — This -stray- is not new at all. It was conditionally secret for a very long time, but after certain events that took place, the enemy already understands what we apply, what we use. Therefore, we have come out of the shadows and are already collecting on it officially. It's very simple, he said. The military emphasized how important remote mining is for destroying the enemy. — The amount of equipment the opponent has &lt;&#8230;&gt; it is necessary to stop not only FPV drones, night bombers, means of fire influence - guns, anti-tank means. Mining itself plays a very significant role, the officer emphasized. The commander of the drones explained how explosive devices with magnetic sensors work. — Dangerous zones are irradiated, in particular, due to the use of unmanned systems, so as not to risk engineers, sappers, and people. For this, it is necessary to have a certain sensor, which then comes into action when a lightly armored, armored vehicle or just something made of metal passes by, he explained. Yuriy Fedorenko reported how much one sensor costs and how many mines Achilles drones can set per night. — One sensor costs 1,200 hryvnias. Sometimes we can deliver up to 70 min per night. It happens differently. You can calculate the cost yourself, but it is very effective in terms of efficiency, he said. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that The defense forces reliably control tank-dangerous areas in the north of Kharkiv Oblast.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/15/do-70-magnitnyh-pryblud-za-nich-dystanczijne-minuvannya-z-bpla-zdijsnyuye-ahilles/	2024-11-14T23:19:56-08:00

Shampoo -Strength of Victory- and sweater -Last Ukrainian-: Russians talk about non-existent goods	However, this is a photo fake. Such a shampoo has never been sold in Ukraine and is not being sold. However, this does not prevent enemy couch potatoes from taking advantage of Ukrainians because of this. Presumably, the image of the shampoo was taken in a photo editor. Fakeness is indicated, in particular, by the lack of information about the manufacturer, as well as a strange description of the product. After all, it is the Russians who most often use the name of Stepan Bandera in their anti-Ukrainian propaganda. The phrase -bandera spirit- is a typical example of this. This is not the first time Russians have tried to -make fun- of allegedly Ukrainian goods that have never been in Ukraine. Yes, before the New Year holidays last year, they spread information that sweaters with the inscription -last Ukrainian- were sold in Ukraine. In fact, these photo fakes are elements to promote hostile narratives. -Power of Victory- in the form of shampoo is an attempt to mock the unity of Ukrainians and their desire to win over the aggressor. And the inscription on the sweater relays the -throwback- about the readiness of the West or Ukraine to fight -to the last Ukrainian-.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/15/shampun-syla-peremogy-ta-svetr-ostannij-ukrayinecz-rosiyany-rozpovidayut-pro-neisnuyuchi-tovary/	2024-11-14T21:51:45-08:00

From the F-16 veto to the supply of 16 of the latest combat vehicles: Ukrainian experience is taken ...	How important it is to receive F-16 for a country from outside NATO, the example of Bulgaria allows us to understand - a country that joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization two decades ago, but still does not have F-16 fighters in service. About how Bulgaria initiated the purchase of the F-16 Fighting Falcon five years ago, and now is in a hurry to get the Fighting Falcons from Ukraine at least until the end of 2025, ArmiyaInform tells. Bulgarian F-16 Block 70 first successful test flight on October 24, 2024 (Video: Lockheed Martin) F-16 acquisition is difficult among several reasons These include obtaining appropriate approvals, the need to train pilots and support personnel, and to prepare and secure the appropriate infrastructure. It is also necessary to allocate considerable funds from the state budget for the purchase and maintenance of aircraft. It is also necessary to find on the market free F-16s of the latest modifications or combat vehicles suitable for modernization with a flight resource preserved at a level sufficient to justify modernization. The most optimal option, of course, is to purchase new fighters directly from the manufacturer, but the backlog of orders is drawn up for years, so it will not be possible to do this quickly. Moreover, during the execution of the order, circumstances may arise that will force the manufacturer to postpone the previously planned delivery time of combat aircraft by months or even years. This is exactly what happened with the first F-16 Fighting Falcon order, which Bulgaria made back in July 2019. Bulgaria then concluded an agreement to purchase eight F-16s of the latest Block 70 modification, six single-seat and two two-seat fighters. In addition, the contract provided for the purchase of regular aviation ammunition, equipment and spare parts for aircraft, as well as the training of Bulgarian pilots. The value of the 2019 F-16 purchase agreement was $1.265 billion, making it the largest military purchase in Bulgaria's history since the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact Organization. Then, in order to conclude the agreement, the members of the People's Assembly of Bulgaria, the Bulgarian parliament, had to overcome a veto from Bulgarian President Rumen Radev. He motivated his decision by the lack of public consensus on equipment, as well as the fact that the order did not provide for the receipt of a full set of regular F-16 weapons. As a former military pilot, Rumen Radev knew what he was talking about, because due to the desire to reduce the astronomical amount for the Bulgarian state budget, the initial plans had to be revised and limited to the purchase of only part of the equipment and ammunition. Then, as Andrii Haruk reports in the book -Fighting Falcon. History of the F-16-, Bulgaria was forced to abandon the purchase of guided aerial bombs in favor of conventional ones, purchase only two AN/AAQ-33 Sniper ATP sighting pods, and purchase only 12 AIM-9X and 13 AIM-12OC-7 missiles. An equally important role in determining the position of Rumen Radev was played by the pro-Russian orientation of that part of the Bulgarian political system, which tried to oppose the further integration of Bulgaria into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. In any case, Bulgaria failed to receive the first F-16 fighters from the 2019 order on time - by the end of 2023. The execution of the contract was postponed until the end of 2025. Judging by everything, one of the reasons that led to the postponement of the contract, in addition to the corona crisis and the failure with the supply of components, was played by the large-scale attack of the Russian Federation on Ukraine. Already in November 2022, Bulgaria concluded a second contract, according to which it is envisaged to purchase eight additional F-16 Fighting Falcon Block 70 - this time four one- and two-seat fighters each. The delivery of aircraft under this contract will begin in 2027. The second contract is similar in amount, but its terms are somewhat more favorable for Bulgaria. Judging by everything, the Bulgarians were able to get better conditions primarily due to the postponement of the implementation of the first agreement. In particular, under the new agreement, the Bulgarians were able to acquire additional spare parts, engines, radar stations, targeting containers, as well as guided aerial bombs and an additional batch of air-to-air missiles. Russia's large-scale attack on Ukraine significantly intensified the country's activities within NATO, affected the political situation in Bulgaria and affected the position of Bulgarian politicians. September 13, 2024 President of Bulgaria Rumen Radev made a demonstration flight on the F-16 fighter. He spoke highly of the combat vehicle's flying qualities, recalled his experience as a military pilot and his first flight on the Combat Falcon in 2005 shortly after Bulgaria joined NATO. The President of Bulgaria also noted the fruitful cooperation between the Air Force of Bulgaria and the United States of America, in particular regarding the training of Bulgarian pilots to master the latest advanced tactics and methods of combat use of military aviation. Separately, Rumen Radev emphasized the importance of Bulgaria receiving F-16 Fighting Falcon Block 70 fighters, which will allow the country's Air Force to overcome the limitations of outdated Soviet equipment. On October 24, 2024, Lockheed Martin announced the successful flight of the first Bulgarian F-16 Block 70 fighter. During it, a test pilot checked the combat vehicle and certified its readiness for operation. This became a significant event for Bulgaria, witnessing the further strengthening of the country's defense ties with NATO, as well as a step that allows not only to catch up, but also in the future to try to overtake Ukraine in the acquisition of F-16 Fighting Falcon fighters. This will be possible due to the fact that Bulgaria will receive today's latest modification of the Block 70 Combat Falcons directly from the manufacturer. Ukraine will be able to maintain its primacy in the development of the F-16 only thanks to the acquired experience and the purchase of the latest combat vehicles.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/15/vid-veto-na-f-16-do-postachannya-16-novitnih-bojovyh-mashyn-ukrayinskyj-dosvid-vrahovuyut-u-bolgariyi/	2024-11-14T21:03:41-08:00
More deadly and environmentally friendly: new shells have been prepared for Leopards and Abrams	How stated in the presentation release of this Düsseldorf-based manufacturer, the Neo cartridge is intended to counteract modern technologies of armored protection, ArmiyaInform reports. KE2020 Neo (Enhanced Kinetic Energy, eKE), defined by their manufacturer as enhanced kinetic energy (eKE) projectiles, represent the latest innovation in Rheinmetall's kinetic energy (KE) ammunition series. Utilizing decades of design experience from a well-known German manufacturer, these 120mm x 570 caliber ammunitions feature a high-strength tungsten penetrator designed to defeat the latest defense systems with increased penetration. The experts of the defense publication Army Recognition announces that Rheinmetall's KE series of projectiles has been significantly improved over the initial DM13 model. It was followed by the DM23 in the 1980s, then the DM33, and later improved versions such as the DM53 and DM63, designed to meet the needs of the upgraded Leopard 2 A6 tank. Separately, it is noted that the latest cartridge continues the evolution of a series of projectiles such as the DM63, which has been updated to meet the strict European REACh environmental regulations. These changes ensure compliance with safety standards for the environment without compromising combat effectiveness. The DM73 is currently the most advanced munition in the series, used by the Bundeswehr alongside the L55A1 high-pressure gun. The official qualification contract signed in September 2020 between the Bundeswehr Federal Office for Equipment, Information Technology and Internal Support (BAAINBw) and Rheinmetall Waffe Munition GmbH underlines Rheinmetall's leading position in smoothbore and tank weapon technology. Rheinmetall's 120 mm smoothbore technology, including the Rh120 guns and ammunition family, became the NATO standard for main battle tanks such as the Leopard 2 and M1 Abrams, and was integrated into the Challenger 3 tank, improving its combat capabilities. In addition to qualifying munitions, cooperation between Rheinmetall, Germany and Great Britain is progressing towards the modernization of tank munitions in NATO forces. This partnership, including the British Army's Challenger 3 and Germany's Leopard 2 platforms, aims to standardize ammunition types between NATO members, improving interoperability. This agreement not only strengthens Rheinmetall's position in tank weapons technology, but also opens the door to future cooperation with other NATO allies, creating important export opportunities for Rheinmetall and its partners in the UK. The new KE 2020 Neo rounds will also support the Challenger 3 upgrade programme, where a smoothbore gun will replace the Challenger 2 rifled gun. This change brings the British tank into line with standard NATO configurations, with full combat capability expected by 2030. Ammunition is planned to be prepared by that time. How ArmyInform reported, in July of this year, the German company Rheinmetall received the first order from the Ukrainian government for the construction of an ammunition production plant in Ukraine. Plans to build the plant were announced in February 2024. The order for the Rheinmetall technology group covers the complete technical equipment of the plant up to commissioning.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/15/bilsh-smertonosni-ta-ekologichni-dlya-leopardiv-ta-abramsiv-pidgotuvaly-novi-snaryady/	2024-11-14T20:55:55-08:00
The story of Taras, a soldier of the ZSU: in Spain, he sunk the yacht of a Russian official, now he ...	Why did he decide to sink the yacht of the head of Rosoboronexport? But is it difficult to work with the Bradley engine? He told ArmyInform about this: -At the time of the large-scale invasion, I was working in Spain as a senior mechanic on the yacht Lady Anastasia.- The salary was $250 per day. At that time, I had only one desire: to earn a good amount of money in order to secure my pension and return to Ukraine and become a grandfather here. In the first days of the invasion, I saw on video how a rocket hit a high-rise building on Lobanovskyi Street in Kyiv&#8230; Then I finally made the decision that it cannot be like this anymore and something must be done. I decided to sink the yacht I was working on. Why did I decide to sink this particular yacht? Because its owner - Oleksandr Aleksandrovich Mikheev - is the head of the Russian company Rosoboronexport. And it is precisely he who is involved in the production of missiles that fly at us. I am a senior mechanic, I have 24-hour access to the engine room. I opened the Kingston to sink the yacht. Water went into the engine room&#8230; But we still had three crew members on board the ship: our boys from Odessa. And here, as they say, -the countrymen helped-: they started to make noise that, they say, we will lose our jobs&#8230; Well, they notified the local police. The repair crew from the port brought a trailer with a huge pump, they managed to block the Kingston, which I opened. It was not possible to sink the yacht, but I did sink it well. She was then arrested and is still standing in the port of Hadrian motionless. That is, disabled. In general, this is a super yacht, 50 meters long, it has luxury cabins, salons&#8230; Of course I was arrested. Detained, or rather. They brought me to the police station, where I had to wait for the trial. But the judge made a decision: there was no damage to the Spanish side, so there is no legal reason to detain me, and I can go home. When I made this story in Spain, I said to myself: what is this job for me, if I may not have a country? Therefore, I can say to everyone: first, let's defend our country, and then we will think about our own business, about our own interests. &#8230;When I already entered Ukraine, I was accompanied by Roman Ratushny. This is our hero, he died in the 22nd year. Kyiv activist. My son's friend. My son, by the way, also serves in the Defense Forces. And on March 1, I came to the Dnipro TCC. And now I have been serving here for 2.5 years, repairing military equipment. I will be 58 soon. Now, if all the spare parts are available, on average I spend 5-6 days to issue one high-pressure fuel pump for the UTD-20 engine. Why so long? Because I do a complete overhaul, that is, I disassemble the pump to the last cog. In parallel with these tasks, I also worked on fuel pumps for the -Kamazov- engine, which is on the BTR-80. I have already repaired the Bradley: I repaired the fuel equipment. It is interesting, more complicated than the classical principle of fuel equipment. The engine in the -Bradley- is an ordinary V-shaped, eight-cylinder, four-stroke engine, like all engines, there is nothing particularly cosmic about it. The Bradley engine is comparable to the KamAZ, although the American one is a little bigger, a little more complex, and much better quality. &#8230;I will tell you this: at the age of 50 or more, you can both live and serve. And it even needs to be done, someone who has a specialty, who has a profession, can help with repairs and some other help. Guys, help our army, help our country, because don't bring it, Lord, we will lose it. Therefore, I call on everyone to defend.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/15/istoriya-voyina-zsu-tarasa-v-ispaniyi-prytopyv-yahtu-rosijskogo-chynovnyka-nyni-remontuye-amerykanski-bredli/	2024-11-14T20:22:57-08:00

In Donetsk region, one more department head of the district military committee was exposed, who also -wrote off- evaders from military registration on the basis of fictitious certificates of the VLK. In Sumshchyna, two founders of a charitable foundation and their accomplices were exposed, who produced fake documents for the evaders to travel abroad under the guise of volunteers. In Odesa Oblast, a former deputy head of the state seaport and a current employee of the institution were arrested for selling fake disability certificates to conscripts. Familiar doctors from the local MSEK were used to make fake plots. In Cherkasy, a recidivist was exposed, who pretended to be a military man and, for money, offered the evaders hospitalization in a hospital with fake -severe- diagnoses. Then, on the basis of fictitious medical documents, the men were -written off- from the military register. Offenders face up to 10 years in prison with confiscation of property. ArmyInform reminds that it is better not to break the law or risk your life, but to use the aggregator of vacancies in the Armed Forces and recruiting centers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/14/chornyj-rynok-mobilizacziyi-sbu-vykryly-czikavi-rishennya-dlya-unyknennya-mobilizacziyi/	2024-11-14T11:57:19-08:00

Ammunition explosions can lead to soil contamination with toxic substances, such as heavy metals, chemical components of explosives, which limit soil fertility and endanger the lives of the population,- said Colonel Oleg Shuvarskyi. Upon completion of the courses, future specialists will be able to conduct environmental audits, draw up acts in accordance with EU legislation, and also determine the possibility of using territories free of explosives for agriculture and other sectors of the economy.

But it must be understood that the positions of the barrel artillery, which are deployed, are also vulnerable. This, of course, should not be allowed, but any artillery, as well as any other enemy forces that appear, are immediately destroyed by the fire of Ukrainian weapons, Yevgeny Romanov explained. Yesterday, after a long break, the Russians resorted to the use of armored vehicles. — The difference from previous days was that the enemy used armored vehicles, including tanks and armored vehicles. Before that, he advanced exclusively with infantry forces - small infantry groups that advanced in the dark, under the cover of rain or fog, so that they would not be noticed by Ukrainian intelligence.

Russian airlines are in a steep rush due to the threat of bankruptcy	About this reports the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. Due to restrictions on currency settlements, the Russian authorities allowed air carriers to transfer funds to special accounts in rubles, but foreign lessors do not accept such payments due to non-compliance with the terms of the contracts. As a result, the companies stopped paying debts, and the released funds were directed to support the technical suitability of the aircraft fleet, the cost of which has increased significantly due to sanctions restrictions. The government of the Russian Federation allowed to write off debts for payments in 2025, but according to current tax rules, these amounts will still be subject to a 25% income tax, which air carriers will not be able to pay. The possible bankruptcy of small and medium-sized Russian airlines will have serious consequences for the aviation industry and the Russian economy in general. It is about reducing the availability of air transportation, reducing the level of their safety, losing jobs and reducing the investment attractiveness of the industry. The increase in the tax burden in the context of the Russian government's measures to fill the budget due to the war against Ukraine is a systemic factor that is gradually destroying various sectors of the Russian economy. We remind you that the cost of loans is rapidly increasing in the Russian Federation and inflationary processes are accelerating, which is inevitable ->approaches the economic crisis in the country.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/14/rosijski-aviakompaniyi-v-krutomu-pike-cherez-zagrozu-bankrutstva/	2024-11-14T10:08:26-08:00

The EU plans to strengthen defense capabilities	This is reported by Service of foreign intelligence of Ukraine. The budget plan of the European Union for 2021-2027 provides 392 billion euros for -cohesion policy- initiatives. About five percent of them have been used today. According to current regulations, these funds cannot be used to purchase defense equipment or directly finance the armed forces. In order to avoid their inappropriate use, the European Commission is considering the possibility of spending money on programs for regional development, in particular, logistics infrastructure. It is about the construction and strengthening of bridges and roads for the safe passage of military equipment. In addition, legislative changes are not excluded, which will provide more flexibility to the rules of budget allocation, in particular, its use for the expansion of defense industries. Such a change in policy indicates an increased focus on defense in the next EU budget for 2028-2034, negotiations on which will begin in 2025. We would like to remind you that in the Russian Federation the cost of loans is rapidly inflationary processes are accelerating, which inevitably brings the country's economic crisis closer.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/14/yes-planuye-posylennya-oboronnyh-spromozhnostej/	2024-11-14T05:58:40-08:00

The parties also discussed this year's innovations aimed at strengthening defense capabilities: the possibility of recruiting directly to a specific military unit and the introduction of basic military service instead of conscription from 2025. The head of the Military Conscription and Recruitment Service of the Republic of Lithuania, Arunas Balciunas, emphasized that it is important for Lithuania, which also borders Russia, to study the experience of Ukraine gained during almost a thousand days of war. -Lithuania also borders the Russian Federation, so we are interested in the experience that Ukraine received resistance for almost a thousand days. When peacetime is replaced by war events, everything changes very quickly. And it is very important for the military, who are responsible for the security of the state, to be ready for these changes,- said Arunas Balciunas.

The dormitory was destroyed, the classrooms were destroyed: Russian troops shelled the university in...	Correspondents of ArmiyaInform visited the scene. According to an employee of the university, she was just passing near the institution when she heard the distinctive roar of a projectile approaching, followed by three explosions. Then she saw black smoke. She was very scared, because she works as a watchman at the university, and it was a miracle that she was not on the territory of the institution. According to Stanislav Chaichenko, Vice-Rector for Scientific and Pedagogical Work of the Donbass State Pedagogical University, as a result of the Russian shelling, probably a missile, there is a hit in one of the university dormitories. In the main building of the university, windows and doors were broken, classrooms were damaged. Fortunately, during the Russian terrorist attack, there were no workers in the premises and only the premises were destroyed. — The educational process in us is carried out remotely. The university is in the stage of relocation, currently the administration works in the city of Dnipro on the basis of another educational institution, - says Stanislav Chaichenko. - Our university is a pedagogical one, the entire line from preschool education is represented: preschool, primary, secondary education in various subjects and specializations, professional education. There are also non-pedagogical specialties such as psychology, management, social work, therapy, rehabilitation and some others. The number of students currently fluctuates at different times, so somewhere on average 2.5-3 thousand students are currently studying, this is together with our separate unit, the Horliv Institute of Foreign Languages, which also moved from Bakhmut to the Dnipro for the second time and now they are next to each other, - he adds vice-rector of the university. He mentions that in a certain period 11 thousand studied in Slovyansk students It was in the early 2000s, the population of Slovyansk at that time was approximately 120-110 thousand inhabitants, and more than 10 thousand people studied at the university. — Most of the students were from Donetsk region, Luhansk region, Kharkiv Oblast, a little bit of Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, came to us from all over the region to acquire a teaching profession, - adds Stanislav Chaichenko. The head of the Slavic MBA, Vadym Lyakh, said that high-rise buildings, a kindergarten, a supermarket, and private cars were also damaged by the shelling.

Prostitutes, apartments and more: what Ukrainian activists found on the hacked computer of the comma...	About this reports Center of National Resistance. At the same time, the general managed to spread a computer virus on equipment at the headquarters of the command of the Russian group in the Zaporizhzhia direction. Also, while sending Russian soldiers to their inevitable death, he sent his own son abroad with a military education. Hackers-activists -Cyber ​​Resistance- and -KibOrg- managed to download a spy virus to the personal computer of the commander of the forces of the Russian Federation in the Zaporizhia region in 2023, Colonel-General Alexander Romanchuk. He spread the malicious program on a number of devices in the main headquarters of the Russian group. The surveillance operation lasted more than a year and a half and made it possible to obtain information about the enemy's plans, the location of his forces and intelligence. Part of the obtained material was handed over to analysts of the CNS. Since the active period of the operation has ended, it became possible to familiarize with a number of its details publicly. Also, the motive for the publication was the rhetoric of Russian propaganda regarding Romanchuk. Some of its elements cause sharp fits of laughter in people who are informed from primary sources. If you compile a portrait of Romanchuk from the publications of some of the Russian -military forces- in Telegram, then a real Rimbaud with the mind of Clausewitz or Sun Tzu appears, who almost personally stopped the Ukrainian offensive in the Zaporozhye direction in 2023. Romanchuk receives the epaulettes of colonel-general from the hands of the chief of the general staff of the Soviet Union Gerasimov and in the presence of the then commander of the invasion forces of Ukraine Surovikin on the eve of being sent to the Zaporizhzhia region. February 2023. Photo from Romanchuk's personal archive, to which CNS analysts were given access. It follows from the publication of the -Rybar- channel that Romanchuk seized a tank during a business trip to Syria, -set up a carousel of fire- and -pulled 40 fighters out of the cauldron.- Another popular channel -Children of the Arbat- adds Romanchuk to the top ten most talented Russian commanders, and the -Neighbor- channel writes that Romanchuk is a key element of Russian defense in Zaporizhzhia in 2023. With such a reputation, Romanchuk received the right to open the parade until May 9, 2024 in Moscow. In fact, under the leadership of Romanchuk, the Russians traditionally bombarded the front line with cannon fodder in the Zaporozhye direction. This became clear in detail thanks to the publication of statistics by Captain Vyacheslav Dondokov from Buryatia, who then headed the tactical group of the 42nd medical battalion of the Russian Federation in the relevant area. Only one tactical medical group of the enemy (stable point) received more than 1,100 wounded for a month. According to Ukrainian intelligence, there were at least 11 such groups in the Zaporizhzhia region. This means that in 2023, Russian troops lost more than 12,000 wounded there every month. Did Romanchuk try to improve the position of the fighters and resort to non-standard steps, continuously studying the situation on the line of contact? The most impressive discovery of the CNS analysts was that the -heroic- colonel-general, while in the position of head of an entire direction, did not show any interest in the affairs at the front. There is no exaggeration here. Romanchuk literally did not deal with the matters entrusted to him. The defense forces had full access to Romanchuk's personal computer and recorded everything he did when he used the device, as well as full access to the colonel general's mail and social media accounts. Romanchuk had a very peculiar occupation during working hours. Judging by the actions on his computer, the lion's share of time was spent choosing on the sites of ads for cottages and apartments for the needs of the family. Romanchuk also engaged in the selection of girls on the dating site for personal needs.

mass bankruptcies and corporate defaults await Russia	This is reported by /a> Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. The number of loans with a dynamic rate, which critically depend on the discount rate of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, is constantly increasing: at the end of 2023, their share was 44% of the total number of corporate loans, but by the end of 2024, it reached 53%. Economists close to the Russian government expect unsecured money issuance, explosive growth of inflation and the collapse of the ruble in the near future. The critical point of this scenario is considered to be mid-2025. In addition, the regulator's tight monetary policy creates risks of recession and transition to stagflation in the short term. The further situation may develop according to the -shock with a decline in production- scenario, which will be accompanied by mass bankruptcies and corporate defaults.

The head of the planning department of the 13th brigade of operational assignment -Charter- told about this on the broadcast of the -Edyny Novyny- marathon Lieutenant Colonel Anton Baev of the National Guard of Ukraine. -The presence of civilians on the battlefield is always a problem for us, for the Defense Forces of Ukraine,- he said. The officer said that if there are civilians next to the soldiers of the occupiers, the fighters of the Defense Forces are forced to cease fire. On the other hand, the appearance of civilians in the combat zone does not pose any problem for the enemy. - Our enemy is not as humane as we are. Therefore, it is not an obstacle for him, but for us it is a very big obstacle. When we see the movement of the enemy from the drone and start using means to defeat him or use artillery - and when we see from the drone that a civilian (usually elderly people) comes out on the way or near the target where the enemy is located - then, accordingly , we understand that there is no question of any fire injury. We have to wait until either the civilian disappears or the enemy moves to another place, - explained the soldier. Moreover, the Russian occupiers deliberately and specifically use civilians as human shields. - Unfortunately, the enemy also knows that we treat our civilians this way. Sometimes it happens that [the enemy] resorts to vile acts, taking cover of civilians, settling in civilian houses. They settle and do not drive civilians out of their houses, they force them to live on, but they themselves settle in basements and in this way protect themselves, because they know that at this time nothing will fly into this house, - said Anton Baev.

The enemy has already proven that there are no principles and rules for waging war for him, so Ukraine must be ready to fight back for a long time and build a defense system that will allow effective recapture of territories,- concluded Dmytro Lazutkin. As reported by ArmyInform, the Ministry of Defense commented on the proposal of disbandment of TCC and SP.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/14/u-minoborony-prokomentuvaly-plan-mobilizacziyi-do-lyutogo-2025-roku/	2024-11-13T21:35:03-08:00

Repression, torture, executions, a sea of ​​blood: the historian reminds the Zhduns what to expect f...	— We have at least a dozen historical examples, so to speak, of the occupation of Kyiv either by Russians or by Soviet troops. But, unfortunately, the whole experience is exactly the same. It all boils down to the fact that after the occupation of the city, mass repressions take place, both against that part of the population that was ready to resist, and that resisted, and against that population that, in the opinion of the occupiers, was not loyal enough. Therefore, I would like to remind everyone, first of all, to address the so-called -Zhduns- so that they do not have any illusions about how the Russians will behave. They will behave the same as they behaved in 1169, 1659, 1918, 1919. We have many such examples. This will first be the absolutely deliberate destruction of people who take a pro-Ukrainian position, and then they will take care of everything else in order to simply level the landscape and change it, populating the city with its own absolutely loyal population. Therefore, no one should have the illusion that the occupation will be peaceful, that -great Russian culture- will come here, humanists in the form of Leo Tolstoy and others. No, it won't. Absolutely peaceful occupation does not exist. There will be repression, there will be torture, there will be executions, there will be a sea of ​​blood. And Kyiv has already experienced this many times. I hope this will not happen again. For this, we have the Armed Forces of Ukraine and, I hope, the consciousness of our population as a guarantee.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/14/represiyi-tortury-straty-more-krovi-istoryk-nagaduye-zhdunam-chogo-chekaty-vid-okupacziyi/	2024-11-13T20:55:49-08:00
Who can become a combat medic: the takmed instructor -Lastivka- told how much time it takes to prepa...	Lastivka told ArmiyaInform correspondent about how important quality training in tactical medicine is, who can become a combat medic and how much time it takes to train him -from scratch-, as well as when and why practice is more important than theory, and motivation determines the result. The boys gave their callsign while still in the brigade. There were many Russian-speaking boys, so they called me -Lastochka- - Ukrainian -Lastivka-. They said I looked like a swallow - small, thin, fussy, sharp and fast. I fly everywhere, I run everywhere, I try to be in time everywhere. My husband also said that I remind him of a swallow, because he once watched swallows in his childhood and saw how they protect their home, their offspring. The swallow is a small bird, and it fearlessly pounces on any threat much larger than itself. That's why he said that I look like a swallow. In the Armed Forces of Ukraine, I am from a large-scale invasion. I wanted to leave back in 2014, when the anti-terrorist operation began, but my husband did not allow me, he said that someone should stay at home with the child alone. In 2022, the child had already grown up, so it was no longer possible to keep me at home under this pretext. And the threat became much more terrible, so I could not stay at home anymore. I am a doctor by education, by 2022 I already had 21 years of medical experience. I worked in a maternity hospital, helped deliver children. And now my children have to defend their home with automatic weapons and I couldn't help them. I'm not afraid of blood, I'm not afraid of hurting people to make them better, to save them. I had to hurt even newborn babies in order to save their lives. That's why I'm not afraid to hurt an adult to make him feel better, to survive. From March 2022 to February 2024, I was in a combat brigade. At the beginning of the invasion, no one taught us what tactical medicine was, what and how we should do it - there was no time, no opportunity. Now I'm at the training center and I see how high-quality training in tactical medicine has become. Now is the time, there is an opportunity to train people to provide adequate assistance on the battlefield - this is very important. Due to this, we have much better trained combat medics who go to the brigades. There they not only provide medical care, but also train fighters. We are training combat medics - these are the people who will continue to teach the boys tactical medicine in the brigades, because, in my opinion, only the basics of the necessary training are laid down during the BZVP, and they are not enough. Any motivated thinking person can become a combat medic. Medical education would be an advantage, of course, but it is not a mandatory requirement, as we primarily train people who have never worked professionally in medicine. We explain in such a way that our students understand why exactly such actions should be taken in this or that situation. We teach them this and try not to use any complicated medical terms. We always prioritize practice, not theory. If a combat medic can work on an algorithm without thinking about it, it is much more important than when he knows how to beautifully explain what he is doing and why. Our graduates may not remember complex medical terms, but they will determine exactly what should be done and what should not be done in any case. And their hands will never forget how to properly make a bandage or apply a tourniquet. Preparation requires a high-quality material base, equipment, and consumables. We have good sponsors who help a lot with all this. There are necessary mannequins, systems, dummies, turnstiles - everything you need. Of course, it all wears out, runs out, and needs to be replaced and replenished. But in general, everything that is needed for quality education is enough. The most important resource is time. We constantly -drive- and train our students. So that they do not get confused, how and where to turn that bandage or tourniquet, so that it is done at the level of automation. Training a combat medic requires intense training and time to train muscle memory. For this, one month is definitely not enough, two is better and you can manage in general, but the best option is three months for preparation. After completing the training, the combat medic receives the corresponding VOS number with a record in the military ticket that he successfully passed the combat medic course with a positive evaluation, that is, he can assume the position of a combat medic and provide assistance on the battlefield and in shelter conditions. We also train paramedics. They are trained according to a more simplified program, but they also know and are able to do a lot to help the wounded and save his life. The most capable, responsible and motivated can later go to the courses of a senior combat medic, when the training program has already been approved. This will be the next step in professional development. A senior combat medic must know and be able to organize, set up a stabilization point - this is a higher level of knowledge and responsibility when it comes to organizing the care of many wounded in a specially equipped place. Being a combat medic is very responsible, so random people are not needed here. You cannot become a doctor by force. Unmotivated students are very difficult to teach. It's better to spend extra time on a person who really wants to learn, and I'd rather teach them, than to spend time, energy and resources on someone who needs to be forced to learn.

Military at disposal: about the grounds and amount of payments	Most often, servicemen who are on long-term treatment after an injury, or those who have been recognized as unfit or limited fit for service in such a unit, are taken into command. That is, they cannot perform the duties of their position, and at the same time they cannot resign from the Armed Forces. So they have to wait for a certain time, for example, to be released or transferred to other units. Of course, this is not a complete list of grounds for inclusion in the ordinance. For example, this is also allowed if: With in full the list of grounds can be found in the Presidential Decree -On Provisions on the Military Service of Ukrainian Citizens in the Armed Forces of Ukraine-. Servicemen on active duty should receive the following financial support: We would like to remind you that if the removal to service is related to long-term treatment after an injury, during treatment in a hospital, or during the time on leave for treatment, servicemen are paid an additional remuneration of 100,000 hryvnias. You can read more about payments for the wounded here. ♬ original audio recording - armyinform &#8211; armyinform In most cases, enlisted servicemen continue their military service. Therefore, they must perform the duties determined by the commander under whose command they fall. Exceptions are military personnel on long-term treatment, parental leave, or those on precautionary measures.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/14/vijskovyj-u-rozporyadzhenni-pro-pidstavy-ta-rozmir-vyplat/	2024-11-13T20:28:51-08:00
Cheap and can be angry: the Republic of Korea has made cardboard drones for aerial reconnaissance an...	Assaid on the official portal of the Peach development company from South Korea, this fixed-wing drone is designed to perform reconnaissance missions with minimal production and deployment costs, which makes it an attractive solution for military tasks, ArmiyaInform reports. A significant reduction in production costs is achieved due to the materials used, because they are light and cheap, and the drone itself is not large in size. Its wingspan is only 80 centimeters, and the maximum take-off weight is up to 1 kg, so the drone is record small. However, this does not affect its flight capabilities. PapyDrone-800 can be launched manually, that is, simply by the operator, whose hand acts as the -runway-. Once in flight, the drone can reach speeds of up to 100 km/h for a maximum of 20 minutes. The drone is able to provide real-time reconnaissance because it is equipped with a high-quality camera that transmits a video signal in real time and thus gives the operator direct access to information about the environment. At the same time, the control system supports not one, but up to five UAVs. The PapyDrone-800 also has an integrated avionics system that handles navigation and data processing. KCNA/P's built-in authentication module ensures the security and integrity of mission data, preventing tampering or unauthorized access. A high level of data encryption ensures that reconnaissance missions remain confidential and secure, even if the drone is intercepted or shot down. Combined with the low price and ease of production, PapyDrone-800 can be considered as a disposable UAV. It does not require ideal flight conditions and, thanks to the IPX3 standard, it can work effectively in various environments, including high humidity. While many drones used by the military have relatively expensive and labor-intensive systems to maintain, the PapyDrone-800 stands in stark contrast. As defined experts from IKK Defense Express, although the drone is positioned by its developers as a reconnaissance device, it has the description states that the internal volume of the fuselage allows carrying a warhead. -As for operational capabilities, it is declared to be used up to a wind speed of 10 m/s, which is the standard -civilian- limit. As for protection against moisture, the cardboard used has protection at the IPX3 level, and the developers showed the possibility of flying in the rain,- DE experts said. In the promo video, you can also see several details, such as the use of hot-melt glue to attach the fuselage elements, as well as the fact that some power elements of the body are still made of carbon, the equipment compartment is made of foam, and the drone also has metal rods. At the same time, the use of electronic components, as seen in the video, is reduced to a minimum number of boards. It should be noted that the South Korean startup Peach also has a larger development, the Papidrone-1800, the parameters of which are not disclosed, but the payload of the drone is obviously larger. Its conceptual idea is similar - to use the cheapest possible components. Thus, according to defense market analysts, the low price of the PapyDrone-800 allows even small military units to have access to advanced intelligence technologies without the financial burden associated with traditional and more complex unmanned systems. This opens up new opportunities for countries and organizations operating within modest budgets, especially in regions with limited military resources. Video: Presentation of PapyDrone-800 UAV.

Fake letters from Freedom House: how Russian propagandists are trying to demoralize the Ukrainian mi...	Letters on behalf of the US non-governmental organization Freedom House with alleged calls to the Ukrainian military to leave the service are fake. Enemy propagandists used a fake email address and logo of an international organization to give the message weight and authenticity. But again, they could not avoid typical language mistakes and Russianisms used by people who do not speak Ukrainian. Freedom House also quickly reacted to this manipulation, calling it part of a campaign to discredit the Ukrainian army: -We have noticed cases of sending fake e-mails pretending to be messages from Freedom House. These letters contain false information directed against the Ukrainian military and are aimed at undermining trust in our organization and the morale of the defenders of Ukraine,- the message reads. According to representatives of the organization, official statements of Freedom House are distributed exclusively through verified channels.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/14/fejkovi-lysty-vid-freedom-house-yak-rosijski-propagandysty-namagayutsya-demoralizuvaty-ukrayinskyh-vijskovyh/	2024-11-13T20:02:41-08:00
Support for front-line communities: the new budget provides for UAH 14.9 billion in reverse subsidie...	This was reported by the Deputy Prime Minister for the Reconstruction of Ukraine - the Minister of Community Development and territory of Ukraine Oleksiy Kuleba. At the meeting chaired by the President of Ukraine, with the participation of representatives of the Government and the Verkhovna Rada, the main indicators of the draft state budget for 2025 were considered. A decision was made to maintain the reverse subsidy in the budgets of communities located in the front-line zone. In particular, the draft budget provides for the redistribution of 14.9 billion hryvnias of the reverse subsidy to support de-occupied and front-line communities, which, according to Kuleba, is -a fair and necessary solution for people working in the most difficult conditions of war.- In addition, an additional 37.5 billion hryvnias are allocated to communities that suffered losses due to Russia's large-scale armed aggression. The Ministry of Development of Communities and Territories also expressed a position regarding the preservation of 64% of the personal income tax (PIT) in the budgets of communities. This solution will contribute to increasing the capacity of local communities and supporting their viability. As reported by ArmyInform, Ukraine will receive the sixth IRIS-T air defense system from Germany by the end of the year.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/13/pidtrymka-pryfrontovyh-gromad-novyj-byudzhet-peredbachaye-149-mlrd-grn-reversnoyi-dotacziyi/	2024-11-13T12:28:34-08:00

On the ladder to the border: border guards thwarted an attempt to escape to Moldova	About this reported in the State Border Service of Ukraine. According to border guards, residents of Kyiv, Odesa, Luhansk, Kirovohrad and Poltava regions turned to the organizer of the scheme, who through one of the messengers offered them help in illegally crossing the border for a fee. Each of the violators had to pay $10,000 to the organizer's crypto wallet. The attacker prepared a plan, including the purchase of a telescopic ladder, to bypass the anti-traffic ditch at the border. However, during the detention, four men tried to escape, but the border guards reacted quickly and arrested all the violators. The driver, who acted as an accomplice, was sent a notice of suspicion under Art. 332 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine -Illegal transportation of persons across the state border of Ukraine.- Regarding all fugitives, administrative offense reports have been drawn up under Art. 204-1 of the Criminal Procedure Code -Illegal crossing or attempted illegal crossing of the state border of Ukraine.- The cases are referred to the court. The operation was carried out jointly with the Department of the Migration Police of the National Security Service of Ukraine in the Odesa region. ArmyInform reminds that it is better not to break the law or risk your life, but to use the aggregator of vacancies in the Armed Forces and recruiting centers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/13/na-drabyni-do-kordonu-prykordonnyky-zirvaly-sprobu-vtechi-do-moldovy/	2024-11-13T11:44:52-08:00
The Ministry of Defense commented on the proposal to disband the TCC and JV	About this he told on the air -Suspilne Novosti-. -It is still too early to draw any conclusions. Territorial recruitment and social support centers are working, and this should be treated very carefully. At the moment, their staff is not as large as was stated in the press. After all, rather large numbers were announced,- Dmytro Lazutkin noted. Dmytro Lazutkiv explained that there are 48,000 positions in the TCC. However, 36,000 people actually work there, of which almost 7,000 are civilians. In particular, among the military, 18,500 are disabled and 3,000 are women. If we talk about those with limited fitness, then for many this status was acquired on the battlefield, these people defended the Motherland with weapons in their hands. This should also be taken into account, and these moments should be treated with caution. In addition, the spokesman of the IOU commented on Roman Istomin's statement that it is impossible to create a single brigade from TCC employees. -If you approach purely quantitatively, then it is possible. But these people perform other tasks. You can treat corruption scandals and unpleasant moments in different ways, but if there are any reorganization measures, we will communicate. Currently, they continue to be under the command of the Land Forces Command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine,- Dmytro Lazutkin noted. Also, the spokesman once again emphasized that 18,500 servicemen of the TCC and SP are of limited suitability who have already fought. As reported by ArmyInform, appearance of TCC and police officers in public places are not -raids-, but warning measures, and if the visitor violates the rules of the military accounting or legislation — the police have legal grounds to detain him.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/13/u-minoborony-prokomentuvaly-propozycziyu-pro-rozformuvannya-tczk-ta-sp/	2024-11-13T11:34:50-08:00
-You will serve in the second line-: the occupiers recruit migrants in -meat assaults-	About informs Center of National Resistance. Since the beginning of the large-scale invasion, the Kremlin has imported migrants to TOT as cheap labor to build the houses destroyed by Russia. However, due to the current crisis, the construction industry in the Russian Federation is at a standstill, and migrants are being offered to join the ranks of the enemy's army. Officially, migrants are summoned for interrogations, where they are offered to conclude a contract and promise that they will serve in the second line. However, in fact, after that, they are sent to training grounds located along the line of military contact, and then sent to -meat assaults-. The Center of National Resistance calls for the reporting of all those involved in such recruiting, as well as the location of the gathering of the Russian military, so that the contracts of the occupiers are completed sooner. As reported by ArmyInform, in the temporarily occupied territories, the Russians conducted -dlya-najmancziv-kndr/->lessons of -international friendship-, where children drew cards in support of North Korea.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/13/budesh-sluzhyty-u-drugij-liniyi-okupanty-verbuyut-migrantiv-u-myasni-shturmy/	2024-11-13T11:24:37-08:00
The army of perverts: the soldier of the Russian Federation who raped a minor in the Kherson region ...	This is reported by the Office of the Prosecutor General. Under the procedural guidance of the Prosecutor General's Office, a serviceman of the 109th Rifle Regiment of the Mobilization Reserve of the 1st Army Corps of the 8th General Army of the Southern Military District of the Russian Federation was identified and informed of the suspicion of violating the laws and customs of war. According to the investigation, in March 2022, the suspect, together with other soldiers of the army of the aggressor state, occupied one of the settlements of the Kherson region. A serviceman of the Russian Federation entered the territory of one of the private houses where local residents and children were hiding. The suspect entered one of the rooms where the underage girl and her sisters were. He asked her how old they were. The suspect ordered the girl to follow him to another room of the house and to undress completely.

The Cabinet of Ministers has changed the conditions for receiving aid for the families of missing an...	About this informs the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. Corresponding changes to the order of payments were approved by the Cabinet of Ministers at the proposal of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. Previously, the three-year deadline for submitting documents to receive a one-time cash benefit was calculated from the date of death indicated in the certificate. It is noted that this led to the fact that close relatives of military personnel, whom the court declared dead after a long period of absence, could lose the right to assistance due to the expiration of the terms even before the court decision itself was passed. Now the counting of time for registration of assistance starts from the day of entry into legal force of the court decision declaring the serviceman dead. This will ensure social guarantees for the families of the fallen defenders. The Government has also introduced an extraordinary payment of one-time cash assistance to persons with disabilities of the 1st group. This is due to the fact that such people need urgent and expensive treatment. Often, due to the long waiting period in the general queue, they do not have time to receive assistance in their lifetime. Amendments are made to Resolution No. 975 of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine of December 25, 2013 -On approval of the Procedure for the appointment and payment of one-time cash benefits in the event of death (death), disability or partial loss of working capacity without establishing disability of servicemen, conscripts and reservists who are called up for training (or inspection) and special meetings or for serving in the military reserve-. Resolution No. 168 of February 28, 2022 -Issue of certain payments to military personnel, rank and file officers, police officers and their families during martial law- was also amended.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/13/kabmin-zminyv-umovy-otrymannya-dopomogy-dlya-rodyn-znyklyh-bezvisty-ta-zagyblyh-vijskovyh/	2024-11-13T04:21:55-08:00

According to the investigation, the suspect, based on a preliminary conspiracy with court employees, ensured that judges passed decisions in civil cases under obviously fabricated circumstances for an illegal benefit. Such decisions provided grounds for men to postpone conscription for military service during mobilization, as well as travel abroad during martial law in Ukraine. The law enforcement officers documented that the suspect received $3,000 in September of this year, and UAH 124,500 in October for two court decisions: regarding the divorce, deprivation of the mother's parental rights, and establishing the fact of the father's independent upbringing and maintenance of a minor child. Currently, the issue of selecting a preventive measure for the suspect and imposing an arrest on the property is being resolved. The involvement of other court employees in the commission of the crime is being checked. ArmyInform reminds that it is better not to break the law or risk your life, but to use the aggregator of vacancies in the Armed Forces and recruiting centers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/13/zroblyu-batkom-odynakom-nedorogo-na-donechchyni-vykryla-pomichnyka-sudu-yakyj-prodavav-rishennya-uhylyantam/	2024-11-13T03:44:57-08:00
Filmed with a camera for the camera — in Zhytomyr Oblast, a cleric of the UOC (MP) faces 8 years	The Security Service of Ukraine reported this on November 13. According to the case materials, after the start of the full-scale war, the suspect imposed pro-Russian views on the parishioners in his sermons, and also distributed posts on social networks justifying the Russian Federation's war against Ukraine. Among other things, on the pages of the cleric, the Russian invasion of our country was presented as a -civil conflict-, and the war crimes of the Rashists were justified. In addition, the person involved publicly insulted the religious views of believers of other faiths, and also called for support for the Russian Orthodox Church.

Examinations initiated by the SBU confirmed the facts of the cleric's informational and subversive activities for the benefit of the aggressor country. On the basis of the collected evidence, the investigators of the Security Service informed the defendant of the suspicion under Art. 1, 2, 3 st. 436-2 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (justification, recognition as legitimate, denial of armed aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, glorification of its participants). An investigation is ongoing to establish all the circumstances of the crime. The perpetrator faces up to 8 years in prison. As ArmiyaInform reported, the Security Service has completed a pre-trial investigation into members of a criminal organization that carried out information sabotage against Ukraine on the order of the FSB.

Next, probably, cavalry, bicycles: an expert on stocks of military equipment in the Russian Federati...	-If we talk about the replenishment of the enemy's troops with combat equipment, then, for example, the entire tank repair industry of the Russian Federation with joint efforts produces about 150-160 tanks every month. About 30% of them are the newest - those assembled from scratch at the Uralvagonzavod. All the rest are cars that have been restored after they were wrecked in Ukraine. Or these are machines that were taken from storage, reanimated and sent to the front. Accordingly, if the enemy produces 150-160 vehicles per month, they will collect 1,920 tanks in a year. The Dutch site Oryx counts the losses of this war. But he counts not just the ones shot down in battle, but the completely destroyed machines that can no longer be restored. So, the Dutch counted a total of 3,494 destroyed tanks from the Russians for the entire time of the fighting. That is, with a production rate of 1,920 tanks per year, the enemy covers its losses without problems. But there is one caveat. The tanks that are now being delivered to the Russian army are older years of production. Because this is what is taken for storage, reanimated and supplied to units. If we receive cars from the allies somewhere in the 70s, 80s - if we are lucky, the first half of the 90s, then the enemy has them in the 60s. The difference in technical capabilities is obvious. the Russian Federation does not produce tank sights at all. They buy them in Belarus. Joint-stock company -Peleng- takes care of their production. It collects 145 -Sosna- sights and 40 of the latest -Sosna-U- sights in a year. On the eve of a large-scale invasion, the Russians purchased optical sights from France. All this was sanctioned. Accordingly, it is necessary to buy in Belarus. According to the sights, it turns out that the Belarusians are able to provide for the Russians. The Russian Federation even has the ability to change broken sights on tanks and keep something in stock. The situation in the Russian Federation is worse with artillery, because cannon barrels, first of all, are long. Second, it is a laborious process. Thirdly, the machines that are needed for drilling and cutting are high-precision equipment that cannot be bought so easily in the market. There were rumors that 10 machines were purchased by the Russians through Austria. But there are fewer than a hundred such machines throughout Russia. And the need for cannon barrels is thousands. Therefore, you can take what you have, repair it and give it to the troops. Accordingly, no one cancels the concept of -fatigue- of metal. The laws of physics apply. What was in storage will definitely have a shorter service life. Separately, it is necessary to say about the means of anti-aircraft defense of the enemy. It was already known in 2022 that the Russians do not have enough workers at factories. Russia produces such devices, but these are high-tech systems that require a lot of components, radio electronics, processors. And they are not produced in the Russian Federation. Accordingly, all this is imported through gray routes, very long supply chains are used. This is far from always military products, it can be purely civilian radio electronics, and it has other, for example, temperature ranges&#8230; And, accordingly, they can do something with air defense, but it will take a long time. And as we knock out their anti-aircraft missile systems, it becomes more and more difficult for the enemy to replenish them. Plus, friends from Iran urgently asked for S-300. the Russians took them to Crimea and sent them to Ayatoli. Then Israel flew there, crumbled everything into a fine vinaigrette. All five of the five long-range radar stations were destroyed. Ayatollah says: -Well, guys, give me more, because I need it, because they will fly again.- And the Russians are on such a normal split now: either for themselves or for their allies. But the Allies gave the Russians ammunition of scarce denominations, for example, 115 mm shells for T-62 tanks, which have a specific gun with such a strange caliber. British intelligence estimates that the adversary will exhaust its reserves of armored vehicles, meaning tanks and armored fighting vehicles, by the fall of 2025. Next, probably, cavalry, bicycles, what else could be there&#8230; We have already seen electric scooters. But we cannot yet talk about the fact that the Russian defense industry is on the verge of collapse. It still has considerable potential. Their much bigger problem is the lack of skilled labor. Also, these are problems with components, which are becoming more and more difficult to get. After all, the expert community and volunteers monitor what and where it comes from, and through diplomatic and not-so-diplomatic ways, partners are provided with data about it, and such schemes are cut off wherever they can be detected. Therefore, this is exactly what will restrain the Russian defense industry. They are now at their best. Because they should implement the fourth shift? Well, the day is not rubber. Switch to an eight-day work week? But they have already switched to a seven-day one. In the area of ​​the same Uralvagonzavod in Nizhny Tagil, in the 23rd year, they began to build a zone where it was supposed to concentrate specialists with technical skills, who are serving sentences for any articles. Probably in order to attract them to work at the tank factory. Therefore, they have already exhausted all the possibilities that the Russians have. There is no possibility to increase something. In particular, also in aviation: because they are already involving Belarusian specialists to restore the MiG-29. Therefore, I think that we will not see the collapse of the Russian defense industry, but we will see a certain stagnation. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/13/dali-mabut-kavaleriya-velosypedy-ekspert-pro-zapasy-vijskovoyi-tehniky-v-rf/	2024-11-12T21:01:44-08:00
-Cossacks- in the service of the Defense Forces of Ukraine: how they created the well-known armored ...	It is about the family of these BBMs, its history and development that the correspondent of ArmiyaInform talked with Andriy Kharuk, a well-known researcher of military equipment and armaments, doctor of historical sciences, professor of the Department of Humanities at the National Academy of Land Forces named after Hetman Petro Sahaydachny. — Andriy Ivanovych, in accordance with the distribution of machine-building production capacities in the former USSR, Ukrainian enterprises, in particular, manufactured formidable tanks and tractors, while the republic's car factories could only boast of rather clumsy -Zaporozhians- and -scary- Volynyankas. Therefore, during the collapse of the Union, our state did not inherit enterprises for the production of wheeled armored vehicles. Where did the -Cossack- genealogy begin? — If we recall the history of the company producing the current BBMs -Kozak-, the private joint-stock company -Praktika Scientific-Production Association- was founded in Kyiv in 1993. Initially, it was engaged in the production of civilian armored objects - bank safes and vaults, secure server rooms, etc. In 1998, the company mastered the production of collector armored cars, and ten years later tried to enter the market of military armored vehicles. — And what was the start of this enterprise in the defense market? — In 2009, -Praktyka- produced a prototype of an armored car on the Iveco Daily 55S18W all-wheel drive chassis. The machine, which received the name СРМ-1 -Козак-, had a welded body of MILUX steel armor (Finnish production) with four side doors and one aft. A 7.62-mm or 12.7-mm machine gun, or a 30- or 40-mm automatic grenade launcher could be installed on a manually operated turret on the roof of the hull. SRM-1 was relatively light - 5.5 tons. This indirectly indicates a not too high level of armored protection (armor thickness was only 5 mm, armored glass in the windows - 56 mm). Designers paid attention to mine protection: the passenger capsule has a double V-shaped bottom. Additional protection against the blast wave is provided by the batteries and the fuel tank located in the double floor. That -Kozak- was equipped with a four-cylinder Iveco F1C turbodiesel (3-liter displacement, 176 hp) and a six-speed ZF6S gearbox. The prototype was displayed at the Independence Day parade on August 24, 2009. The firm launched an extensive marketing campaign, showing -Cossack- at various exhibitions. Interest in the armored car was apparently shown by Nigeria, Pakistan and about a dozen other countries, but it was not possible to receive a single order. The low price did not help either - the company declared that the price of the SRM-1 in the basic version will be only 125 thousand dollars. Even cheaper should have been the version on the chassis of the GAZ-66 truck (with the replacement of the carburetor engine with a diesel one). - That is, at the prototype level, the activity of the manufacturing company in the field of defense then stopped? - Interest in the -Cossack- grew after the beginning of Russian aggression in 2014. On September 2, 2014, the prototype was demonstrated at the National Guard training ground in Novy Petrivtsy, Kyiv region, and on September 24-27, in Kyiv, at the exhibition -Weapons and Security - 2014-. However, in its current form, SRM-1 did not interest the military. In the end, the prototype -Cossack- was bought from the company by the US Embassy and handed over to the Ukrainian border guards on January 20, 2015. - However, a powerful enemy onslaught clearly cannot be stopped with one machine, let alone a prototype. How did events develop further? — The beginning of Russian aggression in 2014 became an incentive for many Ukrainian manufacturers to offer their products to the Defense Forces. However, SRM-1 did not suit the military. The main drawback of the first -Cossack- was insufficient protection, and it was not possible to strengthen it due to the weak chassis. So in 2014, when Praktiki specialists started designing a new armored car, they chose a heavier Iveco Eurocargo 150 E28 4×4 chassis (in the Iveco line, the Eurocargo family occupies an intermediate place between the light Daily cars and the heavy Stralis). The prototype, known as -Kozak-2014-, retained the general features of the SRM-1, but the use of a different chassis made it possible to strengthen the armored protection - it corresponds to level 2 according to the STANAG 4569 standard. The combat weight increased to 15 tons, but the dynamic characteristics did not deteriorate thanks to the diesel 250 hp engine Depending on the purpose of the car and the layout of the internal volume of the body, it can transport from 5 to 11 soldiers plus two crew members - a driver and a commander. — But this armored car, as far as is known, was only an intermediate option, right? — In the spring of 2015, a new version of the armored car appeared on the Iveco Eurocargo chassis — -Kozak-2-. It was distinguished by a significantly improved body, a six-cylinder Iveco Tector diesel engine with a working volume of 5.9 liters and a power of 279 hp. and a number of other improvements. The front suspension is an independent spring, the rear is a dependent spring. The armored body is welded from MILUX steel sheets. Italian anti-trauma seats with five-point seat belts are installed for the crew and landing party. The machine is equipped with a filter ventilation unit of Turkish production and a radio station of the Ternopil plant -Orizon-. Armament in the basic version was mounted in an open tower of the -crown- type. The first two copies of Kozak-2, shown on March 14, 2015, at the training ground in Novy Petrivtsi, were armed with 12.7-mm NSVT-12.7 machine guns. However, other weapons options were also allowed - a 7.62 mm machine gun or an automatic grenade launcher. And in May 2015, the Kozak-2, additionally armed with the Stugna-P ATGM, was demonstrated at the training ground of the 169th Desna training center. - And how did this BBM sample perform in field tests? - Tests of the Kozak-2 armored car were conducted simultaneously in the interests of the National Guard and the Armed Forces. In January-February 2016, the machine passed state tests at the training grounds of the State Scientific and Testing Center of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in Chernihiv, the training center of the National Guard of Ukraine in the village of Stare of the Kyiv region and on the basis of PJSC -NVO -Praktyka--. In particular, on February 17, one of the prototypes at the National Guard training ground underwent practical tests for anti-mine and anti-bullet resistance. A charge of TNT weighing 6 kg was detonated under the bottom of the cars, and the armored car was also fired at with a 5.45 mm AK-74 machine gun, a Dragunov sniper rifle, and a PKM machine gun (7.62 mm caliber). Although the armored car was damaged, the crew in a real battle would definitely survive in the event of such damage. These tests were the first in Ukraine to be conducted in accordance with the requirements of the STANAG 4569 standard. - So the -second- Kozak satisfied the military? was officially adopted by the National Guard of Ukraine under the designation SBA (specialized armored vehicle) -Kozak-001-. The Ministry of Defense was more scrupulous when making decisions: on November 3, 2016, Kozak-2 was admitted to operation during a special period (Order No. 588), and on March 21, 2017, it was taken for armament by Order No. 158. This document justified that -Kozak-2- is designed -for the transportation of personnel, samples of weapons, military cargo and property on all types of roads and terrain; conducting tactical operations such as patrolling; escorting vehicles during special tasks; transmission of orders and provision of communication; fire support of personnel in battle, as well as for the protection of the crew and cargo, personnel from the fire of small arms caliber 7.62 mm, fragments of ammunition and mines.- - And when was their serial production started? - The National Guard ordered the first 22 Kozak-2 armored cars in June 2015 - a year before the official acceptance for armament, and even before the completion of state tests. Obviously, the production of these machines was already underway, because the customer received the first ten of them already at the beginning of July. On February 11, 2016, the first six -Cossack-2- were handed over to the State Border Service of Ukraine. The Armed Forces of Ukraine received the first batch (ten Kozak-2 vehicles) in November 2017. At that time, the National Guard and the State Border Service already had more than 100 such armored vehicles. In August 2019, the general director of Praktika reported that more than 200 Kozak-2 armored vehicles have already been handed over to law enforcement agencies, and another batch of 40 vehicles is being prepared for handover. Another batch, which included more than 40 armored vehicles, was handed over in December 2020. — Regarding the Ministry of Defense: where did these BBMs come from? — In the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Kozak-2 armored vehicles were supplied primarily to units of the Airborne Forces - assault troops. For example, in March 2019, 33 such vehicles were transferred to the 13th separate airborne assault battalion of the 95th separate airborne assault brigade (Zhytomyr), and in December of the same year, Kozak-2 was delivered to the 81st separate airborne brigade (Kramatorsk). In December 2020, the 88th separate marine infantry battalion (Bolgrad) of the 35th separate marine infantry brigade received about 40 armored vehicles of this type, and in 2021, the 36th OBrMP also received such vehicles. Twelve -Cossacks-2- from this brigade took part in the parade in honor of Independence Day in Kyiv on August 24, 2021. The cost of Kozak-2 in 2017 was UAH 8.4 million, and for the contract concluded in December 2019, it reached UAH 9.28 million. This was explained by the increase in the minimum wage and the increase in energy prices. - If it's not a big secret, do you know how much special car data has been collected? Did they take part in the battles in the east of Ukraine? - The total number of Kozak-2 armored cars produced is not known for sure, but it can be estimated at about 300 units. In 2020, two of them were exported to Indonesia for testing, the rest are actively used by the Defense Forces of Ukraine. The National Guard tested its Kozak-2 vehicles in combat conditions in the area of ​​the anti-terrorist operation back in 2015. Later, the armored vehicles of the Armed Forces also visited the battle, in particular, in January 2020, 35 OBrMP vehicles arrived in the zone of operation of the United Forces. - But the most active and serious tests awaited these BBM already during the large-scale invasion of the Russian invaders - After the beginning of the large-scale Russian invasion, Kozak-2 armored vehicles are actively used in battles on all fronts. At the same time, as a result of the redistribution of Kozak-2 equipment, new units appeared in the arsenal - for example, in April 2023, two such armored vehicles were handed over to the 101st Territorial Defense Brigade. - However, even production vehicles need improvement. During operation, the military sees certain defects and expresses its wishes for modernization. And how was it, Professor, with this sample? — A significant drawback of the Kozak-2 armored car is the frame structure with the use of a civilian chassis (albeit with four-wheel drive). This limits the vehicle's ability to pass. Therefore, the next stage of the evolution of armored cars from their manufacturer was the creation of a car with a monocoque supporting body. This variant was called -Kozak-2M1-. It uses the same units (diesel engine, six-speed manual transmission) as on the Kozaku-2, but the undercarriage is completely redesigned. The suspension of all wheels became independent (its elements are supplied by a specialized company from the Czech Republic), and the ground clearance increased from 392 to 430 mm. At the same time, thanks to the rejection of the frame, the overall height of the car even decreased. -Kozak-2M1- differs from its predecessor in significantly better cross-country ability, smoother movement, higher speed of movement over rough terrain. The capacity of the armored car and armament correspond to the -Cossack-2-. The Kozak-2M1 prototype was first presented at the -Arms and Security-2016- exhibition in the fall of 2016. From October 2018 to July 2019, the machine underwent state tests, which were completed successfully. On April 3, 2020, by order of the Minister of Defense, the -Kozak-2M1- was adopted by the Armed Forces of Ukraine. It is classified as an -armored combat wheeled vehicle- - BBKM. — And what decision did the military leadership make regarding this vehicle? — In January 2020, there were reports of an intention to purchase 140 Kozak-2M1 armored vehicles for the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The Ministry of Defense has officially announced that starting in 2020, the purchase of Kozak-2 and Varta vehicles will be stopped, and Kozak-2M1 will be purchased instead. Public opinion -expressed dissatisfaction- with the significantly increased price, which amounted to 10.5 million UAH (above, we indicated that -Kozak-2- cost 9.28 million UAH; for comparison, we cite the prices of other armored vehicles: -Varta- - 6.9 million , Novator 8.1 million, Oncilla 8.3 million). However, as it seems to me, an explanation can be found: unlike the Kozak-2 and Varta, the Kozak-2M1 armored car does not use a civilian -militarized- chassis, but is a special military design with much higher performance characteristics. In November 2021, tests of the Kozak-2M1 armored car equipped with a remotely controlled Sarp Dual module (with 12.7 and 7.62 mm machine guns) produced by the Turkish company Aselsan were completed. However, serial machines were delivered with an old version of armament - a -crown- type turret. — That is, literally on the eve of the great war, these machines entered the troops. Where exactly? - December 6, 2021. The first batch of Kozak-2M1 armored vehicles - 44 armored vehicles - was handed over to the Armed Forces of Ukraine. 20 of them went to the 122nd separate battalion of the 81st OMBr, and the rest went to the Special Operations Forces: 14 to the 3rd Separate Special Purpose Regiment and 10 to the 73rd Naval Special Operations Center. Data on the supply of new batches of these machines after the start of the full-scale Russian invasion were, for obvious reasons, not published.

Various messengers, mail, posts on separatist pages (thank you, monkeys, who promptly sent all the screenshots and followed up, and who immediately understood that it was a fake). As we can see, this attempt was unsuccessful, but the level of it shows that they feel threatened by the very thought that we are here at the TOT and are doing non-violent resistance. We do not know what they wanted to achieve, scandal or discrediting of the Zla Mavka movement. But it's not interesting. We have to do our own thing,- they said on the official Telegram channel of the resistance movement. the Russians send similar messages to sow panic among Ukrainians, because in reality there are no plans for the mandatory mobilization of women into the ranks of the Armed Forces.

NATO Secretary General: Russia's cooperation with North Korea threatens not only Ukraine, but the wh...	He said this during his visit to Paris. -Russia continues its offensive against Ukraine, while at the same time getting closer to its allies China, Iran and North Korea,- Mark Rutte said. He added that Russia, working together with North Korea, Iran and China, threatens not only Europe, it threatens peace and security in Europe, as well as in the Indo-Pacific region and in North America-, -That is why we must stick together - Europe , North America and our global partners — to keep our peoples safe and prosperous. And at the same time, we must keep our transatlantic alliance strong. It is obvious that the immediate task before us is to support Ukraine,- said the NATO Secretary General. Mark Rutte said that after supplying ammunition and ballistic missiles, North Korea sent its troops to fight and die alongside Russia in its illegal war against Ukraine. -In return, Russia provides North Korea with funding and missile technology. This is of great concern. These missiles pose a direct threat to the continental United States, Europe, the Indo-Pacific region and the wider Euro-Atlantic,- he said.

- You will be either for the army or in the army. All. Otherwise we won't survive-: the story of a t...	— 2014 was a shock for everyone. I couldn't understand what was going on. I served and was discharged from the Soviet Army at the turn of the century, 1991-1993. Well, how is it: to find yourself with former comrades in the service on different sides of the barricades? This puzzle did not come together in my head. But time passed and I understood: there is no way back for us. We had perhaps the only chance in history to become a truly independent and integrated state. Because we had no way of dealing with the state. All this time we had small, as I call them, -states-: Khmelnytskyi, Hrushevskyi&#8230; Now I understand why, according to history, Khmelnytskyi was framed for us, and not Mazepa, considering him a traitor. Although in reality it was the other way around: it was Peter who betrayed Mazepa, not Mazepa Peter. Peter promised Mazepa a hetmanate and a separate state, but he did not fulfill his promise&#8230; Yes, I had volunteer friends. And then I strummed something for myself on the guitar. Well, they persuaded me to go. It was in 2016. I drove it once, drove it twice, and -got sick- of it myself. It's like in zombie movies: I was bitten by a wild volunteer - and became a volunteer myself (laughs - Author). At first, they carried some staples, banner film, and all kinds of things. Well, he sang, of course. And then there was the festival -Songs born in ATO-&#8230; — If we take the classic volunteer path, many of the volunteers during the ATO period themselves eventually joined the army for a contract. Didn't think about it then? - I thought. But I was not taken. They said it was old and no one needed it. Yes, I can't run long distances. But I won't run away at the same time (laughs - Author). Therefore, at that time, I only had to ride with songs and raise the fighting spirit. I didn't count how many concerts I did. I just collected chevrons and now I have over 400 of them. I was in some units several times, but I don't count it. All boys are heroes to me. I do not separate combat positions and non-combat positions. Here are the guys at the RAO warehouses. Someone has to ship shells or rockets for -hail-. They have hard labor. But they are often forgotten. Or cooks, drivers. A hungry paratrooper does not win for a long time. And the cook, in order to feed the paratroopers, has to wake up at 4 in the morning, heat up his stove and cook almost until night, regardless of whether something flies nearby or not. People are all wonderful. They just need to be reminded of it. Moral support is very important. People seem to straighten up after stress. Eyes burn again. They approach, thank - and that's it for an hour of the concert. There were units where things were difficult at first. The boys are depressed, depressed. There are commanders who consider it unnecessary to praise or encourage their soldiers. But this is wrong. A person should feel that he is respected, valued. So, along the way, the functions of the MPZ were also replaced somewhere. We drove exclusively on -zeros-. The main condition was that the combat unit had to be. There is enough entertainment in the rear even without us. We used to gather in dugouts, where the booths are 800 meters away. Now the war has moved to a new format - drones, cabs. It is not even possible to go out, not to sing songs. —Nevertheless, now you are a soldier of the Special Presidential Brigade. It's not so old and useless after all? - And it couldn't be any other way. You just do what you have to do. On February 20, 2022, he played a concert at the Docker G pub, returned to Vinnytsia, collected his -anxious suitcase-, documents and began to wait. I didn't know exactly when it would be, but I knew it would happen for sure. On the 24th, my friend helped to take the family to the private sector, and I went to the Public Health Service. Well, as a TrO — in fact, it turned out to be the DFTG under the mayor's command. We were expecting an attack from Moldova, from Transnistria, where Russian troops were. A reserve assault company was formed, somewhere around 60 men, half of whom had fought and half who had not. Those who did not have - took experience from veterans. They fired from automatic weapons, from machine guns, from grenade launchers. Weapons were taken from the TCC. They just came and took boxes. The time was such that everyone understood that we had better not refuse. And in about three months we were disbanded. We surrendered our weapons and went home. I tried to live a normal peaceful life for a while, I went to work. However, I understood - no, I can't. He went to Kyiv, joined the Presidential Brigade and went to the medical commission. - Why did they choose the Presidential Brigade? - Because they have an orchestra. The main thing that motivated me was that I should benefit the army, not be a pawn for it. I can raise the morale of the soldiers, earn money for the brigade, donate to its charity fund. Now the intensity and nature of hostilities is completely different. It is almost impossible for civilians to get to the front lines. And now I ride not just as Sanya Klets, but as a representative of the Special Presidential Brigade, a representative of the Honor Guard Orchestra. - And how did you manage to pass the medical board, if the brothers refused earlier? - The doctor initially refused to sign, saying that you are of limited fitness. I say, I have armor at all, I could sit at home, but I can't. I have to do something. The head of the VLK looked at me and said to the doctor: -Write what is suitable- (laughs - Author). — Has the repertoire changed now compared to the ATO times? — Yes. Of course. Became tougher. I began to hate the Russian woman. The whole If before there was hatred only for the military - for Debaltsevo, for Ilovaisk, then after Buchi, after Irpen, after the people in the wells, I hate them all. Together with civilians. Although I understand that it is better for the military to sing not about hatred, but about life and love, about the same fishing. So that they remember why they are here. That at home they are awaited and loved. The war will affect everyone. There will not be a single family in Ukraine without either a soldier or a volunteer. You will either be for the army or in the army. All. Otherwise, we will not survive. - And what songs are the most popular, the most popular? - -4.5.0- is a popular song. What in the time of ATO, what now. I don't know how many times I've sung it. It is about everything: about love, about war, about brothers. He himself prefers -Envelope- - -envelope in me, envelop yourself, as if there is no other in the world- (sings - Author)&#8230; I'm a lyricist at heart. Well, he recently wrote a lullaby for children. —How does a lyricist feel in the army? Don't you feel like you've been a little overheated? Because quite often we had to hear from creative people that they were -not born for war-, that the army is only for warriors, not for poets? - And no one is born for war. War is the opposite of human nature. However, what to do if we have such an annoying neighbor? For which we have no right to exist at all, as a state, as a nation? To obey and become like them? Should I choose my independence? Everyone should do what they can do. You can hold a weapon in your hands - keep it. Can't - help others hold. Now in the army, even in the rear, almost half of the positions are vacant. What, lyricists can't type on a computer? Reports can't type? At the same time, can't MPZ (moral and psychological support - Author) maintain fighting spirit? I got lucky with the crew. Good luck with the commanders. And the brigadier general, and the deputy brigadier general from the MPZ, and the head of the orchestra are all responsible people who do not care what is happening in the unit, who are focused on the development of the unit, and not on any personal career growth. That's why we always find a common language. Our brigade fights in battalions along the entire front line. The boys took part in the toughest competitions: Bakhmut, Klishchiivka, Avdiivka, Soledar, Vovchansk. Pride takes such people! And here's what I would like to say: guys! Don't wait for summons! Now there is an opportunity to mobilize without TCC directly into the brigade. So look for a department you trust, look for a position where you can handle the tasks and where you will be useful. Understand, the way things are going - everyone will fight. Someone to shoot, and someone to carry the cartridges. Now you have the opportunity to choose what you will do. However, when the summons comes, get to where there will be the greatest need for people. So act! This is the greatest challenge of our lives today. We are not fighting for power, not for some amorphous state. We fight to stay who we are.

The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine clarified the process of standard tests for weapons and equipment	About this wrote on the website of the Ministry of Defense. Type tests are an important stage in the process of evaluating the effectiveness of changes made to the design or production technology of serial products. They are conducted in order to assess the impact of changes on the technical and tactical operational characteristics of the product. Tests are carried out on samples of OVT, in the design or technology of which the proposed changes have already been made. The scope of such tests is determined by the program and methods developed by the manufacturer in accordance with DSTU B 15.211. Typical tests can be carried out both at the test bases of the manufacturers themselves, and at specialized testing organizations, such as the State Research Institute for Testing and Certification of Armaments and Military Equipment, or at enterprises with an appropriate test base. Test results are recorded in the form of an Act and protocols that reflect all test results. If the results confirm the effectiveness of the changes, they are included in the working design documentation in accordance with DSTU B 15.902. To register changes in the technical conditions for the OVT sample, it is necessary to contact the Main Directorate for Life Cycle Support of Weapons and Military Equipment via e-mail mdalc@mil .ua.

The shelling around 4:10 p.m. on November 11 was repeated, as a result of desyatky-budynkiv/->first strike with three UMPB D-30SN air bombs destroyed dozens of private houses in the city. According to the information of Kramatorsk of the City Council during the second shelling four hits occurred, about 30 buildings were damaged by the explosions. One casualty was reported, a 16-year-old boy who was treated. Correspondents of ArmiyaInform visited the place of the event. Several private estates at the sites of the explosions were almost completely destroyed. The power of the explosions is evidenced by fragments of bricks and glass scattered over dozens of meters, mutilated and burnt cars. -We heard four terrible explosions,- said a local resident. - This house was completely destroyed, and in all around us, the slate on the roofs was broken, the windows were broken. I hope they will help us with something to cover the destruction, give us materials. Utility workers, emergency crews of gas workers and electricians are already working at the sites of enemy strikes. They remove debris and construction debris, detect possible gas leaks, and fix broken power lines. One of the munitions hit the sports field in the yard of a local school. At the site of the explosion, there is a deep hole in the asphalt surface. The chemical stench of the explosives had already dissipated overnight, but was still noticeable. The school building was seriously damaged. The blast waves from the impacts from different sides of the school — in the private residential sector and on the sports field — were of such force that they not only broke the windows, but also tore out the glass panes from the windows and bent the front doors. School staff, teachers and parents have already gathered to help clear the debris and temporarily cover windows. -The school is in a village, the school is beautiful - walk through the classrooms and see for yourself,- says Olena Kushnyrenko, who acts as the school's director. Bright, tidy classrooms with recent repairs, new furniture and educational equipment, numerous books testify to the teacher's words. At the time of the explosions, only the person on duty was in the school. Fortunately, the teachers had already left at that moment. - There was nothing and no one here. -There were no soldiers at the school or near us,- says the woman. — I don't see a motive, I don't see any reason either. It is noticeable how she and her colleagues are hurting because of the destruction. She talks about the school as her own home - dignity, just as a local resident talked about her own dilapidated house. While we are talking, a few more people come up to us, say hello and get to work. After a rough night of shelling, they all face a long, hard day of rescuing a ruined building.

Two Ukrainian prisoners of war were killed by Russians: details of the crime	This was reported by the Coordinating Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War. Crimes against Ukrainian prisoners have become regular: almost every week there are new reports of murders committed by the Russian military. Such actions are a gross violation of international humanitarian law and qualify as war crimes that do not have a statute of limitations. Modern means of surveillance make it possible to document these crimes and identify the perpetrators. All collected evidence, including statements of released prisoners, video recordings and radio intercepts, is handed over to the Security Service of Ukraine, the National Police and the Prosecutor General's Office for investigation and prosecution. The coordination headquarters also emphasized that orders to kill Ukrainian prisoners are given by commanders, who thus endanger the lives of their own subordinates, because they are afraid to surrender, realizing the consequences of their actions. All cases of war crimes are thoroughly investigated, and criminals will be punished in accordance with international and Ukrainian law. As reported by ArmiyaInform, on November 11, during the monitoring of information in social networks a publication with a video recording of the alleged shooting of two unarmed Ukrainian servicemen by representatives of the Soviet Union of the Russian Federation in the Kursk direction was discovered.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/12/dvoye-ukrayinskyh-vijskovopolonenyh-ubyti-rosiyanamy-podrobyczi-zlochynu/	2024-11-12T01:18:52-08:00

The main targets of the enemy were the headquarters, fortified areas and firing positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the front zone. As the investigation established, the adjuster turned out to be a local unemployed man who was -noticed- by the FSB because of his pro-Kremlin comments on Russian Telegram channels.

For each -merged- location of the Defense Forces, the occupiers promised a monetary reward, but the agent never received the enemy's funds.

The training ground spread across the boundless steppe, illuminated by the golden glow of the morning sun, glistening with the pinkness of the grass. The feeling of being in a fairy tale... But this fairy tale quickly ends when a giant car drives up with a roar, the military installs equipment on the muzzle, sets up a box of shells and one by one begins to look into the device, exclaiming crew teams. After the exercise is completed, the tank fires several shots. Andriy is in charge of the entire process. Andriy explains that the boys are currently engaged in calibration and firing of shells. The fact is that Ukraine receives various ammunition from its partners, each EU country has its own factories. Each country has its own gunpowder, its own shell, its own metal quality, ballistics are different. —Unfortunately, a batch of ammunition does not always come with the appropriate documents, so calibration and firing is a mandatory procedure in order to clearly target the enemy during a combat mission, he notes. - Also, each cannon has its own shot. The more the cannon fire, the greater the error. And that is why we are now using practical shooting to reveal the size of this error. Look, now they were shooting at a target - a circle with a diameter of 30 cm, from a distance of one and a half kilometers. Two shots with armor-piercing projectiles were clearly hit, this was confirmed by our drones that monitor the work. Although these are shells manufactured in the 80s, the quality is impressive! According to Andriy, it is important to coordinate crews so that everyone knows what and how to do in certain combat conditions. — And it's not the way we were taught in Europe. The instructors there are theorists, most of whom have no idea of ​​real combat, especially in our conditions. They say: you should come to the training ground, check from right to left, the targets should clearly be 90 degrees, level. And we are in hostilities, we don't have that. Therefore, we should listen to their advice and at the same time learn and develop on our own, - he explains. This crew, which was the first to work on the training ground today, has to its credit destroyed enemy BMPs, and literally a week ago it eliminated an enemy tank. In addition, the tankers also work on foot, that is, they come and dismantle dugouts from 10-15 meters up close. — The main job of a tank is to destroy the enemy, the enemy can be different. We have a trump card on these tanks: speed and accuracy, the tankers explain. Andrii's call sign is -Marine-, because he actually started in the marines. At one time, he served his military service, then, during the anti-terrorist operation/OOS, he got into the sixth wave, served for a year and three months, and was a marine in an amphibious assault company. — At the beginning of the large-scale invasion in 2022, he got into the 95th Battalion of the Reserve Corps, and there were only conscripts there. There is a war going on in the country, and they have a temporary war there. You get up in the morning, and there the curbs in the yard are white. We wanted to fight, defend our country, decided to move. Then the combatant says: -Do you want to transfer? Everything, no questions asked.- Only me and my godfather were transferred to tankers. I rode a tank only while participating in anti-terrorist operations. And yes, cleanly on the training ground and just ride on the armor. They translated, and my first thought was: -But where did I end up?-. Well, that is, with my dimensions in the T-72 tank, I did not understand where I was and what I was doing. But our combatant with the call sign -Philosopher- was very good at motivating people, - recalls -Marine-. Later, together with his comrades, he took a direct part in the counteroffensive in the Kherson region, then he got to Donbas, and in the winter of 2023, the crews went to master Leopard tanks. — One group studied in Poland, and I was part of the second, which was studying in Spain. After the exercises, they returned to their 4th tank brigade. Then we were transferred to the newly created 33rd mechanized brigade, specifically to the Leopard, on which we trained. And already during the formation of the brigade, equipment came to us little by little, - says Andriy. According to Andriy, the Russians now keep their more modern tanks, and mostly work with them from afar: they arrived, fired and quickly retreated. — Enemy tanks enter such a sector that it is impractical for us to go to them, so as not to reveal our positions. Because as soon as we start working, -Krasnopoli-, -Lancets- fly out, looking for us. While we were talking here, a -Krasnopol- (radio-controlled projectile of the Russian army. — Ed.) flew over the tank. Thank God, everything is fine, the crew was just leaving, then the projectile just flew by. Because it works only on stationary targets, at a distance of up to 30–40 kilometers, says the tanker. He characterizes the intensity of modern combat as follows: when crews were working under Robotyn (Zaporizhia region), then they were fully loaded - 42 shells. The tank fired these shells in one night and came to the neighboring crews for shells in order to continue working. There were times when 60 shells were fired per battle. The tank of diesel fuel was regularly -left- during the night, and this is more than a ton of fuel. — There was a case that the tank was hit. Well, guys, everyone is alive and well. The difference is that when something hits the Leopard, it is almost impossible to destroy this tank with one shot. Previously, when we did not have active armor, all the destruction was carried out by the enemy anti-tank missile -Kornet-. This is a powerful system. But we started to develop, to change something. And if you hit a Russian car, that's it. My crew destroyed two Russian tanks with three shots. First we hit, stopped the tank, 5–seconds — and the second shot, its turret flies up, and in 15 seconds the second tank leaves. We destroy him with the first shot! In Leopard, there is no such thing as a collapsing tower. There is a problem if they are fired with thermobaric projectiles. But everything is done for the survival of the crew: the tank has a titanium plate that separates the crew from the ammunition, - explains Andriy. With a smile, he adds that you get used to good things quickly. - I I worked first on the T-72, and then the Leopard came, so I say that I will not get into a Soviet tank again. And although I don't have a combat position now, I manage the battle, command the tanks, instruct where to work, from where, at what distance, directions. But if you have to return, then only on Leopard. Just so you understand, it is very difficult to destroy a Leopard. It can be damaged, it will be stopped, it will stand. And then it starts: FPV drones, drops, thermobaric ammunition. We have one tank that was hit by all the FPV drones. We then chased him away, he is currently being repaired and will be restored, says the tanker driver. In the conversation, Andriy also tells how he was injured. Then the task of his crew was to stop the enemy armored group. — We rolled out at the expense of speed and accuracy, fired three shots, destroyed two Russian tanks, began to roll back, and an ATGM came to us. I don't remember how it happened, I was unconscious for some time. Then he came to his senses, we evacuated the tank, quickly got out of it. It turned out that the chargers were also wounded. But all survived, thank God, are already healthy, everything is fine. I underwent rehabilitation at home, in Rivne. I have a wife and two sons there: the eldest is 5 years old, the youngest is 3 months old...

Firepower, mobility and protection: the Australians adopted a new howitzer that fires at 60 km	As stated the authors of the publication Defense Connect, Australia will acquire a fleet of 42 AS9 Huntsman and AS10 armored vehicles for the supply of ammunition, which will be built at the Hanwha Defense Australia plant, ArmyInform reports. This is a modern Australian-made self-propelled howitzer, which is based on the South Korean K9 Thunder system, about which ArmyInform already told in one of her publications. This defense original system was developed specifically for Australia based on the Hanwha K9 howitzer, which is currently in service with the artillery forces of South Korea, India, Norway, Poland, Finland, Turkey and Estonia. The Huntsman is equipped with a 155 mm 52 caliber gun, which is in service with many countries and is compatible with all standard NATO-standard 155 mm ammunition. The main purpose of the Australians' adoption of this artillery installation is to provide highly mobile fire support capable of delivering precision strikes at long ranges while maintaining a high level of crew protection and to replace obsolete towed artillery systems General tactical and technical characteristics of the AS9 Huntsman: AS9 Artillery System The Huntsman is equipped with a powerful 155mm cannon capable of firing both conventional and guided projectiles. As inform experts of the defense portal Army Recognition, this weapon provides an effective firing range of up to 40 km using standard ammunition and more than 60 km when using guided projectiles with a rocket engine. The main characteristics of the AS9 Huntsman 155 mm gun: Thanks to its powerful diesel engine and modern suspension, the AS9 Huntsman has excellent cross-country characteristics. This allows the artillery unit to quickly occupy new firing positions and avoid enemy counter-battery fire. The AS9 is equipped with a semi-automatic loading system, which significantly increases the rate of fire, especially during long artillery operations. The machine is equipped with an active protection system and modular armor, which makes it resistant to mortar fire and anti-tank hits. The fire control system is integrated with the GPS and inertial navigation system, which allows for high-precision firing of targets at long distances. In addition, the installation supports network capabilities to coordinate fire with other artillery and infantry units. The AS9 Huntsman is designed to support troops on the battlefield by suppressing enemy artillery, destroying fortified positions and neutralizing enemy fire points. Due to its high mobility and the ability to quickly change positions, the Huntsman can operate in dynamic combat conditions. The Australian howitzer AS9 Huntsman is a modern and technologically advanced self-propelled installation that combines high firepower, mobility and protection. It is ideal for modern combat conditions, providing artillery support with high accuracy and efficiency. Due to its design and capabilities, this system has an important place in Australia's arsenal and may be of interest to other countries looking for effective artillery support.

Fake Telegram bot in action: residents of Sumy are campaigning to evacuate dogs due to the threat of...	On behalf of the Sumy Regional Military Administration and enterprises, institutions and organizations, a fake letter is sent with a request for help to military units. In social networks, information is being spread that Ukrainian volunteers allegedly tried to transport -almost one hundred kilograms of heavy drugs-, which were intended for the 82nd brigade of the Armed Forces. At the same time, residents of Sumy are offered to report stray dogs in a false Telegram bot, ostensibly to evacuate them due to the threat of the arrival of soldiers from the DPRK. the Russians create such fakes to sow panic among the residents of the region, to make them believe that the Ukrainian authorities alone cannot cope with the provision of the Armed Forces forces So that the Ukrainians were afraid that the North Koreans were participating in the war on the side of Russia and agreed to Russia's negotiating terms. Also to discredit the Defense Forces of Ukraine in the eyes of international partners and reduce international support for our state. And the Sumy region is the focus of attention of propagandists precisely because it borders Kursk. The fact that the Armed Forces have been keeping part of the Russian territory under their control for more than three months is very annoying to the Kremlin dictator. The enemy wants to destabilize the situation in Sumy Oblast in order to return Kursh Oblast as soon as possible.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/12/falshyvyj-telegram-bot-v-diyi-sumchan-agituyut-evakuyuvaty-sobak-cherez-zagrozu-prybuttya-soldativ-z-kndr/	2024-11-11T20:11:23-08:00
-The enemy sneaks in from all cracks-: the Russians stepped up in the Lyman direction	Maksym Bilousov, head of the communications department of the 60th OMBr, told about this on Army TV . -And it just sneaks into our positions from all the cracks. -They began to bombard us with anti-aircraft guns almost every day, enemy artillery and drones are also working,- he said. Maksym Bilousov suggested that the Russians were probably given the task of achieving a certain goal by a certain date. -What's more, I noticed from the video that quite educated people showed up. But receiving injuries, they began to commit suicide more often. This may indicate that the attitude towards them there is such that they understand that even the wounded will go on an assault later,- he said. The spokesman added that Russian equipment attacks very infrequently, maybe once every two weeks, and this is usually the case for foot assaults without mechanized support. According to the information of the General Staff of the Armed Forces, in the Lyman direction seven combat clashes took place near Grekivka, Nevsky, Terni and Serebryanka. Until now, one battle is ongoing in this direction. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/11/vorog-sune-z-usih-shhilyn-rosiyany-aktyvizuvalysya-na-lymanskomu-napryamku/	2024-11-11T11:57:04-08:00
The Defense Forces explained why the enemy uses a minimum of equipment in the Pokrovsky direction	This was reported by a representative of the public relations service on Army TV Serhiy Okishev of the 25th OPDBr. -The enemy does not stop trying to seize our positions, but the paratroopers stand firmly on their lines and repel any attempts of assaults. Our gunners and UAV operators hit all of this on the sly, so now the enemy uses a minimum of equipment, because he knows that it will not reach,- Serhii Okishev said. The spokesman added that the Russians make isolated attempts to land their infantry directly on the positions, but each time it ends fatally for them. -For the most part, they disembark the infantry earlier and they are already moving on foot in small groups,- he explained. As reported by ArmyInform, the enemy's activity is currently high /->stored in the Pokrovsky direction. Clashes of varying intensity started 14 times today. Currently, the battle is ongoing in the Selidovoy region. 13 attacks were repelled near Myrolyubivka, Promeny, Hryhorivka, and Lysivka.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/11/u-sylah-oborony-poyasnyly-chomu-vorog-vykorystovuye-minimum-tehniky-na-pokrovskomu-napryamku/	2024-11-11T11:33:41-08:00
Rustem Umyerov told the EU delegation about the possibilities of Ukrainian production of UAVs	This was notified in the MoU. -I highly appreciate Mr. Borrell's personal contribution to the diplomatic, economic and military support of Ukraine. As a sign of gratitude for these efforts, which strengthened our defense capabilities, he was awarded the -Cross of Honor,- Rustem Umyerov said. The European Union has already provided Ukraine with military aid in the amount of 44 billion euros and intends to continue increasing its support. One of the most effective steps to help our defenders is investing in the Ukrainian defense industry. Rustem Umyerov told the EU delegation about the possibilities of Ukrainian production of drones, which is currently estimated at $11 billion. Of this, Ukraine can invest about $3 billion on its own, but for the maximum development of our potential, financial support from partners is needed. -We hope that a significant part of the next tranche of frozen Russian assets will be aimed at strengthening our defense-industrial complex. I am deeply grateful to the European Union for its leadership and support in many areas. I believe that our joint efforts will help overcome all challenges on the way to peace in Ukraine and Europe,- said Rustem Umyerov.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/11/rustem-umyerov-rozpoviv-delegacziyi-yes-pro-mozhlyvosti-ukrayinskogo-vyrobnycztva-bpla/	2024-11-11T11:16:05-08:00

On the way to NATO: Ukrainian officers were invited to associate membership in CIOR	About this reported in the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. The corresponding proposal was made during a meeting between the Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine, Brigadier General of Justice Serhiy Melnyk, and the person responsible for interaction with the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine on behalf of the President of CIOR Toomas Luman. In particular, Toomas Luman invited the Ukrainian side to attend the organization's winter summit and suggested that Ukraine consider the issue of associate membership in the organization. The parties also discussed the issue of involving reserve officers from NATO countries in the training of Ukrainian servicemen in demining and repairing Western military equipment. For its part, CIOR is ready to involve Ukrainian officers in training courses organized by the organization's language academy. This will give our servicemen the opportunity to improve their qualifications in accordance with NATO standards. -It is a great honor for us to host you in Ukraine. Thank you for the offer to train Ukrainian officers who will be able to improve their qualifications in accordance with NATO requirements. Such joint projects must have a successful end result,- emphasized Serhiy Melnyk.

President: Defense Forces of Ukraine are restraining 50,000 Russian troops in Kurshchyna	About this he said in the evening address. -The front, first of all, is our Kurakhiv direction, other directions are also in Donetsk region,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. There was also a report on the Kursk operation, where the Defense Forces of Ukraine restrained a fairly significant group of Russian troops — 50,000 personnel of the occupying army, who, thanks to the Kursk operation, cannot be directed to other directions of Russian attacks on our territory. -We greatly appreciate the bravery of all our soldiers, every unit involved in these battles,- the President emphasized. The head of state also noted all our forces that strike at Russian bases, logistics, and rear areas. He emphasized that the strikes of our forces on Russian arsenals reduced the amount of artillery used by the occupier, and this is noticeable at the front. -That is why we need far-reaching solutions from our partners - from America, from Britain, from Germany; this is what is vitally necessary. The further our missiles and our drones can hit, the less real combat power Russia will have,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy said.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/11/prezydent-syly-oborony-ukrayiny-strymuyut-50-tysyach-rosijskyh-vijsk-na-kurshhyni/	2024-11-11T10:22:11-08:00

The EU reported how many shells were transferred to Ukraine this year	About this in interview - To the European truth,- said EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell. -We have already delivered more than 980,000 shells, and very soon we will hand over 1 million shells. I know that we made a commitment to reach this level by spring - and we failed. But we will be able to by the end of the year. And for this, we have accelerated significantly,- said Josep Borrell. He noted that, in addition, many ammunitions were delivered to Ukraine under bilateral agreements with member countries, as well as within the framework of the Czech initiative. -In general, by the end of the year, we will deliver more than 1.5 million rounds of ammunition to Ukraine,- said the head of EU diplomacy. Josep Borrell also assured that the European Union is doing everything possible to continue supplying Ukraine with the same amount of ammunition next year. -The problem was not in transferring what was available, but in production. When we promised to reach the level of 1 million shells per year by the spring, we did not know what the real production capacity was, and it was not as large as we thought. Now we already have this production capacity,- he explained.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/11/v-yes-povidomyly-skilky-snaryadiv-peredaly-ukrayini-czogo-roku/	2024-11-11T09:32:42-08:00
How important are Liptsi for Kharkiv: the Armed Forces spoke about the importance of controlling the...	Control over the village would not only open the way for the invaders to Kharkiv, but would also allow them to shell the city with barrel artillery. About the situation in the Lipetsk section of the Kharkiv direction on the broadcast of the telethon -Suspilne Novosti- the deputy commander of the shock battalion of the BPAK spoke -Achilles- of the 92nd separate assault brigade named after Kosh Ataman Ivan Sirko Oles Malyarevich. — At the beginning of May 24, the enemy wanted to reach Liptsi and move on. This is the shortest way to Kharkiv, he said. The military said what is the importance of control over this settlement for the security of Kharkiv. — If they pass through Liptsi, they receive artillery fire from barrel artillery, which is regular in the city of Kharkiv. This cannot be allowed, because if the city can be affected by conventional barrel artillery, this city will hardly be able to live fully, because it will be a constant shelling, the officer explained. However, despite the fact that the enemy then managed to break through the border, reach and gain a secure foothold in Liptsi, the invaders were not allowed by the Defense Forces, so the invaders' plans were not implemented. — Their task was not accomplished. The situation was stabilized there, the enemy was stopped, destroyed, pushed back. They reached Liptsi a little on the outskirts at the beginning of May, but they were all eliminated, Oles Malyarevich reported. Currently, the line of combat in the Lipetsk section has been stabilized, and the initiative in this section of the Kharkiv direction is entirely on the side of the units of the Defense Forces. — The front line is now passing in the Hlybokoye region. The village of Hlyboke is more north of Liptsi, about 8 kilometers from the border, they are currently located, the military said. Now the drones of the -Achilles- assault air defense battalion of the 92nd separate assault brigade named after the basket commander Ivan Sirk continue to work also on the Lipetsk sector of the front. — The situation there has been quite stable for a long time. The enemy is trying to maneuver, pull up reserves, conduct reconnaissance. Our task there is to identify any movements of the enemy, logistical chains and destroy them so that the situation remains stable and the enemy does not have the opportunity to break through our defenses, said the deputy commander of the Achilles battalion. Earlier, ArmyInform reported, when the Russians postponed their desire to capture Kupyansk.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/11/chym-vazhlyvi-lypczi-dlya-harkova-v-zsu-rozpovily-pro-znachennya-kontrolyu-nad-selom/	2024-11-11T09:19:28-08:00
An investigation has been launched into the alleged shooting of Ukrainian soldiers in Kurshchyna	This was reported by the Prosecutor General's Office. A pre-trial investigation has been launched into the fact of violation of the laws and customs of war, combined with intentional murder (Part 2 of Article 438 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine). Deliberate killing of prisoners of war is a gross violation of the Geneva Conventions and is classified as a grave international crime. As part of criminal proceedings, primary investigative (research) actions are carried out, aimed at establishing the circumstances of the event in order to bring the culprits to justice. The pre-trial investigation is conducted by the Security Service of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/11/rozpochato-rozsliduvannya-za-faktom-jmovirnogo-rozstrilu-ukrayinskyh-vijskovyh-na-kurshhyni/	2024-11-11T09:03:54-08:00

In two days, our paratroopers destroyed 28 units of enemy equipment and more than 100 occupiers, another 100 were injured. A separate mechanized brigade successfully eliminated the Russians in Kurshchyna and 47. Two Bradley crews mowed down the landing in which the enemy landed. The occupiers managed to knock out our infantry vehicles with a grenade launcher and FPV, but the Bradleys continued to move, successfully landed the infantry and returned to our positions. A rocket flies towards the Pskov paratroopers. The occupiers gathered together with military equipment in a forest plantation in the Zaporizhzhia region and were preparing for an offensive. the Russians were discovered by the GUR fighters of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, and the fighters of the -Tavria- anti-aircraft missile defense system fired a rocket with a cluster charge at them. After the arrival, two heavy Russian trawlers and personnel were destroyed. Four more armored personnel carriers with the Pskov landing force tried to escape, but soon they were also attacked. These and other topics are discussed by our presenters - lieutenant colonel Serhii Misyura and captain Artem Golub.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/11/raketoyu-po-desantu-voroga-bredli-vykoshuye-posadku-robota-madyara-strim-iz-pryfrontovogo-mista/	2024-11-11T08:56:44-08:00
Constant duty and -window of opportunity-: how drones work in the Kupyan direction	About this on the air of the -Suspilne Novosti- telethon told the deputy commander of the 92nd separate -Achilles- air defense battalion Oles Malyarevich of the assault brigade named after Ivan Sirko, the head of the basket. — Most of the unit is working in Kupyansk now. The situation there is much more dynamic and hot. You can see that the enemy has squeezed into the left bank of the Oskol River in the Kruglyakivka area and is now trying to move north and south [along] the Oskol River in order to completely seize the left bank, he said. The current task of the Defense Forces is to prevent the occupation of the left bank of Oskol by the occupiers and to inflict maximum losses on the enemy. In their turn, the occupiers strike in the direction of the positions of the units of the Defense Forces with anti-aircraft guns, artillery, drones and launch infantry assaults. — They use the full spectrum, but the emphasis is usually on guided air bombs, artillery and infantry assaults. Sometimes such armored breakthroughs happen - it happens very powerfully once every 10 days, but the equipment does not survive for a long time, because the air from our side is very saturated with drones - The cheapest resource of the occupiers, according to the military, is their manpower. Unmanned aerial vehicles of various types significantly help destroy the enemy, despite worsening weather conditions. Oles Malyarevich said that Ukrainian drones help the infantry as much as possible, using the smallest window of opportunity: - UAV forces are developing and have priority both for us and for them. These are full spectrums - reconnaissance, bombers, night, FPV, reconnaissance wings, and kamikaze wings. The weather does have an effect, but our calculations are constantly in positions, they don't have someone to look at the weather and they don't go out Constantly on duty, if there is an hour or two somewhere, a window where you can fly and do your work - we do it. Because without air cover, without the support of infantry drones, it is very difficult to hold a defensive line. We understand this and carry out combat tasks to destroy the enemy, and reconnaissance, and we also actively deliver humanitarian cargo every night for our infantry, for our units that are on the ground, we provide them with all the necessary drones. Earlier, ArmyInform reported, when the Russians postponed their desire to capture Kupyansk.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/11/postijne-cherguvannya-ta-vikna-mozhlyvostej-yak-praczyuyut-dronari-na-kupyanskomu-napryamku/	2024-11-11T08:42:32-08:00

Minus three illegal schemes: MSEK officials and VLK doctors are among the detainees	This was informed in the SBU. Among those detained are officials of medical and social expert commissions and hospitals. For bribes from 2 to 10 thousand US dollars, they helped conscripts avoid the draft on the basis of fictitious medical reports. In Kropyvnytskyi, a surgeon, a member of the VLK, was arrested red-handed when he received a bribe for groundlessly declaring a conscript unfit for service. In the Dnipropetrovsk region, the head of the department of a local hospital was exposed, who took bribes for the diagnosis of serious diseases from close relatives of conscripts.

They didn't manage until November: when the Russians postponed their desire to seize Kupyansk	About the real situation in the Kupyansk direction on the air of the -Espresso- TV channel, told the deputy commander of the BPAK shock battalion -Achilles- of the 92nd separate assault brigade named after Kosh Ataman Ivan Sirko Oles Malyarevich. — In the Kupyan direction, the situation is changing very dynamically, it is tense. Attacks and assaults by the occupiers are constantly taking place. From our side, separate operations are taking place to restore the condition and conditions, he said. The military commented on the situation, drawing attention to the map. - You see on the map how they rested on the left bank of the Oskil River and they had long planned to completely capture it. At the moment, the fighting is going on, if you look at this ridge, north of Kolisnykyvka, the enemy is trying to go there and capture it, the officer explained. However, the enemy does not succeed. - On the left bank on our side there are sufficiently powerful forces and they are doing everything to ensure that they do not spread either down or up there. The task of holding the left bank, the task of preventing the capture of Kupyansk and Kupyansk-Vuzlovoi. The city lives and is holding on, the deputy commander of the drones emphasized. Oles Malyarevich commented on the statements of Russian propagandists about the encirclement of units of the Defense Forces in the Kupyan direction. — We were in danger of losing the possibility of evacuating our settlement. [However], all issues regarding this have been resolved. I will not say how, but we have worked out several protocols in case the situation develops in any direction. So we're holding on to each of our soldiers, protecting our lives and our health, and doing everything we can to keep our work there and our personnel alive. That is, there is no encirclement of our troops, Malyarevich stated. The occupiers did not cope with the task of capturing Kupyansk by the beginning of November, and now they have moved the date of occupation of the right-bank Kupyansk to the New Year. -From the interceptions that we have, and we are constantly conducting reconnaissance, they set themselves the task of capturing even the right-bank Kupyansk by the New Year,- said the military officer. At the same time, in his opinion, the tactics of the enemy will remain unchanged. — If we talk about the Kupyan direction, then on our side it is the Oskil River, on their side it is quite large open spaces along which they move. Tactics will not change, it will be live assaults, it will be sometimes armored breakthroughs, as they did a couple of times, and everything was destroyed on their side, the officer predicted. Oles Malyarevich assumed that the occupiers' tactics will remain unchanged: - They have no options but to attack with infantry. But they are actively working with aviation, they are destroying literally the entire Left Bank - not a single house, not a single building, like theirs in Avdiivka, the whole of Vovchansk. And on the Right Bank it has already been completely transferred from the destroyed Kupyansk, Sinkovo ​​- these are the settlements on the right bank immediately beyond the river. So artillery shelling, air shelling, and -meat- assaults, as they are called, not counting casualties. These are the conditions in which we are working now. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that the Russians are trained better, but go to inevitable death just the same.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/11/do-lystopada-ne-vporalys-na-koly-rosiyany-vidterminuvaly-zabaganku-zahopyty-kupyansk/	2024-11-11T07:28:36-08:00

-Fatality-: Russians are better trained, but they go to inevitable death in the same way	About this on the air of the TV channel -Espresso- told the deputy commander of the battalion of shock air defense systems -Achilles- of the 92nd separate assault Oles Malyarevich of the brigade named after the head of the basket Ivan Sirko. — They have now reached 35 thousand mobilized and 25–30 thousand lost -200-–-300- per month. They support these balances. In order to somehow even them out, they brought in more North Korean soldiers, who are mostly used for the second line, he said. The Koreans, he said, can most likely play a supporting role as additional forces so that the Russian command can throw as many of its own soldiers as possible to the front. — I heard that they were engaged in battle somewhere, so we are also waiting in our direction. If they appear, then there will be information immediately, while there is no information, the military said. The Russians are immediately preparing their own soldiers to be sent to the front. -Because they have trained all of their own people who were mobilized - go ahead,- the officer emphasized. According to him, the enemy fighters are trained and equipped better than before, but this does not help them and the tactics of the occupiers remain unchanged - -meat- assaults. — They teach well enough, better than it was a year and a half ago. That is, they are progressing in this aspect, both in terms of military training and technical support. There is no such thing as an inexplicably running [enemy soldier] with a machine gun in some kind of helmet. Their soldiers are fully equipped, although sometimes they fight for a day and a half, no more, - noted Oles Malyarevich. The military man explained that he controls the enemy soldiers: - First of all, they are driven not only by some conditional patriotism, but also by fear. Because if the whole platoon goes forward, and a few turn back, they will be shot. They have -departments-, they really work. At least - to prison, and it is not known what will happen to him there. So they move forward, I think, mostly out of fear. Secondly, indeed, their propaganda worked in such a way that they believe that there are demons on our side, fascists who must be destroyed, and there is a place for heroism. They are determined that in the next life they will be saints there, probably if they destroy at least one Ukrainian there. Earlier, ArmyInform explained why suicide assaults will become more and more difficult for the enemy.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/11/fataliti-rosiyany-navcheni-krashhe-ale-bizhat-na-smert-tak-samo/	2024-11-11T06:37:58-08:00

The morning scares of the dictator of the Russian Federation did not lead to a volley: a signal to T...	How special were these air maneuvers of the enemy and how it is related to the big world politics, said military expert Petro Chernyk: -A large missile salvo with the use of enemy strategic aircraft Tu-95MS and Tu-22M3 was in August. Since that time, the Russians have accumulated a large combat potential. And here is a very strange moment today: 13 missile carriers and several MiG-31Ks, which are carriers of the Kh-47M2 -Kinjal-, took off - but there was no big volley. This is all tied up in big geopolitics. Trump won the presidential election in America, and Putin is giving him a signal that he may not launch missile strikes on Ukraine, but it is necessary to sit down at the negotiating table and look for some points of contact to freeze the front line in the form in which it is. Did Trump hear this signal?.. Because there is an opinion - I am not a supporter of it, by the way - that allegedly Trump already called Putin. Why I think it didn't happen: Americans don't have the habit of making any very serious decisions before the president takes office. And he will do it only on January 20. So, for the moment, we have pure geopolitics, which has not been implemented into a military tool. I repeat for the second time: this is a signal to Trump. But there is a certain danger here. Nevertheless, Putin believes that it is possible to agree on something with Trump...-.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/11/rankovi-lyakalky-dyktatora-rf-do-zalpu-ne-pryzvely-sygnal-trampu-chy-gra-myazamy-dumka-eksperta/	2024-11-11T06:21:07-08:00
-Zombie-attacks- and -Zelenka-: why suicide assaults will be more and more difficult for the enemy	However, soon the situation will change not in their favor, because the leaves have almost fallen and it will be almost impossible to take shelter under the trees in the plantations. About this on the air of the TV channel -Espresso- told the deputy commander of the battalion of shock air defense systems -Achilles- of the 92nd separate assault Oles Malyarevich of the brigade named after the head of the basket Ivan Sirko. - They continue not to count with [losses] in manpower - they run forward, die and their next soldiers, who run along these same paths, run between their wounded and killed and do not even take them away, run further, - he said. The officer explained the danger of such suicidal enemy attacks. — That is, such -zombie attacks- take place on the part of the occupier, but it is very effective and dangerous, because the occupier, who does not value his own life and also runs with machine guns and grenade launchers, is sometimes a problem to destroy him, to find him, because they crawl through all the basements, burrows, landings, - he explained. However, with the change of season, it will become more difficult for the Russians to storm, because natural shelters will significantly decrease. - However, now the leaves will fall, it will be a little easier, but it will be more difficult for the infantry, because they will be visible even in landings. Earlier, he ran into the landing — and that’s it, he disappeared, because we can’t destroy the entire landing with drones, — noted Oles Malyarevich.

Chemical weapons or ammunition with poisonous substances: the Armed Forces explained the difference	About whether it is correct to call them chemical weapons in an interview with ArmiyaInform the spokesman of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine told Captain Dmytro Lykhoviy: — This is, in particular, about the enemy's use of hand-held gas grenades of the K-51 and RG-VO types, which are means of fighting riots and are prohibited for use as means of waging war. The definition of -chemical weapons- for these munitions is incorrect, but the use of munitions containing poisonous substances in war is also expressly prohibited by the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling, Use and Destruction of Chemical Weapons. Mostly Russians use chloracetophenone. Formally, it is not a chemical weapon. It is a combat toxic irritant. The Chemical Weapons Convention defines chloroacetophenone as a chemical anti-riot agent. It is a chemical that can quickly cause sensory irritation or physical disturbances in the human body, which disappear in a short time after the action ends. That is, tears, snorts, fogging and the like. The enemy, in addition to violating the Convention, is clearly aware of the effectiveness of these applications. Because the very means of fighting street riots is to arm the police to get the protesters to disperse and cease their actions. In the event of the use of dangerous chemicals at the front, the serviceman remains at his position - continues to be in a chemically dangerous environment. These are deliberate actions of the enemy to violate and injure our troops through the use of dangerous chemicals. * * * In an ArmyInform interview with the spokesman of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Captain Dmytro Lykhovy read also about Krynyk, the left bank of the Dnieper in Kherson Oblast, the Gulyaipil and Orihiv directions and the Robotyn ledge. Earlier, ArmyInform published a long interview with Dmitry Lyhovij about how to be a military spokesman, and also about mobilization, civilian media and the meme of the Turkish Olympic shooter.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/11/himichna-zbroya-chy-boyeprypasy-z-otrujnymy-rechovynamy-u-zsu-poyasnyly-vidminnist/	2024-11-11T05:08:06-08:00
Get rid of dependence on Chinese drones: demonstration flights of Ukrainian UAVs for reconnaissance ...	It is these UAVs that are used by the Armed Forces at the front, but almost all of them &#8211; foreign production, in particular &#8211; Chinese Therefore, the issue of development and production of UAVs of this class in Ukraine is one of the most urgent. The other day, the Ministry of Strategy and Industry held an event dedicated to innovations in the field of drones for reconnaissance and correction, where Ukrainian versions of the most common Chinese drone -mavik- on the front were presented. Eight non-state manufacturing firms presented their developments. During the event, the developers demonstrated drone flights, target finding and talked about their developments. One of the -Shmavik- drones has already passed codification and has been approved for purchase by the MoU and for use by the military. Another codified PTAKH-S product (in terms of performance close to DJI Matrice 30 &#8211; ed.) was also presented at the event. As noted by the Minister of Strategic Industries of Ukraine, Herman Smetanin, -today, it is impossible to completely replace the fleet of -maviks- that are operated on the territory of Ukraine in a short time, but our gunsmiths already have experience and designs, which satisfy our Security and Defense Forces. Now it is necessary to scale up production and reduce the number of foreign analogues as much as possible and switch to domestic samples. The domestic production of drones will reduce dependence on foreign purchases, as well as leave a large amount of funds in Ukraine, which will be spent on domestic production, on the purchase of weapons for the security and defense forces within our country. It is known that there was already quite a successful experience of financing the production of weapons at the expense of foreign funds, this scheme is possible. Today, both the Government of Ukraine and the Office of the President are working on attracting foreign investment to finance defense enterprises that produce defense products, including reconnaissance drones. We are grateful to our partners for every hryvnia with which they finance the production of domestic weapons.- Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Colonel Andriy Lebedenko noted the importance of the development of Ukrainian drone production: &#8211; The Ministry of Strategy and Industry supports the search for new capabilities for units of the Armed Forces in the development of domestically produced unmanned aerial vehicles that can compete with Mavik, which is in great demand today. We need to reduce our dependence on imported supplies, so in order to be able to choose the best manufacturers, we make every effort to codify developments. We have created the entire infrastructure, manufacturers through the Ministry of Strategy and Industry will be sent to specialized institutes for our tests. Today, the system, which has already been built, provides an operational opportunity to check them for the approximate combat conditions, to admit them to a soldier, to an officer who is fighting.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/11/pozbavytys-zalezhnosti-vid-kytajskyh-droniv-vidbulys-demonstraczijni-poloty-ukrayinskyh-bpla-dlya-rozvidky-ta-koryguvannya-vognyu/	2024-11-11T04:51:57-08:00

GUR told about the Russian drones -parody- that fell in Moldova	This was reported to the GUR of the MOU. During October 2024, Russia used more than 2,000 UAVs against Ukraine. About half of these drones are decoys or false targets, with which Russia tries to distract attention and overload Ukrainian air defense. -Parody- is one of the main decoy drones that the aggressor uses en masse in air attacks. These UAVs do not have a combat unit. They are much smaller and cheaper than the Shahed-136/Geranium-2, but due to the Lüneberg lens they mimic them in radar. The study of Russian -parodies- proved that Russia is not capable of producing even a primitive -plywood- drone on its own. The -parody- flight controller module contains components manufactured by companies from China (Ebyte, Jiashan Jinchang Electron, Yangzhou Yangjie Electronic Technology), USA (Texas Instruments, Cypress Semiconductor, InvenSense), Switzerland (STMicroelectronics) and Taiwan (SONiX Technology). As reported by ArmyInform, 5 people died in Mykolaiv a> as a result of hitting Shahed. In addition, in Zaporizhzhya due to Russian shelling a man died, another 22 people were injured.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/11/u-gur-rozpovily-pro-rosijski-drony-parodiya-shho-vpaly-u-moldovi/	2024-11-11T04:18:52-08:00
-Shahedis- and saboteurs in the North: who and why manages to break through	toldabout what the situation is at the borders of Chernihiv, Sumy and Kharkiv regions, on the air of the telethon -Social News-. /a> spokesman of OTU -Siversk- Colonel Vadym Mysnyk. — In recent months, such attempts [happen] not very often. First of all, we practically do not allow [DRG] measures, because the defense system has already been built, and the personnel at the border has also significantly improved combat capabilities, he said. Technical innovations are also used to detect enemy saboteurs. Therefore, despite the enemy's attempt to penetrate into the territory of Ukraine, he is not successful. — We also use technical capabilities, which allows us to timely detect such [attempts by the DRG] even under difficult natural and weather conditions. The activity of the enemy's use of anti-aircraft guns remains constant, but we keep this situation under control and do not allow penetration deep into the territories, the military officer assured. Instead, the enemy also uses the north of Ukraine to launch -Shahedy- deep into Ukrainian territory. — Also, the northern direction, namely Sumyshchyna and Chernihiv region, is a strategic direction for the enemy regarding the approach of the -Shakheds- to the territory of Ukraine. This constantly happens every night, if they come in - mostly in the dark, but they can come in during the day as well, - said the spokesman. The defense forces are doing their best to shoot down enemy UAVs, but the length of the border is long, and the enemy is constantly improving methods of penetrating into Ukrainian airspace. — Over the past few days, we have observed significant such mass actions of drones. We are hitting them, but it is hundreds of kilometers [of the border] and the enemy is also trying to change routes, they are changing tactics, Vadym Mysnyk explained. Despite this, the Defense Forces are doing everything possible to protect the airspace of Ukraine. ArmyInform previously reported that in the north of Ukraine, the occupiers attack primarily with long-range weapons.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/11/shahedy-ta-dyversanty-na-pivnochi-komu-j-chomu-vdayetsya-proryvatysya/	2024-11-11T03:57:24-08:00

During the occupation of part of the Kherson region, the former inspector of the colony transferred to a similar position to the invaders.

From the depths of enemy territory: the occupiers are striking with long-range weapons in the North ...	talked about what exactly the occupiers are hitting along the Ukrainian border on the air of the -Suspilne Novosti- telethon spokesman of OTU -Siversk-, Colonel Vadym Mysnyk. — The enemy uses the entire available arsenal of weapons whenever possible. They mostly strike from deep within their territory. These are air strikes, FPV drones, dropping explosive devices from UAVs. They also use MLRS, he said. According to the military, this is the kind of weaponry that allows the enemy to attack the North of Ukraine from deep within its own territory. However, currently most of the shelling still falls on the aggressor state's own territory — a section of the Kursk region temporarily controlled by the Defense Forces of Ukraine. As the spokesman reported, the intensity of shelling in Kurshchyna is consistently twice or even three times higher than the intensity of shelling in the territory of Ukraine. — That is, we also transfer these indicators there. But the enemy is constantly striking both along the border and deep into our regions, they are trying to exert this pressure, - noted the officer. Depriving the Russian aggressors of the ability to shell the territory of Ukraine is possible only with the help of their own long-range weapons. -We desperately need a long-range weapon with the permission of our partners for its full use, so that we can already have a concrete influence on this,- emphasized Vadimy Mysnyk. Earlier, ArmyInform explained, for what purpose the enemy does not reduce the intensity of shelling in the North.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/11/z-glybyny-vorozhoyi-terytoriyi-po-pivnochi-ukrayiny-okupanty-byut-dalekobijnoyu-zbroyeyu/	2024-11-11T03:27:09-08:00

The sources of funding are the governments of Denmark and Sweden and interest from frozen Russian assets. -‎In the conditions of a full-scale war, the support of our international partners is critically important for strengthening Ukraine's defense capabilities. Denmark was the first to start purchasing weapons directly from our defense enterprises. -The Danish model of cooperation is not only solidarity, but also determination in supporting our struggle for freedom and sovereignty,- said Deputy Defense Minister of Ukraine Dmytro Klimenkov. -I am sincerely grateful to the Danish government and all the people for their constant and consistent support. We appreciate that Denmark sets an example in the development of the defense complex of Ukraine. This will allow speeding up the supply of the necessary weapons to our military, while strengthening the Ukrainian economy in the face of Russian aggression. It is extremely important for us to have such a reliable ally as Denmark,- emphasized Herman Smetanin, Minister of Strategic Industries. The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine and the Defense Procurement Agency provided Denmark with comprehensive information on manufacturers, weapon efficiency, production capabilities and compliance with anti-corruption standards. -According to the results of the agreements, Ukrainian manufacturers of arms and equipment, both state and private, will supply the Armed Forces with self-propelled artillery installations, attack drones, anti-tank weapons, and missile weapons,- said the Director of the Procurement Policy Department, Hlib Kanevskyi.

In Sumy Oblast, shelling of the border is the greatest: what is the reason for this	About it on the broadcast of the -Only News- telethon reported the spokesman of the State Border Service of Ukraine Andriy Demchenko. — The enemy does not stop shelling Chernihiv Oblast, Sumy Oblast, and Kharkiv Oblast. I can point out that the majority of shelling occurs in the Sumy region, he said. The DPSU spokesman explained what caused this. — It should be understood that the length of the border within Sumy Oblast is more than 560 km, that is, it is quite significant. The length of the border is shorter within the borders of Chernihiv Oblast, as well as within the borders of Kharkiv Oblast, the border guard noted. At the same time, the enemy's attention to the border of Sumy Oblast is also higher than to the border in neighboring regions. -In the Sumy direction, we can see that the enemy is actively using artillery and unmanned aerial vehicles in this direction, as well as aviation in order to strike along the Sumy region's border,- Andriy Demchenko said. Almost always, the occupiers hit civilian infrastructure and local residents. - These shellings, unfortunately, fall on populated areas, as a result of which civilians living in border areas are killed. There are deaths, injuries to people, and destruction of infrastructure. In fact, Russia does not cease to confirm its status as a terrorist state by taking such actions, he said. At the same time, the spokesman of the State Border Service of Ukraine noted that in the Sumy region, attempts by hostile subversive and reconnaissance groups were also observed, although the number of such attempts or the activity of enemy DRGs has significantly decreased in the last period.

On the rear approaches: in the Kupyan region, the enemy is not allowed to calmly reach the front eve...	Currently, the enemy is trying to storm exclusively in small infantry groups, and the Ukrainian military is destroying the invaders not only on the front line, but also in the rear, not allowing them to accumulate in significant numbers directly on the battle line. told about this on the air -Suspilne novy- Nadiya Zamryga, head of the public relations department of the 14th separate mechanized brigade named after Prince Roman the Great. - The enemy does not abandon the intention of assaults, they carry out them mostly by infantry, because in extreme times, let's say, for a month, heavy equipment is practically not used to transport personnel, - she said. Voiskova explained that there are quite objective reasons for such actions of the enemy. — There are quite objective reasons for this - the enemy's equipment, which was transporting personnel, ammunition and some other things, was destroyed. -Aerial reconnaissance, FPV drones, drops are very effective, and it's all being destroyed,- the officer said. Judging by the effectiveness of the actions of the Ukrainian defenders, the occupiers try to act also at night, but this does not help them. - Uses infantry, small groups. It is worth noting that both during the day and at night. Likewise, this infantry makes incredible efforts, because it is extremely difficult, especially at night, it is all destroyed, said the representative of the princely brigade. The work of Ukrainian drones, which destroy manpower, equipment, fortifications and warehouses of the occupiers, is extremely effective. — We are working to prevent the enemy from moving into attacks and assaults. We try to work effectively with FPV drones, dropping a little further to his rear to destroy his logistics. FPV drones work very efficiently with the contributions of PMM and BC, Nadiya Zamryga explained. The main task of strikes on the near and far rear of the occupiers is to prevent the enemy from accumulating sufficient forces at the front. — We are making every effort to ensure that the enemy does not reach the actual contact line. End Times [the enemy] uses less heavy equipment, but instead uses ATVs and motorcycles. This is a more mobile technique, less loud in sound, but it also manages to destroy it, the spokeswoman emphasized. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in Kharkiv Oblast the enemy has problems with the supply of ammunition.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/11/na-tylovyh-pidstupah-na-kupyanshhyni-vorogu-ne-dozvolyayut-spokijno-dijty-do-peredovoyi-navit-vnochi/	2024-11-10T23:11:38-08:00

The commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces worked in parts and units in the Kursk direction	He wrote about this on his page on the morning of November 11. -If it weren't for the resilience of our soldiers, these tens of thousands of enemies from the best Russian shock units would have stormed our positions in the Pokrovsky, Kurakhiv or Toretsk directions, which would have significantly worsened the situation at the front. Now, following the order of their military leadership, they are trying to dislodge our troops and advance deep into the territory we control. Our task in this direction is to deter and destroy the enemy on his land,- said the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. According to him, the work was devoted to providing assistance to commanders in the organization of combat operations, increasing the effectiveness of fire damage to the enemy, and solving issues of comprehensive support and preparation of reserves. -I am grateful to our soldiers for their steadfastness and bravery in the fight against the Russian aggressor. Glory to Ukraine!- Oleksandr Syrskyi wrote.

The Left Bank, cable crossing and chemical weapons: how the South of Ukraine was defended in the sum...	In the continuation of ArmiyaInform's interview with the spokesman of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Captain Dmytro Lykhoviei, read about Krynky, the left bank of the Dnieper in Kherson Oblast, the Gulyaipil and Orikhov directions and the Robotynsky ledge, as well as the difference between chemical weapons and ammunition with poisonous substances. The first part of the interview: What it's like to be a military spokesperson: Captain Lykhovy on mobilization, civil media and the famous Turkish Olympic shooter - What was the situation in the South of Ukraine in the area of ​​responsibility of the -Tavria- air defense missile system when you were there on a business trip and acted as a spokesperson? - This year I had two business trips. The first - in the operational and strategic group of troops -Tavria-, to the zone of responsibility of which the Avdiyiv direction belonged, the second - in the operational group of troops -Tavria-, in the zone of which were the Kherson and Zaporizhia regions. If in the East during the first mission the situation was tense and controlled, then in the South it was controlled and stabilized. In the huge zone of responsibility of the Tavria anti-aircraft missile system, from the sea to Donetsk region, in August and at the beginning of September, there were sometimes even days when no enemy assaults took place. Often there were several enemy infantry attacks that could be counted on the fingers of one hand. At the same time, about 50 combat clashes per day could take place in the Pokrovsky direction alone, which refers to the Khortytsia air defense system. According to my conclusion, the Russians lacked (and now lack) the forces and means to conduct active offensive actions in many directions at the same time. Although this does not mean that we in Tavria had some kind of -lull-. After all, the enemy actively used artillery, attack aircraft, guided aerial bombs, unguided aerial missiles and other means of destruction every day. —What was the Ukrainian society interested in then, which news reports about the situation in the South attracted the most attention?—The media was most interested in the situation with the withdrawal of units of the Defense Forces of Ukraine from the village of Krynka on the left bank of the Dnieper in the Kherson region. This is actually what started my rotation. It was also about the prospects of the enemy's offensive in the Zaporizhzhia region and details about the nature of the Russian assaults, the results of the combat work of our units in terms of defeating the enemy's personnel, weapons and military equipment, and capturing them. I can single out the regular comments I gave for regional media. We have developed very high-quality cooperation with Zaporizhia and Kherson media regarding the situation in specific regions. I prepared for them special information reports on shades in these areas, which took into account the specifics there. I would like to single out the local editorial offices of -Suspilny- as an example of the high-quality work of regional media. —You mentioned Krynyk. Was it possible to communicate this moment with the bridgeheads on the left bank of the Dnieper, to explain to society what is happening there and why exactly this is happening? — The beginning of my rotation at the Strategic Communications Center of the Taviya Air Force Base fell on the period when, in July, units of the Defense Forces — marines and others - finally withdrew from the village of Krynky on the left bank Dnipro. After all, this settlement was completely destroyed by a long-term complex fire attack on the part of the Russians, there was no longer anything to hold on to. Actually, Krynky ceased to be a settlement a long time ago. At the same time, our troops continued to hold other designated positions and bridgeheads on the left bank of the Kherson region, not allowing the enemy to take control of the Dnieper riverbed. In particular, intensive combat operations by units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine continued with the Russian invaders on the islands in the Dnipro river delta - Milky, Kozatskyi, Bilogrudiy and a number of others. The specifics of the terrain there are such that it is difficult to use a significant force of attack aircraft and armored vehicles, instead, you have to use boats, jet skis, etc. for logistics. These enemy vessels were regularly destroyed by our forces. At one point, even a rope crossing across one of the straits was affected. - And how did the occupiers act in other areas - where there were no such water obstacles? - As a rule, the Russian occupiers carried out assault operations in small infantry groups of up to a detachment. Sometimes it was from 3-4 to 8-10 people. Attacked without the use of armored vehicles, but with extensive use of light equipment, ranging from motorcycles, buggies and the like. For the first time to resort to such tactics, in my memory, they started in February-March 2024. Half a year later, mass use of this tactic began. All this happened during my rotations at OSUV and OUV. The same can be said about the use of ground robotic platforms - in six months, from March to August, it went from the first attempts to mass use. That is, being a member of the military administration, I was able to see for myself how the tactics of conducting military operations change in half a year, how technological innovations become common tools for use on the front line. — How did the situation on the Gulyaipil and Orihiv directions change during this time? —In the Gulyaipil direction, from mid-July to mid-September, the enemy actually avoided infantry attacks (for example, in August there were only two). Announcements by some Western media, in particular the German newspaper -Bild-, about the preparation of a massive offensive by Russians from Pologhi to Gulyapole, although they alarmed the inhabitants of the Zaporizhzhia region, did not come true. In fact, there were no drastic changes in the nature and actions of the enemy, and no signs of the formation of an offensive group were detected. Then I kept stressing it, calming the audience down. I believe that I have fulfilled my mission, and this was true and objective information. In August, several units of brigades and battalions of the armed forces of the Russian Federation were redeployed from Zaporozhye to the Kursk direction. Thanks to this, the threat to Gulyaipol has decreased. In the Orikhov direction, the main fighting took place around the Robotynsky ledge. There, the enemy had little tactical success in some places, but for more than half a year of attempted assault actions, the Russians were still not able to completely -drain- the salient, which was deoccupied by the Defense Forces of Ukraine in 2023. In some cases, on the contrary, our units improved their tactical position, established or restored observation posts, firing positions. It was in this direction that the Russians suffered the greatest losses in manpower and equipment. In the Dnieper operational direction, as I have already mentioned, at the beginning of my term of office, units of the Defense Forces were withdrawn from the village of Krynka to other positions and continued to conduct a defensive operation, also on the left bank of the Dnieper, about which there was appropriate communication. At the same time, in all directions, the Russians actively used artillery, attack drones, such as Lancet and Privet. Also, the enemy massively used drops from drones and strike aircraft - hit with KABs (guided aerial bombs) and NARs (unguided aerial missiles). Our units also inflicted complex fire damage on enemy positions. —The reports of the Tavria military intelligence agency often referred to the use of chemical weapons by the Russian military. Please tell us more about it. — Every month, the Command of the Support Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine provides general statistics on chemical attacks by Russian troops against the Defense Forces and conclusions on their dynamics. The messages of the spokesperson of the -Tavria- OUV referred to a part of these statistics in a specific operational area. During the period of large-scale armed aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, the enemy, along with the use of conventional means of fire damage, uses special ammunition equipped with dangerous chemical substances against the Defense Forces. The definition of -chemical weapons- in relation to these munitions is incorrect, but the use of munitions with poisonous substances in war is also expressly prohibited by the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction.) This is, in particular, the use of hand gas grenades by the enemy type K-51 and RG-VO, which are means of combating riots and prohibited for use as means of warfare. Mostly Russians use chloracetophenone. Formally, it is not a chemical weapon. It is a combat poison of irritant action. The Chemical Weapons Convention defines chloroacetophenone as a chemical anti-riot agent. It is a chemical that can quickly cause irritation of the senses or physical disorders in the human body, which disappear after a short time after the action ends. That is, tears, snorts, fogging and the like. The enemy, in addition to violating the Convention, is clearly aware of the effectiveness of these applications. Because the very means of fighting street riots is to arm the police to get the protesters to disperse and cease their actions. In the event of the use of dangerous chemicals at the front, the serviceman remains at his position - continues to be in a chemically dangerous environment. These are deliberate actions of the enemy to violate and injure our troops through the use of dangerous chemicals. For example, there is a dugout or a trench, the Russians try to demolish them with artillery, drops from UAVs, FPV drones, sometimes UAVs. Despite this, several servicemen continue to hold defense in the dugout. When occupiers see the ineffectiveness of other means of destruction, they use munitions containing poisonous substances, which are prohibited by the Chemical Weapons Convention. Thus, during August, the enemy dropped 196 munitions with poisonous substances from UAVs in the operational area of ​​the Tavria air defense system. Relatively more - in the Zaporizhzhia region, but also in the Kherson region, many such cases were recorded. - As for incendiary ammunition, how often did the Russians use them? What exactly? — In addition to poisonous substances, the enemy uses drops with incendiary substances. This is another set of weapons based on using the combat capabilities of incendiary substances to destroy defensive positions. The statistics of their use are much lower than the discharge of ammunition with poisonous substances. The Russians resorted to this tactic, in particular, on the Dnieper islands, where it is easy to cause a fire and in this way forced the o/s to leave the position. —You kept statistics of enemy losses in the South. Can you share the general results for the time you were in the position of the spokesperson of the Tavria military command center? - Daily filling of tables in Exel format is a convenient way to track the trends of combat operations, both in terms of the number of assaults and shelling, as well as in terms of damage statistics. In July, the enemy lost 1,371 units of weapons and military equipment in the operational zone of the -Tavria- anti-aircraft missile system, in August - 1,041, and in the middle of September - about 400. That is, the statistics gradually decreased. These are the data based on the daily official summaries of the -Tavria- OUV. —Finally, I want to return to the question of the main message that, in your opinion, military communicators should convey to society. What and how should Ukrainians be informed first of all? - The task of military communicators is to maintain constant communication between the fighting army and the rest of society. To do our best to ensure that this connection is not lost, because a part of our society, perhaps, the further from the front line, the more calmed down it is. And the further from the beginning of a full-scale invasion, the less the desire to mobilize, the stronger the desire to sit in the rear. In fact, nothing is over. In my opinion, the best way to communicate in the military is objective information, as well as communication of problems that have been solved. I believe that problems cannot be kept silent, they must be identified and responded to. At the same time, we should also talk about many real positive points that exist in the army. It should also be explained that the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the Defense Forces of Ukraine as a whole, is a large complex organism in which there is a place for everyone. Perhaps, and within the limits of his civilian profession. Because the army also needs builders, tractor drivers, truck drivers, accountants, lawyers, cooks, journalists - almost all civilian specialties. After becoming military personnel, they will actually continue to work in their profession, but at the same time will be part of the Defense Forces and will contribute to the defense of Ukraine, while receiving decent financial support, benefits and public respect.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/11/livyj-bereg-kanatna-pereprava-ta-himichna-zbroya-yak-boronyly-pivden-ukrayiny-vlitku-2024-go/	2024-11-10T22:41:39-08:00

The Holy Trinity: UAV, arta and the Holy Spirit Leopard - the fight against the infantry evil enemy	The video of the combat work was published on the brigade's channel. The assault group of Russians was advancing through a forest strip when it was stopped and partially hit by artillery fire. Then our drones further -polished- the occupiers. But some of the invaders were able to get stuck in the cracks and required surgical removal. The scalpel of the operation was the Leopard tank, which drove up close and shot the Russians. Friendly escort was provided by the M113 armored car. -The occupiers turned the wrong way - their group was met with merciless discharges and fire from artillery brigade units. But later, the deep and dark situation in which they found themselves became even more critical. The dark avenger -Leo- and our predator -M-ka- went to the field,- commented the video in the brigade. &nbsp; As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the 33rd mechanized brigade suddenly destroyed the enemy armored personnel carrier with the help of a daring tank attack.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/11/svyata-trijczya-bpla-arta-i-duh-svyatyj-leopard-borotba-z-pihotnoyu-nechystyu-voroga/	2024-11-10T21:19:49-08:00
The enemy carried out fifty airstrikes and over 600 drone strikes — General Staff of the Armed Force...	Operational information as of at 22.00 on November 10 was published by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The defense forces are directing efforts to disrupt the execution of the Russian invaders' offensive plans and exhaust their combat potential. In the Kharkiv direction, one skirmish continues near Vovchansk. Five enemy attacks have already been repelled by our defenders in the districts of Starytsia and Vovchansk. The enemy used aviation and carried out three airstrikes, dropping 4 anti-aircraft missiles in the areas of Kharkiv, Vilcha and Vilkhuvatka settlements. The enemy launched three attacks on our fortifications in the Kupyan direction. At this time, all of them in the districts of Kindrashyvka, Zagryzovy and Zeleny Gayu have already been repelled. On the Lymanskyi direction, Russian troops stormed the positions of Ukrainian defenders five times during the day in the areas of Terny, Torske and Serebryanka settlements. All enemy attacks are stopped. The defenders of the Ukrainian land are restraining the onslaught of the enemy in the Siversk direction, currently one enemy attack is underway in the area of ​​the Verkhnokamianske settlement. In the Kramatorsk direction, three attempts by the invaders to advance near Stupochky and Chasovoy Yar ended in failure. The enemy launched airstrikes in the areas of Chasovoy Yar and Sloviansk. In the Toretsk direction, the occupiers stormed the Toretsk and Shcherbinivka districts 14 times today. There, as well as near Shcherbinivka, enemy aviation was active. Fighting continues in six locations. The enemy is intensively attacking the Ukrainian defenders in the Pokrovsky direction. During the day, he carried out a total of 35 assault and offensive operations. The Russian occupiers are most active in the areas of Myrolyubivka, Promenya, Hryhorivka, Selidovoy, Lysivka, Sukhoi Yar, and Petrivka. Nine clashes in the direction are still ongoing. The enemy used aviation means of destruction in the areas of the settlements of Lysivka, Kotlyne, Sukha Balka, Oleksandropil. According to preliminary calculations, today our soldiers eliminated 145 and injured 204 occupiers. Two units of automobile equipment, two UAV control points, a buggy and a quad bike were destroyed.

Cartridges are collected even in Britain: at Interflex, automatic machines are -falling apart-	The correspondent of ArmyInform tells about rifle training during the BZVP within the borders of the Interflex multinational training mission on the territory of Great Britain. Most of us hold a machine gun for the first time in our lives, so we don't notice anything strange. However, Ukrainian instructors accompanying us during training in Britain, as well as those who served in Ukraine, note the unusualness of the Kalashnikov assault rifles issued to us for training. Indeed, this is not an AK-74 or any other modifications common in Ukraine, such as the AKS, although at first glance, and especially from a distance, it is difficult to distinguish them even for an experienced shooter. However, if someone who has dealt with the AK family of automatic weapons in Ukraine takes the weapon issued by the British in his hands, he will see a lot of differences, some of which are quite significant. How Britain trains the Ukrainian military in Great Britain / BFBS Forces News report The most noticeable detail that immediately catches the eye is the bright yellow muzzle, which is neither a muzzle brake nor a flamethrower . This is a compensator device that is an adapter for blank firing. It is designed to contain and divert powder gases to the side during firing with a blank cartridge. However, it is not this most noticeable detail that determines the fundamental difference between the machine guns issued to us and the AK-74, because if necessary, a similar or similar compensator can be installed on any model of the AK family. The fundamental differences are different and not so obvious until you pick up the weapon. Among the details that are immediately obvious even to a novice, the most noticeable are also the unusual folding tubular stock and the duplicate safety / fire switch on the pistol grip under the right thumb. With the example, the situation is about the same as with the adapter for blank firing - nothing fundamentally different from the usual AK modifications. The second fuse, on the other hand, is actually a very unusual thing that will cause a number of problems for some of us. The caliber of cartridges is also unusual - these are not the traditional 7.62 mm or 5.45 mm cartridges on our territory. It is a caliber of 5.56 mm of the NATO standard, intermediate in its power between cartridges for pistols and cartridges for rifles. This caliber was adopted as the second standard service rifle cartridge for NATO forces in 1980. Since then, it has spread not only in the countries of the North Atlantic Alliance, but also beyond it. After all, even replicas of the AK, the main individual small arms of the USSR and the Warsaw Pact Organization, which were the main antagonists of NATO during the Cold War, began to be produced under the 5.56 mm cartridge. In particular, such modifications were created in Bulgaria by the armory company -Arsenal-. The most famous Bulgarian modifications of the Kalashnikov assault rifle, including those chambered for the 5.56 mm cartridge, were the AR-M1 / AR-M1F and AR-M9 / AR-M9F. The letter -F- is used to denote the folding tubular metal stock, which helps to identify the AKs made by Arsenal's Bulgarian gunsmiths. Due to the availability of a significant number of 5.56 mm cartridges, the Ministry of Defense of Great Britain purchased and uses for training Ukrainian military Kalashnikov assault rifles of the AR-M9F model. This particular model has a right-hand thumb safety/fire switch and a folding tubular stock, as well as a number of other less significant features such as a polymer buttstock or pistol grip. Ukrainians train with Bulgarian AKs manufactured by Arsenal We get used to the weapons we receive quite quickly - they are really high-quality and easy-to-use automatic weapons for training in handling weapons and shooting during basic general military training. In terms of basic parameters, the AR-M9F is almost identical to the AK-74. However, the AR-M9F has a number of disadvantages. Oddly enough, it's primarily a collapsible tubular stock and a duplicate safety/fire switch on the pistol grip. These improvements of the Bulgarian gunsmiths created some problems for some of us. It is really very convenient to remove the weapon from the safety or to put the machine on the safety with a slight movement of the thumb of the right hand. However, the AK-74 in Ukraine does not have such an improvement, so the instructors forbade the use of a duplicate fuse. In conclusion, those of us who, for the sake of speed, tried to use the fuses on the sleeves without the instructors noticing, did ourselves a disservice. After returning to Ukraine, they had to get used to the usual AK-74 fuse. However, there were practically no offenders who regularly used a backup fuse. The instructors were vigilant, and we ourselves understood how negative the consequences of faulty muscle memory can be on the battlefield in Ukraine. Instead, the problem with the tubular stock was of a different nature. After long-term use in some submachine guns, the butt assembly attachment loosened, which obviously had an extremely negative effect on the accuracy and accuracy of the shot. To prevent this, we were forbidden to make an example. The ban on folding the stock helped, but not enough - as a result of long intensive training, the machines could not withstand and sometimes practically -crumbled- in someone's hands. It cannot be said that it was too massive, but the depletion of weapons was significant. So the aiming bar, which fell off during shooting due to vibration, did not surprise anyone. To be fair, the problematic weapon was replaced immediately. My first machine gun, which regularly jammed from the first day of shooting, was replaced already on the next field trip. After that, there were no problems with the re-received weapon until the very end of the training. In the same way, problematic submachine guns were also exchanged for other soldiers of the platoon. The British were extremely careful with their weapons and meticulously inspected them for the slightest complaint. Our Danish instructors demanded of us the same careful attitude towards the machines. The instructors were no less scrupulous about collecting cartridges after training. However, such vigilance when it came to empty cartridges was caused not in any way by the need to count all the fired cartridges and collect all the casings from them, so that the number of cartridges issued clearly coincided with the number of cartridges. During the firing of empty cartridges, no one counted their number, so it was possible to replenish the ammunition, filling the stores to the brim, as needed at any time. I think that each of us fired about 800 to 1,200 blank rounds during training. However, the lack of record of empty cartridges did not exempt from the obligation to carefully select cartridges in thick grass or among fallen leaves and brushwood. This was done in order not to pollute the environment, and also because the collected cartridges were processed for the production of new batches of empty cartridges. What's more, cardboard boxes from cartridges, which were asked not to be torn, were also collected in a separate bag. These neatly opened boxes were not thrown into the trash, but were also to be used for repackaging cartridges. Such -recycling- in the British way may seem trivial to someone, but a combination of care for the environment, frugality and strict adherence to really useful and important rules cannot fail to command respect. By demanding compliance with these and other simple rules, the instructors strengthened our discipline, brought up a responsible, cautious and careful attitude to weapons, taught us to strictly observe safety measures. All this later came in handy during the firing of live cartridges, when the instructors' requirements for compliance with safety measures and cartridge control became significantly stricter.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/11/gilzy-zbyrayut-navit-u-brytaniyi-na-interflex-avtomaty-azh-rozsypayutsya/	2024-11-10T20:54:14-08:00
How the Armed Forces forced the Buryats to jump: the story of a soldier who mastered everything from...	How is it to be on the defensive when you are assaulted three times a day? What tricks do the occupiers resort to on the front line? The soldier told our correspondent about this: -In the summer of 2022, I took part in the assaults. It was the Neskuchny, Velika Novosilka district. After one of the storms, I went to the hospital: I was wounded in my right heel, it was torn by a splinter. Nothing like that, the bones were intact, just tore the foot&#8230; In 2023, we were assigned to the 1st tank division and held positions near one of the villages in the south. It was already autumn-winter last year. It was difficult there, the enemy attacked us three times a day. In such difficult situations, the most important thing is that the soldiers in the positions do not withdraw into themselves, continue to communicate with their comrades, and listen to experienced fighters. It is important to take more ammunition to the position. Because this is not a very good option when the fighter takes a lot of stew, and BC - only four stores. If you yourself do not bring more BC to the position, then no one will do it for you. During the war, I mastered many types of weapons, from the RPG-7 to the M-240 and the Browning M2, but I loved the RPG the most. Because you can take this -pipe-, as it is called, and walk with it: I can find shots in almost any trench, ammunition is in everyone, they are interchangeable. Once upon a time, we carried out assault operations in Velika Novosilka. And there, the enemy AGS started working on our boys. Then the group commander told us to try to suppress him. This AGS behind the houses stood diagonally to us, and we saw it a little. With two shots from the RPG-7, we didn't just suppress him, we cut him down altogether. In one of the settlements in the south, I remember, we had two positions. The commander then ordered me to install American Claymore mines in front of them. It is an analogue of the Soviet MON-50. And then one day the Russians came to storm us again. They always entered from three sides: in the center and from two flanks. The battle began and we blew up those Claymores on both the left and right sides. Then the enemy was well mowed down by these mines. Then we captured two Russians. We squeezed them in a pincer between our two positions. One 19-year-old boy from Kamchatka did not hesitate. And the second one - a Buryat, he was 40 years old - even jumped on a mine in order to destroy the convoy group and himself. In the same area, the Russians had a custom of making -horseshoes- from their corpses. Because all the plantations there were already destroyed, only the stumps themselves. Then the occupiers placed three corpses of their comrades in front of them between two tree stumps, they also placed them on their sides and made a window between the bodies to conduct fire. In the same way, Russians often hid under the bodies of their dead after assaults in order to save their lives. Because then our drone could not see them very much.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/11/yak-zsu-prymusyly-buryata-strybaty-istoriya-voyina-yakyj-opanuvav-vse-vid-rpg-7-do-m-240-i-dvoma-postrilamy-vyrubyv-vorozhyj-ags/	2024-11-10T20:40:43-08:00
-Crush- everything: Israeli designers have created a laser installation that will shoot down UAVs, m...	How informs the official portal of this high-tech weapons manufacturer from Haifa, the latest defense equipment was recently presented at the largest military exhibition in North America AUSA, which is organized by the Association of the US Army, reports ArmyInform. The device Lite Beam (-Light beam-, in Ukrainian) is designed to quickly neutralize aerial threats, including swarms of drones. This 10 kW laser system is designed to enhance force protection during mobile ground operations, combining economy with cost-effective use. Lite Beam is part of Rafael's strategy to expand the use of directed energy weapons to counter a variety of air and ground threats. This mobile model is an adaptation of the Rafael system Iron Beam (- Iron beam- - in Ukrainian), a fixed laser with a power of 100 kW, capable of destroying targets at a distance of several kilometers. These weapons can be mounted from light vehicles and deployed in a variety of operational areas, allowing to counter a wide range of threats, from drones and missiles to mortar shells. In addition, the system can neutralize identified improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and other ground-based threats, increasing its versatility on the battlefield. The new version of the Lite Beam presented at AUSA 2024 has an updated increased power compared to previous models of 7.5 kW, matching similar systems such as Jupiter from MBDA and Rheinmetall. With an effective range of several hundred meters to approximately 2 km, the Lite Beam excels in its ability to accurately track targets with an advanced tracking system that can also be integrated into other anti-drone systems (C-UAVs). Design modularity allows the Lite Beam to be installed on a variety of platforms, including armored vehicles, ships, and fixed land platforms. As for the source of consumed energy, this combat laser station can be powered by diesel generators or batteries depending on the operational needs. One of the key features of the Iron Beam is its lower cost per shot compared to conventional interceptor missiles. Each Iron Beam intercept is valued at $1,000, which is significantly lower than the $40-$50,000 per Tamir missile the Israelis use in the Iron Dome (-Iron dome- in Ukrainian) from the same Rafael. Other international players are rapidly developing high-energy laser technologies: in particular, MBDA, Rheinmetall, Lockheed Martin and Raytheon are also developing 10 kW solutions. Among them is the ATHENA from Lockheed Martin allows multiple lasers to be combined to achieve an output power of 30 kW, while HELWS from Raytheon is designed for extreme mobility and can be mounted on a simple pickup truck. Although this technology is still in the early stages of development with many systems being researched or tested, it offers promising potential for future defense applications. Lite Beam's ability to provide fast and accurate laser protection in a mobile format highlights Rafael's achievements in this field, positioning it as a potentially strategic tool to counter emerging threats. The Rafael laser installation has an unlimited -store- of cartridges, which allows you to use it without the need for reloading. In addition, no fragments of intercepted targets remain after the shot, which reduces the risk of collateral damage. According to the authors of the publication Army Recognition, this is especially important in the context of the conflict in Israel, where the country's air defense forces faced a shortage of ammunition for Iron Dome. Analysts cite data from Israeli economists who note that the war in Gaza has already cost the Israeli economy more than $67.3 billion, but the use of high-energy lasers such as Iron Beam or British DragonFire, about which in its publications repeatedly ArmyInform told, it also has its own problems. Atmospheric conditions such as clouds or rain can affect the ability of the beam to reach the target. Because the laser must remain focused on a moving target for several seconds to provide enough energy to destroy it. This requirement can limit its effectiveness against multiple threats at once, such as a barrage of missiles. In addition, some targets may be protected by materials resistant to laser attacks, which may reduce the effectiveness of the system. High-energy Iron Beam laser weapons system.

And again, nuclear blackmail: the Russian Federation took out a dirty bomb from the closet	However, in reality, such statements are part of the systematic nuclear blackmail of the Russian Federation, aimed at discrediting Ukraine, and are false. Russian statements about the so-called -dirty bomb- serve as a cover for its own actions that pose a threat to international nuclear security. This is written by the Center for Strategic Communications and Information Security. Russia itself has repeatedly threatened to use nuclear weapons, occupied the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, and also provokes fears about possible incidents at the Zaporizhzhia and Kursk nuclear power plants. Russian forces are also moving tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus and conducting exercises using the nuclear arsenal, which is causing concern to the world community. Such Russian fakes aim not only to discredit the Ukrainian leadership, but also to divert attention from their own crimes in the nuclear arena. Statements about the possibility of Ukraine using nuclear weapons are purposeful propaganda aimed at undermining international trust in Ukraine and justifying further nuclear escalation on the part of Russia.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/11/i-znovu-yadernyj-shantazh-rf-distala-z-shafy-brudnu-bombu/	2024-11-10T20:11:28-08:00

President: Russian military facilities are becoming increasingly accessible to our soldiers	He said this in the evening address. -First of all, words of gratitude to all our soldiers, which provide the strikes of our drones. Everyone can see how it works. Drones are at the front, as well as our long-range drones deep in the Russian rear,- said the President. Volodymyr Zelenskyy added that Russian military facilities are becoming increasingly accessible to our soldiers. -I thank the Security Service of Ukraine and the guys from the Special Operations Forces. Russian military warehouses, airfields, their military-industrial complex enterprises - they will not hide,- he emphasized. The head of state reported that only the special forces of the Security Service have already destroyed more than 1,300 Russian tanks. -Every eighth Russian tank destroyed by Ukraine is due to guys from the SBU. I am also grateful to the soldiers of the Main Directorate of Intelligence. To all units that perform tasks in the east of our country, in battles and behind enemy lines,- Volodymyr Zelenskyi said. As reported by ArmyInform, on the night of November 10, units of the Forces of Unmanned Systems of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in cooperation with other units of the Defense Forces caused fire damage to warehouses with ammunition 1060 center of material and technical support in the Bryansk region of the Russian Federation.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/10/prezydent-rosijski-vijskovi-obyekty-stayut-use-bilsh-dosyazhnymy-dlya-nashyh-voyiniv/	2024-11-10T10:03:52-08:00
-Our first assault was just on Easter-: -Otaman- from the TCC told about his service in the assault ...	His story was told in OK -Pivnich-. Currently, 56-year-old Oleksandr Boyko is a military officer of the Eighth Department of Poltava District TCC and SP — Mashiv Poltava District TCC and SP. -I quickly put things in order, gathered myself and came to the TCC on March 1, where I mobilized to the Armed Forces. Although they didn't really want to take it, because they are 53 years old, they have enough ailments: hypertension, diabetes, weight 140 kg. I have had to take a handful of pills every morning for years. But all the same, it is necessary to protect the Motherland - who, if not us? And he didn't think about the difficulties, he had to, and he left,- Sergeant Oleksandr Boyko says. A few days later, representatives of the separate combined assault unit -Odin- came to the department and offered Oleksandr Boyko to join its ranks. I agreed. The formed unit was sent to the training center in Chernihiv region for coordination. Later, the platoon was sent to perform combat missions in the Sumy region near the Russian border. Their task was to hold positions, preventing a possible penetration of the enemy's DRG. There were shellings, but there was no direct fighting during that period, notes the sergeant. With a surplus, this -peace- was compensated later - on the outskirts of Liman, in Serebryan Forestry. -Our first assault was just on Easter. They received an order to storm the position taken by the Russians. We walked through the forest for several kilometers. They carried only BC and water - no food was taken. The battle was expected to last 4-5 minutes, but it lasted more than 20. There were about 80 of them, and 27 of us. But we still fought back what we had,- says the sergeant. Two weeks later, Oleksandr received a contusion and injury. After several months of treatment and rehabilitation, Oleksandr returned to the Eighth Department of the Poltava District TCC and SP in Mashivka. The state of health requires constant treatment, so he periodically has to return to the hospital, the soldier admits. So far, he is not considering the possibility of dismissal from the ranks of the Armed Forces, because he sees that civilian men are in no hurry to defend the country. -Men don't want to come here to protect their families - mothers, children, women. On the contrary, they hide behind their women. I don't know how they have enough conscience! I can't do that,- says -Otaman-. Among his responsibilities now, in addition to protection, there is also notification of citizens. It is necessary to communicate a lot with conscripts, check documents, issue summonses for clarification of data or passing of the VLK. The most difficult thing, the sergeant notes, is when people do not understand what military duty is. They start scandalizing, insulting, humiliating. They often ask why he does not fight himself. -It is so insulting in my soul that I fought for myself and for them, shed blood, and they are not only hiding, but also dissatisfied. But go fight yourselves, we have already won back ours. If you love your family, your children, you must go to protect them. Don't people realize that they won't be able to do anything when the enemy gets here?-, says the sergeant. ArmyInform reminds you of the opportunity to use the aggregator of vacancies in the Armed Forces and recruiting centers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/10/pershyj-nash-shturm-buv-yakraz-na-velykden-otaman-z-tczk-rozpoviv-pro-sluzhbu-v-shturmovomu-pidrozdili/	2024-11-10T09:43:24-08:00
They perish among the ruins: in Vovchansk, the occupiers lose their manpower without any advance	About this on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- the spokesman of the OTU -Kharkiv- told - lieutenant colonel Yevhenii Romanov. - Fighting continues in the city. We cannot talk about the advancement of the Russians. If the enemy advances on one or two buildings, it should be understood that several people enter there and die in those ruins. Then several more people enter there, who also die. That's what promotion is all about, he said. The spokesman said that the invaders were supposed to capture the city by certain dates determined by the Russian military-political leadership, — They had the task of capturing [the city] by certain dates, but so far they have not succeeded. Vovchansk is controlled by Ukrainian troops, the officer emphasized. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that the new task of the Russian occupiers in Kharkiv Oblast is to take control of Kupyansk on the left bank by the new year.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/10/gynut-sered-ruyin-u-vovchansku-okupanty-vtrachayut-zhyvu-sylu-bez-zhodnogo-prosuvannya/	2024-11-10T09:21:58-08:00

-Queen in the trenches- as -Thunder in the sky-: what movie news to expect this winter. Interview wi...	In an interview with ArmiyaInform, their producer, reserve colonel Oleksandr Driz, told about these new movies. - Let's start with the nearest date - December 6. I am very pleased that for this holiday we have a gift in the form of a movie called -Queens in the Trenches-. This is a film about women in the army based on the example of three people who had very good jobs before the war. One of our heroines, Oreste Brit, studied at the Sorbonne University and lived in Paris. In 2006, she became a beauty queen, received the title of -Miss Kyiv-, her photo was decorated by the best foreign publications. Another heroine is Diana -Dana- Vinogradova, a very interesting person who stood near the origins of -Right Sector- and currently holds the position of deputy brigade commander. She is the only woman in the Armed Forces of Ukraine who holds a position of this level - the deputy commander of the brigade for moral and psychological support. Now she is studying at the National University of Defense, there is also a fragment about this in our film. The third heroine is a designer, participant and organizer of various music festivals. This is Yulia Sidorova, her call sign is -Kuba-. Everyone already knows her as a very famous medic who saved a huge number of servicemen and continues to do so in the 92nd Brigade in Kharkiv. She saves lives and has her own team that she has chosen. All this will also be told in our film. The main goal of this film is to use the example of these women to show both girls and men how to act in modern conditions. Oresta Britt is a well-known volunteer. She was an adviser to the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valery Zaluzhny, now she is very active in volunteering, and is engaged in REEs. It has many different directions of assistance to the Armed Forces and we show it all. Our other two heroines officially joined the military during the large-scale invasion, signed contracts and are now very successfully serving in the ranks of the Armed Forces. We hope that this project will have a positive effect on the mobilization campaign, that people will see how these girls, having such serious successes before the war, went to defend Ukraine during a large-scale invasion. - You mentioned the mobilization campaign. What do you think can activate this process so that new people go to the army? – I think that only a positive example of others. By the way, Orestes Britt in our film tells what advantages a person receives when he now goes to the service, goes to war. Yes, it is very dangerous there, you can stay there both on the battlefield and on the shield, as they say, return. But the fact is that during such service, a person receives both recognition and status in the country that will win - a worthy place, honor and respect in society. And he will also find the best friends and will feel like a real citizen, a real patriot who did not hide, but followed the call of his soul and heart to defend our country. Therefore, in such a situation, of course, we cannot influence some administrative or organizational measures for mobilization, but in a spiritual way, in the fact that people may have a desire to leave after listening to these girls - I am sure. Many people are currently in a state of uncertainty, so this film of ours will, I think, help them orient themselves and make the right choice, because the Armed Forces of Ukraine currently offer a lot of vacancies. - And whose story impressed you the most? b> – All three of them are such extraordinary and very bright heroines. But I was personally impressed by -Dana- Vynogradova. She is an artist, she had exhibitions in Lviv. In addition, she writes poems, publishes patriotic books. She is involved in the army, starting from training and ideological work with personnel to purely military operational, operational-tactical matters, where she takes a direct part. I just wonder where she got such a range of knowledge, skills and abilities. She is very young, now a senior lieutenant, but she has held the positions of lieutenant colonel, and now she will probably have higher positions after the National Defense University. And it's not just like that. Even the brigade commander, who was her commander, was amazed at how she, being in the rank of lieutenant, handled all her duties very confidently. Therefore, this is really the kind of story that impressed me the most. - Now tell us about your second film - -Thunder in the clear sky-, the main character of which is the Hero of Ukraine Rostyslav Lazarenko, call sign -Thunder-. – We created a project called -Fighting Families-. The co-author of his idea is, together with me, the head of the Department of Public Relations of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Colonel Bohdan Senyk. Each series of this project is dedicated to a certain type of Armed Forces. The films have a career orientation load and also promote military professions. During the large-scale invasion, two series were created, dedicated to the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The first series was called -Defenders of the Sky- about the profession of military pilots. And the second - -Air defense is working calmly.- Rostyslav Lazarenko also took part there, but he was not the main character, there was another main character. After that, we decided that Rostyslav, as a Hero of Ukraine, as a very well-known and respected person, needed a separate film and we are currently creating -Thunder in the Clear Sky- as a portrait project. This is a portrait of a hero who experienced a lot and deserved a lot. Just imagine that today he has almost doubled the record of Ivan Kozhedub himself. Rostislav graduated from the military educational institution named after Kozhedub. He is an unsurpassed personality and the film is about him and partly about the team of those with whom he is. Because his boys, as he calls them, are a fighting family. They have their own corporate culture, their own awards, and tattoos, and bracelets, and many symbols that are fundamentally important to them. This film reveals more broadly the life of the hero, the leader of the stormtrooper pilots. Undoubtedly, there are also tragic stories about his brothers who have already died. How difficult it all is for him these days... He says: -For me, when the war ends, it will be a very difficult period, because then I will be able to remember everyone. And not like now, because now there are constant sorties-. He has already destroyed an insane number of enemies and continues to destroy them. Unfortunately, this is already the history of today. Despite everything, he believes in Victory and aims his boys at the victorious activity of destroying the enemy. - When will you be able to see the films? - Both of these projects were commissioned by the Ukrainian Cultural fund where we won the competition. -Queens in the Trenches- is scheduled to premiere on Armed Forces Day on Channel 24. After that, the film will go to other TV channels, streaming platforms and other sources. And the second project -Thunder in the Clear Sky- has, in our opinion, a cinema perspective. That's why we want to launch it in cinemas in January first. Even now, the -Planet Kino- chain and some cinemas want to rent it. Therefore, only after the film is shown in cinemas, it will be released on television. - Tell us about your creative plans. - Today we want to continue the aviation theme. Apart from Rostislav Lazarenko, there are many other worthy people there. By the way, the Hero of Ukraine Vadym Voroshilov, call sign -Karaya- and the pilot, squadron commander, who is currently also studying at the Defense University of Ukraine, Ivan Smerechansky - -Smereka-, also participate in the film -Thunder in the Clear Sky-. We want to expand the palette of these heroes, so we are planning another film about attack aircraft. And then we want to talk about bomber aircraft and fighter jets, which we have in all projects. That is why we have very good prospects in aviation, I believe. But we will not forget about other troops. Perhaps it will be possible to continue the -Fighting Families- cycle. We did about the infantry, marines, assault troops, special operations forces. In the continuation of -Fighting Families- we would like to touch on other military professions.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/10/koroleva-v-okopah-yak-grim-sered-neba-yaki-kinonovynky-chekaty-cziyeyi-zymy-intervyu-z-oleksadrom-drizom/	2024-11-09T20:41:50-08:00
How to survive in battle, or What useful things will be taught at BZVP: life hacks from a DSHV instr...	ArmyInform asked the instructor about how paratroopers are prepared for war with the enemy, as well as how to communicate with society so that people stand up for the defense of Ukraine. -The deeper you dig into the ground and properly arrange the dugout, the more likely you are to survive the battle,- Comroty Roman explains the importance of engineering training to the mobilized. Theoretical block: instructors talk about the nuances. They explain to people at the classes how to act and what to do during enemy attacks with guided aerial bombs: - the Russians use anti-aircraft missiles on the front, aim them directly at our positions. Guided aerial bombs are divided into different types and types, that is, they have different charge equivalents. People in positions must understand: in order to survive, deep holes must be dug, overlaps must be arranged, and so on. In the winter of this year, the 79th DSHV brigade, Mariinsky direction. Then the Russians made 13 KAB strikes against our advanced positions. After that, I talked with my brother, the boys survived because they dug in well. Everything was -according to - according to-, there were no -two hundred-, two - -three hundred-, concussions. This is a real-life example of how the ability to dig in well saves the lives of defenders on the front line. These are tactical, fire, engineering, intelligence training, work with/against UAVs and tactical medicine, communications. We focus on night classes using drones. Interaction is important on the battlefield. The mobilized work as part of tactical groups, divisions and platoons. Let's see which of them is the leader to determine the commander of the department. Actions in defense and attack, assault actions, tactical movements inherent in various types of combat. Small group tactics: hit and roll. Repelling an enemy sabotage and reconnaissance group, how to counter the meaty assaults of the Rashists. That is, all working moments that are in a real combat situation. Due to the fact that the enemy is now massively using drones with resets, we show them what elements can unmask them during missions. That they can give out during the day, or in the dark. Working with weapons and shooting is, of course, a priority.- The key point of training: the instructors in the classes share their own combat experience. Again, there are different terrains: an urbanized area, a plantation, a field, some kind of body of water. Accordingly, the combat tasks are different: - In 2023, during the counteroffensive in the south, I, as part of the 46th Airmobile Brigade, performed tasks in the -fire sack- near Robotyny in Zaporozhye. The task was to keep two plantations and approaches to them for 6-7 days. Our group consisted of 8 servicemen. In principle, there were no fixed positions there, but there were, as we called them - -coffins- - small pits, where we held the defense. SPs were set up, sectors of fire were determined. To say that it was very hot there is an understatement. The enemy worked around the clock for us: Vasylok, LPG, AGS, aviation with anti-aircraft guns, and barrel artillery. In short, solid trash. Plus the enemy used small group tactics, launching groups of three at night to determine where we were. Of course, we destroyed them on the approaches. The drones hung in the air by themselves. One day, a command came from the management: storm the next landings. Disguising smoke was launched to indicate the direction of the landings and the starting point of the assault. I don't know how, but our tanks somehow got into positions in this area, until that time none of our heavy equipment had left at that point, and they worked on the enemy. After which there was an assault, another unit from our brigade took these two landings. Next was to be our replacement. We already realized that the enemy had hacked our radio communication and knew the evacuation point already during the withdrawal from the positions. They flew at us with -fan- mines, then drones joined. But all my soldiers were prepared for any close approach, they all knew what they had to do, followed by always voice commands and onward movement, on turns at a run, no one stopped anywhere. We walked the entire route (several kilometers in fact), although we also had our own weapons and shells, we took everything as befits paratroopers. Somehow we reached the trenches of our neighbors. They flew there. Hecked out. Got in touch. They waited Our driver was injured then, so there had to be another car. The enemy struck again with mortar fire. Aimed at 120 mines for 15 minutes, and it seemed like an eternity. There was darkness in everyone's eyes, screams, it is clear that the head was bursting from pain, contusion. Our brother's leg was torn off by shrapnel, already in the dugout they provided him with medical assistance, they wanted to save him. But, unfortunately, the heart couldn't stand it&#8230; What am I leading to? In battle, the main thing is not to lose control and the ability to manage people during combat. Quality training saves the lives of military personnel on the front lines. Therefore, using such personal examples, we explain to the mobilized what reality awaits them and why it is so important to be ready for anything. The contingent of mobilized people are completely different people in terms of psychotype, social status, with different life problems and the like. We determine the degree of motivation of each person, for this we conduct testing, and we continue to work with them in classes on national and patriotic training. When working with recruits, psychological preparation is also important. Their combat effectiveness directly depends on the emotional health of servicemen. After all, we understand very well that things happen differently in war, in moments of panic, in stressful situations, a person can go -into a stupor- and, unfortunately, die. Therefore, we teach how to cope with stress and pressure, make decisions and, most importantly, work in battle as part of a team. So how to master yourself in crisis situations. There is such a simple exercise -Square-. It is quite effective. To calm down, a serviceman must breathe. He visualizes a square, on inhalation he moves his gaze to the right corner, on exhalation lowers it, on inhalation to the left corner and again on exhalation to the upper corner. In such a simple way, a person distracts himself, focuses on breathing and calms down over time. Next, it is important to teach the unit commander how to act in similar situations. He is the commander, the leader. And he should not shout at a subordinate when he is not in his right mind. The great war has been going on for three years, and the people who are coming now, unfortunately, are not prepared at all. Many people do not even know elementary things, this is primarily some basic knowledge of tactical medicine. There is YouTube: there are a lot of video courses on tactical medicine, which demonstrate in detail what the MARCH algorithm is. See how the machine is disassembled and assembled. There are shooting ranges, airsoft training that everyone loves, it's all available. People should study before they join the army. It will be easier for instructors in training centers to prepare you, because there will already be some basis. And, again, even if you've already joined the army, don't feel sorry for yourself. Especially during the preparation period. Work at the maximum, at 200%, at 300%, so that it will be easier for you in the future. Absorb as much information as possible, ask questions, always be interested in everything. It will be easier for you in battle. I will give an example. We had a set where we conducted BZVP for contractors. The youngest was only 18, and the oldest was probably 27 years old. So, they came to us already charged, hungry for knowledge. You know, it's like a blank slate on which you can write your best story. Or like the clay from which you mold that perfect fighter. To this day, thank God, the boys are unsubscribing, thanking them for the training. And as always, the next guys are asked to -pump- even more. Every Ukrainian man must protect his family and country. This is an axiom. You are either here in the army or, due to your health, you work for defense in the rear. There are many professions in the Armed Forces where you can be useful. Now there are recruiting centers, they will help you choose your profession. Prepare yourself for the fact that Ukraine must be defended. It will not be the case that some fight and others sit and wait for the war to end by itself. Will not end. We have such a category of citizens who say: they will come to my home, to my city or village, then I will go to fight. But it will be too late. The military, who were in the war, they understand this perfectly. They say that many Ukrainians are simply afraid of dying in the war. Yes, people are afraid, everyone is afraid. A person who is not afraid is just crazy, I think. Fear is good. If there is no fear, it is bad, especially when you are at war. Some say they are afraid of TCCs. We have already found a solution for you: allow military units to mobilize people directly, bypassing the TCC and SP. In my opinion, this should be done much earlier. There would be fewer negative stories, which Russian propaganda is very fond of spreading in order to discourage mobilization in our country. Mobilization is a matter of state survival. It is necessary to change the military at the front, who have been fighting there for almost 1,000 days.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/10/yak-vyzhyty-u-boyu-abo-chogo-korysnogo-navchat-na-bzvp-lajfhaky-vid-instruktora-dshv/	2024-11-09T20:31:31-08:00
They no longer know how to scare: the Russians have seen Poles in the TCC	However, this is a fake, said the UNITED24 platform, because it has never published such ads or posted such a video. In the fake video, they say that approximately 47% of the staff of the TCC are Polish citizens who have signed contracts with the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. Such a step is apparently necessary in order to fight corruption during mobilization in Ukraine and to increase the efficiency of the TCC. The video itself was assembled by propagandists from footage that has nothing to do with the so-called -mass service of Poles- in the TCC. For example, with the help of a reverse search fact checker -Vox Ukraine- united24-> found a photo of the former head of the Odesa regional TCC and SP Oleksandr Okhrimenko, on which the Ukrainian chevron is visible. The photo was taken on December 12, 2023, during his press conference in Ukrinform. First, the Russians showed Okhrimenko's real chevron, and then a redacted one with the flag of Poland. In the original pictures, only the Ukrainian flag is present. There are also grammatical errors in the video. For example, -territorial center of recruitment and social support- was translated as TRSSCs, but it is correct TCR and SS (Territorial Centers of Recruitment and Social Support). The main goal of this and similar fakes is to disrupt the mobilization campaign in Ukraine. Russians no longer know how to scare Ukrainians so that they do not join the army. Each time their lies are more and more detached from reality.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/10/stopfejk-uzhe-ne-znayut-yak-lyakaty-rosiyany-pobachyly-v-tczk-polyakiv/	2024-11-09T20:11:04-08:00
Even the bridge to the Crimea is protected by the Russians not by quality, but by quantity	The spokesman of the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, captain of the 3rd rank, told about this on the broadcast of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon Dmytro Pletenchuk. — The enemy is indeed taking steps to strengthen the defenses of this facility. Accordingly, it is impossible to say that these actions have absolutely no result. Whatever quality, whatever principles these weapons are used, in any case, of course, quantity matters, he said. So even in the case of the Kerch bridge, Russians traditionally try to increase quantitative indicators for themselves and do not improve quality. — Just in the case of the so-called -Crimean- bridge, we see that the Russians very often take precisely the quantitative indicator. Because, as practice shows, it is quite difficult for them to repel attacks of even not the most modern weapons with the systems they use, the spokesman explained. However, the number of weapons collected to protect the bridge is still capable of producing results. — Given the amount of anti-aircraft they have attracted, they can still do this from time to time. They try to protect it both from the air and from the water. For this, they use various hydrotechnical structures and aviation patrols, Dmytro Pletenchuk said. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that threat of strikes -calibres- from the Caspian are not zero, but extremely insignificant.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/09/navit-mist-do-krymu-rosiyany-zahyshhayut-ne-yakistyu-a-kilkistyu/	2024-11-09T12:21:59-08:00
Maneuver defense and -meat- assaults: the operation in Kurshchyna continues	told about this on the telethon -Edyny Novy- > spokesman of OTU -Siversk-, Colonel Vadym Mysnyk. — The enemy continues to maintain the intensity of shelling along the entire strip of the northern border. These are Chernihiv, Sumy and part of Kharkiv regions in our area of ​​responsibility. By terrorizing the local population, in addition to this, they are thus tying up our combat units. These are hundreds of kilometers of the border so that we cannot concentrate them or use them in the hottest areas of the front, he said. The occupiers hit the territory of the Kursk region most intensively. — The greatest concentration of shelling and fighting, [concentration] of enemy forces on the territory of the Kursk region is where fierce battles are currently taking place. They have a nimble nature on our part, the spokesman said. Instead, the enemy tries to fight not with skill, but with the number of personnel and equipment, in the usual way. - They are constantly forced to bring various reserves here - both from the depths of their territory and from other areas of the front. -When they run out of armored vehicles, they send small groups of infantry to attack,- he said. The Russians use the accumulated forces and resources extremely inefficiently. — The enemy uses the tactics of meat assaults. We do not see anything new. They accumulate manpower, equipment and try to use their advantage precisely in this with assault actions. But our soldiers in defense are very good and the enemy's losses in the last two days have been significant, Vadym Mysnyk said. The Russian invaders treat their own civilian population on the territory of Kurshchyna just as ruthlessly. - Just demolishes all its settlements to zero. Over the past day, the enemy used 46 anti-aircraft missiles in Kurshchyna, and 15 anti-aircraft missiles this afternoon. Dropped 60 UAVs, 32 [hits] by FPV drones, the spokesman said. The occupiers are also actively using artillery and mortars. Over the past 24 hours, 264 shellings and about 1,200 explosions have been recorded in the Kursk region controlled by the Defense Forces. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that voyuvaty-po-inshomu-rosiyany-ne-vmiyut/->Russians -take their own settlements to zero and hit their own population-, because they don't know how to fight in any other way.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/09/manevrena-oborona-ta-myasni-shturmy-operacziya-na-kurshhyni-tryvaye/	2024-11-09T12:06:32-08:00
The number of KAB drops in Kharkiv region has increased: the purpose of the enemy has been explained...	A representative of the communications service told about this on the air of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon with the public of the -Charter- brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine, Sergeant Volodymyr Degtyarev. — The beginning of the Kursk operation had a certain result, for example, in the fact that the number of used anti-aircraft guns in Kharkiv region significantly decreased. If there could have been dozens in May-June, then they practically disappeared, he said. However, in recent weeks, the number of guided aerial bombs dropped by the enemy on Kharkiv region has increased significantly. — In the last few weeks, the enemy has started using guided aerial bombs again. -Mostly in the city, on civilian infrastructure, mostly in the evening or at night, although there are also daytime shellings,- said the guardsman. — It is very difficult to find logic in the application of [CABs]. Sometimes they just hit the highway. Sometimes, like last night, in the center of the square, in Derzhprom, which is a UNESCO monument, or simply in suburban buildings. It is very difficult to find any logic, apart from the fact that these are obviously attempts to intimidate the population, Volodymyr Degtyarev noted. He said that the detonation of a guided aerial bomb is truly depressing. — Those who have watched even the video of detonation of guided aerial bombs, see that the blast wave from them reaches hundreds of meters. Their impression is simply incredible. And, in fact, now it is one of their main means of such, one might say, massive destruction, - emphasized the representative of -Charter-. ArmyInform previously reported that lyudyna-distala-poranen/->Russian troops shelled Kup'yansk again: two people were killed, one more person was injured.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/09/chyselnist-skydiv-kabiv-po-harkivshhyni-zrosla-metu-voroga-poyasnyly-v-sylah-oborony/	2024-11-09T11:51:47-08:00
The threat of strikes - calibers - from the Caspian: not zero, but extremely insignificant	The spokesman of the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, captain of the 3rd rank, told about this on the broadcast of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon Dmytro Pletenchuk. — There are currently no confirmed facts of the Caspian Sea being used to launch missiles that could fire at our territory. There are cruise missile carriers there, that's a fact. Their technical characteristics allow them to be used from such a distance - this is also a fact. However, there are currently no confirmed examples of such use - and this is also a fact, he emphasized. The military noted that there are at least two Caliber carriers in the Caspian Sea who fled there from the Black Sea. -There are at least two carriers that are being tested for the Black Sea Fleet, which were forced there from the Azov-Black Sea region,- the spokesman said. In view of this, the danger of using -Caliber- sea-based missiles from the Caspian Sea is not zero, but extremely small. — The danger can be considered to be present, but the distance is quite large and it will allow to react in time to such launches. Considering the technical characteristics of these missiles, the probability of their destruction is very high, Dmytro Pletenchuk emphasized. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that enemy fleet The Black Sea fleet is on deaf defense: defenseless Russian ships are protected from drones by aviation.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/09/zagroza-udariv-kalibramy-z-kaspiyu-ne-nulova-ale-vkraj-neznachna/	2024-11-09T11:34:35-08:00
Enemy KABs in the South significantly increased: the results of disappointing statistics	About this on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- mentioned the spokesman of the OUV -Tavria - Colonel Vladyslav Voloshyn. — From the beginning of September, the Russians made certain changes in the design of guided aerial bombs and these bombs began to fly further. They hit with these bombs, struck even in the center of Zaporozhye, he said. The military gave the following statistics of the dropping of KABs in the South for October. -In October, in the Southern direction, the Russians used about 500 guided aerial bombs specifically on Ukrainian positions and on populated areas near the line of combat,- said a military officer. About a third of these 500 CABs occur in the last week of October. — Already this month, during the first 9 days of November, the enemy also used about 150 guided aerial bombs. That is, the enemy began to use guided aerial bombs more, because they bring him a certain result and it is very difficult to fight with this type of weapon. It is better to fight him when these bombs are still on the ground, and not somewhere in flight or already on the ground, Vladyslav Voloshyn emphasized. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in the South the occupiers are preparing for assaults and have named which areas are most at risk.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/09/vorozhyh-kabiv-na-pivdni-suttyevo-pobilshalo-pidsumky-nevtishnoyi-statystyky/	2024-11-09T11:19:59-08:00
The number of enemy assaults in Toretsk decreased, but Russian losses increased	Major Anastasia Bobovnikova, spokeswoman of Luhansk OTU, told about this on the broadcast of the Suspilne Novosti marathon. — The number of assaults has decreased in this direction. However, if we look at the nature of these assaults, it has [also] changed. -We can see that the enemy is using more personnel,- she said. This leads to a significant increase in the casualties of the occupiers. — They suffer much greater losses. Today, every day we see that the enemy loses 50-70 people killed and wounded, which is about 5% of the total losses of the Russians per day, the officer noted. This is how the spokeswoman described the Russian assaults in the urban development of Toretsk. - You can imagine what these assaults are like: there are a lot of Russian personnel in the urban development. They are hiding somewhere, sitting somewhere. And we, of course, detect them and try to destroy them as efficiently as possible. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in the area of ​​Chasovoy Yar and Toretska, the enemy is preparing to intensify assaults: the units of the occupiers are well equipped contractors.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/09/kilkist-vorozhyh-shturmiv-u-toreczku-zmenshylas-odnak-vtraty-rosiyan-zrosly/	2024-11-09T11:07:11-08:00

How the channel helps to protect Chasiv Yar was explained in OTU -Luhansk-	Major Anastasia Bobovnikova, spokeswoman of Luhansk OTU, told about this on the broadcast of the Suspilne Novosti marathon. — The canal next to Chasiv Yar is a natural fortification that protects Chasiv Yar. In order to cross this channel, [the enemy] needs to build certain crossings and bridges. In order to bring the bridge, at a minimum, there should be no active fire [from the Defense Forces], she said. Gunners of units of the Defense Forces keep the canal under fire control. — We, in our turn, protecting this channel, of course, will not give such an opportunity [to the enemy] and we will take every opportunity to stop the crossings and keep this channel under the watchful eye of our artillery, — Ukrainian drones will also not allow vehicles to cross the enemy channel . — Also, FPV drones work very skillfully. Our drone operators have a very high level of training and also have a very high level of creativity. They are constantly inventing new and new ways that Russia can't chew,- Anastasia Bobovnikova stressed. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in the area of ​​Chasovoy Yar and Toretska, the enemy is preparing to intensify assaults: the units of the occupiers are well equipped contractors.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/09/yak-kanal-dopomagaye-zahyshhaty-chasiv-yar-poyasnyly-v-otu-lugansk/	2024-11-09T10:42:04-08:00

In the South, the occupiers are preparing for assaults: which areas are most at risk	The most endangered areas on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyni- named the spokesperson of the OUV - Tavria- Colonel Vladyslav Voloshyn. — At the moment, the situation in general is not much different from the situation that has been here for two or three weeks. The enemy continues shelling, continues strikes. They are shelling not only the positions of the Defense Forces of Ukraine, but also the cities located in the front-line zone and in the South of Ukraine in general, he said. The officer reported that the Russian command is accumulating forces and means with the aim of intensifying assault operations on certain sections of the battle line. — Russian troops, according to our intelligence, are quite actively preparing to conduct assaults on certain sections of the demarcation line. They are carrying out and some have already carried out the occupation of [positions], they have pulled up the replenishment. Ammunition has been received and is being replenished, and engineering and aerial reconnaissance of our positions is being actively conducted, the spokesman said. All this indicates that the enemy is preparing for assaults, and some assault groups have already been moved to advanced positions. — They are preparing to start assault operations. Some assault groups have already been moved to forward positions. This indicates that sometime in the near future the enemy will start storming our positions, the military officer explained. However, according to him, we are talking about some kind of large-scale offensive, namely assault actions in separate local areas. -I don't mean any big offensive, but assault operations will begin on one of the sections of the combat line,- said Vladyslav Voloshyn. Also, the spokesman of the -Tavria- military command center named the most threatened sections of the combat confrontation line in the South. — The most dangerous look, and we know about it, that the opponents are preparing to carry out assaults there, this is the area in the Vremivsk direction, where the settlements of Levadne and Rivnopil are located. This is a plot near Gulyaipol. This is a section of the battle line, the so-called Robotynsky salient, where our counteroffensive took place and certain territories were liberated, the military said. There, the enemy will try to align the battle line. -In addition, there is certain information that on the coastal territory on the left side of the Dnieper, where Kamianske is located, the enemy is also concentrating a certain amount of forces and means for the preparation of assault groups with further assault actions,- said the spokesman of the -Tavria- OUV .

Survival and Fear of the Commander: The motivation and drive of the occupiers remain unchanged	A representative of the communications service told about this on the air of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon with the public of the -Charter- brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine, Sergeant Volodymyr Degtyarev. -Their basic motivation is survival, their basic driver is fear of the commander and the barriers,- he said. Soldiers of the Russian army do not trust their own commanders and do not expect any help when wounded. Their only chance to stay alive is to surrender in captivity. — They understand that if they are injured, they have virtually no chance of evacuation or quality tactical medicine. Therefore, most of those who come to us to surrender, they come with injuries, expecting that at least here they have a chance to survive, - said the soldier. However, despite a low level of critical thinking and only basic training, the enemy remains dangerous due to its sheer numbers. — The mere fact of having such a mass of people allows them to be used as consumables. In principle, they have minimal functions: to get here and there, to shoot in this direction, - explained Volodymyr Degtyarev.

The last personnel reserve of the Russian Federation: the enemy is recruiting teenagers	notifies the Service of Foreign intelligence of Ukraine. The number of vacancies for teenagers aged 14 to 18 increased by 76% during the year. From July to September 2024, the demand for young professionals increased several times. Minors are most actively employed in large companies. In particular, the number of employees under the age of 18 increased ninefold in the -Magnet- retail chain. At the same time, the number of minors working informally is increasing. There are 6 million citizens aged 15 to 17 in the Russian Federation, but a little more than 1% of them work. By the end of 2023, the number of employed persons aged 15 to 17 increased by 40% to 87,000. In 2022, their number was 61.6 thousand. persons The total shortage of personnel in the Russian Federation reaches 5 million people. The involvement of minors is facilitated by the state policy of the Russian Federation aimed at simplifying the employment procedure for them. Employers, in conditions of acute shortage of personnel, are forced to create jobs that involve part-time employment and a flexible schedule especially for young people. A draft law on easing the admission of minors to harmful and dangerous work has been submitted to the -State Duma- of the Russian Federation. Thus, under the conditions of the war, underage workers became a personnel reserve for the Russian Federation against the background of a serious labor shortage.

It's about walking quite a long distance to get into the forest strips they still control, he said. The -foot tactics- of the enemy are evidenced by various data, in particular, the losses of the enemy in the area of ​​responsibility of the -Charter- brigade. — If we look at the figures of enemy losses on our site for the past month, we will see that 200 enemies have been destroyed and a total of 20 pieces of equipment. These are mainly light vehicles and light vehicles, motorcycles, ATVs, just one tank. This indicates that, at least in this area, for certain reasons [the technique] is not used, the military said. It is possible to learn about the reasons for the enemy's refusal to use the equipment only on the basis of objective data, since the prisoners that the -charters- manage to capture have an extremely low level of situational awareness. - Why exactly, what are these reasons, we can only make hypotheses, because the captives we take are usually expendable material. All the prisoners we have taken in the last few months are yesterday's prisoners with a very low level of critical thinking. They have no connection with the world, any means of communication is taken away from them. All they know is what their commanders tell them. They get minimal information, the guard explained. The tasks of the enemy soldiers are simple, if not to say primitive - to run to a certain point, deliver some cargo. - Their task is to try to get from point to point where they are met by the next guide and sent on. The calculation is that out of ten, at least a few will make it, and eventually, somewhere in the accumulation point, there will be enough people to make some kind of movement in our direction, Volodymyr Degtyarev said. Equipping such -disposable- enemy combatants is easiest with basic soldier gear. — Basic soldier equipment. Given that they have to carry basically everything on their person, this is the basic small arms. In the forest areas, where they have been for a long time, they have accumulated quite a lot of weapons, which we are trying to track down and destroy. However, in the main, those with whom our fighters face in battle, if we are talking about some shooting battles, are equipped only with basic shooting weapons, the -charter- said. Earlier, ArmyInform explained why the occupiers are saving equipment for Kharkiv Oblast.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/09/vytratnyj-material-jde-pishky-ta-nese-vse-na-sobi-kym-i-yak-voyuye-rosiya-na-harkivshhyni/	2024-11-09T08:42:59-08:00

At the so-called -talks about important things-, the occupiers planned a mandatory review of the main theses of the Russian dictator during his speech in Valdai. Naturally, in this way, the enemy develops a cult of personality among the young generation and at the same time distorts reality by shifting the responsibility for the war to the victim.

In the Pokrovsky direction, fighters of the 425th OSHB -SKALA- cleared the trenches from the Russians. During the assault, the Russians hit our Bradley BMP twice, but the vehicle withstood the blows, landed the infantry and returned to our positions. Fighters of the Belarusian regiment named after Kastus Kalinovsky defeated the Russian assault group. In this they were helped by the automatic grenade launcher Heckler &amp; Koch GMG. Since the Russians are increasingly attacking with infantry without the cover of armored vehicles, automatic grenade launchers are very effective in destroying them. These and other topics are discussed by our presenters - lieutenant colonel Serhii Misyura and captain Artem Golub.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/09/bijczi-skaly-znyshhuyut-rosiyan-majbutnij-flagman-vms-proviv-strilby-strim-iz-pryfrontovogo-mista/	2024-11-09T07:51:08-08:00

Who is in the boat, who is under it: five men tried to conquer the Tisza on a two-seater watercraft	About this reports State Border Service of Ukraine. The incident happened in the evening when the border patrol noticed a group of people moving quickly towards the border. The attackers had already tried to board the boat, but the craft was too small for everyone, so some men jumped into the river, trying to swim across it on their own. Border guards pulled the men out of the cold water, detained them and took them to a unit where they were able to warm up. The detainees were residents of Mykolaiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Cherkasy and Zakarpattia regions. The men said they paid between $8,000 and $11,000 for a -safe- border crossing. After receiving the funds, the shippers reported that they would have to cross the Tisza River in a two-seater rubber boat. Administrative protocols have been drawn up against the detainees for illegally crossing the border. Currently, the identification of persons involved in the organization of this offense is ongoing. ArmyInform reminds that it is better not to break the law or risk your life, but to use the aggregator of vacancies in the Armed Forces and recruiting centers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/09/hto-u-choven-hto-pid-nogo-pyat-cholovikiv-namagalysya-pidkoryty-tysu-na-dvomisnomu-plavzasobi/	2024-11-09T06:50:06-08:00

Soldiers instead of armor: why the occupiers save equipment in Kharkiv region	This was told on the air of the national telethon -Yedini Novyni- the spokesman of the OTU -Kharkiv- Lt. Col. Yevgeny Romanov. — We observe that the enemy is trying to recruit people to replace the losses he has suffered. He also accumulates ammunition, concentrates equipment in certain areas, but does not use it, but uses infantry assaults. He takes care of equipment, unlike people, he said. The spokesman explained why the Russian command acts in this way. - Because he doesn't have enough equipment. The Ukrainian Defense Forces destroyed a huge number of his armored combat vehicles and he has a shortage of this equipment. He is trying to repair old models, but this process is slower than they burn on Ukrainian soil, Yevgeny Romanov explained. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that the Russians stormed five times in the Vovchansk district under the cover of airstrikes.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/09/soldaty-zamist-broni-chomu-okupanty-ekonomlyat-tehniku-na-harkivshhyni/	2024-11-09T05:32:11-08:00

In addition, he noted that speaking purely about weapons, there is contract work. Arms manufacturers and suppliers from all over the world send their commercial offers to the agency, and specialists choose the best conditions for price, quality, speed of delivery and guarantees. -After that, the advance payment and receipt of the goods are already made. At the same time, during the year, the MOU together with the agency are actively working to try to implement the elements of competitive bidding as much as possible.

Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces: Drones have become a key element of success on the battlefie...	He wrote about this on his Facebook page. At the monthly meeting with the commanders of the UAV units, General Oleksandr Syrsky listened to the report of the commander of the Unmanned Systems Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Colonel Vadym Sukharevskiy, about the creation of drone units and the results of their use in combat conditions. The participants discussed the experience of using drones in difficult circumstances, including the use of interceptors and drones for long-range missions, even in the face of Russian electronic warfare. Considerable attention was paid to the implementation of the latest technologies and tactics of using drones. The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine thanked the combat commanders of the unmanned units, in particular the crews of the 414th regiment of the CSW BPS and the 412th battalion of the BPS SBS, for their high level of professionalism and efficiency. He emphasized that despite the difficult weather conditions, the UAV units of the Armed Forces demonstrate high efficiency. The biggest impression on the battlefield is made by strike bomber drones, which have completed more than 7,000 combat missions. During October, these complexes struck more than 52,000 targets, including destroying 129 artillery systems, 221 pieces of radio equipment, and more than 4,000 enemy soldiers. -We continue to destroy the enemy 24/7,- concluded General Oleksandr Syrskyi.

The weather will not stop the enemy's infantry: that will give the defenders the desired result	told about it on the air -Suspilnye News- Captain Yuri Fedorenko, commander of the battalion of unmanned attack air systems -Achilles- of the 92nd separate assault brigade named after Kosh Ataman Ivan Sirk. — As long as the enemy has manpower, this will not significantly affect, in my opinion, the conduct of hostilities. Again, where it started is my subjective opinion, for the first time mass assaults in any weather - in snow, in rain, and in mud - were carried out precisely by -Wagner- on the flanks of Bakhmut. It didn't matter then - if the equipment doesn't pass, the infantry soldier passes, he said. This was effective for the enemy, but only up to a certain point - as long as he had enough reserves. — It gave results. Regardless of the fact that the losses were disproportionate, the enemy was still able to push through. But, if you remember, at that time at some point they pearl-pearls, it seemed that there was a very difficult situation, and then at some point -Wagner- ran out. They began to be replaced by -regulars-, and at that time the Defense Forces stabilized the situation, Yuriy Fedorenko said. In the same way, even now the enemy will not be able to carry out shock-assault actions without regular replenishment of manpower, which is massively knocked out by units of the Defense Forces. — It is fundamentally important for them to be fed with additional personnel. For this, they are currently using the services of North Korea and are currently building additional personnel in one way or another in order not to stop pressing, the drone commander explained. How long the Russian command will be able to act in this way depends on many factors, primarily on the effectiveness of the destruction of enemy manpower by units of the Defense Forces not only directly on the battle line, but also in the enemy's rear. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in Kharkiv Oblast, the enemy is storming with active fire support.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/09/pogoda-pihotu-voroga-ne-zupynyt-shho-dast-zahysnykam-bazhanyj-rezultat/	2024-11-09T03:39:40-08:00

From a factory guard to a school director: the collaborator turned Vovchansk into a center of Russif...	The Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office informed about this. It is noted that an indictment has been sent to the court against a 36-year-old resident of Vovchansk, who is suspected of collaborative activities. According to the investigation, during the occupation of the city of Vovchansk by Russian troops in the summer of 2022, the man agreed to cooperate with the invaders. Before the invasion, he worked as a security guard at a local factory, but after the occupation, he voluntarily took the position of director of school No. 1, created on the basis of the Vovchansky Lyceum. In his new position, the suspect organized the transfer of the educational process to the Russian language and planned to teach Ukrainian schoolchildren according to Russian educational standards. He also collected lists of teachers to send to courses in Belgorod and received methodological recommendations from the occupation administration. In September 2022, before the deoccupation of the city by the Armed Forces, the man fled with the Russian military to the territory of the Russian Federation. He is currently wanted, and his case will be heard in absentia in the Chuguyiv City Court. The suspect faces up to three years in prison. As reported by ArmyInform, the man who became the hero of the propaganda video and organized the broadcast of Russian channels.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/09/dyrektor-kolaborant-peretvoryuvav-vovchansk-na-oseredok-rusyfikacziyi/	2024-11-09T02:51:10-08:00
UAVs, -solntsepok-, FPV-drones: in Kharkiv Oblast, the enemy is storming with active fire support	About this on the air of the national telethon -Yedini Novyni- spoken the spokesman of OTU -Kharkiv- Lt. Col. Yevgeny Romanov. — The enemy does not stop storming the positions of Ukrainian troops in the Vovchansk region. With the support of air strikes, the enemy tried 5 times to storm the positions of Ukrainian servicemen, but all these attempts were in vain. An enemy that advanced like this and was left lying on the battlefield, he said. The spokesman told what forces and means the occupiers use during the assaults — usually they use powerful KAB strikes. Tonight, 5 rockets were used against the TOS-A-1 -Sunset- flamethrower system, FPV drones are used and, of course, artillery fire, the spokesman said. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in Kharkiv Oblast Ukrainian soldiers burned two enemy heavy flamethrower systems.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/09/kaby-solnczepok-fpv-drony-na-harkivshhyni-vorog-shturmuye-za-aktyvnoyi-vognevoyi-pidtrymky/	2024-11-09T02:38:53-08:00
Animal fear, 15 kilometers on foot and 90% loss of equipment: why in Kharkiv Oblast Russians walk ov...	told about it on the air -Suspilnye News- Captain Yuri Fedorenko, commander of the battalion of unmanned attack air systems -Achilles- of the 92nd separate assault brigade named after Kosh Ataman Ivan Sirk. — [Enemy] tactics remain the same. When the enemy has the opportunity to actively use lightly armored or armored vehicles, he uses them. But the enemy loses a significant amount of this equipment on the battlefield - up to 90%, which is in the zone of damage of both our anti-tank weapons and drones. For long-range logistics, the enemy will use light armored vehicles quite actively, he said. When the enemy's armored vehicles run out, the occupiers switch to motorcycles and buggies, and when they run out, they go on foot. — When the enemy runs out of this technique, he resorts to assaults at the expense of highly maneuverable vehicles - two-wheeled motorcycles, buggies, other pickup-type vehicles. When they are lacking in a moment of time, it is mostly living power. They move along landings, run across a clear field and thus try to shorten the distance as much as possible and accumulate, the military said. In some places, enemy soldiers have to cover very considerable distances on foot just to reach their own forward positions or assault lines. — At some rallies, the enemy went through the entrance to advanced positions in the region of 12-15 kilometers. Step by step, they are trying to reach, accumulate and move to shock-assault actions, Yuriy Fedorenko said. At the same time, the losses of the occupiers are extremely high, but they still continue to go. — During such movements, the enemy suffers very significant losses, indeed very significant losses. The question arises why they stick, why they do not surrender to captivity, which can motivate in a clean field to run from one landing to another, realizing that out of 8 people who run, out of 8 occupants who run, one or two will catch up, they are see what motivates you to move forward? - the officer asked the question and then answered it himself. According to the commander of the drones, the occupiers are driven by an animal fear of their own henchmen. — This is an animal fear of one's spouse. The occupier understands that if he returns to the rear, he will not be able to be heard by his own - he is guaranteed to be either destroyed or publicly punished, and there are still a number of tools and coercion. Therefore, the occupier chooses death on the battlefield rather than returning to his people, he explained.

You can't even call this a drone: the French military is interested in the MALE Aarok UAV weighing 5...	UAV developer Turgis &amp; Gaillard is actively promote to the market its MALE Aarok drone (Medium Altitude Long Endurance, in Ukrainian - great endurance at medium altitude), ArmiyaInform reports. French developers, when presenting the new Aarok drone, immediately called it the first European military drone of the MALE class. MALE is an American acronym for the medium-altitude, long-duration drone community. Thus, Aarok MALE can be considered a direct competitor and analogue of the American reconnaissance and strike drone MQ-9 Reaper (-Reaper-), which our editors detailed told in one of her publications. Interestingly, the French drone is developed by a comparatively small private company, Turgis &amp; Gaillard. The company was founded in 2011, has about 300 employees, and an annual turnover of 50 million euros. The 5.5-ton UAV will stay in the air for 24 hours thanks to a turboprop engine that produces 1,200 horsepower and is relatively quiet. According to unofficial information, the power plant will be the Ardiden 3TP Safran engine. At the air show in France, a model with a PT6 engine from the Canadian branch of Pratt &amp; Whitney. The manufacturer separately emphasizes the high strength characteristics of its drone, which allows it to take off even from unprepared airstrips. It is possible to operate from ground airfields in any weather conditions in the automatic take-off and landing mode. The cruising speed of the French drone is 250 knots - 463 km/h, the cruising altitude is 9150 meters (echelon FL300). Technical characteristics of Aarok: Like the American Reaper, the French drone Aarok can stay in the air for up to one day. This allows the use of UAVs to operate over the open sea for maritime patrol and reconnaissance tasks. The drone is equipped with a retractable landing gear. Among the interesting features, the optical-electronic surveillance station is installed closer to the tail of the drone. The station includes electro-optical and infrared cameras and a laser range finder. Laser target illumination and guidance of guided weapons are possible. In the middle part of the drone's fuselage, a multi-mode radar can be installed, which is used, among other things, for ground surveillance and mapping tasks. It is also possible to search for sea and air targets. The manufacturer reports that the drone can carry up to 4 high-precision guided munitions (GPS-INS, laser or infrared guidance) weighing 250 kg or up to two munitions weighing 500 kg each. The stated target engagement range is 35 km. In addition, the drone can carry up to 16 air-to-ground missiles with a range of up to 15 km. Most likely, we are talking about AGM-114 Hellfire missiles or analogs, specific models are not disclosed. Compared to its competitors, the UAV is much lighter and cheaper than the EuroDrone, which is currently being developed by Airbus Defense &amp; Space. In the future, the French Air Force should receive six EuroDrone systems, currently four copies have been ordered for an amount of approximately 2 billion euros. General Stéphane Mille, chief of staff of France's Air and Space Forces, thinks it is a -quite attractive- aircraft, reported by the Zone Militaire portal. -And I'm willing to pay to see, because there is sometimes a gap between what we announce and what we can do,- he told a parliamentary hearing. -Aarok is a very interesting project, to be very clear. Overall, the work is of a high quality and is carried out in a relationship of trust between Turgis &amp; Gaillard and the departments of the Ministry,- noted the country's Minister of Armed Forces, Sebastien Lecornu.

Massive attacks by Shaheds: why the enemy chose such tactics and how many reserves he has. Expert op...	-There are several reasons why Russia started to use Shaheda so massively against Ukraine. The first is geopolitics. Elections were held in the USA, there is a new president. And all geopolitics today is built on strength. Putin is showing the collective West and the USA that Ukraine remains important to him and the Russian Federation. And in order to stop this horror of war, he trivially raises the stakes. He wants to be spoken to on the terms he needs. The second point is also related to Donald Trump. During the election campaign, Trump announced that he would end the war in 24 hours, and that he would end aid to Ukraine as such. Russians have a very simple logic. If the US stops helping Ukraine, then missiles for Patriot air defense systems will become less, as well as for all other types of weapons, for example, for Stinger MANPADS. By the way, our defenders perfectly beat the Shaheds with them. That is, the Russians want to use their relatively inexpensive UAVs to deplete the Ukrainian stockpile of anti-aircraft missiles. Fewer rockets means a lower knockdown ratio. And then, according to the classics, launch a major missile attack on Kyiv and Ukraine. For the occupiers, our capital is not only the main goal in their war of aggression against Ukraine, it is also a sacred place. They cannot accept that the -Russian city- is resisting. Therefore, daily UAV attacks are another attempt to put constant psychological pressure on the population, with the aim of breaking the motivation for resistance. Rashists think that sooner or later the people of Kyiv will not endure and will start internal riots against Ukrainian statehood itself. He said, it is necessary to end these horrors of war and to agree on something. This is absurd. What is the enemy's logic? Even if at least one -Shahed- has achieved its goal, it does not matter whether it is a critical infrastructure object or a residential building, then the terror must continue. Another goal of the Kremlin is the economic terror of the Kyiv agglomeration, which is the largest in Ukraine. Many large enterprises that pay taxes to the state budget are concentrated here. When an air alert is declared, all these businesses cease operations. Accordingly, output decreases, and this, of course, leads to a decrease in tax revenues. After receiving in the second half of 2022 the first batch of Iranian Shahed UAVs, Russia was able to launch their mass production on its territory, as well as significantly modify them. The enemy managed to increase the production of -Shaheed- to about 2,000 pieces per month. That's a pretty big number. But, I think, they will not go higher. They have the highest explosives production capacity. They managed to raise by 30% the production of alcohol compounds used in explosives, gunpowder and aluminum powder. They also have a problem with the workforce. Of course, there are enough workers. But everything that they could put in order, they have already put in place. Without the direct help of China and Iran, the Russians will not be able to further increase the production of Shaheds.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/09/masovani-ataky-shahedamy-chomu-vorog-obrav-taku-taktyku-i-na-skilky-u-nogo-vystachyt-zapasiv-dumka-eksperta/	2024-11-08T20:48:50-08:00
Subletting and lifting: about the amount of payments and why it is profitable to enter into a contra...	What is the difference between -sub-hire- and -elevation-, and who can receive such assistance, ArmiyaInform tells. This is, in fact, compensation for housing rent at the place of service. It is paid if the serviceman does not have his own housing in this territory. It should be noted right away that the procedure for issuing compensation is not very simple and fast. And it may also require certain costs, in particular for obtaining certificates. The basis for payment is a serviceman's report, as well as list of documents, determined by Cabinet Resolution No. 450. But if you go this way and arrange everything, you can get quite a good amount of compensation. In particular, the following amounts have been set for 2024: For servicemen with three or more family members, compensation amounts will increase by one and a half times. This is the assistance that is provided in the event of the relocation of servicemen to a new place of military service in another settlement in connection with appointment to a military position, enrollment in military educational institutions and military colleges or training centers, the term of study in which is six months and more, without retaining the position at the previous place of service or in connection with the redeployment of the military unit. Or after graduating from military educational institutions with appointment to positions in units in other settlements. More details about who can receive such assistance is prescribed in the Order of the Ministry of Defense No. 45. How much is paid? Moving allowance is paid in the amount of a monthly allowance for a military serviceman and 50 percent of a monthly allowance for each member of his family who moved with him to a new place of military service; Per diems are also paid for each day of stay on the road to a serviceman and each member of his family who moved with him. Who are considered family members? These are the persons listed in the serviceman's personal file, in particular: How many times can you receive in the event of a frequent change of duty station? Moving allowance is paid no more than for two moves of a serviceman during a calendar year. What is needed? They are paid on the basis of the order of the commander of the military unit, which is issued on the basis of the serviceman's report. In addition, the order specifies whether the wife (husband) is a military serviceman. If necessary, the commander can organize verification of the authenticity of data on the relocation of family members of a serviceman. If both the husband and the wife are military servicemen, the lifting allowance for each of them is paid at the new place of military service, for family members - from the monthly allowance of one of them. Currently, this applies to servicemen serving under a contract or enlisted officers. Unfortunately, mobilized servicemen do not have such an opportunity. But this may be one of the motivating factors for signing a contract with the Armed Forces of Ukraine. More about the opportunities provided by the contract service you can read here. And about the peculiarities of concluding a contract martial law actions, here.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/09/pidnajom-i-pidjomni-pro-rozmir-vyplat-i-chomu-vygidno-ukladaty-kontrakt/	2024-11-08T20:36:47-08:00
Was -Lebedev- became -Lebedenko-: the Russian Federation is spreading a fake about the Ukrainization...	The Ministry of Digital Transformation of Ukraine, which is responsible for the functioning of -Dia-, stated that such messages were not sent and are fake. In addition to the traditional grammatical errors in the text of the screenshot, which indicate a fake, any user of -Actions- will notice a font that is not typical for this application. This fake is another propaganda attempt to discredit the Ukrainian state system and inflame tension in society by spreading false information about the alleged forced imposition of Ukrainian identity on citizens. In addition, the fake name change is a typical example of -mirroring-. For Ukrainians, such practices are absolutely atypical, but for Russians, the compulsion to change names and surnames to ones that are considered Russian is a phenomenon that has been widespread since the 17th century. In the 30s and 40s of the 20th century, the -Russification- of surnames became massive in the USSR: on the one hand, people saved themselves from repression, on the other, they sought career growth, which was impossible with a -non-Russian- surname. Among the most famous examples is the father of the ex-leader of the Ministry of Murder of the Russian Federation, Shoigu Kuzhuget, who, in order to appear more -Russian- and to pursue a party career, changed his first and last name. Even now, the Russians have not given up on this: in the occupied Ukrainian territories, people are encouraged to change their Ukrainian surnames when obtaining Russian passports.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/09/buv-lebedyev-stav-lebedenko-rf-poshyryuye-fejk-pro-ukrayinizacziyu-prizvyshh-v-diyi/	2024-11-08T20:09:33-08:00

The man received payment in Russian rubles for this. Moreover, the accused himself gave an interview to Mariana Naumova, a Russian propagandist, which was later broadcast on the First Channel. In the recorded video, the man, deliberately distorting the facts, denied the armed aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine. He spoke in support of the enemy's actions, presented the Russian military as -liberators- and told how the aggressor state -cares- about the local population, providing the residents with -human aid-. The man was awaiting trial while in custody. During the trial, the accused pleaded not guilty. Regarding the interview, the man stated that he does not remember whether he made any comments on camera. The guilty verdict was issued by the Chuguyiv city court of the Kharkiv region.

On October 17, 2022, the Council of the European Union adopted a decision to establish a European Union Mission to provide military assistance to Ukraine with an initial term of two years. The strategic goal of the mission is to contribute to the strengthening of the military potential of the Armed Forces of Ukraine to restore and effectively conduct operations to allow Ukraine to defend its territorial integrity within internationally recognized borders, effectively exercise its sovereignty and protect the civilian population from armed Russian aggression. So far, the European Union Military Assistance Mission to Ukraine has trained 63,000 soldiers of the Armed Forces. In the coming months, the mission will train an additional 15,000 troops, bringing the total number of trained soldiers to 75,000 by the end of winter 2024/2025. The European Union Military Assistance Mission to Ukraine conducts individual, collective and specialized training of the Armed Forces on the territory of the European Union, as well as coordinates and synchronizes the activities of the member states regarding training. The training is accompanied by the provision of lethal and non-lethal equipment to the Armed Forces. The European Union mission to provide military assistance to Ukraine is financed from the European Peace Fund. The future training objectives of the European Union Military Assistance Mission to Ukraine will be constantly adjusted in terms of the number of troops to be trained and skills in accordance with the combat needs expressed by Ukraine and in coordination with partners. Ensuring Ukraine's military training is one of the areas of activity within the framework of joint security obligations between Ukraine and the EU, signed in June 2024.

The F-16 protected Donald Trump, but missed the mark on tenure	About the most famous use of the F-16 fighter during the incident, which could potentially become one of the attempts to assassinate Donald Trump, says ArmyInform. Patrolling of the airspace of the United States of America, including F-16 fighters, is carried out as part of the comprehensive control of North American airspace and airspace, which is provided, implemented and coordinated by the United States and Canada's Joint Aerospace Defense System. The joint US-Canadian air defense and missile defense system is subordinate to the North American Aerospace Defense Command. Abbreviated from the first letters of its name in English, it is known as NORAD. NORAD's headquarters and command center are located at the US Peterson Air Force Base, but the command is joint US-Canadian and is responsible for the airspace security of both countries. There are three regional headquarters under his command: the Alaska NORAD region at Elmendorf Air Force Base; the Canadian NORAD Region in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and the Continental NORAD Region at Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida. An F-16 Fighting Falcon from the Minnesota ANG performs a simulated interception of an aerial target during the EAA AirVenture 2024 air show in Oshkosh, Wisconsin NORAD's primary mission is to protect the sovereign airspaces of both nations by responding to unknown, unwanted, and unauthorized actions in the airspace. and the surrounding area of ​​North America. Forces and assets under NORAD monitor the airspace around the clock with the aim of detecting unauthorized actions, track air targets and, if necessary, carry out a set of measures with the aim of diverting them from their flight path, forcing them to land or destroying them if they can pose a potential threat. NORAD works in close cooperation with the US National Guard, law enforcement agencies, special services and all other components of the security and defense forces of the United States of America and Canada. Patrolling American airspace, NORAD pays increased attention to the places of stay of the President of the United States. The American media has repeatedly drawn attention to the significant increase in costs for the security of the first person of the state, including due to the fact that F-16 fighters must be constantly in the air with the support of refueling aircraft in order to provide combat air patrol (CAP) within the limits of the temporary no-fly zone around the president. During the presidential elections in the United States, the protection of the candidates for the position of the President of the United States is provided not only by the Secret Service, which is responsible for the protection of senior political figures, but also by other components of the security and defense forces of the state. This year, even the Pentagon joined the protection of candidates in the presidential elections. NORAD is also traditionally involved in patrolling the airspace in the places of rallies and other meetings of candidates for the President of the United States of America with voters. This was done both during the recent presidential race and in previous election campaigns. Increased attention to the protection of US presidential candidates is fully justified, because assassination attempts are quite frequent. Among the latest high-profile cases, we can mention the assassination attempt on the now elected US President Donald Trump on July 13, 2024 at a campaign rally in the town of Butler near Pittsburgh in the state of Pennsylvania. Then the bullet hit Trump's ear, which for a while became a symbol of the unity of the electoral core of voters around the figure of a charismatic candidate. Judging by the results of the vote, the shots to the side and next to the candidate for President of the United States ultimately contributed to his victory. However, this is far from the only and not the first time that Donald Trump's life was or could be in potential danger during the election campaign. During one of these incidents, an F-16 patrol fighter of the NORAD mission took a prominent part in preventing a possible attempt on his life. The incident occurred during a Donald Trump campaign rally on October 28, 2020 at Laughlin/Bullhead International Airport in Bullhead City, Arizona, when an unidentified aircraft entered the closed airspace without authorization, creating a potential threat to the then-current To the President of the United States of America. The pilot of the offending aircraft did not communicate with the air traffic controller and did not respond to radio warnings. NORAD's statement on the incident states: -A NORAD F-16 aircraft tracked a general aviation aircraft that failed to communicate with air traffic control and entered the temporary restricted flight area around Bullhead City, Arizona without proper clearance.- Seeing that the offending aircraft did not respond in any way to the initial interception procedures, the F-16 fighter pilot fired a warning shot, using flares to attract attention. After that, it was possible to establish radio communication with the offending aircraft and it was taken out of the prohibited zone. The firing of F-16 flares became a bright part of the pre-election show. The US president and the crowd of protesters in his support were delighted by what they saw, although they did not understand exactly what was happening. -Oh look at that! Look, look, look! They pointed to the future President! How about that?- - shouted Donald Trump, instantly noticing how to take advantage of the situation. After that, the politician, who is prone to outrage and is not picky in his words, did not forget to scold the Democrats and the American media. According to him, they never report or show anything really interesting and important, and even seem to have deliberately turned the cameras in the other direction in order not to film the F-16. It is not difficult to make sure that Donald Trump's statements turned out to be far from reality - the incident was reported in detail by dozens of local and national American media. Instead, the statement that the F-16 pointed to the future President of the United States by firing signal missiles turned out to be quite true, although somewhat premature. Donald Trump lost the 2020 presidential race then but won the current 2024 US Presidential election by a landslide.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/08/f-16-zahystyv-donalda-trampa-odnak-ne-vluchyv-shhodo-kadencziyi/	2024-11-07T20:58:47-08:00
It destroys what it cannot seize: the Kremlin already realizes that it will not be able to take Odes...	Military expert Petro Chernyk told ArmiyaInform about this: -Ukraine is one of the five largest countries exporting grain and leguminous crops in the world. Almost 500 million people around the world are supplied with Ukrainian grain, primarily African countries. This is a huge number. This is also a serious source of foreign currency income for our state. Therefore, the Russian strikes are aimed at reducing the export potential of Ukraine, which for grain and other crops is carried out mainly by sea. racists want to undermine our country economically. There is an important nuance. Russia is also among the top 5 grain exporting countries. The Russian Federation produces from 70 to 140 million tons per year and sells two thirds of it. So if we do not grow and sell our grain to foreign markets, then Moscow will replace us, enrich itself even more and replenish the budget for military purposes to continue the war of aggression against Ukraine. An interesting point. If the Russians set about destroying our port infrastructure, this is a sign that the Russian Federation will no longer be able to return Ukraine to its circle of interests. If the enemy understood that he could completely return Ukraine, he would not destroy the golden hen that lays the golden eggs. That is, the Kremlin already realizes that it will not be able to take Odeschyna. We need to strengthen our air defense, particularly in the south. There is a reflection on the part of South Korea regarding the transfer of anti-aircraft missile systems of their production to us. This is the Cheolmae-2 medium-range air defense system, a rough analogue of the German IRIS-T system. By the way, the Korean complex was developed using technologies from the Russian S-350 and S-400 air defense systems. Maximum range to the target: 40 km. But, again, we must understand that it will not be possible to completely close the airspace over Ukraine. Even if the maximum number of air defense systems is installed in Ukraine, there will still be a breakthrough.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/08/znyshhuye-te-shho-ne-mozhe-zahopyty-kreml-vzhe-usvidomlyuye-shho-vzyaty-odeshhynu-ne-zmozhe-dumka-eksperta/	2024-11-07T20:53:15-08:00
-- Russians? Drop your weapon-! They didn't quit. And I shot: as Junior Sergeant Dobosh broke throug...	Mr. Ilya is 48 years old. In the army - since May 2022. Joined the ranks of the 51st separate rifle battalion of the 63rd separate mechanized brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Military accounting specialty is machine gunner. Behind his back is a term of service in the Crimea, in Feodosia, from 1994 to 1996, after Ukraine declared independence. Served in the ranks of the construction battalion. He recalls how his military unit could not -say goodbye- to the Soviet -stars- on their uniforms for a long time - although the neighboring unit had already switched to tridents. In civilian life, he managed to master many professions: a driver, a logger, a security guard, and a forester. Originally from Transcarpathia - from Mukachevo. -Why did I join the army in 2022? Because I understood that if everyone stays at home, then the Russians can be at my doorstep. Besides, my brothers went to war. When I learned about it, I also went to war. Do I regret going into the army all the time of the full-scale war? No,- says the army man. The military man has a number of hot spots behind him, including battles for Bakhmut. Now he is on the difficult Lyman direction. The other day, at the end of October, during combat missions, he destroyed up to 10 enemy personnel and prevented a breakthrough in his position. The military recalls: -I was just at training - mastering a new combat vehicle, MTLB. He came back on Saturday, on Monday he took a turn at the front. And here they go, 20 meters away from me. I ask: -Russians? Drop the weapon!-. They lined up like goslings. The weapon was not thrown. I shot. A few hours later, a new batch arrived. They were also shot,- the unit commander succinctly recalls. The most terrible thing, says Mr. Ilya, during a large-scale invasion was when the brothers were on one side of the battle, and he was on the other. -It was scary whether I would see them again: whether I would survive or they would survive. Then it was really scary. But everyone survived, thank God. It's hard to lose your friends&#8230; Recently, I lost a close friend: a landmine flew and he was cut by shrapnel. I pulled him out of the trench, he was dragged into the car on a stretcher, but, unfortunately, he was not taken to the hospital. Three children remained and the wife&#8230; -. Mr. Ilya suffered a concussion during those events. Now undergoing treatment. But they try to find time during the war for jokes - where would we go without that. -Once they said to the fellow: -Listen, the commander was urgently looking for you! Run as fast as you can to him!-. He rushed, ran 300 meters, and only then remembered that the commander was on vacation. He stopped and turned around - and my friends and I were lying there, laughing,- Mr. Ilya recalls. The need for people in his department is palpable, says Mr. Ilya. But he emphasizes that reliable fighters are needed. -I have to be sure of my brother - that he will not let me down and will not run away anywhere. As in his commander. And this, in fact, is one of the main tasks of the commander: the fighter should not be afraid of him. He should, by his own behavior, encourage him to perform his duty well, and not to -jump on his skis- and go home. You have to treat your soldiers humanely, otherwise he won't be a good soldier, he won't want to serve.- When asked what victory will be in the Russian-Ukrainian war, Mr. Ilya answers: -When I return to my family. When my brothers, alive and well, return to their families. Someday there will come a time when we will all gather in some cafe and sit together, remember the service, remember those who are not with us. Let's remember all the good and not so much. This will be a victory for me.- Photo from the personal archive of Ilya Dobosh	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/08/rosiyany-kydajte-zbroyu-ne-kynuly-ya-j-postrilyav-yak-molodshyj-serzhant-dobosh-proryv-na-lymanskomu-napryamku-vidbyvav/	2024-11-07T20:26:46-08:00

Jumping into holes and pretending to be a hose: the Russians are trying to save themselves somehow	The head of the planning department of the 13th brigade of the operational assignment -Charter- of the National Guards of Ukraine Lieutenant Colonel Anton Baev. - They have chosen such a system - we partly forced them to this, because during their movement we constantly inflict fire damage on them, constantly hit them. They hide in those -holes- that they equip and dig on the routes of their tracking. A very large number of -burrows-, everywhere along all the routes they mainly use, he said. The guardsman described the usual tactics of the occupiers: - When the fire attack begins, there is a -hole- somewhere, where they all climb. If not everyone climbs there, then they hide under the trees. In the same case, if Russian soldiers are found while moving in open areas where there is no shelter, they fall down and pretend to be dead. — If we find them in some areas where their usual tactics are impossible, then they simply fall down and either pretend to be dead, or just lie there and not move, hoping that they will not be seen. But it doesn't work, the military man emphasized. Earlier, ArmyInform explained that prompts Russians to surrender as prisoners in Kharkiv Oblast.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/07/strybayut-u-nory-i-prykydayutsya-shlangom-na-harkivshhyni-rosiyany-namagayutsya-vryatuvatysya-hoch-by-yak/	2024-11-07T11:53:25-08:00

Property is not worth life: the military explained the importance of evacuation from the north of Kh...	About the importance of timely evacuation on the broadcast of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon the representative of the communications service told Sergeant Volodymyr Degtyarev of the -Charter- Brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine. — Liptsi is a strategic settlement, because it is located on commanding heights and from there it is possible to hit Kharkiv with barrel artillery. From there, we managed to knock out the Russians back in May, and we continue to knock them out [further]. However, now it is practically a ghost village with no civilians because it is constantly hit by both FPVs and other means and artillery, he said. The military officer noted that there are no hostilities on the territory of the village itself, but it is absolutely impossible to live in it under constant fire from the Russian military. — There are no hostilities as such, but there is no life there, no population, because all civilians have been evacuated from there. And here I would like to remind you about the importance of evacuation from front-line zones because property is not worth human life - the Guardsman noted that the evacuation of civilians from the zone of active hostilities also significantly facilitates the work of the Ukrainian military and gave a specific example when the absence of civilians made it possible to neutralize a Russian manned aircraft a bomb that did not explode. — It makes it easier to get around, to locate, and basically to work. For example, recently our sappers had to neutralize an unexploded anti-aircraft gun that fell into one of the sheds right in Liptsi. There is no possibility to take out the KAB, that is, they have to be blown up. This is an explosive wave that can reach a quarter, and it is obvious that we definitely need to be sure that there are no civilians nearby, Volodymyr Degtyarev emphasized. Earlier, ArmiyaInform showed how the -Charter- fighters destroyed a 500-kilogram KAB in Liptsi.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/07/majno-ne-varte-zhyttya-vijskovi-poyasnyly-vazhlyvist-evakuacziyi-z-pivnochi-harkivshhyny/	2024-11-07T09:11:55-08:00

The fog hides everything: in the north of the Kharkiv region, the enemy is being watched despite the...	The head of the planning department of the 13th brigade of the operational assignment -Charter- of the National Guards of Ukraine Lieutenant Colonel Anton Baev. — Weather conditions are changing and are currently changing for the worse. We are seeing more phenomena such as fogs, which last longer during the day and are very disruptive. It starts to get darker earlier, the night part of the day gets longer, more cold comes. That is, the conditions of the war are changing and now everyone is adapting to them, both us and the enemy, he said. However, the activity of the enemy in view of the weather conditions has not decreased - the occupiers are intensively preparing for the onset of winter with further significant cooling. — The enemy is currently accumulating, pulling up its reserves. We see enemy soldiers approaching with heavier loads, gear and equipment. Perhaps they are bringing to their positions and preparing various insulation for winter, the military said. Instead, enemy offensive actions in the area of ​​responsibility of the -Charter- brigade decreased. — The enemy has not carried out offensive actions in the last 2-3 days. Armored vehicles were not recorded, but a lot of movements are recorded, the guardsman noted. The officer explained that the weather affects both sides equally, and who uses it to their advantage depends a lot on planning and preparation. — The weather affects both sides equally: both us and the enemy. How to use it depends on the task and the mind of those who use it. But the fact that it complicates the work is precisely because even the same intelligence - both winged intelligence and intelligence through drones that is taking place - its quality becomes worse, the officer explained. This forces the soldiers of the Defense Forces to look for new ways to detect the enemy, and not just rely on the usual reconnaissance with the help of UAVs. — We understand that we can no longer fly so far, we can't hang for so long, the fog hides everything, that is, thermal imaging devices on drones do not always help. This is a powerful factor that greatly affects intelligence and it is necessary to take it under close control and constantly look for some alternative sources of information and somehow solve it, because there is less information due to the fact that we do not see each other, Anton Baev emphasized. Earlier, ArmyInform explained, who will take advantage of the change in weather conditions in the Kharkiv direction.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/07/tuman-vse-pryhovuye-na-pivnochi-harkivshhyny-za-vorogom-stezhat-popry-zminu-pogodnyh-umov/	2024-11-07T08:27:09-08:00

In the Kharkiv region, drone operators from the -Sharp Cartouches- special unit of the NSU -Omega- tracked down three Russians who were calmly chatting near a burning house.

A representative of the communications service told about this on the air of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon with the public of the -Charter- brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine, Sergeant Volodymyr Degtyarev. — The weather is getting worse, weather conditions are getting more difficult. At night, in the morning and for most of the day, there is fog, which, accordingly, limits the use of UAVs, both reconnaissance and strike, both enemy and ours, he said. The military explained that the more prepared side will be able to take better advantage of the change in weather conditions. - It is clear that this is used by someone who is prepared for it. From our side, we see that the enemy is trying to bring down separate small groups of fighters, to replenish their losses, which they have suffered in recent weeks, in particular in our sector, - said the guardsman. Currently, in the area of ​​responsibility of the -Charter- brigade, the occupiers have practically given up the use of equipment. - They practically do not use trucks, cars, and armored vehicles, because we have successfully burned almost everything that appears in recent weeks. Therefore, their tactic is to move in small groups that carry ammunition, food, rigging groups trying to bring in some fuel, - said Volodymyr Degtyarev. The spokesperson of -Charter- reported that currently, despite the deterioration of weather conditions, the guardsmen continue to effectively destroy the enemy with the help of heavy night drones. - We understand from the intercepts, we hear that they are restless, because, despite the weather, our night drones continue to disturb them, bomb their fortifications every night. They have difficulties with evacuation, because it is practically non-existent, because the equipment does not come, so most of their wounded remain there and sooner or later turn into two hundred, - said the representative of the public relations service. He also spoke about the enemy's losses during October. — If we look at the results of enemy losses for the past month, we can see that we hit a hundred and they will never see this world again, and more than a hundred are wounded. However, it is possible to assume with great probability that these losses are also irreversible, - noted Volodymyr Degtyarev. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that Russians are gradually being -pushed out- - from the north of the Kharkiv region - in October, they completed the de-occupation of 400 hectares of forest massif within the boundaries of the Lipetsk community of the Kharkiv region.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/07/pole-boyu-v-tumani-vijny-hto-skorystayetsya-zminoyu-pogodnyh-umov-na-harkivskomu-napryamku/	2024-11-07T05:52:16-08:00

The enemy plans to integrate -Cossacks- into fake volunteer battalions on the TOT	About this informs Center of National Resistance. The battalions perform a propaganda function and are designed to create the impression that the local population is voluntarily fighting for the occupiers.

Now the Kremlin has decided to merge these two fake structures. Hoping in this way to at least slightly increase the number of fighters in the -battalions-, as well as to emphasize the narrative that, they say, -Cossacks- support the aggressor.

Sanctions work: oil refining stops in the Russian Federation	This is reported by Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. The shutdown of the refinery is predicted to have a negative impact on the domestic volumes of oil refining, the fulfillment of export obligations, worsen the situation with the supply of fuel to the domestic market, and increase the costs of maintenance and modernization of enterprises. It is expected that the volume of oil refining capacities during downtime will be 1.8–2 million tons per month. The real reasons for the downtime of the refinery in the Russian Federation are limited access to Western equipment and components due to international sanctions and the impossibility of replacing foreign spare parts necessary for the maintenance and modernization of the refinery. In fact, the Russian import substitution program did not produce significant results. Actually, Russian equipment manufacturers provide only about 30-45% of market needs, and only in some components (pumps, compressors, reactors, etc.). Also, the Russian Federation failed to use China as an alternative supplier of equipment, since Chinese technologies are not always compatible with Russian equipment, which sometimes requires a complete replacement of equipment and significantly increases repair and maintenance costs. Earlier ArmyInform reported , that the Russians forcibly throw men from TOT into the infantry in Kurshchyna.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/07/sankcziyi-praczyuyut-u-rf-zupynyayetsya-naftopererobka/	2024-11-07T03:53:04-08:00

In the words of X platform user Mason (@mason_8718) who reports regularly and in great detail about South Korea's defense industry, the Hyunmoo-V is classified by the ROK military as a -super-capable ballistic missile- (UPBM). Although the Hyunmoo-V was previously announced profile publication The Defense Post, the South Korean military has not yet provided any precise or definitive information about its characteristics. Usually, such information is deliberately withheld in order to make it difficult for an adversary to obtain information about new developments. However, the experts of the Army Recognition defense portal made some technical explanations. With a height of 15 to 16 meters, a diameter of 1.6 meters and a weight of 36 tons, the Hyunmoo-V has the dimensions of an intercontinental ballistic missile. For comparison: the modern American ICBM Minuteman III has a length of 18 meters, a diameter of 1.7 meters and a weight of 35.3 tons. Intercontinental ballistic missiles are usually equipped with nuclear warheads and have a range of more than 10,000 kilometers. In Minuteman III, the nuclear warhead weighs 400 kg; the missile can cover a distance of 13 thousand kilometers. For the Hyunmoo-V, the corresponding figure should be only 3 thousand kilometers - and that is under the conditions of using a warhead of reduced weight. Weapons experts have estimated that the range is only 300 kilometers when fully loaded. But the explosive power of the rocket is huge. The heaviest warhead reportedly weighs up to 9 tons. This means that the Hyunmoo-V may now be the most powerful conventional (non-nuclear) weapon in the world when it comes to explosive power. Until now, the American GBU-43/B aerial bomb was considered as such a weapon, better known as MOAB, which contains 8.48 tons of explosives. Ballistic missiles cannot even come close to such parameters. They are designed for nuclear warheads that cause great destruction at a much smaller mass than conventional explosives. The closest to the Hyunmoo-V in terms of parameters is the Chinese Dongfeng 21C, which can carry a 2-ton conventional warhead at a distance of up to 1.7 thousand kilometers. This begs the question: Why would a weapon as large and bulky as an ICBM but with a much shorter range be needed because it has an extremely large payload? The point is that Hyunmoo-V was built for a specific purpose and to be used against a specific opponent. The warhead, which reportedly weighs up to 9 tons, is so heavy because it is a penetrating part, also known as a -bunker destroyer.- Her kinetic energy must penetrate walls and the ground before exploding. North Korea's fortified facilities are the target. These include command centers in the mountains, weapons factories in tunnels, command bunkers and underground nuclear facilities where North Korea is stockpiling nuclear materials. At the beginning of 2024, South Korea announced the successful test of Hyunmoo-V missiles. According to preliminary data, the tests probably took place in December 2023, when the missile was launched from the west coast and hit a group of islands located at a distance of about 185 kilometers from the launch point. This distance is comparable to the distance between Seoul and Pyongyang, which underlines the missile's importance to South Korea's defense. In theory, Hyunmoo-V could also be used as a hypersonic glider, for example, to destroy ships. South Korea is working on one of them, but it has not yet been unveiled. Photo 5.

The Joint Strike Ship (JSS) is currently in the concept development stage. It is designed to be able to launch as many cruise missiles of different sizes and for different purposes as possible. Construction of the three ships is scheduled to begin in 2030. Official Seoul plans to purchase at least 200 Hyunmoo-Vs. They are manufactured by the South Korean company Hanwha Aerospace, which is a key player in missile development of the Republic of Korea.

Consequences of drone strikes in Kyiv: houses are on fire in the city, a medical facility and a busi...	This was reported by the head of KMVA Serhii Popko. According to him, a fire broke out on the 33rd floor on an area of ​​50 m², which led to the partial destruction of the building structures of the 34th technical floor. The fire has been extinguished, there are no casualties, residents are being evacuated. Debris from drones was also recorded in Obolonskyi and Solomyanskyi districts. In the Obolonsky district, debris caused a fire on the upper floor of a business center, there is no information about the victims. In Solomyansk, debris fell on the territory of an industrial enterprise and a medical center. So far, medics have hospitalized one victim from the territory of the enterprise. In addition, a two-story private house is on fire in the Podilskyi district, and units of the State Emergency Service were dispatched to the scene. As reported by ArmyInform, as a result of the attack by drones of the Russian armed forces on Kyiv, in the Holosiivsky district, an apartment in a residential building was damaged. Also in this area, a fire was registered on the territory of the garage cooperative. Rescue services are already working at the scene. In addition, next to the garages that caught fire in the Holosiivskyi district, a fire broke out at a nearby service station. The total area of ​​the fire is 300 square meters.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/07/naslidky-udariv-dronamy-po-kyyevu-v-misti-palayut-budynky-poshkodzheno-medzaklad-ta-biznes-czentr/	2024-11-06T20:55:36-08:00
War in the sky: an expert spoke about the enemy's new developments in the field of UAVs	And now it is important to understand what is in the enemy's arsenal in order to effectively implement new developments to actively counter the enemy's drones. A well-known expert, former deputy chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, lieutenant general, spoke in more detail about this Ihor Romanenko: -After the events of 2014, we saw that unmanned aerial vehicles have a future. And what's more, by 2014, under my leadership, we developed the concept of combating the enemy's unmanned aerial vehicles, which was approved by the then Minister of Defense of Ukraine Yezhel. But due to the fact that his position, I I understand that it changed under the influence of the Russians, so this matter did not go beyond the concept. That is, this Minister only verbally promised to further promote this direction. But then, after all, our group from the Central Research Institute of Weapons and Military Equipment of the Armed Forces of Ukraine worked in this direction. It was in 2015-16 at the front, already during the Anti-terrorist operation. The group consisted of two parts. The first was involved in the implementation of our drone developments, which we had: Stork, Fury and a number of others. The second part of the group, which I headed, resolved the issue of how to fight the enemy's unmanned aerial vehicles. And at that time we focused on the means of radio-electronic warfare. The Russians were also developing all this, they worked out their developments. Unfortunately, at the end of 2022, the situation changed: the enterprises of the military-industrial complex of Russia overtook us in this direction. On our side, all this time the development of electronic warfare tools, which were supposed to suppress Russian drones, was going on. > This year, the enemy has modernized its drones in a number of directions. The first thing he did was apply artificial intelligence. What we are talking about here: when the enemy's FPV drone is aimed at an object that is covered by our electronic warfare means, at this stage the drone loses control and does not hit the target. And in order to overcome this, the Russians began to use elements of artificial intelligence. That is, they control the drone to the appropriate distance, and then the control passes to artificial intelligence, and EW tools do not affect it. So then the drone -captures- the target and then automatically points to it. The Russians have also modernized and are installing fiber optic cable on the drones. Optical fiber follows the drone, and it is controlled via a cable. Accordingly, our means of radio-electronic warfare do not affect the enemy drone. And this is how the target is hit. And now, from our side, there are developments that will fight with such means: in addition to fire damage, other options are offered. We must also say that due to the fact that we affected the enemy's A-50 long-range radar reconnaissance aircraft, the Russians have now switched to the use of tactical-level strike-reconnaissance systems. That is, they use a reconnaissance drone that can operate at a range of more than 100 kilometers. It scouts and drops data for the -Iskander- battery, which is working on purpose. ... Our Defense Forces, in turn, during 2023-2024 are actively scaling up the production of drones. Maybe we don't have much money for it, but there are talented developers. And by the way, the private sector is also now actively and effectively helping the army in this area. Well, there is always a question of time. We don't have time for everything yet, but the main thing is that we have the latest developments.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/07/vijna-v-nebi-ekspert-rozpoviv-pro-novi-rozrobky-voroga-u-galuzi-bpla/	2024-11-06T20:48:32-08:00
UBD benefits: as a participant in hostilities, you can park for free in the capital	ArmyInform tells about how combatants can take advantage of this benefit. According to the rules of improvement of the city of Kyiv, the right to free parking of vehicles is used: As reported in -Kyivtransparkservice-, at the moment, when parking, participants in hostilities need only attach a document entitling them to benefits to the lower left corner of the windshield. In particular, a copy of this document can be made and attached, and personal data can be redacted. In the future, the system of preferential parking should change. A corresponding algorithm is being developed. It is not yet known when exactly it will become operational. Therefore, it is worth following updates on the -Kyivtransparkservice- website. Please note that parking at municipal lots is paid only on weekdays from 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. At other times on weekdays and during the day on Saturdays and Sundays, parking is free. In total, 3 zones with parking lots are defined. You can read more about the addresses of the locations of such sites on the Kyivtransparkservice website.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/07/pilgy-ubd-yak-uchasnyku-bojovyh-dij-bezkoshtovno-parkuvatysya-u-stolyczi/	2024-11-06T20:33:39-08:00
Counterfeiters issue humanitarian aid for support from the state: why should they?	However, this is a fake, are written in the VoxCheck project. Despite the fact that the order shown in the video is real, the help shown in the video is unlikely to have been provided by the Ukrainian authorities. Most likely, this is humanitarian aid. After all, among the demonstrated items, there is not a single one that would be produced or sold in Ukraine. Instead, propagandists passed it off as state support for the families of fallen soldiers. The goal of such fakes is quite obvious - to devalue the life of a Ukrainian soldier and discredit the state authorities of Ukraine. We remind you that the families of Ukrainian soldiers who died at the front receive a one-time payment of 15 million hryvnias from the state. If a soldier died during the period of service, but not during hostilities, his relatives are provided with monetary assistance in the amount of 750 subsistence minimums. As of January 1, 2024, the subsistence minimum is UAH 3,028 for able-bodied persons. That is, the family of a fallen soldier receives almost 2.3 million hryvnias. However, this amount may change with changes in the size of the subsistence minimum. These sums, 2.3 million or 15 million, are divided equally between all members of the deceased's family. The following have the right to receive funds: parents of the deceased; one of the spouses who did not remarry; children under 18 years old; dependents. Also, families of soldiers who have gone missing, in addition to maintaining monthly payments for a soldier (postal salary, salary according to military rank, allowances for years of service, other monthly additional types of financial support), are provided with an additional payment, which was assigned to a soldier for participation in hostilities, in the amount of 100,000 hryvnias. The family is deprived of such payments if the soldier voluntarily surrendered, deserted or voluntarily left the military unit or place of service.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/07/fejkoroby-vydayut-gumanitarnu-dopomogu-za-pidtrymku-vid-derzhavy-nashho-cze-yim/	2024-11-06T20:07:28-08:00

Three agents of the Russian Federation who aimed Russian missiles at Prykarpattia received 13 years ...	This was reported by the Security Service of Ukraine. SBU officers detained the attackers in the western region of Ukraine in the first days of the full-scale war. The accomplices of the aggressor turned out to be three residents from Kyiv, Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia, who were recruited by Russian intelligence back in 2021. The agents acted as part of a group and -locked in- to several Russian curators, with whom they communicated through anonymous chats of the popular messenger. According to the instructions of the occupiers, those involved were supposed to prepare data for a missile attack on the airfield in Prykarpattia, and after the enemy attack to -report- on its consequences. In order to carry out the enemy's task, the agent from Kharkiv acted under the guise of a -travel blogger-, who used a drone to make a video of a panoramic view of a strategic object and posted the recorded files on Instagram. Another agent, a resident of Kyiv, settled near the airfield on the eve of the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation in order to record aircraft takeoffs and landings in real time. She provided the received information to a third member of the Russian agency to forward the intelligence to the occupiers. On February 24, 2022, agents tracked the consequences of a missile attack on an aircraft facility and sent relevant information to the Russian special services. SBU officers detained the traitors when they were preparing for -evacuation- across the western border. According to the materials of the Security Service, the court found the detainees guilty under Part 1 of Art. 111 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (treason). As reported by ArmyInform, a spy from Sloviansk received 15 years in prison.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/06/po-13-rokiv-tyurmy-otrymaly-troye-agentiv-rf-yaki-navodyly-rosijski-rakety-na-prykarpattya/	2024-11-06T11:11:28-08:00

Operation Gabriel: details of Russia's war crime against Ukrainian children	This is reported by the Security Service of Ukraine. We are talking about the commander of the 205th separate motorized rifle brigade of the Russian Armed Forces, Dzhabrail Yusupov, with the call sign -Gabriel-. According to the investigation, in July 2022, under his command, a group of 20 armed invaders broke into the Novopetriv special school and kidnapped 15 children. The children, together with the school principal and her husband, were taken to the Crimea, and later to Anapa, Krasnodar region of the Russian Federation. For a month, they were kept in a boarding house, where the children were forced to sing the Russian national anthem. Only in November 2022, thanks to one of the charitable organizations, it was possible to take the children from the Russian Federation through third countries and return them to their homeland. Based on the collected evidence, Yusupov was notified in absentia of suspicion for violating the laws and customs of war (Part 2 of Article 28, Part 1 of Article 438 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine). Currently, measures are being taken to search for him and bring him to justice. This is not the first time that the SBU investigates such crimes. Earlier, an occupation official of the Kherson region was exposed, who also participated in the deportation of Ukrainian children.

We will remind you that from 2025 it is planned to -fermerskoyi-produkczyiy-z-2025-roku->increasing purchases of farm products , which will provide the military with fresh seasonal fruits and vegetables. In addition,requirements for the caloric content of food products have been introduced, which guarantees compliance with their energy value to the needs of military personnel.

- Trump will be more decisive, he will resolve the battle deep into Russia, and the end of the war-,...	Some commentators were outraged, because -not a single US president has done anything good for Russia. Everyone contributed to the collapse of the Soviet Union, and now Russia.- Other swamp dwellers are outraged by the fact that -no one wants to work in our country- everything is not the same, and Trump will be more decisive. In his name, he will resolve the battle in the depths of Russia. And that's the end of the war.- Some -narrow-minded- tried to push the narrative that -Trump has traditional values, and that means Russia.- However, such a wretched man immediately received answers in the form of -He was shooting white tomahawks over the heads of our base in Syria, and then he said that his daughter had advised him so and he decided to strike!- Why do we need such a traditionalist who is ready to start a nuclear war?-. The rest of the Muscovites were very excited, because -under Trump, we received the most crippling sanctions-; he also gave more weapons to Ukraine than Obama. Israel also supports Trump, and therefore Russia's ally, Iran, will also be bad. It's not worth rejoicing.- One of the representatives of the Mokshan filth writes that -The elections will end and they will not go to the next one. If they go to the M-2 highway between Kursk and Belgorod, then they will shoot the road, and Belgorod will be in a semi-encirclement.- Some Russians say that -Politics is an eta bolshoy bardel, not a club of noble gentlemen.- For such a reckless decision and the death of our soldiers, all commanders-atsov, we need to go to a tribunal. Trump will start to prove that he is the best and then he will show how to talk to Putin.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/06/tramp-budyet-ryeshytelnyeye-razryeshyt-bit-vglub-rassiyi-tak-i-zakonchicza-vajna-uzkiye-nyyut-pro-peremogu-trampa-na-vyborah/	2024-11-06T07:43:56-08:00
The Ministry of Defense is testing new samples of women's winter uniforms and introducing elements o...	This was discussed during the meeting devoted to issues of inclusivity and barrier-freeness, held under the chairmanship of the Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine, Brigadier General of Justice Serhiy Melnyka. Yes, field trials of demi-season uniforms for women are currently underway. And the first samples of the winter uniform are prepared for scientific and research tests. -The introduction of women's form is important, in particular, because the dimensional grid of the form for men is not relevant for women,- Serhiy Melnyk said. At the same time, he added that the process is slowing down due to the low interest of manufacturers to provide test samples for the tests necessary to develop technical conditions for production. The Ministry also takes into account the results of field testing of summer uniforms and underwear. Changes to the technical conditions of certain elements of military clothing are already planned, taking into account the feedback of female military personnel. Serhii Melnyk also emphasized the need to provide women's bulletproof vests that would meet the protection requirements when reducing the weight of armor plates. Also within the scope of the -Wounded Package- project initiated by the Ministry of Defense this year, requirements for adaptive clothing that will be provided to wounded servicemen are being developed. According to the plan, from 2025, a set of such clothes will be issued irrevocably and free of charge at stabilization points and during inpatient treatment. The project covers all units of the Defense and Security Forces, therefore it requires interdepartmental agreement and the adoption of the relevant resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. In addition, as part of the implementation of the National Barrier-Free Strategy of Ukraine The Ministry of Defense will reconstruct part of its buildings by the end of 2024. -For this year, work on 10 medical facilities of the Ministry of Defense was planned and financed. Elevators, ramps and other equipment will be built and put into operation there, which will make life easier for servicemen who have received disabilities and have corresponding needs. We are already planning further steps in this direction for next year as well,- noted Serhiy Melnyk. The Deputy Minister of Defense added that a list of the Ministry's facilities, which will be subject to reconstruction in 2025, as well as the dates of the start and completion of works and sources of funding are determined. vprovadylo-novi-standarty-yakosti-formy/->introduced new standards of form quality.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/06/minoborony-testuye-novi-zrazky-zymovoyi-zhinochoyi-formy-ta-vprovadzhuye-elementy-inklyuzyvnosti/	2024-11-06T07:42:22-08:00

President Trump: great risks or great opportunities for Ukraine?	-During the months leading up to the US presidential election, I was asked many times the question: 'Who is better for us: Trump or Kamala?' The following answer seemed the most correct: Thus, with the victory of Donald Trump, we find ourselves on the threshold of a period of change. Despite the flurry of despair in the popular media, there is good reason to hope that the new administration's actions will be favorable to us. Let's find out why this is so. The years of Joe Biden's administration (2021-2025) will go down in history as a catastrophically unsuccessful period for the United States in the context of foreign policy. The surrender of Afghanistan to the Taliban, the large-scale Russian-Ukrainian war, the aggression of Iran and its proxy forces against Israel, the deepening of ties along the -axis of evil- Russia-China-Iran-North Korea - this is just a list of the main failures committed by Washington in previous years. Against this background, Trump's first term (2017-2021) was distinguished by an exemplary foreign policy strategy. Let's recall how in the mid-2010s terrorist attacks by the Islamic State took place in different parts of the world. Under Trump, the US military, together with its allies, eliminated the IS threat. At the beginning of 2020, the legendary (and infamous) Iranian general Qassem Soleimani was eliminated. Several Arab states signed a peace treaty with Israel (the Abrahamic Pact). A treaty was signed between North and South Korea. Currently, three actions of the Biden administration that prompted Vladimir Putin to attack Ukraine can be singled out: Donald Trump is now promising to do two things on his first day in office: close the southern border and restore oil production permits to make the United States the world's largest oil producer again. This should collapse the price, which has been holding for a long time at the level of $70-80 per barrel, favorable to the Russians. We have heard Trump's statements many times that he will stop the Russian-Ukrainian war in 24 hours. He even said several times that he would do it even before the inauguration, which is scheduled for January 20, 2025. Obviously, this will not happen so quickly, but the fact is that the newly elected president sees the Russian-Ukrainian war as a problem that needs to be solved as soon as possible. It is not for nothing that he, unlike Kamala Harris, mentioned Ukraine during most of his speeches on the eve of the elections. At the beginning, the priority of the new administration will be to stop hostilities, that is, to freeze the front line in current positions. Of course, one should not hope that Trump will immediately convince Putin to release all Ukrainian lands. But it is worth recalling his words a few months ago: -If Putin does not obey me, I will arm Ukraine to such an extent that he will regret it.- That is, the acceleration of the pace of arms delivery is considered by Trump as a way to deter Moscow. Let's not forget that it was during Trump's first term that Obama's embargo on the supply of lethal weapons to Ukraine was lifted. An extremely important factor is the fact that the Republicans won a majority in both houses of Congress. Full one-party control will ensure a high speed of decision-making, in particular regarding new aid packages for Ukraine. Broad bipartisan support for pro-Ukrainian initiatives will remain in the Senate and the House of Representatives. A negative factor can be Trump's entourage, led by his vice president JD Vance, Tulsi Gabbard, Robert Kennedy and others. Vance is known for his statements regarding the inappropriateness of large-scale US intervention in the Russian-Ukrainian war. He outlined his vision in an article for the New York Times, where he described the optimal scenario, in his opinion: freezing the front line and starting negotiations. However, it is worth noting that Vance never spoke about openly handing Ukraine over to Moscow. The activation of US foreign policy in other directions should be positive for Kyiv, in particular: Over the past four years, Washington has made many mistakes that need to be corrected immediately. We hope that an exemplary foreign policy strategy will be a feature of Trump's second term as well. Be that as it may, the main difference between the Trump administration and its predecessors should be the determination to achieve the chosen strategy, whatever it may be. Biden, Blinken and other incumbent officials have always made loud statements about supporting Ukraine to the very end, ensuring victory, etc. But their actions differed significantly from what they said: the weapons always arrived with many months of delay and in insufficient quantities. The USA did not provide Ukraine with everything it needed when we could develop success in the second half of 2022 (the Kharkiv operation and the liberation of Kherson), or when we were preparing for an offensive in the summer of 2023. Currently, the main task of President Zelensky is to direct Trump's determination in the direction we need. The Victory Plan presented by us should become the main argument during Trump's talks with Moscow. A period of indolence and indecision on Capitol Hill is being replaced by a time of great change and great opportunity. Opportunities that we should take advantage of.

The Russians tried to escape from our FPV drone on a -loaf-. The evacuation group of the occupiers could not break away from the pursuer, so they came up with nothing better than to throw out their -three hundredth- in order to gain speed.

$4,000 each from a swindler — in Transcarpathia, the head of the regional TCC and the deputy command...	The Security Service of Ukraine reported this on November 6. According to the materials of the National Police investigators, both figures acted separately, but used similar -schemes-: in exchange for bribes, they offered conscripts to avoid conscription on the basis of forged documents about -bad- health. To do this, officials provided potential conscripts with fictitious medical reports of the VLK about the presence of serious diseases. In the future, evaders used a forgery to remove themselves from military registration and could illegally leave Ukraine. The cost of such -services- was from $4,000 per client. On the basis of the received evidence, both officials are suspected (according to the crimes committed) under two articles of the Criminal Code of Ukraine: An investigation is ongoing to establish all the circumstances of the crime and bring the perpetrators to justice. Perpetrators face up to 10 years in prison with confiscation of property. ArmyInform reminds that it is better not to break the law or risk your life, but to use the aggregator of vacancies in the Armed Forces and recruiting centers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/06/po-4-tysyachi-z-uhylyanta-na-zakarpatti-vykryly-ochilnyka-rajtczk-ta-zamkombryga-teroborony/	2024-11-06T06:46:05-08:00
The General Staff of the Armed Forces explained why they are creating new brigades instead of replen...	The conversation with Dmytro Lykhoviei was published on November 6. -Recently, the enemy has increased the number of regiments, brigades and divisions and the number of personnel by almost 100,000 people. The length of the front line also increased. In order to close the front, new brigades must be created within the Armed Forces,- Dmytro Lykhova said. According to him, there is simply no other effective way to counter the enemy who prevails, as today there are 1,300 km of frontline with active combat clashes. He also noted that the Russian occupiers have a significant advantage, sometimes fivefold, on the battle line. -Therefore, when during hostilities there is a threat of losing the positions and lines of defense of certain brigades, the redeployment of individual battalions of other military units is used here. This is a logical and regulated method of action to strengthen the defense: when there is a threat of a breakthrough in problematic areas of the front, units from unattacked areas are transferred to it,- Dmytro Lykhova assured. He noted that in conditions of insufficient forces and means, this is the optimal way to counteract the prevailing enemy forces, thus reducing the risk of a breakthrough. Also, according to the spokesman, it should be taken into account that currently the Armed Forces do not have the opportunity to quickly replenish the brigades with personnel. -Such a need is scheduled a month in advance. It is also necessary to understand that the people who join the unit must undergo adaptation and coordination in it, and this takes time. That is why, to strengthen the section of the front, where there is a threat of a breakthrough, an already formed unit is used, which is ready to perform the task in a short time,- explained Dmytro Lykhova. In addition, Lykhovi emphasized that brigades are also needed for rotation and replacement of already existing brigades. -You can't limit yourself to the simple replenishment of brigades that have suffered significant losses either - because they need combat coordination. New brigades are needed to replace them and withdraw them from the area of ​​hostilities,- noted Dmytro Lykhovi.

Ukraine expects a new tranche of aid from the EU in the amount of 1.9 billion euros — Rustem Umyerov	He wrote about this on his Facebook page. In addition, Rustem Umyerov expressed his gratitude to the head of the Committee, Mrs. Delphine Pronk, and the EU ambassador to Ukraine, Katarina Maternova, for their constant help and support. Thanks to European partners, Ukraine is successfully implementing a number of important security initiatives, in particular as part of the EUMAM Military Assistance Mission, which since October 2022 has already provided training for more than 62,000 Ukrainian military personnel in EU countries. By the end of the year, this number will increase to 75 thousand. The minister welcomed the EU ambassadors' decision to extend the mission's mandate for another two years and expressed hope for conducting exercises directly in Ukraine, which would speed up the training of Ukrainian defenders. The Minister of Defense also called on European countries to invest in military production in Ukraine, proposing to conclude long-term contracts for the joint production of drones, long-range weapons and ammunition. He emphasized the expectation of a new tranche of aid from the EU in the amount of 1.9 billion euros at the expense of frozen Russian assets, as well as the importance of allocating an additional 6 billion euros from the European Peace Fund to strengthen the Ukrainian army. Rustem Umyerov emphasized that the future of Ukraine lies in the European Union and NATO, and the country will continue to strengthen cooperation for a joint fight against the coalition of dictatorships led by Russia.

After interrogation, it turned out that this Pitkevich has quite a long combat experience. In October 2022, while serving a sentence in one of the Russian colonies, he agreed to sign a contract with the private military company Wagner. As part of the units of the PKK, he initially participated in the storming of the settlements of Soledar and Bakhmut. In June 2023, he took part in the -hike- to Moscow, which was then organized by the leader of the -Wagner- PMK. In June of this year, he signed a new contract and entered the service of the 155th Marine Infantry Brigade of the Russian Federation. In August, when the brigade was transferred to Kurshchyna, he took a direct part in the hostilities as an assistant grenade launcher. At the end of September, he witnessed the murder of two Ukrainian prisoners of war near the settlement of Hlushkove. According to him, the order for the execution and subsequent removal of the heads from the bodies was given by the commander of the unit. -The prisoner of war gave his name, as well as the names of the soldiers - the direct perpetrators of this war crime!!!

the Russians executed at least 109 unarmed Ukrainian soldiers	This was reported by the National Information Bureau with reference to an interview with the head of the Department for Combating Crimes Committed in of the armed conflict, Office of the General Prosecutor Yuriy Belousov. According to him, the number of executions of captured Ukrainian soldiers began to increase significantly at the end of last year. Prior to that, the facts of torture prevailed. Yuriy Belousov emphasized that the physical destruction of Ukrainian soldiers in captivity, in particular through executions, torture and terrible conditions of detention, shows the elements of genocide. Ukraine collects evidence of the aggressor's crimes from all possible sources. These are the data of our military, intelligence, information from interrogations of Russian prisoners of war, etc. Despite all the complexity of investigating cases, caused by the impossibility of access to the scene of the crime, bodies and conducting an examination, there are real sentences for war criminals. In the future, not only the perpetrators will be brought to justice, but also the entire vertical of the organizers of such crimes: those who incited, gave orders and did not respond to such crimes.

An ecological disaster is approaching in the community and district. Next year, the Russians will leave Luhansk Autodor without large orders and, accordingly, without additional funds. Because contracts with this company are concluded only for the maintenance of highways. Repairs, in particular, and capital ones, will be carried out by contractors from Russia. Currently, five enterprises from the regions of the Russian Federation have already been selected, which will be involved in the work in the so-called LNR. The occupiers do not need foreigners.

According to the case materials, the suspect was a local pensioner, a former employee of the disbanded militia. She worked for the enemy through a -liaison-, an old acquaintance of hers, who was also an ex-militia. In 2014, he joined the DPR terrorists, and after the start of a large-scale war, he became a combatant in one of the reconnaissance and assault brigades of the Russian Armed Forces. According to the instructions of the Russians, the agent leaked the locations of fortified areas and firing positions of Ukrainian troops in the Kramatorsk direction to the -liaison-. First of all, the enemy was interested in the coordinates of the rocket artillery of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, as well as the routes of movement of tanker trucks with fuel, which were supplied to the front. In order to collect intelligence, the perpetrator drove around the area in her car and secretly recorded military objects. The counterintelligence officers of the Security Service exposed the traitor in time, established her location and arrested her.

Against infantry and tanks: what is known about the M136 Volcano remote mine system	As write the authors of the Taiwanese magazine The Liberty Times, created by American designers back in the 80s of the last century, the M-136 Volcano remote mine laying system is still in demand on the world arms market, ArmyInform reports. At least the military from this island immediately ordered 14 sets of these installations from the United States. The relevant agreement entered into force last year after the US State Department approved a proposed $180 million arms package that included Volcano systems and M977A4 HEMTT trucks. But in September of this year, Taipei received a message that these -remote miners- will not be delivered to the island until 2026. The M136 Volcano is an automated mine delivery system that can rapidly deploy large minefields in a variety of environments using prepackaged containers. This weapon is capable of quickly laying both anti-personnel and anti-tank mines over a large area, creating deterrents against potential enemy landings and vehicles. Defense publication experts Army Recognition underline the universality of the deployment of this weapon. -Volcano-, which is how the name of the installation is translated, can be both ground-based (Ground Volcano) and air-based (Air Volcano). The system is quick to assemble and disassemble and uses modified GATOR mines available in active or inactive canisters. The Ground Volcano modification is optimal for setting deep and tactical minefields. This system uses an M139 dispenser and an easy-to-operate dosage control unit. Ground Volcano uses modified GATOR mines, available in both combat and training versions. The system includes three main components: M87A1 ammunition, M88 and M89 training ammunition. Each M87A1 container contains six anti-tank mines and one anti-personnel mine. Anti-tank mines are equipped with magnetically induced detonators that are activated when objects with metal components move. This makes the mines particularly effective against armored vehicles. Anti-personnel mines, in turn, are activated with the help of strings that can reach up to 12 meters in length. The mines are 12 cm in diameter, 6 cm high, and each mine contains about 605 g of explosives. Mounted on an Oshkosh Defense HEMTT A4 M977A4 truck, the Volcano system can carry 960 anti-tank and anti-personnel mines, deploying a minefield up to 1,100 meters long and 120 meters wide within 4-12 minutes. This factor ensures operational protection of important facilities and strategic points on the battlefield. Mines are equipped with a self-destruct mechanism after a specified time, which ensures that unexploded ordnance does not pose a long-term threat. The M977A4 truck used to transport the Volcano system is equipped with a number of modern technologies that make it a reliable and maneuverable vehicle. Its features include a 500-horsepower Caterpillar C15 diesel engine, traction control, anti-lock braking and air suspension. These characteristics ensure high passability, including overcoming water obstacles up to 1.2 meters deep. The M136 Volcano system is a powerful tool for creating minefields, providing reliable protection against enemy offensive operations. Its mobility, speed of deployment and high efficiency make it an integral part of the arsenal of modern armed forces. M-136 Volcano remote mining system.

-Our -Caesar- has already fired 1,500 shots-: the commander of the French self-propelled guns on com...	The first batch of such vehicles arrived from Denmark, which handed Ukraine all 19 self-propelled guns it had in service. Currently, these self-propelled guns are used in units of the 148th separate artillery brigade of the Zhytomyr Airborne Assault Troops of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The gun commander with the call sign -Chrom- was among the first Ukrainian artillerymen to master this technique in Denmark. >He talked about the advantages of French self-propelled guns and their use in the conditions of modern warfare in a conversation with the correspondent of ArmiyaInform. He also worked in this specialty abroad. He says that he joined the Military Commissariat at the end of spring 2022, but in the end he was accepted for military service only at the beginning of summer. &#8211; I got a position as a driver-mechanic in the 95th Brigade of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, I worked on the self-propelled artillery howitzer 2C1 -Gvozdika-. After the training center, he arrived in the eastern direction, the Svatovo-Kreminna district. Already two weeks after my arrival, I was put in the crew, - recalls the gunner. Then the crews were constantly on trips and there were not even close to such a number of enemy drones. - Only the first time they saw -Lancet-, they didn't know what it was yet. He then hit the equipment, at first we thought it was an RPG projectile. The intensity of the work was much higher, our self-propelled guns stood at a distance of 2-5 km, they fired along the front, it was possible not to hide very much, - says -Khrom-. About six months later, he received a concussion, already during hostilities in Serebryansky forest in Kharkiv region. A mine flew next to his ACS, so close was the crew to the front line. For a while, Khrom dropped out of the crew, and at the same time he was offered to go for training on the CAESAR ACS. - I said that there are guys with more experience, but the combatant answered: -Their experience is for these guns. And you will do better for CAESAR,- he recalls. In Denmark, Ukrainian gunners trained for only two weeks, but this time was enough to master the machine. Every day there were classes from 8 in the morning to 9 in the evening. Then there was an accelerated course to train people before the arrival of the first batch of these self-propelled guns in Ukraine. Now the training period has increased. — At the time of training, I was a driver-mechanic, but after returning to Ukraine I was appointed a gun commander. At the same time, I was transferred to the 148th artillery brigade, which was being formed at the time, - adds -Khrom-. At the beginning of the summer of 2023, -Khrom- and its crew used the French self-propelled guns for the first time in the Zaporizhzhia region. They mainly fired in the direction of Robotyny, where there were enemy fortifications. He mentions that even there there weren't as many drones as there are now in the East. - Now we interact with the air reconnaissance unit, they report enemy -birds-, then we determine when to work. The main advantage of this machine is mobility. We can make a march of 100 km, shoot back and leave, - explains the commander of the gun. But in combat conditions, the weather sometimes makes corrections, the self-propelled gun weighs 35 tons and it is more difficult for it to move in the mud. Also, due to its considerable size, it is more difficult to disguise. - Before arriving in Ukraine, our machine fired 55 shots, it was actually new. We have already fired about 1,500 shells. Some machines have 3-4 thousand rounds, says Chrom. Among the other advantages of the CAESAR self-propelled guns are an armored cabin and anti-mine protection, as well as a French guidance system known throughout the world. > —We mostly work in the rear, throw shells at them behind the front line. The optimal shooting range is 18-20 kilometers, but we also shot at 34 km. However, accuracy is lost from the range, the crew adds For the self-propelled guns, different types of projectiles are provided, the crew chooses them depending on the task and the targets identified for hitting. The division says that most of the repair works on French self-propelled machines are carried out by their own efforts. — For example, our mechanic Oleksandr, who used to repair combines. He determines the problem by the sound, these guys are the ones who keep these machines. He could already tell the French manufacturers about all the nuances in combat conditions and how these self-propelled guns can be improved, - praises his brother -Chrom-. According to him, there are enough people in the division, they are quite willing to join the artillery . A new addition has arrived recently, young guys. Now the new recruits are undergoing training in Ukraine, the training center has such a machine and there is an opportunity to get basic knowledge. At first, newcomers work in parallel with other crew members and gain experience. Gradually, independent trips begin, for example, to shoot at the ban, -Khrom- explains. It is not difficult to master the machine, the gunners say. Already in the brigade, experienced colleagues will tell and show everything. In the same way, specialization will be determined on the spot. A person can come as a gunner, but in the commander's opinion, a novice can be more effective as a loader. - Everything is checked in practice, otherwise no way. Currently, Ukraine has the largest combat experience of using these self-propelled guns. Their application was developed without taking into account EW, drones. Drones have changed everything and we are already learning how to use CAESAR in a new way, -Khrom- summarizes.

Elections in Moldova and Georgia: what they have in common and how it will affect the situation in U...	Oleksandr Chupak, an expert of the non-governmental analytical center -Ukrainian Studies of Strategic Research-, tells about this in an exclusive comment to ArmiyaInform. -Both in Georgia and Moldova, the elections were accompanied by numerous reports of interference by Russia and violations of democratic standards. In both countries, there were cases of falsification and manipulation at the polling stations, which were noted by observers of the OSCE and other international organizations. Pro-Russian political forces in both countries used propaganda and tools to pressure the electorate, emphasizing the dangers of rapprochement with the EU. Both countries have significant pro-European segments of society, especially among the youth and urban population, who aspire to integration with the EU. These people took part in mass demonstrations in both capitals to express their support for pro-European leaders and to resist pro-Russian pressure. In Moldova, this support helped the pro-European candidate Maia Sandu win, and in Georgia, despite significant resistance, pro-European forces continue their struggle.- -Despite the common features, the elections in these countries had significant differences. In Moldova, the victory was won by the pro-European force led by Maya Sandu, who was able to unite the electorate around the idea of ​​European integration, in particular thanks to the support of the Western diaspora and urban centers. In Georgia, the ruling Georgian Dream party, which is supported by the pro-Russian oligarch Bidzina Ivanishvili, maintains power thanks to administrative resources and extensive falsifications, according to the opposition. Her next victory in the parliamentary elections caused public protests that continue to this day. The general political climate is also different. In Moldova, the president has significant influence on political processes. In Georgia, President Salome Zurabishvili, although he supports pro-European values, has limited power, which allows the government to act in favor of pro-Russian interests; she condemned the falsifications during the elections.- -The events in Moldova and Georgia have a direct impact on Ukraine, as those countries are facing challenges similar to ours on the road to European integration. Ukraine, waging a full-scale war against Russia, should actively work with countries that can become our allies in the fight against the occupier. Especially with Moldova and Georgia, which, like us, suffer from the occupation of their territories by Russia. The situation in Georgia is a reminder of the risks that arise when pro-Russian forces hold power. A parallel can be drawn between Ivanishvili's rule and Yanukovych's time, when a clear oligarchic vertical of control over power and business was established in Ukraine. Under such conditions, the perspective is to approach the current status of Belarus, and the Georgian opposition understands this well. In the context of Moldova, the situation with Transnistria is always interesting for us. The Russian enclave should have been liquidated at the beginning of 2022, but then Maya Sandu did not want to spoil relations with Moscow. Sandu's victory means that Ukraine has the opportunity to strengthen its influence (political, economic, etc.) on Chisinau with the aim of preventing Moldova from returning to the Russian orbit.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/06/vybory-u-moldovi-ta-gruziyi-shho-spilnogo-ta-yak-cze-vplyne-na-sytuacziyu-v-ukrayini/	2024-11-05T20:17:47-08:00
Propagandists justify the involvement of the DPRK in the war: they invented a new fake	Responding to this, Russian Telegram channels began to write that there were -infiltrators- behind the controls of this military equipment. This is allegedly due to the fact that among specialists in the Armed Forces there are colossal losses and the training period of the Ukrainian military is shortened. So, according to the propagandists, taking this into account, the appearance of the North Korean military in the Russo-Ukrainian war is natural, and this should not be surprising. Propagandists seek to fuel the narrative by reporting on the -Nativs- who control Western military equipment. about a possible war of the Russian Federation against the entire NATO bloc, and not only against Ukraine. That Ukraine is allegedly only a puppet in the hands of the -NATO masters- and -NATO bases and troops- are located on its territory. For example, the -Nativites- are fighting on the side of Ukraine, so soldiers from the DPRK can supposedly fight for Russia.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/06/propagandysty-vypravdovuyut-zaluchennya-kndr-do-vijny-vygadaly-novyj-fejk/	2024-11-05T20:02:33-08:00
From convicts to marines: which Russians are fighting in the South of Ukraine	Colonel Vladyslav Voloshyn, the spokesman of the -Tavria- OUV, told about this on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- : — Our south is quite large and there [are] various Russian units of its connection. For example, representatives of Russia's -Northern Fleet- are stationed at Tenderivska Spit at the mouth of the Dnieper. These are the marines, there are also various units that the Russians also use in hostilities. Next are mainly representatives of their combined armies of the southern district. Closer to the east are the representatives of the Eastern Military District. In addition, we have several units of their -airborne troops-. The spokesman noted that the training of fighters of different units and units differs significantly. — As for their training, it is different. There are also professionals, -specialists-, and there are their so-called mobilized, who already have a certain level of training. In addition, there are small units, mainly in the assault squads, which are units of former prisoners. This phenomenon is not widely used, but it exists, said the spokesperson of the -Tavria- OUV. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in the south The Russian army of Ukraine has concentrated about 200,000 troops, these forces also include the occupation troops in Crimea.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/05/vid-zekiv-do-morpihiv-yaki-rosiyany-voyuyut-na-pivdni-ukrayiny/	2024-11-05T12:17:51-08:00
Cold and wind: how they have already affected the battlefield in Kharkiv region	toldabout how the change in weather conditions has already affected the battlefield in Kharkiv Oblast on the air of the national telethon -Yedini Novyni- /a> spokesman of OTU -Kharkiv- Lt. Col. Yevhenii Romanov. — The enemy now attacks mostly with infantry. We know that the enemy is constantly accumulating forces and resources. He imports ammunition, equipment, food, warm equipment, fuel and lubricants. He is preparing for the winter, he said. Answering the presenter's question about the possible accumulation of tanks by the enemy in the area of ​​the village of Hlyboke of the Lypetsk community, north of Kharkiv, the spokesman noted that the Defense Forces are monitoring all the actions of the enemy and are ready for any development, and tanks are a very vulnerable target in this regard. part of the battle line. — We are aware of our enemy's actions, but for obvious reasons we will not say what our troops are preparing for him in this direction. But I will note that tanks are a very vulnerable target in this direction and we are ready for it, the spokesman emphasized. The officer said that in recent days the nature of hostilities was significantly affected by the weather. — If we talk about the last two days, the weather had a very significant effect. The number of combat engagements and losses on the part of the enemy decreased by almost a third, the number of displaced equipment decreased, and their activity decreased. It snowed, it rained, it got colder, and the change in weather is making significant adjustments at the moment, the military officer said. The impact of changing weather conditions on the enemy's use of light UAVs is particularly noticeable. — Very strong wind. What flies in the air is quite vulnerable. Speaking about small FPV drones, -maviks- and similar unmanned aerial vehicles, the weather significantly affects them, Yevgeny Romanov said. Earlier, ArmyInform reported, which remains the main consumable of the occupiers in Kharkiv Oblast.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/05/holod-i-viter-yak-vony-vzhe-vplynuly-na-pole-boyu-na-harkivshhyni/	2024-11-05T12:08:04-08:00

Collaborators from district administrations are responsible for attending these inspections. During examinations, doctors will campaign to conclude a health insurance contract, for which you must have a passport of the Russian Federation. That is, one of the goals of these reviews is to identify those who have not received passports. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that the enemy shelled Donetsk region again.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/05/okupanty-znovu-vdayutsya-do-prymusovyh-medychnyh-oglyadiv/	2024-11-05T11:57:55-08:00
A correctional officer of the Russian Federation and two collaborators were detained in Kherson	The Security Service of Ukraine reported this on November 5. Another detainee turned out to be a resident of the regional center, an agent of the Russian military intelligence (better known as GRU), who adjusted enemy fire on the Defense Forces. To do this, the defendant traveled around the territory of the community on a scooter and tried to identify the locations of Ukrainian troops involved in hostilities at the front. The priority targets of the enemy were camouflaged headquarters, firing positions and strongholds of units of the Armed Forces. The agent sent the received information to the Russian game via messenger in the form of screenshots with the markings of military objects on Google maps. During the special operation, the Security Service detained the traitor in her own apartment and carried out comprehensive measures to secure the positions of the Defense Forces. Another detainee is a 60-year-old ex-law enforcement officer from Kherson, who after the capture of the community joined the local occupation administration of the Russian Federation. There, the former mayor of the city, Oleksandr Kobets, appointed the collaborator as his -deputy on legal issues.- Among his main tasks was the preparation of a pseudo-referendum of the Rashists regarding the accession of the region to the aggressor country. The third suspect, who was detained by the SBU together with the National Police, is also a resident of the regional center, which during its occupation was part of the so-called -Main Directorate of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation in the Kherson region.- In the ranks of the pseudo-institution, the collaborator was engaged in the -passportization- of local residents through forced registration of Russian citizenship. Investigators of the Security Service informed the detainees of the suspicion (according to the crimes committed) under two articles of the Criminal Code of Ukraine: The perpetrators are in custody. They face from 15 years in prison to life imprisonment with confiscation of property. As reported by ArmyInform, a spy from Sloviansk received 15 years in prison. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/05/u-hersoni-zatrymaly-koryguvalnyczyu-rf-ta-dvoh-kolaborantiv/	2024-11-05T11:42:46-08:00
Everything will be repainted: how winter will affect the palette of war	Colonel Vladyslav Voloshyn, the spokesman of the -Tavria- OUV, told about this on the air of the national telethon -Yedini Novyni- . — Cold weather always brings certain corrections, first of all, it increases the importance of various thermal imaging tools. That is, it is better to see where what warms whom, he said. Also, the cooling and approach of winter will lead to the fact that the battlefield will be repainted in the literal sense of the word. — In addition, when it is a cold season, firstly, the palette of the battlefield changes. This very arena, it turns a different color. In particular, if it was green, then it turns gray, yellow, then white. That's why camouflage and, shall we say, quality camouflage is essential. And not only for a person as camouflage, but also to hide equipment, the spokesman emphasized. The change in weather will also affect the fighters. - In addition, when such weather changes, it becomes much more difficult for a person to be in such a temperature field.

It is worth noting that October became a record for the launch of attack enemy drones: &#8211; August: 818 – launched, 701 – shot down, 91 – lost in location; &#8211; September: 1410 – launched, 1156 – shot down, 201 – lost in location; &#8211; October: 2,072 – launched, 1,206 – shot down, 766 – lost to location. During the same period: May, June, and July 2024, 1,133 attack UAVs were launched on the territory of Ukraine. 1055 were shot down by anti-aircraft defense, 10 were lost in location. The percentage of shooting down for the period May–July 2024 is about 94%. Thus, the percentage of direct hits by enemy attack UAVs of the -Shahed- type and drones of other types imitating real -Shaheds- in May-July and August-October 2024 is 6 and 5 percent, respectively. As reported by ArmyInform, the President thanked the defenders of the Ukrainian sky.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/05/ponad-3-tysyachi-zbytyh-shahediv-za-3-misyaczi-genshtab-oprylyudnyv-pidsumky-povitryanoyi-vijny/	2024-11-05T07:18:20-08:00
More than a hundred soldiers, 10 tanks and 12 BMPs defeated the enemy in the Siversk direction	This was reported to ArmyInform by the operational-tactical group -Luhansk-. The Russian command, hoping for quick success, involved 10 tanks in the battle, including one modern T-90. The occupiers tried to attack in the gap between two Ukrainian armed forces brigades: the 10th mountain assault brigade and the 54th mechanized brigade. But this tactic turned out to be a disaster for them. The Ukrainian military responded promptly to the enemy's maneuvers. Fighters of OTU -Luhansk- delivered a powerful blow to the enemy, destroying 24 units of armored vehicles, of which ten tanks (T-62, T-72, T-90), twelve BMP (infantry fighting vehicles), two MTLB (multi-purpose light armored tractor) and one ZU-23-2 (23-mm paired anti-aircraft gun). The casualties of the occupying personnel are also impressive: more than a hundred Russian soldiers were disabled, more than sixty of them were killed, more than thirty were seriously wounded, and the rest quietly disappeared into the nearest forest or got lost. The decisive role was played by the professional work of Ukrainian artillerymen, who destroyed most of the enemy's armored vehicles with targeted strikes. Operators of anti-tank guided missiles were also distinguished, who eliminated several tanks with accurate shots. -Our fighters showed the enemy that his tactics of numerical superiority do not always work. Each of our soldiers knows what he is fighting for his people and has a clear goal. They once again proved to the Russians that Ukrainian land cannot be broken,- one of the officers of the 10th Mountain Assault Brigade emphasized. -This failure once again demonstrated the weakness of Russian tactics, which are based on numerical superiority and -massive attacks- that disregard the lives of soldiers. The Ukrainian defenders did not just repulse the attack — they once again proved the high level of combat skill and determination of our soldiers, who fearlessly defend every centimeter of Ukrainian land,- reported the Luhansk Technical University. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the 10th motorized infantry battalion of the -Edelvejsy- mountain assault brigade made a selection of Russian -armor- burning in front of our positions. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/05/ponad-sotnya-soldativ-10-tankiv-i-12-bmp-na-siverskomu-napryamku-vorogu-vlashtuvaly-rozgrom/	2024-11-05T07:08:13-08:00

-I'm alive, I eat porridge, I drink coffee, I shoot-: the story of a paratrooper-artillery -Dragon-	The story of the fighter was made public by the Airborne Assault Troops of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The -Dragon- gunner is 22 years old. He was a popular football player in civilian life. Then he served conscripted service in our artillery division. There were 21 days left until -Dembele- - and a large-scale war began. The boy immediately signed a contract with the artillery, and admitted this to his parents only during his first vacation. -I explained that they should not completely believe the news, because everything is not as bad as shown on TV. Dad accepted, but mom still worries. I call them and say: -We soaked the gifts! Mom, I'm alive, I drink coffee, I eat porridge, everything is fine.- All the guys with whom I served time signed contracts one by one in our brigade. Sisterhood is an important thing. In the Armed Forces, everything is not as scary as civilians think. Those who came to us with war must be terrible,- says the gunner. -Dragon- admits that he is also sometimes scared: when the enemy fires very hard. And he tells how he escapes from his worries: The personnel remained alive. The M777 gun is also fine. The gunners called her -Marukha-. She has quite a shot &#8211; three thousand shots. The gun is operational and was even -wounded- by an enemy lancet, but continues to work effectively. -Dragon- speaks of her with love. -If there were more replacements, we could better drive them further,- adds the fighter. Previously ArmyInform reported that the Defense Forces told the story of the mechanical engineer Vitaly and how he fought in Ugledar.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/05/zhyvyj-yim-kashu-pyu-kavu-strilyayu-istoriya-desantnyka-artylerysta-drakona/	2024-11-05T01:04:33-08:00

BZVP of students: when and from what course will universities teach how to defend Ukraine	Mykhailo Vinnytskyi, Deputy Deputy Minister of Education and Science of Ukraine, told about this on the air of Novosti.LIVE . — The adopted law obliges us to introduce basic general military training in institutions of higher education in 2025. Obviously, this does not apply to freshmen, because they are mostly seventeen years old. It is most likely that it will be the third year, where the students have already reached 19-20 years of age and are of legal age, he said. Educational innovation, according to the deputy minister, is in no way connected with mobilization. — The mobilization age remains 25 [years]. It's just that a person who graduates from higher education should be able to handle a weapon, know where meetings are held in case of need, how to defend themselves in case of need, how to provide first aid with tactical medicine in case of need. All these things are included in basic general military training, explained the Deputy Minister of Education and Science of Ukraine. Currently, the system is being developed, training grounds are being prepared, and from January 2025, the training of instructors will begin. — This is a continuation of the initiatives that the Ministry of Education has now introduced to reformat -Defense of Ukraine- as a subject in high school, Mykhailo Vinnytskyi emphasized.

From the steering wheel -medevak- to the NRK remote control. A frank conversation with a stormtroope...	We met with him not far from the combat mission area and talked about the war for an hour and a half. Let's quote the direct language of -Makara-. I grew up in such an environment, had such an upbringing that for me the question did not arise when the war began: to go or not to go. The answer was self-evident. There was only a question of where to go, with whom to move and to which part of the front. There were calls, they said, let's go abroad. But I didn't get into such conversations, I clearly understood what I wanted and where I was needed. It would be a breach of conscience for me not to get involved in the problem that exists at this stage of history. My field of activity changed every year: in the Kyiv campaign I was an infantryman, in the Zaporizhzhia direction - a driver of a -medevak-. During the Bakhmut campaign, he was transferred to the assault company to the position of a machine gunner, then he was a mechvod, an M113 gunner. The commander of the assault group in the end. The most difficult was in Avdiivka, it cannot be compared with anything. Now I am responsible for a completely new direction for us - ground robotic complexes. It just needs good infantry experience, an understanding of the battlefield, tactics and how everything is arranged on the front line. I was always interested in developing something new. All these positions, it was not in the format that I was forcibly placed, given an order. It was a choice moment. I could stay and continue to work in the medical service, I could remain the same machine gunner, driver mechanic. In our team, you can choose what you want to do. I have a lot of people now who are not directly involved in the battlefield, but they are as useful as possible to support the infantry, in general, to the life of the battalion. We understand that there will be no benefit from a person who does not have the desire to do this or that. At the very beginning of the great war, motivation was very powerful. I went to war with the thought that I would not last more than two weeks here. Nevertheless, I will do something useful and right, even if it leads to my death. Then this motivation changed: the more professional I become, the longer I will live on the battlefield and in this war in general. And the more good things, actions that lead to victory, I will be able to do. After the loss of my brothers, the motivation changed dramatically, and now I want to avenge these guys. War is constantly changing: almost every six months there is a different style, character, technology, opportunities for conducting both defensive and offensive actions. Both with us and with the enemy. The armed forces are developing very quickly. We have surface drones, our own long-range drones that attack the Russian Federation. But still, the human resource on the battlefield will be the main one, because everything is focused on the fact that the same FPVs, drop systems, ground reconnaissance complexes, everything is adjusted to destroy the infantry that holds the lines. But we can do everything with the help of technology to help the infantry do their jobs. Infantry will be the main factor on the battlefield in any case. The infantry will always be the most important argument, because if there is a person there, then it cannot be assumed that it is our line. It will never be possible to completely replace a person in the trenches of work. We've had cases recently where most of the enemy's infantry simply didn't make it to our front lines simply because they were being maxed out by drops and FPV drones. Out of 100% of personnel, 10% reached the front line. This already simplifies the infantry's work as much as possible. She already has less impact on her positions and it's easier for her to do her job. &nbsp; &nbsp; A post shared by Kolya Makarov (@_kolya_makarov) 70% of my unit consists of fighters with assault infantry experience. And there is a young addition with no combat experience that just makes up for it. There are young guys 19-20 years old, and there are men who are already 30-40 years old. But in general, we do not have an age barrier. Age does not matter here, at all. It is decided by your experience, your ability to act, and the level of your motivation. And it very often happens that the commander of the department is a young guy, and he has men under his command who are 45 years old. They listen to him and do what he says. They consider him their commander and do not want anyone else. There are also girls in the teams, they are mostly in the positions of BpLA operators, NRK operators. But there are other examples. I was once given an infantry assault unit with a seconded group. There was a girl who had never been in battle before. And I had never been on the defensive with girls before and had never attacked. And the boys were critical of her. But literally a day or two later, everyone was in shock, because she dug trenches better than everyone else, carried out night combat duty better than everyone else, performed tasks better than everyone else. And later, already in her battalion, during the assault, this girl was left alone in the position, holding the defense herself. When reinforcements arrived, she led the group she was given. It was her third or fourth combat appearance. This shows that not everything depends on age and gender in war. Discipline, motivation and your inner core decide here. We need to put a new cadre of officers on their feet - young, active ones who have come through modern battles. Because what we are seeing now on the front line is largely the fault of the commanders. We can do the right thing in current situations, but we need a modern approach. In our brigade, there are only those people who came up from the infantry in commanding positions. A year or two ago, you were doing your job in the trenches, storming, defending, and now you are a platoon, company, battalion commander. Most of them are people aged 30-35. We have quite a few young group commanders in our battalion, who are 18-20 years old, and they show themselves very cool on the battlefield as commanders. A leader generally has a very strong influence on a team. It may be that the group is not motivated. But if the commander knows how to present information well, teach well, show people that they are important to him, he is ready to go with them to the end, and that it is really important to him that they know how, whether they have learned it, then the group becomes motivated . &nbsp; They understand that no one is going to abandon them just like that. And they are ready to work. I recently sent a very powerful cool branch commander to where he will grow and develop even more. He went to a higher position than mine, in fact, but I see that it was useful for everyone. Civilians do not fully understand what is happening here. In their eyes, everything looks like a person was stuffed into a -bus- and immediately taken to war. People do not understand what the front is like, what front-line cities are like, how the principle of work in the army is arranged, that not everyone is fighting on the front lines here. People need to be told more about how the army is organized. When they understand this and know what functionality awaits them in the service, the number of people who will voluntarily go to the army will increase. The rear and the front are different worlds, of course, it always has been. But I began to notice that when I see acquaintances, friends in the rear, they have a certain fear of communication, a certain fear of conversation, because they do not know what to talk about. And it is felt very strongly. I'm not pissed off by people in the back, I'm pissed off by people who aren't doing anything to win. When friends ask: -Well, what should we do?-. I say: just ask yourself a question every morning when you wake up. He set himself a goal and a task to do something for the country. I would like the civilians to understand: we can live in peace here in the rear only because there is someone who holds the defense, who died at night so that I could live this day. I would advise civilians to prepare. Medicine should be studied at least minimally. Tactics. We somehow didn't think about it. There are many opportunities for this in the country. When you are ready for something, you feel more confident. We have a test week of the attack aircraft, there is a cool FPV school. Come at least to talk to the military simply. In addition to the BZVP, we also have training at the brigade, battalion, and unit levels. When a person comes to me, he has time to join the team, to get used to it. If I see that a person is not ready, he will not go to the battlefield. A person must be prepared, and I can never ask a person to do something that I have not taught him myself. He was, is and always will be. Don't be afraid only of fools. During hostilities, fear goes overboard, but you need to be able to adjust it correctly and understand that on the battlefield there is only you, the enemy and death. And now you have such a game, who will throw this death into whose basket. And that nothing will help you at that moment, except yourself. Therefore, fear should be put in the background and act. If you give in to fear, then 100% you will not return from the battlefield. Or die in the next battles. It is necessary to understand that it is necessary to act now and already. And everything will depend on how you act. When you defeat yourself inside, break through all these moments of hesitation, then, in principle, not a single challenge will be scary for you. Fantastic question. Very often plans get in the way of work. We will plan when everything is over. My plans for now are to make sure that as few parents as possible cry for their sons who are forever in the war. Because this is the most difficult, the most painful moment - to look into the eyes of the parents of their brothers whom they buried. And at that moment you realize that you are ready to give everything so that all of this does not happen. Therefore, I advise all commanders, if you lose your soldiers, to go to their funerals and talk to their parents. This then gives a very great motivation to work even better, deal with personnel, do everything more professionally in order not to make even small mistakes on the battlefield. To save personnel as much as possible and to perform the combat task as efficiently as possible.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/05/vid-kerma-medevaku-do-pulta-nrk-vidverta-rozmova-zi-shturmovykom-pro-tyl-strah-komandyriv-i-plany-yakyh-nemaye/	2024-11-04T21:05:43-08:00
-Iron Fist- will provide Bradley: the US has ordered an active defense system	As informs the official portal of the US Department of Defense, profile an agreement was signed with General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems, which will install active defense systems. The total cost of the work is $191.2 million for BBM equipment with an unspecified number of these systems, ArmyInform reports. And the direct manufacturer of this equipment is one of the leading Israeli gunsmithing companies, Elbit Systems. Her site in May this year announced that the Haifa-based company has been awarded an initial contract worth approximately $37 million to supply Iron Fist active protection systems (APS) for General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems (GD-OTS) to upgrade the US Army's Bradley M2A4E1 infantry fighting vehicle (IPV). The contract will be executed within 24 months. Iron Fist (in Ukrainian - -Iron Fist-) APS is an advanced Hard Kill system aimed at increasing the self-defense capabilities of armored platforms against modern threats on the battlefield. It is the second generation APS of the Israel Defense Forces, characterized by high performance and low requirements for volume, weight and power consumption. The system provides armored platforms with 360-degree protection against a wide range of anti-tank threats, such as anti-tank missiles (ATMs), anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs), unmanned aerial vehicles and threats located both in the open and in urban areas. . Thanks to the use of modern technologies, Iron Fist creates a protected hemisphere around the machine, effectively tracking and destroying threats. At the heart of Iron Fist's operation is the use of radars (Radars) that detect and identify missiles/projectiles/UAVs aimed at an armored vehicle. After detecting an enemy target, the information is transmitted to the on-board electronics, which coordinates the launch of the interceptors. These obstacles, created from flammable materials, minimize the number of fragments during an explosion and neutralize the threat with a powerful shock wave. Therefore, the threat is destroyed or deviated from the flight path, which significantly reduces the risk of hitting the target. Iron Fist has high application flexibility. The system can be installed on various types of armored vehicles, including light vehicles. At most, thanks to the use of electronic-optical sensors, the system is able to determine the location of the shooter, as well as automatically turn the BBM tower towards the threat, if this function is activated by the operator. An additional advantage is the possibility of installing Iron Fist in stationary positions, which makes it a universal means of protecting both mobile and stationary objects. Iron Fist launchers can be adapted to different customer requirements. The standard configuration includes two-charge installations, but options with an increase in the number of interceptors to six or even eight are possible, although the latter have not yet become widespread. For heavy equipment, as a rule, two launchers with different numbers of charges are used. Light vehicles such as the MRAP are equipped with a single installation. To simplify firing in response to light vehicles, you can additionally install a machine gun that will automatically turn towards the enemy object, which greatly facilitates the work of the crew. It should be noted that the first prototypes of the Iron Fist active defense complex were developed in the 2000s and, in addition to being installed on Israel Defense Forces (IDF) vehicles, were also offered for export. The system was primarily created to neutralize guided anti-tank missiles and rocket-propelled grenades, and is currently being tested to intercept armor-piercing feathered sub-caliber projectiles. Yehuda (Udi) Vered, General Manager of Elbit Systems Land: -Our Iron Fist active defense systems represent the highest level of innovation, offering comprehensive protection against emerging threats on the modern battlefield. Through this strategic collaboration with GD-OTS, we are honored to contribute to the advancement of the Bradley infantry fighting vehicle, providing the US military with additional capabilities to effectively and safely accomplish their missions.- How reported ArmyInform, since the beginning of the large-scale invasion of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine codified and allowed for operation in units of the Defense Forces of Ukraine almost 40 samples of foreign and domestically produced armored vehicles. Among them are M2 Bradley infantry fighting vehicles. Iron Fist Active Protection System (APS) for Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicles.

Чи вистачить резервів: експерт про втрати армії рф та її подальшу долю	But to what extent can this affect the overall power of the Soviet Union group in Ukraine? Simply put when people in the enemy army are over? But is there anyone else there to call up for military service? An expert of the Center for Defense Strategies, Viktor Kevlyuk, told about this: -If we talk about the mobilization reserve of the Russian Federation, then we should remember that their the previous defense minister said that Russia has up to 20 million people who could be drafted. Official Russian statistics say that Russia has a population of 143 million. Accordingly, about 27 of them are people of draft age. Therefore, if the Russian military medical commissions do not bother much, and that is what they are doing, there may be up to 25 million. in my opinion Again, we do not forget about the Russians who are serving their sentences, and the enemy is very actively recruiting them for military service, thus disposing of criminality. Now we have to talk about the active enemy army, its say, individual segments: what state are they in now. Special operations forces in the Russian Federation are quite small. Russian SSOs have -raked out- enough at the front in Ukraine to make their existence difficult, but the requirements for selection there remain quite strict, and the preparation &#8211; Quality. And I personally expect neither reduce their combat qualities or reduce their numbers. It is a specialized structure to get there anyone. On the other hand, they are part of the respective military districts and armies. These are special purpose brigades and regiments. They suffered very large losses in 2022, when they were used as a prepared infantry, and this is the way of using these specialists, in fact, led to very serious losses. Special forces of the Russian Federation has remained about half since 2022. All the rest are conscripts called up from the reserve, who previously served in the special forces and have the appropriate training. But they are a little older. Accordingly, they tolerate physical stress differently than young fighters. But they have experience, and many even have the experience of several military companies, including Syrian. Therefore, we will observe the tendency where the units of the Russian Federation will become worse and worse. Here they tried to select people, tried to prepare them. But when the task was set to deploy new divisions, the enemy took 31 separate landing brigades from Ulyanovsk, on its basis formed 104 airborne assault divisions, including a Motorial Regiment of Territorial Forces and another mobilization. . And they were simply assigned the name of assault troops. Although in both regiments, no person who at the time of reformat was served in them, had no airborne training. That is, these were ordinary guerrillas who were simply -lucky- to become paratroopers. Later in the division to include the 345th Parachut-Destant Regiment. are currently performing their tasks in the Kherson direction. They did not show themselves in any way, but they &#8211; -дєсантніки-. На початку вторгнення у противника були 76-та та 7-ма десантно-штурмові дивізії, 106-та та 98-ма повітрянодесантні дивізії. And there were three more amphibious assault brigades: the 11th, 83rd and 31st. Відповідно, всі ці -організми- зазнавали втрат, бо виконували роль штурмових загонів. Тож повітряно-десантні війська рф залишаються високомобільним компонентом, вони маневрують вздовж всієї лінії фронту. Вони відносно непогано укомплектовані, відносно непогано забезпечуються. Але, по-перше, це легка піхота, а по-друге, це підрозділи, які зазнають величезних втрат, бо виконують завдання непритаманні повітрянодесантним військам. According to those who started the war, about 40-50% remained in the ranks. British intelligence claims &#8211; 50% And in some military units, probably less. For example, from the 331 regiment, which -distinguished- in Bucha, there is little left, because as soon as it fell into the field of view of the forces of Ukraine's defense forces, it was mowed by everything than it is. Marines. Її намагалися підтримувати на певному рівні, але це дуже важко робити через те, що та морська піхота, яка нині воює проти нас, це – партизани в бригадах другого чи третього формування. Приміром, 810 бригада Чорноморського флоту переформовувалася три рази: після боїв за Маріуполь, після боїв на Херсонському напрямку, і зараз добивають її третій склад у Курській області. Інформація, яку я бачу у відкритих джерелах, дозволяє стверджувати, що на відміну від спецпризначенців і десантників, у морській піхоті рф час від часу лунали відомості про підрозділи, укомплектовані колишніми в&#8217;язнями. Це говорить про те, що морська піхота виконує задачі штурмовиків і людей там сильно не шкодують. Якщо перейти до підрозділів мотострілецьких, то – їх до біса багато, і це основа угрупування російських військ в Україні. І ми бачимо, що росія веде війну за зразком 1916 року, коли піхота своїми масами давить на противника за підтримки артилерії і, можливо, авіації. Тобто, коли ми говоримо про ворожу піхоту, то ми говоримо про війська, які мають базову підготовку і досвід ведення бойових дій. І важливий момент – ми спостерігаємо тенденцію поступового зменшення якості військ рф. As the Defense Forces of Ukraine knock out their bones, people without training and without special knowledge come to take the place of the fallen Russian soldiers. I think that the enemy group in Ukraine will gradually degrade. If in February 2022 it had from 150 to 190 thousand, in December 2023 &#8211; 400-450 thousand, now we are talking about 470 thousand. Але російська система комплектування поступово дає збої та не в змозі постачати поповнень, які б вже покривали втрати. Так, в період з 29 вересня до 24 жовтня вбитими, зниклими безвісти та дезертирами противник втратив десь 18100 військових та ще 39400 пораненими і хворими. 23% will not return to the army due to severe wounds and amputations. In total, about 5,7500 soldiers were departed from the system, and only 20 and 25 thousand were received for replenishment. Тому, мабуть, ще рік бойових дій і наприкінці 2025-го це угруповання фізично може перестати існувати-.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/05/chy-vystachyt-rezerviv-ekspert-pro-vtraty-armiyi-rf-ta-yiyi-podalshu-dolyu/	2024-11-04T20:29:46-08:00
The enemy is dispersing a fake about a grant for -over a billion hryvnias-: what are we talking abou...	It is interesting that on the Derzhkino website there is indeed news about the announcement of the presidential grant competition in 2025. To participate, it is necessary to submit relevant documents: application, estimate, description of the film, etc. Similar conditions were previously seen in 2023 and 2024. But, of course, there is no mention in them of -positive coverage of TCC actions.- The real purpose of the competition is to provide state financial support to young artists for the creation and implementation of socially significant creative projects. Clear restrictions on project topics are not specified. In the forgery, an amount of more than one billion UAH was indicated for the creation of a film production, but only UAH 3.9 million was indicated on the official website. This is the amount of funds provided for the payment of three grants, in accordance with the Presidential Decree -On State Support of Culture and Art in Ukraine.- They are allocated from the budget of the Ministry of Culture and Strategic Communications. As in other similar cases, by inventing such lies, the enemy is trying to disrupt mobilization and sow enmity in society.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/05/vorog-rozganyaye-fejk-pro-grant-na-ponad-milyard-gryven-pro-shho-mova/	2024-11-04T20:14:44-08:00

We see an increase in the number of North Koreans, we do not see an increase in the reaction of part...	The president announced this in his evening address on November 4. He said that he listened to the reports of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, General Oleksandr Syrskyi, and the Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Lieutenant General Anatoliy Bargylevych, as well as the Minister of Defense of Ukraine, Rustem Umyerova. -Combat situation now, all directions. Of course, the most attention is paid to the Donetsk destinations. But we also see Russian activity in the south of Ukraine. The defense forces must provide a response. The Kursk operation was discussed separately today. It will be three months of our active actions in Kurshchyna soon. And this is important — keeping this -sanitary zone- in designated areas near our state border. And we must appreciate the importance of this operation - the Kursk operation - to replenish our exchange fund. This greatly helped the liberation of our people from Russian captivity. I thank all the soldiers, sergeants and officers who are involved in our active actions in Kurshchyna,- said Volodymyr Zelenskyi. According to him, he listened to a separate report by the GUR and the Foreign Intelligence Service regarding the North Korean military on the territory of Russia. -There are already 11,000 in the Kursk region. We see an increase in the North Koreans, we do not see an increase in the reaction of partners. Unfortunately,- the President remarked. Volodymyr Zelenskyi also announced that he had a conversation with the President of Moldova, Maya Sandu, whom he congratulated on her victory in the elections and, in general, on the fact that Moldova's course towards real sovereignty has withstood the test. The President also met with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and German Foreign Minister Annalena Berbock. -And one more thing. Today is a professional day for almost 200,000 Ukrainian men and women. All employees of -Ukrainian Railways-. I had the opportunity to congratulate them, thank them. And please don't forget to always thank the people who work in such special industries of ours that carry everything else in the country. I am proud of our people! Glory to Ukraine!- Volodymyr Zelenskyi summed up.

GUR called on the people of Russia to unite in the fight against Putin's regime	The statement of GUR was published on his channel. -What kind of -unity- can we talk about when an aggressive Moscow is getting fat, and the regions are stably pale and poor. Take, for example, Ingushetia - every third resident here lives below the poverty line. The situation is similar in Kalmykia, Karachay-Cherkessia, and Tyva - every fifth person is in poverty there,- said the GUR statement. According to our intelligence officers, such -unity- of obedience and silence of those reduced to poverty benefits the Kremlin, because it is from the regions, and not from Moscow or St. Petersburg, that the Putin regime draws human resources for -meat- assaults. -During the criminal war against Ukraine, 3.5 times more Bashkir invaders died than Muscovites; residents of Tatarstan - three times more, Buryats - twice. The recipe for Moscow -unity- contains only two components - poverty and death,- the HUR reminded. But they said that it was time to stop and punish Moscow. -You can report on the movement of Russian troops, the location of their headquarters and military-technical developments through Main intelligence bot or in other safe ways,- the GUR statement said. As reported by ArmyInform, according to the data of GUR occupiers throw the wounded to the assault against the backdrop of heavy losses.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/04/gur-zaklykav-narody-rosiyi-do-yednosti-u-borotbi-z-rezhymom-putina/	2024-11-04T11:29:35-08:00

A representative of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine passed the course -Information available for ...	The training took place in Riga, the capital of Latvia. A delegation of communicators from Ukrainian government structures took part in the event. The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, in particular, was represented by junior lieutenant Vladyslav Dunayenko, who shared his impressions of the event with the ArmyInform correspondent. — Since Ukraine is moving in the direction of the EU, our Latvian friends organized a training called -Accessible information for all- for representatives of Ukrainian ministries and other state bodies on simplifying communication with people with disabilities. We learned to write texts according to certain standards that make them accessible to anyone - children, the elderly and people with disabilities, in particular, people with reduced mobility, people with visual and hearing impairments and even people with intellectual disabilities. The purpose of the training is to add these skills to the work of press services and press offices of Ukrainian ministries, - explained Vladyslav Dunayenko. The training program involved not only studying the rules of information dissemination, but also introduced seemingly elementary things: the presence of ramps, road markings, traffic light buttons, etc. The course participants visited the library for people with visual impairments, where they got acquainted with how books and other information materials are printed in Braille, how audio books and audio messages are created for people with visual impairments. They were also in the inclusive museum of Latvian culture. — Due to the fact that we have an increasing number of people with disabilities, this experience will be extremely relevant for Ukraine in the coming years. Creating such content and adapting the environment for people with special needs is important to us. The second aspect is about clear and simple language. In our state structures, as in most European countries, before these rules were introduced, the so-called -official language- is used, which is often incomprehensible to the common man. And this applies not only to state structures, but also to banks, insurance companies, etc. The integration of plain and understandable language standards will be appropriate in order for the society to be more aware of what is happening. After all, writing in a simple and understandable language will help to inform the society more effectively, - noted Vladyslav Dunayenko. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/04/predstavnyk-ministerstva-oborony-ukrayiny-projshov-kurs-dostupna-informacziya-dlya-vsih-v-mezhah-ryzkoyi-akademiyi/	2024-11-04T10:21:58-08:00
The Minister of Defense of Ukraine met with his Lithuanian counterpart in Kyiv	The Minister of Defense of Ukraine published his post evening of November 4. -Together with my Lithuanian colleague and the Minister of Strategic Industries of Ukraine, Herman Smetanin, we signed a document aimed at strengthening our defenders on the battlefield: the Memorandum of Understanding between the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, the Ministry of National Defense of the Republic of Lithuania, the Ministry of Economy and Innovation of the Republic of Lithuania and the Ministry of issues of strategic industries of Ukraine regarding cooperation in the field of defense industry,- said Rustem Umyerov. According to him, the Memorandum envisages the joint production of UAVs and their components, ammunition and components, electronic warfare equipment, and the development of advanced technologies. -I am sincerely grateful to Lithuania and personally to Mr. Kaschyunas for the comprehensive support of Ukraine. Lithuania is our faithful friend who helps us diplomatically, economically and, most importantly, militarily,- Rustem Umyerov noted. During the meeting, specific ways of deepening cooperation were also discussed. Among the topics are plans for 2025 aimed at even greater military aid to Ukraine. -Representatives of our intelligence provided detailed information to Lithuanian partners about the current situation at the front. The aggressive plans of the enemy for autumn and winter were analyzed. Today we see how Russia receives help from dictatorial regimes, including the involvement of manpower from North Korea. But I am convinced that with such reliable partners as Lithuania, we will defeat the aggressor. Together we are getting closer to victory!-, Rustem Umyerov assured.

This Coalition was created at the initiative of Lithuania and united 21 countries to support our army and our people. Very grateful for this support and this leadership. We must understand that the longer this terrible war continues, the more territories will be polluted and mined. For this we need the support of our partners. In turn, the Minister of National Defense of the Republic of Lithuania, Laurinas Kaschyunas, noted that the large-scale invasion of Russia made Ukraine one of the most mined countries in the world. - Successful demining is a prerequisite for Ukraine's victory. The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine and its Armed Forces are responsible for a wide range of mine action activities and today perform both combat and humanitarian demining. This requires significant international support, said Laurinas Kasciunas. And he added that this first batch of demining equipment is much more than just a set of tools: - It symbolizes our steadfast support for Ukraine. The head of the Administration of the State Special Service of Transport, Major General Oleksandr Yakovets, assured that the received pickups will increase the power of engineer-mining and engineer-assault units, provide operative and humanitarian demining units and make our life safer.

The second army of the world is again the first in looting - now in Kurshchyna	This was reported by the Center for Countering Disinformation on November 4. According to the Center, the Kursk TV channel aired a story about residents of the Glushkiv district of the region who reported cases of robbery by the Russian military.

Stories about mass looting by the Russian military in the Kursk region also regularly appear in local communities on social networks. Even the Z-warriors admit it. Instead, the local authorities call this data -Ukrainian IPSO- and pretend that nothing happened. -Cases of looting by the Russian military on its own territory reveal the same -mysterious Russian soul- as best as possible, which does not know any values ​​and moral principles, but only seeks to make money,- said the message of the CPD.

The soldier who took over the company. The story of a combat officer -Maxon-	This war has already brought up many worthy young commanders who went from soldier to officer, and today we will tell about one of them - Maksym Zaichenko, lieutenant of the Third Separate Assault Brigade. Correspondent of Armiya TV met with - Maxon- in the early fall near the combat mission area to ask him about 10 years of war, attitude to people and leadership in the current army. - You are from Zaporozhye. If you compare the city 15 years ago and now, what has changed? - I was born in Zaporizhzhia in 1992. He entered the football sector in 2007. Subsequently, repressive actions on the part of the then authorities against the fans began. This is me about the case of the Pavlichenkos. We supported the actions in Kyiv, for me it was a manifestation of my civic position. It happened that -Berkut- tried to put us on the asphalt simply because of the red and black flag. Both in Zaporizhzhia and at away matches. Therefore, it was precisely this press from the side of the state, from the side of law enforcement agencies, that forced us to unite. And when the revolution began, the fans came forward as a single force. Our city is very industrial, I had the impression that you only have to move along a typical vector: learn to be an electromechanic - school, vocational school, factory. It was important for me to think about my future so that it was determined by me, and not by the environment. I found like-minded people who believed that Zaporizhzhia is not only factories, but many different areas. Cossack spirit, how not to be cool. You just need to develop them. - Did you even then think that there would be a war? What will have to be fought for? — This became clear to me after the Revolution of Dignity. I was a student, I took an active part in the revolution both on the Zaporozhye Maidan and on the Capital Square. When all kinds of -militia- and Russians began to capture populated areas, of course, there was already an understanding that it was necessary to react. Ilovaisk became a critical moment. It was an understanding for me that the situation is not as rosy as I imagined. I understood that I had to join the army. I was supposed to go to the third year of the university, but I packed my things and went to Kyiv. We had a mobilization center at the Kozatsky hotel. He stayed there for several weeks, underwent training and went to the East. Arrived in Urzuf near Mariupol. Got weapons, got armor, it was a volunteer battalion of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. - How did those around you, loved ones, perceive your decision to go to war in 14th? - The family had a reaction that, they say, you can stay, you don't need to go - they can kill you there. But I have explained my position. And they supported me, saying that I was doing everything right. It was organic for me and my environment. Once again, I am an ordinary guy from Zaporozhye. — Tell us about your battle path. How did you end up here? - During the 2014-16 campaign, I was a grenade launcher, a machine gunner in an assault platoon, as it was then called. I was in the rapid response group, participated in the Shirokin operation. Stabilization actions were also carried out in Mariintka. Sometimes he performed the tasks of a unit commander, but he did not officially have a title. Retired as a senior soldier. Later in his civilian life, he began to delve into military topics. He formed a defense headquarters in our city, he immediately understood that it was necessary to acquire skills, not only in handling weapons, but also in medicine, tactics, and military management. Just before the large-scale invasion, he moved to Kyiv. And I knew that, in case of anything, the guys from Azov and I would gather at ATEK (plant in Kyiv). And on February 24, indeed, everyone was there. They say to me: -Maxon-, come on, you are a veteran yourself, gather people like you, people are coming from different regions, organize. So, literally on the first day, more than a hundred people gathered at my place. Some I knew, some just arrived. They came again. And in the evening they ask me how many people you have. At that time there were about one hundred and thirty. They put me in charge of a company, they say, deal with the distribution of personnel, structure, organize, think about support, think about combat training. For about a week, he was engaged in organizing this. Legally, it was just a group of people. At the same time, there were already situations when the enemy came very close to Kyiv. I gathered groups of people who were already ready to perform combat tasks and they went to perform such tasks already in those days. There was a kind of -commotion-, but work had to be done, for example, they helped one of the units of the 72nd brigade to hold the line on the Irpin River. There were a number of other similar combat missions. In just a few weeks, we were able to build a management structure, assign people roles according to their knowledge and skills. But there were also people who did not know much, they had to gain a basic level of training in these couple of weeks. In this way, we coordinated, formed a company, at that time it was a unit of territorial defense -Azov-Kyiv-. On the basis of this company, we later reformed into a company of the Azov-Kyiv SSO battalion. Being actually a company commander when he was drafted into the SSO, only then did he receive the rank of sergeant. - How did the events develop further? - Then we went to the Zaporozhye direction, where as a company we joined the battle and helped hold Vremivka. There was a difficult situation. The enemy then took possession of Neskuchny, there was very little left to enter Vremivka. We went there, reinforced our comrades from the territorial defense, from the Defense Forces. There was another episode when the enemy entered a settlement, and we immediately knocked it out: we were provided with three BMPs, our infantry drove into them and cleared this settlement. In this way, they worked to stop the advance of the enemy in the Zaporizhzhia direction. After that came the understanding that it was necessary to develop as a unit, because we did not have heavy weapons, armored vehicles, artillery, tanks. We realized that it is not promising to be permanently attached to someone. Therefore, it was decided to reformat and create a brigade within the Ground Forces. At that moment, I was offered to develop the battalion. That's how I got the primary officer rank - junior lieutenant. This is how I went from a senior soldier, then an actual company commander, I was still the head of intelligence in the Bakhmut direction, then I worked in the Avdiiv direction, Terny, and now I am here as a so-called acting officer. battalion chief of staff. - Are there people, commanders or soldiers that you look up to? - This is not about historical figures or any military leaders, but about the fact that there are a lot of guys around who look fear in the eyes. I understand for myself that everyone can have fear, but what distinguishes a brave person is not the absence of fear, but the ability to overcome this fear and fulfill the task that you have, that you have set for yourself. And it's not just about war, it's about life in general. And I am very glad that many of the guys we have here are, in fact, almost all of them are heroes. And everyone I see, I have a lot of respect for someone who is in our department and can be looked up to. In general, in response to this question, I can name many battalion commanders. We don't have -jackets-. The average age of the officers is probably somewhere in the region of 30 years. All of them grew up within the brigade, roughly speaking. Now we have reached the level where we have harmony between the officers and the rank and file, there is an understanding between the soldiers. And there are no questions, they say that an outsider came to command there. - If it were not for the Third Assault Brigade, in which brigade would you like to serve? - But there is no such brigade. It happens that people do not want to spend their own efforts, to come to everything ready-made. But the guys and I built this unit from scratch. Everything in the Third Assault Room was created from scratch. Created directly by the guys in this crew. Fighters of all levels. Both soldiers and command. And volunteers. Indeed, this is the child that we created, gave birth to together. I just can't say that I see myself anywhere yet. And it's not about us being perfect. We actually have a very wide range of areas that need to be developed. Nothing perfect exists. And even if somewhere we are the coolest, there is still room to grow. Therefore, everyone who comes, I am sure, will be able to realize himself with us. If the ideas are really competitive, then a person will show himself, and we will create all the conditions for this. - Tell us about how you prepare recruits? - We have recruiting centers. A person comes, asks what they are interested in, signs a contract. Next, our instructors provide basic skills, do everything to ensure that a person is first of all able to blend into the team. After a person has come to us, he also goes through adjustment. That is, it is not the case that a recruit arrived and was immediately sent somewhere. This is something that scares many. We don't do that. Because we would lose ground to an unprepared fighter. And it is not profitable for us to put an untrained fighter on the front line. We are interested in a person being ready to perform basic tasks. - Tell us about recent work (the conversation was recorded at the end of September, ed.). What is the current situation in your area of ​​responsibility? - If we talk specifically about our unit, the Second Assault Battalion, we have been in active defense since the spring, we were moved from the Avdiiv direction for recovery. But recovery takes place in combat conditions. And lately, the enemy has been trying to seize the bridgeheads, advance in the direction of Borova, to the Oskil River. The pressure is on several fronts. Including due to the range of responsibility of our brigade. But we are trying to dictate our own initiative. We suppress the enemy, accordingly, the defense is active, we carry out counterattacking actions. Somewhere we are helping other units. Right now, our soldiers are conducting active assault actions on the front. And the preparation for these actions was very exhausting, dynamic, it's a pity that I can't tell about it. According to our estimates, the main goal of the enemy is to seize specific settlements before winter. In order to cross the river on our site. So that they have a bridgehead and from it continue the offensive and seize Ukrainian territory further. - What was remembered during these days? - Is it that the enemy's infantry marches in droves every day. And now I sometimes have this feeling, especially in the morning, like a time loop, -groundhog day-. Almost every day the same thing. The enemy tries to climb, follows almost the same routes. We are waiting for him there, we meet him, inflict damage, squeeze like cockroaches. But they continue to do it the next day. And they use the same ineffective methods. - Do you expect that with the rains and cold weather the nature of the fighting will change? - There is a conceptual opinion, and there is a practical one. If you start from a practical point of view, it is always better to winter in basements, and not in dugouts in the ground. Therefore, purely from a practical point of view, the impression is that the enemy is trying to occupy populated areas in order to meet the winter normally. We faced the fact that actually wintering in the ground is a little more difficult than getting settlements. And from a more global point of view, the adversary needs to compensate for the reputational losses he has already suffered. Which were caused by the actions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. I have in mind both the Kursk operation and the situation with the fleet at sea, how we knocked them out. Therefore, they use a large human resource, a significant amount of equipment. And he will achieve some results, and indeed, this winter and these geopolitical moments will shape the reality that will take place in the spring. - Do the military talk about potential negotiations, some kind of truce? - I believe that such thoughts appear more among the civilian population and in the mass media. Not so in the military. We are thinking about the combat mission that is immediately in front of us. This is directly my attitude. We have, regardless of what happens in the offices in Kyiv or other cities, other countries, to fulfill the task that is clearly issued as a combat order. Hold the line. Provide maintenance in general. Each brigade has a line of responsibility. We need to get used to the fact that everyone should be responsible for their own line of responsibility. After all, when you fail in yourself, you thereby set others up. The same probably applies to people who try to shift responsibility from themselves to someone else. There is a citizen, his responsibility, it is written in the Constitution, in addition to rights. Yes? But there is still a responsibility to protect one's Motherland. Why is it often said that the Third is stormy, it has an ideology, there is some high psychological level. Because our people, first of all, are ready to take responsibility for themselves. And when you understand that you have a specific task, you will fulfill it regardless of other circumstances. That is why we are thinking about this. - What are your plans after the war? Will it ever end? — In war, it is difficult to talk about plans. But I know for sure that I will return to my family, to my wife, to my son. I am in contact with them, now video communication helps. But what I know for sure is that as long as I am in the Armed Forces of Ukraine, I will do my duty. I will try to bring this point as close as possible, I don't know what to call it, but this point is a clear understanding that the eastern neighbor, I hope, will no longer be in the form of the Russian Federation, this fragmented structure will not threaten our state. And, accordingly, to my family. And to the families of my boys, my brothers. That is, it is a matter of survival. We are not fighting because we are simply stubborn. Or we were told by our Western partners that we should fight. This is a question of survival. So I want to make sure my child doesn't have to fight. That my wife will not be in danger. Until there is this understanding, I will use the most effective methods, which is to defend the state with weapons in my hands. And to protect those people, citizens who live in this state. This is what we are doing now.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/04/soldat-yakyj-vzyav-na-sebe-rotu-istoriya-bojovogo-oficzera-maksona/	2024-11-03T21:11:52-08:00

Rocketman Kim's intercontinental antics: what is known about the ballistic missile he plans to launc...	As informs the Army Recognition portal, intelligence received during a confidential briefing indicates that North Korea has completed preparations for a nuclear test at its Punggyeri test site, with a special equipment and launchers, probably for the launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile designed to demonstrate atmospheric reentry capabilities. As the authors of the portal note, the leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-un, has been increasing his show of force in recent months, accelerating missile tests and opening a secret military enterprise for the production of uranium in September. According to South Korean intelligence, North Korea has deployed a mobile launcher, likely the 12-axis model recently shown in state media, to launch intercontinental ballistic missiles that could potentially reach the US territory. The move comes in line with South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol's warnings that Pyongyang could stage major military provocations around the US election to pressure Washington and its allies. The ICBM, probably the Hwasong-18 or a similar missile, will check durability of atmospheric re-entry technology, which is critical for the warhead to withstand the extreme heat and friction en route to the target. While previous North Korean intercontinental ballistic missile tests have been conducted with launches at steep angles to minimize distance and avoid hitting nearby territories, analysts suggest that a more standard trajectory would represent a major advance in North Korea's missile program. Such a test would confirm North Korea's ability to target remote locations, including the US mainland. Escalating tensions on the Korean Peninsula since 2022, particularly following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, have allowed North Korea to develop its nuclear and missile programs under less international scrutiny. In this context, recent reports from the authorities of the Republic of Korea leave no doubt about Kim Jong Un's intentions to continue developing weapons of mass destruction while strengthening alliances with states outside the Western sphere, such as Russia. For decades, North Korea has developed a nuclear capability to increase deterrence against perceived threats. Relying on asymmetric weapons strategies to offset the limitations of its conventional forces, Pyongyang has made significant progress in miniaturizing nuclear warheads and developing intercontinental ballistic missiles such as the Hwasong-14 and Hwasong-15 models. These capabilities position North Korea as a nuclear power capable of striking the United States, thereby increasing geopolitical pressure on the United States and its allies. As North Korea occupies a strategic position, the US and its regional allies continue to closely monitor these preparations to anticipate any potential threat. -The possibility of nuclear tests and the launch of intercontinental ballistic missiles during the election period in the United States creates an atmosphere of uncertainty, emphasizing the importance of maintaining international vigilance,- the authors of the article summarize. The launch of the North Korean intercontinental ballistic missile Hwasong-18.

About the great construction and the best servant of the soldier: why in Britain they teach the mobi...	No matter how well trained and highly motivated the soldiers are, no matter how many they are, and no matter how well they are equipped with the right weapons and ammunition, the fighters will not be able to hold their positions if they are not properly equipped. The correspondent of ArmiyaInform tells about how they learn to set up individual shelters, observation and firing positions during the BZVP within the limits of the Interflex multinational training mission on the territory of Great Britain. The task of our two detachments is to occupy a circular defense in a house on the outskirts of a small settlement called Eastmere. This is one of the locations of the famous STANTA - Stanford Training Area in the county of Norfolk in the northeast of England. Based on the approximate population size by Ukrainian standards, Istmir can be called a village, because it is unlikely that more than a thousand people can live in the houses there. However, in terms of infrastructure, it is more of a town, because it even has its own hotel. Before leaving the camp for the so-called -Urban- - training in combat tactics in urban development - I had time and will be able to surf the Internet well, so I not only know the general history of the STANTA district and the town of Eastmere, but I can also navigate its streets . Eastmere was built in 1942 when, during the Second World War, the British Army needed a combat training ground to train soldiers for urban combat. It was on the territory of STANTA that soldiers were trained for combat after landing in Normandy during Operation Neptune on the famous D-Day. There are a lot of photos and videos from Eastmere Training Village on the Internet, including media publications about the recent training of Ukrainian servicemen from previous rotations. This makes it possible to recognize not only the streets and houses of the town, but even individual rooms inside the buildings. The most interesting fact turns out to be the fact that from the end of the 1960s to the mid-1970s, the famous TV series -Dad's Army- (-Dad's Army-) about the so-called Home Guard (The Home Guard), which was originally called Local Defense Volunteers (LDV). The Home Guard can be called local defense units or, in a more familiar wording for Ukrainians, territorial defense. Volunteers who could not join the army in any other way due to medical reasons or because they had professions from which specialists were exempted from conscription went to the British Terrodefense during the Second World War. Most often, the British could not join the army in any other way, except for service in the Home Guard, because they were older than the mobilization age. Hence the title of the series -Dad's Army-, which jokingly plays on the age of the volunteers, most of whom are over 50 years old, while others are not supposed to serve for medical reasons or because of their civilian profession. The TV series -Dad's Army- became extremely popular in Great Britain, having a huge impact on society and popular culture. During its run in the 1970s, it regularly drew an audience of 18 million viewers, its characters became recognizable, and many of its catchphrases became catchy. In 2000, Dad's Army was ranked thirteenth in the British Film Institute's list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes, and in 2004, Dad's Army was ranked fourth in the BBC's poll of the UK's best sitcom. In the end, the extraordinary popularity of the series prompted the British in 2016 to make a full-length film -Dad's Army-. After reading about STANTA and -Dad's Army-, you involuntarily begin to associate yourself with the heroes of the series and British soldiers of the Second World War. So when we finally get to the town of Eastmere, its modern look is somewhat surprising, because we expected to see something from the 80s. But no, Eastmere has been renovated, updated and partially rebuilt. The middle of the last century is evidenced only by the rusty skeleton of an armored car left in the backyard of a city hotel. It has such an ancient appearance that it appears to be a message not even from the Second World War, but from the even earlier First World War. It is the two-story hotel building that our second and fourth units are to protect, while the first and third units are set up in the house across the street. There are a lot of rooms on two floors and in the solid basement of the hotel, so there are two fighters for each position. We are given the task of setting up observation and firing positions in a limited time and with the means at hand in such a way as to be able to repel the training assault that will be carried out by the instructors. Time is short, so we get to work right away and work non-stop right up to the deadline. I am lucky to work with -The Chinese- - he is younger than me and has some experience in military training, so he can orient himself better and faster than me. I myself am more useful in earthworks - rural childhood and the experience of archaeological expeditions are in evidence, but I feel less confident in urban development and with building materials. Our building material is bulky and inconvenient to carry wooden pallets, heavy sandbags and heavy clumsy stone building blocks, much larger in size than the standard bricks we are used to. We also find some fragments of metal structures, boards, netting - everything goes. Our -big construction- continues, the outskirts of Istmir have turned into an anthill, on the streets of which dozens of soldiers in pixels are dreaming, dragging everything that will help to set up positions. Our unit continues to work even when some fighters from neighboring platoons have long since finished their work and are resting. Only after the deadline, when the instructors are already leaving to evaluate our work, -The Chinese- and I have time to run around and inspect the work of our brothers and sisters. The quality is impressive, and -Grandfather- and his partner actually managed to build a real -Great Wall of China- - an impenetrable barricade. -Grandfather- in civilian life is a builder, so he knows what he's doing. The instructors praise our unit, and our position thanks to the -Chinese- is one of the best - comfortable, well protected, with a good field of view and firing. Instructor -Thomas- gets into position with the machine gun and nods his head approvingly - we did a good job. Then, when we go to inspect the positions of neighboring platoons, we will see positions that are even better than ours, and, unfortunately, significantly worse positions. Those who completed the work much earlier than us did it precisely because they neglected their own safety and built the fortifications badly. While we are visiting the neighbors, I remember the world-famous tale of the three little pigs, which, by the way, originally originated in England and goes back to the depths of folk folklore of the Middle Ages. The first piglet made a house out of straw. But the evil wolf blew - and the lightweight straw weaving flew behind the wind. The second piglet made a house out of branches, sticks and verbolos. However, the predatory beast tensed up - and destroyed the shaky weaving of the mouth. And only the third piglet built a real tenement with strong walls. So no matter how much the attacker tried to break his fortress, he could not even move a single brick or move even a single pebble. The third pig stubbornly struggled, while his fellows, hastily making a shelter out of straw and sticks, rested, played, sang and danced and passed the time in every other way. However, later, when it came to the fight with the enemy, it turned out that only the house of the third piglet was able to reliably protect the inhabitant. Instead, the straw and adobe -fortifications- crumbled to pieces at the slightest enemy pressure. The instructors do not read us notations, they only silently pay attention to certain shortcomings that are obvious even without their prompts. Only later, already during other classes, one or the other of them make small remarks, from the combination of which a simple but important moral emerges: -A good soldier always takes care of himself, his safety and his comfort. After all, how well he feels, how well rested, how safe and comfortable his shelter and position are, directly depends on both his survival and the performance of the combat mission. A soldier has no servants to do everything for him. He is his own best servant, who can and should take care of himself in the best possible way. So never be lazy, because your life depends on your work.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/04/pro-velyke-budivnycztvo-i-najkrashhogo-slugu-soldata-chomu-u-brytaniyi-mobilizovanyh-vchat-buty-tretim-porosyam/	2024-11-03T20:40:25-08:00
The battle for the White House: what is known about the strategic communications of Kamala Harris an...	Donald Trump's election campaign is built on the images of a -savior of the common people- and a national hero. His communication strategy is to consistently emphasize Trump's role as the only defender of citizens against the -system.- His slogan is-They didn't come for me, they came for you. I'm just standing in their way- resonates with thousands of American citizens, especially among supporters of the Republican Party. The key theses of Donald Trump's campaign are collected in Agenda 47, which includes ten priorities and twenty promises focused on the security and financial well-being of Americans. Trump's staff has made extensive use of micro-targeting, attracting support among specific groups such as parents, veterans and athletes through promises addressed to each audience separately. Opinion leaders are another important tool during election campaigns. As of today, 49 celebrities, including Elon Musk, Mel Gibson, Tucker Carlson, Kanye West and Fifty Cent, have expressed their support for Donald Trump. This greatly strengthens his position among voters, for whom the opinion of these people is authoritative. In response to Donald Trump's hero image, Kamala Harris' staff chose the archetype of a leader who faithfully serves the country and leads it to change. Her campaign builds on Harris' previous experience as vice president of the United States and California attorney general, emphasizing her accomplishments and work already done. The main audience of Kamala Harris' information campaign is middle-class citizens. In its strategy, it relies on the support of such famous persons as Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jimmy Carter, Barack and Michelle Obama, Eminem and Taylor Swift. In total, she was supported by 81 famous people, which is a significant advantage for attracting the attention and trust of voters. The information campaigns of both candidates were also influenced by the publication of -Project 2025- by the think tank -Heritage Foundation-, which highlights the potential first steps of Donald Trump if he wins the election. The project has become a sensation and has caused concern among many US citizens, as its recommendations are considered a threat to democracy and civil rights. Donald Trump distanced himself from the project. At the same time, Kamala Harris began to use it as a tool for conducting -offensive actions-, forcing Trump to take a reactive position. Donald Trump and Kamala Harris' strategic communications show consistency and a clear structure. Both candidates go to great lengths to maintain their chosen image and to maintain the tone of their own brand. Kamala Harris is benefiting from the powerful support of opinion leaders, as well as the effect of the sensational release of -Project 2025-, which significantly increases her chances of winning the presidential election. At the same time, time and circumstances leave room for change, which adds uncertainty to the race for the White House.

The heart of a soldier of the Armed Forces for $70,000: Russians on the darknet are lying about -bla...	But as informs the Countering Disinformation Center, these messages are part of a long-running campaign by enemy propagandists, known as Black Transplantology. It dates back to 2014. Its main goal is to discredit the Ukrainian military and political leadership and to create a negative image of Ukraine on the international stage. This fake also works as a tool of psychological warfare, causing distrust in the Ukrainian authorities, speculating on emotionally complex topics and creating an image of the Ukrainian military as -victims of the system- rather than Russian aggression. The manipulation is aimed at destabilizing Ukrainian society and weakening the country's support from the international community. Propaganda often uses similar disinformation tactics to tarnish Ukraine's reputation as a corrupt state with a disregard for human rights. Ukraine, on the contrary, always adheres to international norms of humanitarian law and ensures proper treatment of fallen soldiers, strictly fulfilling international obligations.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/04/sercze-bijczya-zsu-za-70-tysyach-dolariv-rosiyany-v-darkneti-breshut-pro-chornu-transplantologiyu/	2024-11-03T20:15:51-08:00

From hopelessness: whom Russians fear the most and why they surrender	A representative of the public relations service of the -Charter- brigade told about this on the broadcast of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon - Sergeant Volodymyr Degtyarev of the National Guard of Ukraine. - Almost every week we manage to capture someone from the Russians. They fear their commanders in some places more than us, he said. The military said that Russians most often surrender because of hopelessness and hoping for medical help from the Ukrainians. - It is usually rare that they surrender themselves. Most often, we create certain conditions for them when, for example, they are injured and understand that they will not receive help from their own, and then they start to show signs or go towards our soldiers, - said the guardsman. Russian servicemen of the same units who have long been in that part of the Kharkiv direction, which belongs to the area of ​​responsibility of the -Charter- brigade, are mostly captured. - Basically, these are the same units, but they have been recruiting former -convicts- for a long time, who sign a contract with the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation. This is a new form of the -Wagner- army, only now instead of -Wagner- they come and representatives of the Russian Ministry of Defense communicate with them, - explained Volodymyr Degtyarev.

A living rebuke to the evasioners — 60 Czechs received permission to join the Armed Forces	About this informed the Czech radio spokesman for the president, Philip Platosh. Petr Pavel received a total of 181 such requests for permission to join the Armed Forces. The satisfied statements were approved by the ministries of defense, interior and foreign affairs of the Czech Republic. According to Czech law, if a Czech citizen wants to legally join the war on the side of Ukraine, he or she must first ask the president for permission to serve in foreign armed forces. Otherwise, the Czechs face criminal liability. Citizens can also retroactively apply for a service permit. As reported by ArmyInform, the Law of Ukraine was adopted, which allows foreigners and stateless persons to serve in the Armed Forces, the National Guard and the DSTU under a contract in officer positions. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/03/zhyvyj-dokir-uhylyantam-60-chehiv-otrymaly-dozvil-na-vstup-do-zsu/	2024-11-03T02:57:26-08:00
In the fall, the Russians were counted, but they will not be cured: the October losses of the occupi...	The representative of the public relations service of the -Charter- brigade named the representative of the public relations service of the -Charter- - Sergeant Volodymyr Degtyarev of the National Guard of Ukraine. — If we look at the losses of the enemy only in the area of ​​responsibility of our brigade, we will see that we disabled up to 200 Russians. 89 of them will never see this world again, he said. Another 97 occupiers managed to be injured, and some of them also, most likely, eventually fell into the category of irreversible losses, given the extremely low level of training of enemy soldiers in tactical medicine and the almost unorganized evacuation. — Evacuation is very badly organized, there is practically no training in tactical medicine. It can be concluded that even this hundred will not survive. That is, 200 Russians were destroyed in a month - that's two full-fledged infantry companies. This is a lot, as for the section of the brigade, - remarked the soldier. Also, the representative of -Charter- reported that in October, the Guardsmen destroyed or damaged 20 units of enemy equipment, mostly cars. — Of course, this may indicate that they are preparing an accumulation, and we are ready for it, we are watching, we are preparing our anti-tank means. However, so far we can see that the ability for us to see deep and far enough thanks to drones and shoot through these roads does not allow them to use the technique, - explained Volodymyr Degtyarev. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in Kharkiv Oblast, the enemy intensively spends manpower, but saves military equipment.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/03/voseny-rosiyan-polichyly-ale-vzhe-ne-vylikuyut-zhovtnevi-vtraty-okupantiv-pidrahuvaly-v-hartiyi/	2024-11-03T02:42:45-08:00

About this in the interview Youtube channel The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine was told by Oksana Ferchuk, adviser to the Minister of Defense of Ukraine on logistics and IT. She reminded that SAP is the leading international system in the field of resource management, which is used by 28 NATO countries. This program was provided to the Armed Forces of Ukraine by colleagues from the USA and specially adapted for our country. The system automates supply processes, generates information about the balance in warehouses, orders, allows you to see the real need, procure and provide the army with everything necessary on time. About 240 large Ukrainian companies use SAP software to control and allocate their resources. -SAP is the digital core and will help us provide the most modern defense resource management process and is an integrated solution with other systems,- said Oksana Ferchuk. Also, thanks to SAP, control over the supply and accounting of weapons and military equipment at the main bases was automated. This also applies to spare parts for equipment that we receive as part of international technical assistance. According to Oksana Ferchuk, this system is implemented by a joint team with the General Staff and the command of the Logistics Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. And now it is already used in 600 military units in the directions of 6 security services. -The result of the final implementation of the system should be the full automation of logistics processes and the complete rejection of paper document flow in logistics operations,- concluded Oksana Ferchuk, adviser to the Minister of Defense on digital development, digital transformations and digitization. As reported by ArmiyaInform, the IT coalition since its creation in September 2023 accumulated 157 million euros to support Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/03/systema-sap-dopomagaye-minoborony-kontrolyuvaty-j-avtomatyzuvaty-proczesy-zabezpechennya-postachannya-ta-finansuvannya/	2024-11-03T02:07:47-08:00

In the Lyman direction, Russian invaders attacked Ukrainian positions 16 times during the day near Grekivka, Terni, Yampolivka, Torsky and Serebryansky forests. There are currently two battles going on. In addition, the enemy actively used aviation, carrying out twenty-four airstrikes with unguided missiles. During the day, the enemy carried out seven offensive operations in the Ivano-Daryivka and Vyimka areas in the Siverskyi direction. In the Kramatorsk direction, one combat clash was recorded near Predtechyny, which was successfully repulsed by our defenders. Having dropped three guided aerial bombs in the direction of Toretsk, the Russians attacked the positions of the defense forces eight times. The occupiers concentrated their main offensive efforts near the settlements of Toretsk and Shcherbynivka. Currently, one combat clash continues. Since the beginning of this day, in the Pokrovsky direction, the Russians have tried 11 times to break through our defense near the settlements of Mykolaivka, Promin, Krutiy Yar, Selidove and Vyshneve. One battle is still ongoing near Krutoy Yar. The enemy is suffering significant losses - today 229 occupiers were neutralized in this direction, 87 of them - irreversibly. Two tanks and two BMPs of the enemy were also destroyed. In the Kurakhiv direction, the enemy is also active - 51 times attacked our positions near the settlements of Illinka, Novoselidivka, Novodmytrivka, Gostre, Maksimilianivka, Antonivka, Kostyantynivka and Katerynivka, nine battles - continuing. According to updated information, 180 occupants were neutralized, 66 of them &#8211; irreversibly, in addition, one vehicle was destroyed and two armored fighting vehicles and one artillery system were damaged. In the Vremivsk direction, the invaders carried out 14 offensive actions near Trudovoy and Maksimivka. Four clashes are still ongoing. The enemy carried out an airstrike in the areas of Novodar'ivka, Bogoyavlenka, Maksimivka and Velika Novosilka, dropping six anti-aircraft missiles and using 30 anti-aircraft missiles. In the Orihiv direction, our troops repelled 4 enemy attacks near Novoandriivka, Robotyny, and Malaya Tokmachka. Until now, one attempt by the enemy to advance in the direction of our positions near Novoandriivka continues. In the Dnieper direction, our troops repulsed three enemy attacks near the Cossack Camps, Dnipro and Kozatskyi Island, the enemy was unsuccessful. In other areas, the situation has not undergone significant changes. As reported by ArmyInform, the Defense Forces of Ukraine stopped more than 100 attacks of the enemy and caused significant losses to the occupiers. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/03/genshtab-zsu-vidznachyv-voyiniv-5-brygad/	2024-11-02T22:07:21-07:00
Will North Korea go further than Kurshchyna: the expert named the country that can stop it	About how the actions of Putin and Kim Jong-un are perceived in Beijing, the expert on the history of Ukrainian-Chinese relations, candidate of historical sciences, leading researcher of the Institute of History of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, Volodymyr Golovko, told in the ArmyInform commentary: -China is not very satisfied with this Russian-Korean initiative It should be remembered that it is with North Korea that China has an Agreement on Cooperation and Friendship, which provides for the provision of urgent assistance from the PRC if necessary, that is, in fact, a military alliance. Therefore, involving the only country to which China has such alliance obligations is a serious challenge for Beijing. Obviously, China will put pressure on both North Korea and the Russian side to limit the North Koreans' participation in hostilities against Ukraine. Obviously, Beijing will seek to ensure that the use of North Korean troops is limited in nature. Most likely, Russia and North Korea will be watching for China's reaction. And for the time being, the Koreans will not enter the Kursk region in large units. Further, both the Russian Federation and the DPRK will take into account both the reaction of China and the reaction of the Western world. If the reaction of China, as well as the Western countries, is strong, then the participation of the North Korean military will be limited to the Kursk region. If not, then the Russians will dare to transfer the Koreans to internationally recognized Ukrainian territory.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/03/chy-pide-pivnichna-koreya-dali-kurshhyny-ekspert-nazvav-krayinu-yaka-mozhe-zupynyty/	2024-11-02T22:06:11-07:00
Invisible heroes of a complex operation: how engineers of the Support Forces of the Armed Forces bro...	Lieutenant Colonel Ivan Veretko is the deputy commander of the 48th Kamianets-Podilskyi Engineering Brigade for psychological support of personnel. He devoted his whole life to service in the engineering troops. He started serving in the special forces in 1998, graduated from the Military Engineering Institute at the Podilsk Agrarian and Technical University in 2005, and the National Defense University of Ukraine in 2024. Went through the ranks from deputy platoon commander to deputy brigade commander. Now its military unit is one of those operating in the Kursk region together with other components of the Defense Forces. ArmyInform asked a military officer about the difficulty of an engineer's work during a breach of the state border, the special psychological training of a sapper, and much more. We are talking about this very thing today, November 3, when Ukraine celebrates the Day of the Engineering Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. - Do the specifics of your brigade's actions differ from actions on the territory of Ukraine and Kurshchyna? - On the territory of Kurshchyna itself, the specifics of actions do not differ from the tasks performed by our brigade on the territory of Ukraine. The only thing that was new was overcoming the border and engineering barriers of the enemy located on the border. — How did you interact with the units of the DSHV, SV ZSU? — We interacted in such a way that the sapper units of our brigade were placed under the command of the amphibious assault units, namely: battalions, companies, and directly our means of communication were adjusted under their communication. - Is there special psychological training for sappers? Briefly explain how this happens. — The sappers go through an obstacle course that simulates the conditions on the battlefield. Servicemen of the sergeant rank underwent combat stress courses to be ready to respond to critical situations in their units during combat missions. - How did your unit commanders prepare (psychologically, morally) their people for operations on the territory of the Kursk region? The deeper the knowledge and confidence in one's skills, the calmer and more confident a fighter acts in stressful situations. When a person clearly knows how to react in extreme conditions, in combat operations under KAB strikes, his body and psyche are less affected by panic or uncertainty. First, you need to learn to reduce your anxiety level. The work of a sapper is a constant risk, and if you keep it to yourself, you won't last long. We learn to control our breathing, quickly -switch- after tasks and maintain emotional calm, even when everything around us is turbulent. Secondly, it is important to be able to adapt quickly to a new team. When a sapper is attached to another unit, everyone has to understand each other's words, because there is no time for explanations in battle. Therefore, we often conduct joint training with other units in order to be -on the same wavelength-. Last but not least is exposure. The life of a sapper is a constant stress, and you need to be able to cope with it, recover quickly and stay focused. Conversations and explanatory conversations were held that this task is necessary for the army and the state as a whole. However, people were motivated to take these actions. — Were there ready-made engineering and fortification structures on the border with the Russian Federation? How was the border with the Russian Federation fortified (and was it fortified at all)? - There were high-quality engineering fortifications on the border with the Russian Federation, the border was fortified in terms of engineering. In addition to the fortifications, there were many mine-explosive and non-explosive barriers combined as a whole in the line of defense. — Due to what, in your opinion, did the Defense Forces manage to break through the state border: equipment, people, training? — The border was managed to break through due to the effect of unexpectedness, the training of people who had some combat experience and were equipped with good armored vehicles. —In the network, information is already spreading that the Russians are entrenched in Kurshchyna. Is that so? And the Defense Forces of Ukraine? - Almost from the very beginning, the Russians began to carry out fortification works for the defense of Kurshchyna. The Defense Forces of Ukraine, in their turn, also began to carry out fortification works in order to consolidate and defend units on this territory. —Is your crew adequately staffed? And the techniques? (for actions in Kurshchyna and in general). Do you need people who are specialists in civil life? - This is always a difficult question. On the one hand, we have a team that shows its strength, professionalism and confidence every day. But, on the other hand, motivated, goal-oriented people are always needed - because engineering forces have their own specifics, and there is always a need for those who are ready to work under constant drive. We do not have monotonous days: sometimes we are laying roads for equipment, sometimes we are clearing mines for special forces. And every new task needs those who can withstand the stress and make quick decisions. Therefore, even when it seems that there are enough people, new, motivated professionals will definitely not get in the way. - What would you advise civilians who have not yet decided to mobilize or not to join the Defense Forces of Ukraine - But come to us! Everything awaits you: drive, friendship, and, as they say, real tests of spirit and body. The work we are doing is not just a service, it is a battle for the future. At the front, we are not just defending the land, we are standing up for the right to live freely, for the lives of our relatives, for Ukraine, as we want to see it. Everyone who joins becomes a part of this struggle. It's a real challenge, yes, but is there anything more epic than fighting for your country and winning? In the engineering troops, there is not enough work only for sappers! Specialists of various profiles are needed in our team, because engineering troops are engaged in a wide variety of tasks - from the construction of defensive fortifications to the creation of routes for combat vehicles. And even after our victory, the engineering troops will still have a lot of work to do in demining, cleaning, and decontamination of our motherland of Ukraine from explosive objects. - What inviolable values ​​and principles guide you in your work? - In my work, I am always guided by the principle of justice, because it is the basis of true leadership. It is important to me that subordinate personnel feel supported and cared for. A fighter who has to perform combat tasks must not only be professionally trained, but also provided with everything necessary: ​​clothing, food and timely payment of financial support in full. These are basic needs that must be met so that a serviceman can fully perform his duties, knowing that he has reliable support. The job of a sapper is not just to carry out combat tasks, but to be always ready to be near any unit (airborne assault troops, special forces groups, tank units) that needs their help. Since sappers are usually attached to other combat units, they must be able to quickly adapt to new conditions and quickly establish contact with a foreign team. It is not easy, but this is the specificity of our work. - What does it look like in practice? Sappers do not always work in their usual team - they are constantly assigned to other units. This means that each sapper must be able to quickly get used to a new environment, understand the task, and at the same time be responsible for the safety of the entire unit. The work of a sapper is always a difficult and dangerous process, but, as they say, there are nuances. It's one thing to clear a path for tanks. This task is clear, understandable: the sappers know that there is an armored vehicle in front of them, which is ready to withstand a certain level of danger. The main thing here is to lay a safe corridor and to react promptly to a change in the situation. Demining for special forces and more is a completely different story. This is filigree work, where the life of the sapper depends not on the armor, but on the people who will then follow invisible paths to the enemy's rear. It requires absolute precision, accuracy and silent work without the right to make a mistake. You usually have to work at night or in unfamiliar territory, and any little thing can be decisive. At such moments, sappers must be psychologically prepared for high responsibility: they go first, providing a way for those who carry key tasks on the front line, and often become the invisible heroes of a complex operation. After all, it is not for nothing that the motto of our brigade is ahead of the first. - Whose exploits from among the personnel of the brigade would you single out, in particular, during the actions in Kurshchyna? Two servicemen of the brigade were awarded the Order of the -Golden Star- posthumously. These are Lieutenant Oleksandr Borshulyak and Junior Sergeant Denys Dorofeyev. In particular, several times Denis Dorofeev's unit was able to stop the advance of the enemy thanks to the minefields they installed. In total, they had thousands of installed mines on their account.

F-16, Tom Cruise and -Top Gun-: how -Maverick- helped Ukraine and whether it can help more	Why didn't Pete -Maverick- Mitchell choose the newest dual-lightning F-35 Lightning II for the mission, but was forced to fly the older -Rhino---Hornet- - -Rhino- F-18 Hornet? What is the most important component in a fighter plane and why can't a fighter pilot think? ArmiyaInform tells about how -Maverick- has already helped and whether it can still help Ukraine. The combat sequences of many, if not the vast majority, of feature films are more fairy tales than actual depictions of combat. However, the influence of the world of cinema, especially the masterpieces of world fame, on real life is undeniable and it applies, including international politics and the military sphere. This also applies to -Top Gun- - a dilogy of Hollywood films about the pilots of fighter jets. Its first part was published way back in 1986, and the second was published 36 years later - in the spring of 2022. The first -Top Gun- not only became extremely popular, collected more than 350 thousand dollars in theaters, made the actor of the main role Tom Cruise a superstar, and made the American heavy carrier-based fighter F-14 Tomcat famous. The 1986 film also significantly influenced the perception of military service in American society in the mid-to-late 1980s. At that time, Americans, in view of the detente in relations with the USSR and traumatic memories of the war in Vietnam, viewed the prospect of a military career rather negatively. Instead, -Top Gun- made military service popular again, causing a veritable boom in new recruits in 1986. About 90% of those who aspired to serve in the US Navy indicated that they had watched a feature film about fighter pilots with Tom Cruise. The second -Top Gun- also became a sensation at the American and global box office. Collecting more than $1 billion worldwide, it left behind such films as Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (just over $950 million), Batman (around $770 million) and Jurassic Park 3 (around $750 million). The very names of the films indicate that -Maverick- had to compete for the audience's attention with very powerful rivals. It was possible to win the battle for the audience thanks to the cooperation of forces and means - from the nostalgia of the fans of the first -Top Gun- and the star galaxy led by Tom Cruise to the dashing plot, talented direction and extremely realistic location shooting. The influence of this part of the dilogy also went far beyond the world of cinema, affecting world politics and international relations. First of all, he significantly raised the morale of Ukrainians and strengthened the anti-Russian position in the whole world. The main villains of the film flew precisely on Russian Su-57s and used the Mi-24 attack helicopter. This left no doubt that the unnamed country was at least on friendly terms with the Russian Federation. The way in which the latest American F-18 Hornet fighters and even the legendary, but already decommissioned F-14 Tomcat confidently crushed the latest Russian weapons left no doubt that the Russian aggressors can and should be defeated. To defeat the aggressor state of the Russian Federation, it is enough to provide Ukraine with the necessary weapons and train the Ukrainian military to use them - and the Armed Forces of Ukraine will ensure the desired result. The film, which was watched or at least well known by the citizens of all pro-Ukraine states and all the politicians there, did its job even when it was not mentioned. When it was possible to include the issue of providing Ukraine with the F-16 Fightin Falcon to the agenda, reminiscences from the dilogy began to work with triple efficiency. The spirit of -Top Gun- was felt in everything from quotes from the film in media publications to visual solutions. After all, the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyi took a photo in the cockpit of the -Fighting Falcon- in the same way that Tom Cruise did many times in many American fighter jets. It was in the F-16 that Tom Cruise was photographed on December 6, 2001 during a visit to the Joint Reserve Naval Aviation Base in Fort Worth (Texas). Volodymyr Zelenskyy did this at the Skridstrup Air Base in Vojens (northern Denmark) on August 20, 2022. It took more than two years for the first F-16s to enter service with the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. -Fighting Falcons- in the Ukrainian sky, the President of Ukraine presented > August 4, 2024. The next day Volodymyr Zelensky published several photos of the fighter jets, noting that -the F-16 is truly a reality, a reality in our skies.- Between the two August series of photos - in Denmark in 2022 and in Ukraine in 2024 - there is a gap of hundreds of hours of negotiations and thousands of hours of training of Ukrainian pilots, during which -Top Gun- was not only in the air, but also repeatedly mentioned directly by instructors and their students . -Did you see the last movie, Top Gun, where Tom Cruise says, 'If you think, you die,'- cites the American media Politico as saying Tom Richter, a former US Marine Corps F/A-18 Hornet pilot who later transferred to the F- 16. -No matter how Hollywood it is, it's true.- Watching films in the original language with subsequent discussion is always an important component of language training. It was urgently needed and received by Ukrainian pilots during F-16 training. Also, films are an important motivational tool that can, with the help of bright emotional images, establish certain thoughts in the audience, postulate certain theses, and form stable beliefs and principles. -Top Gun- is the best for this. The thesis -it's not about the plane, but who is the pilot- that is repeatedly repeated in the film emphasizes, first of all, the training, skill and fighting spirit of military pilots. The F-16 is a perfect fighting machine, but its main component is the pilot in the cockpit. It is thanks to the pilot that the fighter turns from a set of tools and functions assembled into a single body into a living organism capable of acting as a single entity with a person. In the hands of a well-trained military pilot, the F-16 becomes a direct extension of his consciousness, a part of his body, like an arm or a leg. It is at the moment when this union can be achieved and firmly established that the training can be considered complete. None of the parts of -Top Gun- show how Tom Cruise's character flies exactly on the F-16 - this would make the parallels between the films and life even more obvious. However, Pete Mitchell instead has the globally recognized callsign Maverick, named after the AGM-65 Maverick air-to-surface missile. AGM-65 Maverick is the standard, one might even say classic, ammunition for the F-16 Fightin Falcon multipurpose fighter. This missile is intended for Close Air Support aircraft during an all-out battle. -Maverick- is an extremely effective missile capable of hitting and destroying a variety of tactical targets - armored vehicles and ground vehicles, fuel and ammunition depots, stationary fortifications and enemy air defense facilities. However, the AGM-65 Maverick also has a weak point - a range of only 40 km. In view of this, using it over the battlefield in Ukraine under the current conditions is too risky, since to launch it, the F-16 will have to fly too close to the line of combat engagement. The risk of losing a plane due to the action of enemy air defense is too high and in the vast majority of cases it is absolutely not worth the destroyed enemy targets. So at the moment there is no need to talk about the transfer of AGM-65 Maverick to Ukraine. Under the current conditions, other air-to-ground munitions should become more important, primarily high-precision, medium-range glider guided bombs AGM-154 JSOW. However, one should not forget that the modern war has already surprised many times with non-standard solutions and changed the rules of the battle. Therefore, you should not completely forget about the AGM-65 Maverick - by changing a number of parameters, they may well turn out to be an effective means of combat. Similarly, in the fictional world of Top Gun: Maverick, the F-18 Hornet is not the latest F-35 Lightning II, disabled by enemy GPS jammers, but chosen for the mission. What's more, the old F-14 Tomcat puts up a decent fight and even comes out victorious in a confrontation with two enemy Su-57s. For all its fabulousness, the cinematic -Maverick- never crosses the fine line between realism and fantasy definitively. The chances that the dogfights shown in the movies could have happened in reality are extremely slim. But they are not absolutely zero. The chances that the AGM-65 Maverick can be effectively and safely used over the battlefield in Ukraine are extremely slim. However, Ukrainians know how to surprise and impress no worse than Pete -Maverick- Mitchell. Because -it's not about the plane, but who the pilot is.- Earlier, ArmyInform talked about JSOW guided aerial bombs from the USA: what kind of weapon is this and how will it help the Defense Forces of Ukraine and thought, what will be the task of Mirage 2000 in Ukraine, and also explained why they are fighting on the side of Ukrainestrong peanut John McClain, John Rembo, Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and Indiana Jones, Angus McGyver, T-800 terminator, Neo and John Wick and other movie heroes of world fame.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/03/f-16-tom-kruz-i-top-gan-yak-meverik-dopomig-ukrayini-i-chy-zmozhe-dopomogty-shhe/	2024-11-02T21:36:02-07:00
They twisted the essence: fake workers of the Russian Federation created a manipulation about the co...	Actually, in the interview, an excerpt from which the Russians seem to be spreading, Sergeant Tymochko did not say anything about -plans for the mobilization of women-, but only expressed an opinion about the need for civilians, in particular women, to undergo military training courses. Civilian training centers operate in Ukraine, engaged in both general military and specialized military training of civilians. Civilian women and men take the course in these centers voluntarily as part of preparation for military service and resistance to Russian aggression. So the propagandists, in their characteristic manner, twisted the essence of the message and made a short manipulation out of it. Since 2014, no woman in Ukraine has been forcibly mobilized. However, Russian propaganda regularly spreads fakes that Ukraine is about to start mobilizing women. This is one of the most favorite topics of propagandists, to which a certain number of gullible Ukrainians are -led- every time. We remind you: the service of women in the Defense Forces of Ukraine was and is exclusively voluntary. And the goal of such destructive narratives is to cause a split in society, to sow distrust in the Armed Forces and state authorities.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/03/perekrutyly-sut-fejkoroby-rf-zlipyly-manipulyacziyu-pro-pryzov-zhinok-do-vijska/	2024-11-02T21:17:54-07:00
Billions for a new BMP: the US will replace the world-famous M2 Bradley	According to the information distributed by the author of the defense publication Army Recognition, the Pentagon allocated to General Dynamics (GDLS ) and American Rheinmetall for $800 million for the development of prototypes of this machine as part of the Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle (OMFV) program, ArmyInform reports. The total cost of the rearmament program is estimated at $45 billion, and the United States Army plans to purchase approximately 3,800 units of new armored vehicles. In June 2023, GDLS and American Rheinmetall were selected from five competitors for the final stage of detailed design, while Point Blank Enterprises, Oshkosh Defense and BAE Systems were eliminated from the competition. Evaluating the concepts of the future BMP, experts from IKK Defense Express in particular stated that in fact we are talking about more than a classic modern BMP with a forward location of the engine and transmission department. And also deliberately emphasized armor protection in the form of, most likely, elements of dynamic protection in the lower frontal part of the hull and details on the sides, which are additionally reinforced with overhead elements. Specialists from the Army Recognition defense portal analyzed the novelty more thoroughly. The authors of the site believe that the XM30 will bring significant changes to the infantry fighting vehicle (IPV) category, having a 50x228mm gun in a remote-controlled turret, dual anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs), an AI-enabled fire control system, and a hybrid powertrain. The XM30 will have a crew of two (mechanic driver and commander) and will carry six infantrymen. The vehicle's size and capacity were designed to maintain a balance between firepower and mobility, while preventing it from becoming too large or heavy, as was seen in some previous BMP designs. The combat vehicle will be designed to work alongside future versions of the M1 Abrams main battle tank and is expected to include protection against unmanned aerial systems (UAS). Digital engineering is central to the development of the XM30. In the early stages of the program, the five aforementioned contractors were awarded approximately $60 million each to create digital projects based on Army requirements. Through this process, which facilitated design, development and possible future upgrades, the US Army clarified the requirements for the armor and ensured that they were achievable, avoiding the problems that led to the cancellation of previous programs. For example, by using 3D models and simulations in the early stages of design, the Army has obtained assurances from contractors that all requirements and subsystems, including sensors and fire control mechanisms, are agreed upon before physical prototypes are built. This approach has minimized development costs and helps contractors and the Army quickly resolve any design issues that arise during the process. The XM30's modular design supports future technological upgrades, allowing new systems to be integrated with minimal changes to the vehicle's core architecture. Equipped with a hybrid-electric drive and various weapon systems, including a 50 mm cannon and anti-tank guided missiles, the XM30 is configured to meet current operational requirements while maintaining flexibility for future needs. The XM30 program is a continuation of the US Army's efforts to replace the M2 Bradley, which has been in service since the 1980s. Despite several previous attempts, including the Ground Combat Vehicle and Future Combat System, such initiatives were not successful. Mainly due to problems with requirements alignment, funding, manufacturing technology and prototyping schedule. Colonel Geoffrey Jurand, the XM30 project manager, emphasized that the current program is consistent in these areas and is supported by the use of digital technologies. This approach allows the vehicle to be designed and tested using digital models, avoiding some of the problems faced by previous programs. Both General Dynamics and Rheinmetall have been selected to move forward in the competition, with the US Army currently in the third phase of a five-phase schedule. These contractors will deliver prototypes to the military by the end of 2026, and the Pentagon will conduct a critical analysis of the design by the first half of fiscal 2025. The final selection of a single supplier for production will occur around the first quarter of fiscal year 2028 after testing and evaluation of prototypes. The program is also supported by a -digital trinity- approach that includes model-based systems engineering, digital engineering and development, security and operations (DevSecOps). This digital approach improved tracking and communication between contractors and the Army, and errors were identified and corrected early in the design process. XM30 is one of six programs identified by the Pentagon to demonstrate the benefits of digital technology. The US Army's use of digital technology for this project aims to improve design efficiency, reduce costs and ensure the armored vehicle's modularity and adaptability to future needs. The program has earned the trust of senior United States Army leadership, who have expressed support for its goals and its potential to deliver long-term benefits, including cost savings through its open architecture. As the program progresses, other phases will focus on prototyping, testing and evaluation. The US Army plans to begin testing prototypes in 2026, with a final production decision expected in 2028. Implementation of the program to create the BMP XM30 Mechanized Infantry Combat Vehicle.

Russia uses Western components for attacks on Ukraine — the President	Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated this in his evening address on November 2. -Today, first of all, gratitude to our soldiers. To everyone who protects Ukraine from the daily attacks of -shaheed- and rockets. In the month of October, more than 2,000 -martyrs- were against Ukraine, against our people. Literally every day. This number of -shahedis- is more than 170 thousand components that should have been blocked for delivery to Russia. Microcircuits, microcontrollers, processors, many different parts, without which this terror would simply not be possible,- said the President. According to him, all this is supplied to Russia from abroad. -And this, unfortunately, from companies from China, Europe, America - many micro-contributions to the constant Russian terror. This brings the world back again and again to the need to work much harder to control the export of specialty parts and resources. In order not to give Russia the opportunity to circumvent the sanctions that have long been imposed against Russia for this war,- said Volodymyr Zelenskyi. In his opinion, the situation is similar to that of the Shaheds and Russian missiles. -They all contain components from other countries. Fighting against Russian strikes means fighting, including for the strength of sanctions against Russia. Sanctions should increase and be effective. And every scheme to circumvent sanctions is a crime against people and the world. And it is precisely such schemes that allow Russia to also help the regimes in Iran and North Korea build up their muscles. This is a global threat. And only global, special pressure can overcome this,- the President assured. As reported by ArmyInform, the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy once again ataku/->emphasized that constant terrorist attacks on Ukrainian cities indicate insufficient pressure on Russia and its allies.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/02/rosiya-vykorystovuye-zahidni-komponenty-dlya-udariv-po-ukrayini-prezydent/	2024-11-02T12:31:59-07:00

Loud and unsuccessful escape at the border: shippers and -customers- detained at gunpoint	About this reported the State Border Service of Ukraine. Suspicious movement near the border was recorded by a video surveillance camera. The border guards reacted immediately and set out to search for violators. The fugitives were apprehended after several warning shots. It turned out that the detainees were residents of Kyiv, Kyiv and Lviv regions. During further search activities, border guards detained the 55-year-old organizer of the crossing and his accomplice, a female driver who transported illegal immigrants to their destination. As the law enforcement officers found out, the man organized illegal crossings through social networks, offering his services for 9-10 thousand dollars per person. The detained men were taken to the border unit, where administrative and procedural documents were drawn up against them for attempting to cross the border illegally. The organizers face criminal liability for h. 2 Art. 332 of the Criminal Code (-Illegal transportation of persons across the state border-), and the driver was also prosecuted for maliciously disobeying the legal requirements of border guards. ArmyInform reminds that it is better not to break the law or risk your life, but to use the aggregator of vacancies in the Armed Forces and recruiting centers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/02/guchna-ta-nevdala-vtecha-na-kordoni-perepravnyky-ta-kliyenty-zatrymani-pid-postrily/	2024-11-02T11:21:59-07:00
Dropping drones - the Russians use tourer drones in the direction of the main strike	Senior Lieutenant Andrii Bezsonov, head of the radio-electronic warfare service of the 18th Slavic Brigade of the National Guard, told about this on Army TV. -In my private opinion, there are Russian UAV crews that move from place to place, from direction to direction. And through this, they strengthen the direction that is most interesting to them at the moment. We have also had such people visit us and we can see it, first of all, by the quality of piloting. That is, we intercept the video and see how it flies, how it bypasses trees, how it approaches the target, how it counteracts our EW means,- said Andriy Bezsonov. According to him, the situation with enemy drones has improved somewhat in his brigade's area of ​​operation near Chasovoy Yar, mostly local operators are working, which our pilots call -husks- because they demonstrate very low efficiency. (video from 28:44) As reported by ArmyInform, the occupiers are crossing the channel near the Time Yar, they are unable to gain a foothold, but they continue to attack.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/02/perekaty-drony-rosiyany-vykorystovuyut-dronshhykiv-gastroleriv-na-napryamku-golovnogo-udaru/	2024-11-02T11:03:43-07:00

Four enemy stormtroopers were walking through the ruins, and an ammunition was dropped on them from above, which exploded in such a way that it hit the whole group. -Pay attention: after the reset, dust rises on each Russian infantryman - this is the impact of metal balls.

Just from the street to the marines: what has the Russian marine corps turned into	About this on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- told the spokesman of the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, captain 3 rank Dmytro Pletenchuk. — The quality composition changes. The Marine Corps is an elite, and its elite is not only in the name, but also in the level of training. Just today I came across a material in which a former prisoner turned out to be a marine. That is, now the qualitative composition of these units does not differ significantly, he said. Now, there is no special training for Russian marines. — In fact, the organizational core of the marine corps is used, that is, the command structure, which, of course, is not directly applied on the battlefield. These units have become ordinary infantry units that fill up just off the street without any special training. Because [real] Marines is amphibious training, it's jumping, it's conquering the three elements, the spokesperson explained. Unfortunately, a similar situation is observed in the Armed Forces of Ukraine, although the Armed Forces of Ukraine still try, despite intensive combat operations, to better train marines. — If we take the training from us, the training of the marines continues periodically, despite the fact that they are in combat conditions. But, nevertheless, and there we can notice that now it can actually be called simply infantry, said Dmytro Pletenchuk. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that the 155th Separate Guards Marine Brigade of the Pacific Fleet of the Russian Federation is known for its war crimes, it was even characterized as -very rotten brigade-.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/02/prosto-z-vulyczi-u-morpihy-na-shho-peretvorylas-rosijska-morska-pihota/	2024-11-02T09:21:40-07:00
Artificial intelligence against the -heavenly river-cutter- - the Russians are trying to keep their ...	Video appeared on November 2. After the Russian -wing- noticed the approach of our kamikaze drone, it began to maneuver sharply to escape. This time it was difficult for our operator, but he managed to get close to the Russian UAV and destroy it. But in the future it will be more difficult. Perhaps our drones will have to use new attack tactics, enter from the blind spots of additional cameras, or increase the combat part of our FPVs. Previously, the Russians tried to reduce the consequences of the -sky cutter-, the mass destruction of their reconnaissance -wings- by camouflage painting them, but this did not give results. Now they are trying to use artificial intelligence.

While most mapping technologies -focus on flat representations of the world,- Wilczynski said, Pinpoint will address -how you use that 3D representation to help drones determine their positioning, to help aircraft pilots navigate, to help understand when you're getting drone video or from the plane, what position is he actually looking at.- A representative of the firm noted that it could be an alternative to GPS, which could be vulnerable to adversary interference. That's important in part because of -all the obstruction issues we've seen in Ukraine,- he said. -I think what we're going to see in the next few years is a transition from this absolute GPS navigation system to a much more reference navigation system, more like what happened when you could sort of be in the middle ages on a ship and make your route through the stars-. Pinpoint plans to complete several pilot programs with domestic and foreign drone manufacturers next year, and then make the technology widely available. -We work with various companies throughout the project creation chain. Some companies produce suspensions, some produce completely (unmanned aerial vehicles). There are a bunch of different development options: free, more expensive, some with more durable UAVs. So we are trying to experiment with this market,- Vilchynskyi said. -This is a really fast-growing market right now as people in the defense community realize that the GPS we've relied on for so long may not be available in the next conflict,- said a Maxar spokesperson.

At the same time, the spokeswoman noted that the occupiers are accumulating and concentrating forces and means with the aim of intensifying offensive actions. — We now see that the enemy is withdrawing reserves, the enemy is establishing manpower at the front line, replenishing military personnel, installing anti-aircraft missile systems. We see that they are preparing for some active hostilities, the spokeswoman said. The officer also reported on which divisions and units of the occupiers operate in the area of ​​responsibility of the Luhansk OTU. — If we talk about Chasiv Yar, then the Airborne Division of the Central Military District of the Russian Federation is stationed there. In other directions, these are motorized rifle units of the same military district, Anastasia Bobovnikova said. Earlier, ArmyInform explained, why the occupiers focused their efforts on capturing Toretsk and Chasovoy Yar.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/02/sytuacziyu-v-toreczku-vdalosya-stabilizuvaty-de-zupynyly-voroga/	2024-11-02T08:42:34-07:00

Senior Lieutenant Andriy Bezsonov, head of the electronic warfare service of the 18th Slavic Brigade of the National Guard, told about the situation near Chasovoy Yar. -You kill them, and they keep climbing and climbing. Another wave, another wave, more... Their human resource is inexhaustible,- said Andriy Bezsonov. According to him, the Russians are actively manipulating the logistics routes of the Defense Forces in order to disrupt supplies. The Russians are also persistently looking for ways to protect themselves from our FPV drones. -I didn't see EW shoulder pads, instead there are a large number of EW rifles, and such modifications, about which there is no information. Apparently, this is a small garage production, not very efficient, because in my eyes the Russian worked with an electronic warfare rifle and received an epfivishka,- Andriy Bezsonov said. (video from 26:07) As reported by ArmyInform, the fighters of the 18th National Guard brigade showed what the occupiers have transformed Chasiv Yar.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/02/cze-nagaduye-zombi-rezhym-v-call-of-duty-koly-ty-vbyvayesh-a-vony-vse-lizut-naczgvardiyecz-pro-boyi-pid-chasovym-yarom/	2024-11-02T08:41:29-07:00

A SSO sniper destroyed a group of enemy fighters in Kurshchyna. The Russians were ambushed, and then the surviving occupiers were methodically eliminated by a sniper of the Special Operations Forces. In the Kharkiv region, during the rotation of the Russians at their positions, shells from our artillery and drops from drones flew at them. As a result, the occupiers had to leave their positions urgently.

Major Anastasia Bobovnikova, spokeswoman of Luhansk OTU, told about this on the broadcast of the Suspilne Novosti marathon. — The enemy is most active near such cities as Chasiv Yar and Toretsk. Near Chasovoy Yar, the enemy is trying to cross the channel. No success at this point, she said. However, the Russians take into account previous experience and change their tactics. — Now they have focused on the use of sabotage and intelligence groups and the so-called -secrets-, when one, two, three people run across the channel, hide in urban buildings, in basements, in holes and wait for replenishment or, rather, for the accumulation of sufficient forces for assaults. However, at the moment, such attempts are detected and the groups are affected and destroyed, the officer said. The spokeswoman explained why the named cities are important for the invaders. — These cities are a priority for the Russians, they want to capture Donetsk and Luhansk regions before the cold. As far as we know, the enemy is not preparing for the winter period, because they believe that they will achieve their goals before the onset of frost. Therefore, they focused their strikes on these cities, the officer said. However, the concentration of the enemy's main efforts on Chasovoy Yar and Toretsk does not mean that the occupiers have curtailed their activity in other areas. -In particular, in the Seversky direction, the enemy is also advancing with the use of equipment and simply infantry groups to one unit,- the spokeswoman said. However, currently all enemy assaults are successfully repulsing units of the Defense Forces. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in the area of ​​Chasovoye Yaru, the drones of the Defense Forces destroyed the naval jet bomber of the occupiers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/02/vstygnuty-do-holodiv-okupanty-zoseredyly-zusyllya-na-zahoplenni-toreczka-ta-chasovogo-yaru/	2024-11-02T07:57:18-07:00

It looks futuristic, it burns even better: the jet bomber of the occupiers was destroyed in the area...	Major Anastasia Bobovnikova, spokeswoman of Luhansk OTU, told about this on the broadcast of the Suspilne Novosti marathon. - Usually, the enemy uses the tactics of small assault groups, as mentioned earlier. However, there are other methods, using technology. For example, it is the transportation of the occupiers to the forward positions and the work of artillery, the work of drones and aviation, she said. Voyskova informed about the interesting fact of the use of a jet naval bomb launcher by the Russian invaders. This testifies to the occupiers' lack of weapons and military equipment and an attempt to use anything on the battlefield. — the Russians pulled up a Soviet RBU-6000 or -Smerch-2- jet sea-launched bomber in the direction of Chasovoy Yar. It looks pretty futuristic because it's a ship weapon. However, we can say that the occupiers are dragging everything they have onto the battlefield. Including the ship's bomb launcher, which was not destroyed by our Navy, the drone fighters of the operational-tactical group -Luhansk- did finish off. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in the East the Russians are resorting to rat race tactics.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/02/vyglyadaye-futurystychno-goryt-shhe-krashhe-reaktyvnyj-bombomet-okupantiv-znyshhyly-v-rajoni-chasovogo-yaru/	2024-11-02T06:46:43-07:00

Hypersound has reached Turkey: Ankara will develop a charge based on a ballistic missile	How states the TurkishFacts4u page on the X social network, in the Republic of Turkey confirmed not only the fact of the existence of such a weapon, but also its practical testing, ArmyInform reports. Mach 5.5, and this fact refers Turkey to a rather narrow circle of countries that have hypersonic technologies. Defense market analysts who are the authors of the Army Recognition portal note that hypersonic missiles, the speed of which exceeds Mach 5, have high maneuverability and are practically invulnerable to modern anti-missile defense systems. Traditionally, the Tayfun missile in its basic configuration, the SRBM (Short Range Ballistic Missile) can engage targets over 500 km away. Turkish developers assured that its maximum range is up to 1,000 km. The missile in ballistic configuration with a length of 6.5 meters, a diameter of 610 millimeters and a mass of 2,300 kg identifies the target using a coordinate guidance system. The Tayfun, equipped with a pre-formed cluster warhead, has a high hit accuracy with a CEP (Circular Probable Error) value of 10 meters or less. The hypersonic version of this missile promises to significantly increase the speed, range and effectiveness of destroying targets. > Although detailed technical characteristics, such as range, payload and methods of evading countermeasures, have not yet been published, experts are already stating significant progress in the development of Turkish missile technology. Observers note that the company Roketsan, founded 1988, plays a key role in ensuring Turkey's self-sufficiency in the field of defense technology. The latest developments in the field of hypersonics demonstrate its ability to create advanced weapons. These successes confirm that Turkey is ready to compete at the world level and aims to become an important player in the global arms race, where hypersonic technologies are becoming one of the key directions. The development of this type of weapons shows Turkey's desire to strengthen its position on the world stage and significantly increase its strategic and defense potential. At the very least, the creation of a hypersonic version of the Tayfun SRBM can significantly strengthen Ankara's position in the Mediterranean, the Middle East and other strategically important regions, analysts concluded.

From -rat- to oath: how the military oath evolved in Ukraine	Taking the oath was started in the 9th century. with the arrival of the Varangians to the Ukrainian lands. Rata - that's what the oath to the prince was called. Accordingly, the soldiers were originally called -ratai-, that is, the one who took the rata (oath). Joining the wife, the soldiers swore their loyalty to the prince, and after that the soldiers were considered brothers. The Zaporozhye Cossacks inherited this tradition. When a new warrior came to Sich, he went through reception rites. Among them was a solemn oath of allegiance to the society and acceptance of Orthodoxy if the man was of a different faith. Subsequently, in the period of the XVII-XVIII centuries. the Cossacks were forced to swear an oath to the Russian tsars. It is obvious that at that time it was a forced measure, because the Cossacks swore to them for political reasons. The military oath of the Legion of Ukrainian Sich Riflemen also faced a test in the form of the Austrian military command, because the Sich Riflemen were part of the Austro-Hungarian army. According to the plan of the authorities, they had to swear an oath to the government of Austria-Hungary. But the volunteers who joined the ranks of the SSS went to the ranks of the army with the goal of defending their homeland from the Russians and serving their own Ukrainian people, so they had no desire to swear allegiance to a foreign state and its people. However, due to poor technical support and the threat of dissolution of the SSS, on September 3, 1914, the troops of the SSS Legion were forced to take an oath of allegiance to Austria-Hungary and its emperor. But the USS military did not put up with this and drew up its own alternative text of the oath of loyalty to the native Ukrainian people, although it did not receive official approval. The text was as follows: -I, &#8230;, the Ukrainian Sich Archer, swear to the Ukrainian princes, hetmans, Zaporizhia Sich, graves and all of Ukraine, that I will faithfully serve my Motherland, defend it from the enemy, fight for the honor of Ukrainian weapons until the last drop of blood. So, Lord God and Archangel Michael, help me. Amen.- Under the text of the oath, the soldiers who took the oath must sign. This made the oath more weighty. Special attention should be paid to the wording -to serve the Motherland, to defend it against the enemy- because this was the main motivation of the volunteers. On July 24, 1918, the Council of Ministers of the Ukrainian State of Hetman Pavlo Skoropadsky passed the Law on General Military Conscription. They tried to recruit only those citizens who demonstrated -unconditional devotion to the idea of ​​an independent Ukraine- to the army. Hetman Skoropadskyi also approved the -Law on the Military Oath of Allegiance to the Ukrainian State-. The text of the oath was provided in short changes for conscripts of various religions and nationalities living in the Ukrainian State. The text of the oath: -I promise and swear by Almighty God and the Holy Gospel that I will serve, without sparing my life, faithfully and sincerely to the last drop of blood to the Ukrainian State and His Highness Hetman, the Supreme Commander of the Ukrainian Army and Navy. I will in all cases put up the greatest possible resistance to the enemies of the Ukrainian State, I will watch over all the interests of the Ukrainian State and sacredly guard the official secret entrusted to me and obey without objection all orders for the needs of the service and the State, conscientiously perform all my duties and do nothing for my own benefit to do something that would be contrary to my service and oath. I will never forsake my unit and my Flag, and in all cases I will behave as befits an honest, faithful, conscientious, brave and conscientious (officer or soldier). May God help me in this, and in the end I kiss St. Scripture and the Cross of my Savior. Amen.- This time, the Ukrainian army immediately had the opportunity to swear to its own people and native land. In addition, the Hetman administration took important steps in the organization of the future Ukrainian army. On November 13, 1918, in Lviv, the Ukrainian National Council of the ZUNR approved the text of the -Oath of Ukrainian Troops- by its resolution. It was set out in the following format: -We solemnly swear to Almighty God to faithfully and obediently obey the Western Ukrainian People's Republic, Its Supreme Authority, Its Government, Its Army, as well as to all Its chieftains and all Its leadership, to respect and protect them, their orders and suggestions in every service to be carried out, against every enemy, whosoever he may be, and wherever the will of Her Supreme Authority shall require, on the waters, on the lands, in the air, by day and by night, in battles, offensives, skirmishes and in all kinds of enterprises, in other words, in every place, at every time, on every occasion, to fight bravely and bravely, never to abandon our troops, flags and weapons, never to enter into the slightest understanding with the enemy, always to act according to the laws of war demand and how honest soldiers face to live and die in honor in this way. Yes, God, help us - Amen.- The Ukrainian Galician Army was the most capable Ukrainian military formation during the First Liberation Struggle in 1917-1921. In January 1919, the authorities of the Ukrainian People's Republic approved a sample oath or, as it was then called, -The Promise-. Subsequently, on March 12, 1919, on behalf of the Directory in Vinnytsia, Chief Ataman of the Army of the Ukrainian People's Republic Simon Petliura approved the new text of the oath of the Ukrainian troops. The oath took place solemnly, as a rule, it was attended by high-ranking state officials. Galicians freed from Serbian captivity swear allegiance to Ukraine and the Ukrainian army, August 3 1919. Photo: wikipedia.org Text of the oath: -I swear by the honor of a citizen of the Ukrainian People's Republic and I solemnly swear to Almighty God to faithfully serve the Ukrainian People's Republic, obediently obey its supreme authority of the Directorate, the government and the people's army. I swear to respect and protect the orders and all recommendations of their service, to carry them out exactly against any enemy of the Ukrainian People's Republic and the working people, whoever this enemy may be and wherever the will of the Supreme Republican Power will demand: on water, on land, in the air , day and night, in battles, offensives, skirmishes and all kinds of enterprises, in a word, in every place, at every time and in every case fight bravely and courageously to the last drop of blood. Do not throw away your military units, flags and weapons in any case, do not enter into any, even the smallest, understanding with the enemy, always behave as the military laws and the honor of a warrior-knight require, in this way and honor to live and honor to die Help me in this, Holy God, my love for my native Ukraine and the people.- The Ukrainian military organization was established in 1920 in the western Ukrainian lands. The members of the Ukrainian military organization were veterans of various military formations, first of all, the Sich Riflemen of the Army of the Ukrainian People's Republic and the Ukrainian Galician Army. Colonel Yevhen Konovalets, the former leader of the Sich Rifle Corps, headed the UVO. Each new member of the UVO had to swear an oath of loyalty to the organization. The oath was taken in a secluded place in a narrow circle of people. Those who took the oath raised the three middle fingers of their right hand, and put the left one on the weapon. And various texts of speeches were delivered. Usually, the oath was about unfailing execution of the orders of the leadership of the UVO and about signing a death sentence in case of treason. The OUN and the UPA, following the traditions of the UVO, presented their own text of the oath on July 11-15, 1944, at the founding Great Meeting of the Ukrainian Main Liberation Council near the village of Sprynya. It was prepared by the OUN leadership and the UPA Main Team. The oath entered into force by order of the General Military Staff of the UPA on July 19, 1944, and was published in the magazine -Povstanets- in November 1944. It was accompanied by instructions on the procedure for its preparation and celebration events. The oath was taken after the training, when the soldiers were already sure of their choice. For this event, the warriors prepared in advance by memorizing the text. The ceremony took place on a wide lawn, the rebels were festively dressed and with weapons in their hands, all this was accompanied by a divine service. The first collective oath was administered on August 5, 1944 by the Chief of the Main Military Staff of the UPA for the soldiers of the 3rd Hundred - -Snakes-, -Mace- and -Lions- - using the text approved by the UGVR. Text of the oath: -I, a soldier of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army, having taken up a weapon, solemnly swear by my honor and conscience before the Great Ukrainian People, before the Holy Land of Ukraine, before the spilled blood of all the Best Sons of Ukraine, and before the Highest Political Leader To the People of Ukraine: To fight for the complete liberation of all Ukrainian lands and the Ukrainian people from the invaders and to win the Ukrainian Independent Cathedral State. In this struggle, I will spare neither blood nor life and will fight until my last breath and final victory over all the enemies of Ukraine. I will be courageous, brave and brave in battle and merciless towards the enemies of the Ukrainian land. I will be an honest, disciplined and revolutionary-vigilant soldier. I will follow all the orders of my superiors. I will strictly preserve military and state secrets. I will be a worthy brother in battle and combat life to all my comrades-in-arms. When I break or deviate from this oath, let me be punished by the strict law of the Ukrainian National Revolution and let the contempt of the Ukrainian of the people.- Modern Ukraine On August 24, 1991, together with the adoption of the Act of Proclamation of Independence of Ukraine, the resolutions -On the Proclamation of Ukraine's Independence- and -On Military Formations in Ukraine- were also adopted. In November 1991, at the 2nd Congress of the Union of Officers of Ukraine, where Defense Minister Kostyantyn Morozov was present, the participants took the first unofficial oath of loyalty to Ukraine. On December 6, the Council of Ukraine adopted the laws of Ukraine -On the Defense of Ukraine- and -On the Armed Forces of Ukraine-, and also the resolution -On the text of the Military Oath- approved the text of the military oath solemnly taken in the Verkhovna Rada by the First Minister of Defense of Ukraine, Colonel General Kostiantyn Morozov. After the VRU resolution -On the text of the Military Oath- was approved on December 6, on December 23, soldiers led by Martirosyan on the Independence Square in Rivne took it, publicly swearing allegiance to Ukraine. The text of the oath: -I, (surname, first name and patronymic), join the military service and solemnly swear to the Ukrainian people to always be faithful and loyal to it, to defend Ukraine, to protect its sovereignty, territorial integrity and inviolability, honestly and to honestly perform military duty, the orders of commanders, to strictly adhere to the Constitution of Ukraine and the laws of Ukraine, to keep state secrets. I swear to fulfill my duties in the interests of my compatriots. I swear never to betray To the Ukrainian people.- In peacetime, the day of taking the oath is declared a holiday for the military unit, usually it is a weekend. The commander determines the time and place by separate order, announcing to the personnel. Native military personnel and guests may be invited to the ceremony, priests or religious representatives may be present. Military personnel come in full dress uniform, but during martial law the uniform is determined by the commander. The party lines up, and those taking the oath stand in front. The ceremony begins with a speech by the commander, followed by speeches by representatives of the higher command and veterans. The military are called according to the alphabet, and they, with weapons in their hands, take an oath and put their signature. From this moment on, they officially become military personnel.

Preparation of the mobilized and -military rally -Paris — Dakar--: the chief sergeant of the Armed F...	— What are the features of training in wartime, in the conditions of the situation that has developed, what problems and difficulties exist? — The huge volume of personnel that needs to be trained. At the same time, the terms of such preparation are as limited as possible. Therefore, the number of those who need to be trained and the time limit: these factors definitely have a negative impact on the quality of training. Again, by the method of trial, error and testing in most NATO countries, they came up with the position that the basic general military training for those citizens who have never served before should be 3 months. This is the most optimal term to equip a serviceman with all the necessary skills and abilities. On the other hand, we understand that combat units and units need to be equipped as soon as possible, given the losses they suffer on the battlefield. And here two important factors come into conflict. The first is preparation speed and quantity, and the second is quality. And it is in wartime that we try to balance these three indicators so that in a short time it is possible to train a certain number of servicemen, but at the same time achieve a certain quality of training. Of course, quality suffers. In addition, everything depends very much on how training is organized in a particular training center. How staffed are the instructors at this center and how qualified are they? Plus, it is necessary to take into account the moral and business qualities of those who come to such training, whether they have the motivation to study or not. And a number of other factors that are reflected in different educational centers in different ways. Therefore, the quality of such training in different educational centers also differs. Where management managed to gather more trained and experienced instructors, the quality is better. Where leaders think about improving the educational process, while minimizing many distractions for cadets, such as daily uniforms, patrols, shifts, performing some work and so on, of course, the quality of training is better in such training centers. But it is different everywhere. Also among the main problems is the search and selection of qualified instructors. Since May 2022, the network of training military units and training units conducting BZVP has been significantly expanded. And a large number of new instructor positions were introduced, which must be filled with competent instructors. And it is necessary that they all have combat experience, are prepared, etc. This is very difficult to do even during two years of a great war. Next, it is necessary to send as many such instructors and sergeants as possible to the appropriate courses so that they acquire the methodology and become specialists in teaching. This is what we do, trying to do everything we can and even more. — Recently in social networks, some civilians have been spreading information about the alleged falsification of BZVP in the Armed Forces, what do you know about the above, are the facts being presented true? — Yes, there are cases when civilian bloggers or some experts quite often explain in social networks certain problems of training our military personnel, especially regarding BZVP. Indeed, there are enough problems. As I have already said, you can achieve quality in training only when you train the optimal number of military personnel and you have appropriate deadlines for that. Well, of course, there are other conditions: material and technical base, ammunition. So there are problems, and we know them. Even better than some experts. And we do everything to solve them. I am participating specifically in the area of ​​professional development, training of instructors from among sergeants. It must be said here that combat sergeants are also lacking in combat military units that directly fight the enemy at the front. Therefore, commanders do not really want to give their experienced subordinates as instructors to training centers. They need them there to carry out combat missions. Another of the main problems of the basic training of a soldier is the violation of the very technology of training a fighter to participate in combat operations in the fiercest war that can be on this planet. A full-scale war of the Russian Federation against Ukraine with the use of strategic aviation and all types of weapons and equipment, including the latest drones and so on. Humanity has practically never seen such a war. Only nuclear weapons are not used. Ideally, after basic general military training, a serviceman should get into his unit, where he must undergo further training, certain exercises and a stage of collective training of the unit before performing combat tasks. It is this process that helps a serviceman to prepare for combat operations over a certain period of time. But quite often this does not happen. We can compare the participation of Ukrainian servicemen in combat operations on the front line with the participation of car racers in extremely difficult and fierce rallies -Paris - Dakar- or -Le Mans-. Professional drivers have been preparing for these races for years. Our military does not have the ability to prepare for war for years. Most of our soldiers go to combat brigades immediately after the end of the BZVP. At the moment, unfortunately, we do not have a set of military units to fully replace units on the battle line, given the large length of the entire front. This would provide an opportunity for our units and units to periodically leave the areas of hostilities, recover, and undergo a full cycle of training. Therefore, the absence of this cycle, let's say, also greatly affects the quality of a soldier's training. Therefore, it is impossible to expect that after BZVP a soldier, who was a civilian before that, will come and fully fight the enemy on the front line alongside experienced fighters. To make up for certain shortcomings in his training, as well as in psychological readiness for combat, it is necessary to train with a military unit, for which an adaptation course should be held in it for two to three weeks. I recently worked in the Zaporizhia and Kherson directions, before that I worked in other areas of hostilities. So, in each military unit, sergeants and officers organized additional training for servicemen who come from training centers after the BZVP. And where it is organized effectively, the level of execution of combat missions is better, and there are fewer losses. As part of this training, sergeants who have combat experience and an understanding of the nature of combat operations in this area identify the shortcomings of a particular serviceman, and take such additional training into account. Soldiers are trained for those types of weapons that are specifically in a brigade or battalion. Due to the fact that our units sometimes have different types of weapons (in particular, even small arms), accordingly, the nature of hostilities in different areas of the front differs. Tactics of actions of both the enemy and ours in urban areas, plantations, fields, ruins of cities and villages are taken into account. The main thing is that motivated people come who are ready to fight the enemy, protect their families, homes, their country, the future of their children. — What real steps are being taken to increase the effectiveness of the BZVP, to ensure a higher quality of training for our soldiers? — First, the quality of such training is constantly being analyzed. This is work directly in the training units and units that carry out the BZVP, by checking the training process, interviewing the military themselves, and testing them. And work in combat military units when such fighters come. At the moment, a feedback system is being implemented between training centers and units at the front: reports with shortcomings are sent for further rapid response. Secondly, we are currently working on involving officers and sergeants with combat experience from combat military units to the basic general military training held in training centers. That they directly participate in the training of their future fighters. Such a practice is already in place at the Training Center of the State Academy of Medical Sciences, and it has proven its effectiveness. The main area on which we concentrate is improving the training of the instructors themselves, in particular the professional component of their training, improving their skills in fire, tactical and engineering training, for their transfer to cadets. We hope that the increase of BZVP from one month to one and a half will increase its quality, provide an opportunity to conduct more practical training with recruits, primarily in shooting and tactics.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/02/pidgotovka-mobilizovanyh-ta-voyenne-rali-paryzh-dakar-golovnyj-serzhant-zsu-rozpoviv-pro-problemy-bzvp-pid-chas-vijny/	2024-11-01T21:23:44-07:00
Or maybe for a sex shop - Russian propagandists invented a TCC costume for Halloween	A screenshot of this announcement was shared by z-channels in Telegram. Like, this is the -scariest- outfit for such a holiday. For -confirmation-, the fakers shared a screenshot of an announcement from the OLX platform, which was allegedly published by a user under the nickname Ihor UA. In fact, the user under the nickname Ihor UA did not display goods with such a description. The screenshot circulated online is a fake. Ukrinform investigators established that fakers changed the date and description of the original ad, in which the user sells an assault tactical suit, but leaves out the location, price, and author's nickname. With the help of such fakes, propagandists try to demonize representatives of the TCC and SP in the eyes of Ukrainians.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/02/a-mogly-i-dlya-seksshopa-rosijski-propagandysty-vygadaly-kostyum-tczk-dlya-hellovina/	2024-11-01T21:12:49-07:00
President: North Korean soldiers are already near the Ukrainian border	About this he said during the evening address. North Korea recently test-fired a new ballistic missile that set records for flight time and altitude. Volodymyr Zelensky emphasized that cooperation between Moscow and Pyongyang has already allowed North Korea to improve its missile and artillery capabilities. Now the first thousands of North Korean soldiers are near the Ukrainian border, and, unfortunately, Ukraine will be forced to defend itself against new invaders. The president emphasized that the world cannot simply watch this threat grow. According to him, Ukraine has accurate data on the locations of the North Korean military on the territory of Russia, but it cannot carry out pre-emptive strikes due to the lack of long-range weapons. The provision of such weapons depends on Ukraine's partners - the USA, Great Britain, Germany and other states, which have so far refrained from active actions. Zelensky called for the active participation not only of Western countries, but and China, which declares its desire to end the war, but at the same time only observes the situation. The President of Ukraine concluded that North Korea's participation in the war against Ukraine poses a threat to the whole world, and it must be stopped as soon as possible. As reported by ArmyInform, in an interview with South Korean TV channel KBS Volodymyr Zelenskyi shared his thoughts on the danger posed by the involvement of the North Korean military not only for Ukraine, and why it is important to resist it together.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/01/prezydent-pivnichnokorejski-soldaty-vzhe-bilya-ukrayinskogo-kordonu/	2024-11-01T14:29:43-07:00

Modern cyber technologies for young people in defense of democracies: an international conference wa...	The event was organized by the non-governmental organization -International Academy of Geoinformatics- with the assistance of the Department of International Defense Cooperation of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine and with the participation of the Kyiv Association of Military Attachés of the countries of the Ramstein group. The President of NAPNU, the head of the -Knowledge- Society of Ukraine, Vasyl Kremin, and the director of the NATO Documentation and Information Center in Ukraine, Vineta Kleine, addressed the conference participants with a welcome speech. -99% of all military aid to Ukraine comes from NATO. We all remember how we started. We started with light equipment, then added heavy military equipment, then anti-tank and anti-aircraft systems. Then drones, ammunition and tanks. And we have already reached the Patriot, IRIS-T and F-16 aircraft systems. We always emphasize that supporting Ukraine is not so much charity as our security interests. It is important to emphasize that during the last summit it was once again confirmed that Ukraine's membership in NATO is irreversible, and the question is no longer whether Ukraine will join NATO, but when. But for now, it's about increased military support and more security deals. And all this can become a bridge to Ukraine's full membership,- Vineta Kleine emphasized in her speech. ArcGIS technology, the core of NATO's geographic information system, was the subject of a 20-minute talk by Nick Sutherland, Executive Director of Defense and Intelligence at Esri European National Government Team. Col. Serhii Pryshchepa, representative of the Support Forces Command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, told about the implementation of the tasks of creating geospatial data based on Esri technologies. The speech of the deputy chief for educational work of Lviv Lyceum named after Heroes of Krut, lieutenant colonel Taras Hrytsevich, was also interesting. Candidate of technical sciences Ivan Galenko, vice president of the International Academy of Geoinformatics, told about the command and staff game -Cyberjura-, which allows you to use cloud technologies to arrange the ArcGIS OnLine space. Other speakers also spoke about its practical application. The main target audience of the event was young people who are able to respond to the challenges of modern war with the help of modern technologies.

Russia is removed from participation in the cross-border payments project -mBridge- due to sanctions	About this informs Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine. The project was developed by the central banks of Hong Kong, China, Thailand and the UAE with the support of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS, which unites the central banks of 60 countries of the world). The purpose of the discussion is to prevent the creation of an alternative mechanism for international transactions, as this will weaken the effectiveness of sanctions pressure on the Russian Federation. In view of the risks of participation in the project of Russia or the transfer of this technology to it, the Bank for International Settlements is considering the possibility of closing the project - the Director General of BIS A. Karstens stated that the organization will not support projects related to countries under sanctions. Earlier ArmyInform reported that the enemy is planting drugs in order to create a pretext for detaining Ukrainians at the TOT.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/01/rosiyu-usuvayut-vid-uchasti-u-proyekti-transkordonnyh-platezhiv-mbridge-cherez-sankcziyi/	2024-11-01T11:18:18-07:00

They provide for classifying the organization of illegal migration as a particularly serious crime, making decisions on the administrative -deportation- of foreigners without a trial, and creating a -register of controlled persons - foreigners- who are illegally staying on the territory of the Russian Federation. Strengthening the anti-migrant policy will have a negative impact on the Russian economy - migrants provide cheap labor in construction, agriculture, transport, service, etc. A decrease in their number will lead to an increase in the labor shortage, an increase in labor costs and a slowdown in economic growth. In addition, such a policy will worsen the Russian Federation's relations with the countries of Central Asia. Since the beginning of the year, the number of illegal migrants in Russia has increased by 40 percent. The rate of cases of organizing illegal migration increased by 5.5 times. In 2024, the number of decisions of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation to restrict foreigners from entering Russia increased by 50% to 180,000 cases. Over 106,000 violations in the field of migration legislation were recorded in ten months of this year. 20,000 people were deported from the Russian Federation, and 1,200 people were deprived of their Russian citizenship. As of October 1, 6.2 million foreigners were registered in Russia (8.5 million in 2023). At the same time, the population in Russia is rapidly decreasing. This is influenced by the declining birth rate, high mortality of young men and the outflow of citizens abroad. To maintain the population at the level of 146 million people, Russia must attract from 390 thousand to 1.1 million migrants annually. North Korean military personnel are not classified as migrants. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that 84,000 Kadyriv residents plan to die in Ukraine in the near future.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/01/kreml-posylyuye-antymigrantsku-polityku-cze-matyme-negatyvnyj-vplyv-na-ekonomiku-rf/	2024-11-01T11:04:56-07:00

The ghost of North Koreans: who dies in Kurshchyna in Russian -meat-attacks	Vadim Mysnyk, the spokesman of OTU -Siversk-, told about this on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyni- . — The Defense Forces of Ukraine continue the Kursk operation. Here is the greatest enemy concentration of both [enemy] shelling and enemy manpower and equipment, he said. —The enemy is concentrating its forces precisely in this area of ​​the Kursk region, where the zone of active hostilities is taking place. The concentration of Russian forces and resources in the Kursk region is 4-5 times greater than the concentration of enemy troops in other areas in the area of ​​responsibility of the Seversk military complex. — the Russians use the tactics of meat assaults. They do not change anything - this is how they operate in Ukraine, in the Donbass and in the South, the spokesman said. The military armies of the Russian Federation are able to try to advance only by creating a significant advantage in manpower and partly in equipment. At the same time, when the Defense Forces of Ukraine destroy all enemy equipment, the Russians continue to storm continuously with small infantry groups. — Weather conditions still allow the use of equipment. But when we knock out the equipment, they continue to assault already small small groups of infantry of several people. Incessantly, literally every 10-15 minutes, they come and go, said Vadym Mysnyk. the Russians attack despite colossal losses. The military told which reinforcements the enemy sent to Kurshchyna. — There are marine brigades, and amphibious divisions, and various -storm- battalions. They are trying to carry out assault actions from different directions, but they are getting in the teeth and we are inflicting maximum damage on them, the officer said. At the same time, Ukrainian defenders do not record the participation of servicemen from North Korea in combat operations in Kurshchyna. The spokesman of OTU -Siversk- promised to provide relevant information as soon as the participation of soldiers from the DPRK in battles on the territory of the Kursk region is recorded. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that ->in Kurshchyna, Russian soldiers are wild with fear.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/11/01/pryvyd-pivnichnokorejcziv-hto-gyne-na-kurshhyni-u-rosijskyh-myasnyh-shturmah/	2024-11-01T10:33:41-07:00
Top ten border fighters: which units of the DPSU have the right to independently recruit new recruit...	List of units and contact numbers published on the official website of the State Border Service of Ukraine. The commanders of these units can draft reservists and conscripts who have expressed a desire to do military service during mobilization. The Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine recently introduced relevant changes to the Procedure for the Conscription of Citizens for Military Service During Mobilization for a Special Period (Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine dated October 1, 2024 No. 1130 -On Amendments to the Procedure for Conscription of Citizens for Military Service During Mobilization, for a special period-). According to the changes, the list of military units whose commanders draft reservists (except for reservists who have signed a contract to serve in the military reserve) and conscripts during mobilization is determined by the General Staff of the Armed Forces for a special period. The commander of the military unit can now independently refer conscripts and reservists to the Military Medical Commission (MMC) to determine their suitability for military service. Commanders of military units are also given the right to equip combat military units at the expense of volunteers who express a desire to serve under the draft. For this, it was necessary to contact the TCC and the joint venture. How does it work? The commander of a military unit during the draft of a conscript (reservist) for military service on mobilization: After being enrolled in the lists of a military unit, servicemen are sent to educational institutions for basic general military training State Border Service. If a person does not meet the requirements due to health or professional-psychological characteristics, the commander has the right to deny him the prize. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that the military can select units for service without the participation of the TCC.

About this the Ministry of Defense announced on November 1. -Our second large-scale Hackathon is designed to unite talents to create the latest technological solutions that will help counter the enemy's means and save the lives of our military. We will turn the best ideas into real systems that will strengthen the country's defense,- said Deputy Minister of Defense for Digitalization Kateryna Chernogorenko. -Onslaught of Machines 2.0- will focus on two challenges: Challenge 1: Countering guided aerial bombs. The enemy actively uses corrected air bombs for devastating strikes from long distances. Due to their protected navigation and complex flight paths, they are difficult to intercept with traditional air defense systems. The Ministry of Defense is looking for solutions to neutralize or reduce the effectiveness of these bombs. Challenge 2: Countering fiber-optic guided drones. The enemy uses drones controlled via fiber optic communication. This makes their radio jamming impossible. The Ministry of Defense is looking for a solution to effectively neutralize these drones. You can register for the Hackathon at the link. Deadline for filling out the form: November 8. - After registration, we will inform participants about the technical details of the calls.

They don't have armor, or they hide it: in the Kharkiv region, enemy infantrymen justify their name	The reasons for such a structure of losses of the enemy's ATS in the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyni- explained the spokesman of the Kharkiv OTU lieutenant colonel Yevgeny Romanov. - What we give in our reports, what we observe, what we work on is about one and a half hundred dead and wounded every day. Armored combat vehicles and tanks are also being destroyed, he said. At the same time, in terms of losses of weapons and enemy equipment, the enemy's road transport prevails. — About three or four times more equipment losses are caused by motor vehicles.
