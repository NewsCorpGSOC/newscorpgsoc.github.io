In Toretsk, the enemy is pressing in mass: the Armed Forces spoke about the peculiarity of the tacti...	About the situation in Toretsk on the air of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon the spokeswoman of OTU told Luhansk- Major Anastasia Bobovnikova. — They suffer heavy losses, but are constantly replenishing manpower at the front. Unfortunately, the enemy is very strong against us. We are actively destroying the enemy's manpower. For example, an assault group of 5 people enters. Three of them don't survive anyway. One will be the three hundredth, one will run away somewhere. But there are a lot of them, that is, they are constantly storming and we are trying to fight them off, she said. The situation in the city is extremely complex and dynamic, on the eastern outskirts there are practically no buildings left in which to hold positions. — The situation is extremely dynamic. It's hard to say any specific numbers, because today it's one percent, tomorrow it's another. Today we conditionally defend one street, tomorrow we will recapture another street there, and therefore, in terms of interest, it is not worth focusing on this. However, the fighting is very dynamic on the eastern outskirts of the city, and there are almost no houses left to hold on to, the officer said. The spokeswoman explained what the Defense Forces needed to deter, stop and repulse the occupiers. - We need personnel, weapons, and ammunition for these weapons. We need everything. Give us all your weapons and we will win, because we have enough motivation and willpower, she said. The enemy strikes the city, including from a heavy TOS flamethrower system. Presumably, it is about TOS-1A -Solntsepok-. — They resort to this kind of weaponry, and I want to say that it is a very terrible weapon, it is prohibited by the Geneva Convention, because especially the use of this weapon on urban development, because it is not selective and the civilian population also suffers from it, in fact, very a terrible weapon, said the military. However, the Ukrainian military is conducting an effective counter-battery fight. The spokeswoman promised the enemy a decent retribution for the strikes on Toretsk with the TOS. -In addition, the counter-battery fight is working, we are hunting their artillery and very successfully, they lose artillery almost every day,- said Anastasia Bobovnikova.

Having become -directors- of schools, technological and agricultural and metallurgical technical schools, the so-called teachers organize the work of -educational institutions- in accordance with the educational standards of the aggressor state. Even before the full-scale invasion, they took part in patriotic activities to support the national identity of Ukrainians, and some even taught the Ukrainian language. Now -educators- use educational and methodological documentation of the Russian Federation and the -DNR-, which eradicates our history and culture. Moreover, they conduct flash mobs as part of the all-Russian -movement of the first-, during which they force schoolchildren to swear allegiance to the Russian Federation. They also organize campaigns for children to write letters to their so-called -heroes-. The suspects are wanted. As reported by ArmyInform, law enforcement exposed a female collaborator from Kup Yanska, who worked in the occupation pension fund.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/10/zmushuyut-uchniv-pysaty-lysty-vijskovym-zlochynczyam-desyatom-dyrektoram-na-okupovanij-donechchyni-povidomleno-pro-pidozru/	2024-10-10T08:57:57-07:00
Burns to the bone - the invaders have shown the consequences of the work of our dragon drones	A video of the consequences of a typical dragon drone attack appeared on the Internet.

Civilians as in a shooting range: in Kherson Oblast, Russians hit buses and shops with FPV drones	In detail about the terrorist actions of the invaders on the broadcast of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon told the spokesman of the -Tavria- OUV, Colonel Vladyslav Voloshin - Every day, the enemy fires virtually all settlements that are not far from the line of combat and, in particular, on the right bank of the Dnieper. All available weapons are used. There are FPV drone strikes, missile strikes, and multiple rocket launchers are used. Of course there is artillery, he said. The officer also reported on such an insidious type of ammunition as anti-personnel mines. Occupants can install them remotely and camouflage them to the elements of the terrain. - This is a rather insidious weapon, like mining these territories with PFM-1 mines - insidious anti-personnel mines with a plastic casing. They disguise them as stone elements, terrain elements, grass elements. These mines are very difficult to detect by means of demining and they do not have self-destructors. These mines cause significant damage to the local population, the military officer emphasized. The military officer also emphasized that the Russian military acts like typical terrorists, firing not only at the military, but also systematically terrorizing local civilians. — How the adversary conducts terror against the local population in the shooting range, using FPV drones on civilians, on shuttle buses, on civilian cars, on civilian buildings, even on shops - wherever he sees a crowd of people, he uses his own armament. This is typical terror, these are typical actions of a terrorist state that wants to destroy all Ukrainians and conducts its combat operations not against the Defense Forces of Ukraine, but against the civilian population, Vladyslav Voloshyn explained. The occupiers resort to the same insidious tactics not only in the Kherson region, but also along the entire line of combat. — The entire Right Bank and the Dnipropetrovsk region, in particular, the Nikopol, Marganets, Myriv territorial communities are also suffering from enemy shelling. In addition, the enemy uses more than 300 different kamikaze drones, guided munitions -Lancet- and others - about three dozen -Shaheed- drones every day in our operational zone, the spokesman added. The officer noted that such terror against the local population is terror against the local population, because the military is trying to counter such types of weapons. And civilians cannot do this, that is why the enemy simply attacks them, bringing trouble and death, - said the spokesman of the -Tavria- OUV, Colonel Vladyslav Voloshyn. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in Kherson region Russia terrorizes local residents, there are dead and injured, and also informed about insidious Russian mining tactics using sticky dirty mines.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/10/po-czyvilnyh-yak-u-tyri-na-hersonshhyni-rosiyany-byut-fpv-dronamy-po-rejsovyh-avtobusah-ta-magazynah/	2024-10-10T08:27:55-07:00
Not -Baba Yaga-, but the goddess of revenge - the night bomber crew has already destroyed 12 Russian...	The video appeared on October 10 on the brigade channel. the Russians call our drone -Baba Yaga- and dislike it very much. Not in vain, because -Nemesis- effectively mines the territory, burns equipment and personnel. -Nemesis- is especially fond of enemy tanks, of which he has already burned 12. The self-named -Nemesis- comes from the Greek goddess of revenge, Nemesis. And this is the case when the name accurately reflects the essence of the weapon. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the 63rd mechanized brigade repelled the assault of the Russian invaders, in particular stopped the enemy column.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/10/ne-baba-yaga-a-bogynya-pomsty-ekipazh-nichnogo-bombarduvalnyka-znyshhyv-vzhe-12-rosijskyh-tankiv/	2024-10-10T08:09:33-07:00

About the situation in Toretsk on the air of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon the spokeswoman of OTU told Luhansk- Major Anastasia Bobovnikova. — The enemy is now most active in Toretsk. The situation in general on our routes - Toretskyi, Kramatorskyi, Siverskyi - remains consistently difficult. It's been a little quieter around Time Ravine, but that could change quickly. -There is, of course, active and heavy fighting near Toretsk,- she said. Hitting the city, the enemy uses all available means of fire damage. — The enemy is destroying the city with artillery and aviation. In the eastern districts, there are almost no houses left that survived, that is, in which you could take shelter or somehow continue to fight for them, the military woman said. In particular, today the occupiers hit Toretsk with aviation and a heavy TOS flamethrower system. — Today, the enemy launched 9 airstrikes in our direction. In addition, I want to say that today the enemy launched a strike with TOS, which is a heavy flamethrower system. If the enemies are listening to us, we will find you and you will have trouble, the spokeswoman said. The officer explained that this is part of the enemy's complex tactics, when he first wipes the city off the face of the earth and then goes on the offensive in small assault groups. — They approach comprehensively, they use artillery on the front line very actively, they try to destroy even our relatively rear cities with aviation, for example, Kostyantynivka constantly suffers from airstrikes. When they completely wipe out the city, they start small stormtroopers who already start storming and trying to break through our defenses. That is, there is a comprehensive approach here, she explained. Anastasia Bobovnikova emphasized that the occupiers do not count on their own losses or on the casualties among the civilian population. — The enemy does not count with the lives of civilians, does not count with the lives of the military. They don't care, they randomly shell Toretsk, destroy it from the map. It is clear that civilians also die in such a struggle, she said. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that the enemy is trying capture Toretsk, occupiers advanced along Tsentralnaya Street, there at times there are more than a thousand residents in the city: the enemy does not care about civilian casualties.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/10/vczililyh-budynkiv-na-shodi-toreczka-ne-lyshylos-vorog-vdaryv-z-vazhkoyi-vognemetnoyi-systemy/	2024-10-10T07:54:24-07:00

The Defense Forces of Ukraine successfully hit the Shahed UAV storage base, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reported. About 400 attack drones were kept there. In the Kramatorsk direction, the Russians decided to take up a position in one of the houses. The soldiers of the 30th mechanized brigade did not like this very much, and they sent their reconnaissance group to talk with the Russians. Our fighters know well how to talk to the occupiers, so they first attacked the house with drones. When the Russians got hot, they started to run away. Scouts of the 30th brigade caught up with them and captured them. These and other topics are discussed by our presenters - Captain Artem Golub and Lieutenant Colonel Serhii Misyura.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/10/rusnyu-pidirvaly-u-budynku-ti-hto-vyzhyv-zdalysya-goriv-sklad-shahediv-strim-z-pryfrontovogo-mista/	2024-10-10T07:44:50-07:00

According to him, this is how the enemy checks the Ukrainian defense system, which is built on the border, and collects information about the plans and units located there. -Secondly, they terrorize the local population, because there were several cases before when they destroyed vehicles of the civilian population and killed them. But recently, for several months, we have not allowed them to actively act,- Vadym Mysnyk said. He noted that natural conditions favor the activities of Russian DRGs. -These are continuous forest areas, marshland, small rivers, reservoirs. But, as I said, we have the technical means to detect such groups, and the units that are on the northern border and carry out the tasks. They are already trained and are quite effective against them,- he emphasized. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that the spokesman of the Siversk operational-tactical group, Colonel Vadym Mysnyk, told about -pivnichnogo-kordonu/->presence of Russian troops at the border.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/10/vbyvstva-ta-znyshhuvannya-nad-misczevymy-u-sylah-oborony-rozpovily-pro-aktyvnist-rosijskyh-drg/	2024-10-10T07:34:37-07:00

About this announced on October 10 the Chief of Communications of the Air Force Command Armed Forces Colonel Yuriy Ignat. -The enemy only damaged a few pieces of equipment, but did not destroy them. This is a war, in a war not only people are injured, but also equipment. Not only that, the same Patriot unit continues to perform tasks in the region,- said Yuriy Ignat. According to him, yesterday the Patriot air defense system conducted an anti-aircraft battle against a group of Russian ballistic missiles and managed to intercept some of them. -The Patriot system is one of the enemy's highest priority targets! Why? Because it is only thanks to this American air defense system that we keep Russian aircraft at a certain distance. Technologies in war are developing rapidly... The enemy is changing its tactics of application, using all available methods of conducting intelligence — from satellites and reconnaissance UAVs to ground agents, the enemy does not spare Iskanders, having information about the potential presence of the Patriot in one or another area, -said Yuriy Ignat. He reminded about the collection of mock-ups and declared their importance and necessity in these conditions of warfare. -The enemy often aims at mock-ups, but sometimes, unfortunately, it's real equipment,- Yuriy Ignat said. He reminded that Patriot is a stationary complex and structurally not intended for war in dynamics. -Only Ukrainians - soldiers of the anti-aircraft missile forces of the Air Force have tested and use this system in such conditions. When the situation on the battlefield changes rapidly, when the enemy uses dozens of reconnaissance systems, EW and air attack means - missiles and attack UAVs of various types. Patriot must survive in these conditions. Quickly change position, effectively camouflage, use a limited amount of equipment in the front-line zone, and at the same time, try to shoot down the Russian aircraft at a long distance. Or at least actively work on him, which will not allow him to get closer. These are the realities!-, Yuriy Ignat said. He criticized People's Deputy Maryana Bezugla, who spoke about the Russian attack on the Patriot air defense system. -Those who want to help, join! The army lacks experienced people of various professions, material and technical assistance. And those who pursue certain goals, want to promote themselves and get rich on the dirty hate of the military — don't forget about the boomerang effect!-, concluded Yuriy Ignat. As reported by ArmyInform, the operator of the Patriot air defense system Viktor talked about beating down the Russian -dagger-.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/10/vorog-poshkodyv-patriot-a-ne-znyshhyv-povitryani-syly-rozpovily-podrobyczi-ataky-rosiyan/	2024-10-10T06:20:52-07:00

-Ramstein-: what to expect from the Defense Forces of Ukraine	The meeting was scheduled for October 12, but it was postponed due to a change in the plans of US President Joe Biden. A new meeting schedule of the Contact Group on the Defense of Ukraine should be prepared in the near future. What can the Defense Forces of Ukraine expect in the context of providing military-technical assistance and strengthening our capabilities in the war against Russia? Military expert Petro Chernyk told ArmiyaInform about this: -The main goal of Ramstein is to discuss, synchronize and accelerate the provision of military aid, weapons and equipment to Ukraine.- In general, the Rammstein site, which includes more than 50 countries from all continents, is a unique phenomenon since the Second World War. Let me remind you that the anti-Hitler coalition was documented on January 1, 1942, and at the start it included only 26 countries. And in -Ramstein- from the very beginning there are more than 50. So, this site is actually an anti-Russian, anti-Putin coalition. As for funding, I can say that it will come from both NATO and the European Union. The needs of the Defense Forces have not changed strategically and will not change in the near future. Most likely, Ukraine will be offered everything that was already provided before. According to him, we are a unique country in terms of the range of weapons, because we have been provided with a whole range of the most diverse weapons. Nowhere is there such a number of the most diverse armored vehicles that are available in Ukraine. Take at least tanks: the Armed Forces of Ukraine use American Abrams, German Leopard 2, and British Challenger 2 tanks in battles. Plus a huge line of small arms, artillery systems, and air defense equipment. In addition, ATACMS and Storm Shadow long-range missiles. We already have F-16 planes. It is quite likely that there will be an increase in the number of weapons from partner countries. Petro Chernyk says that perhaps we will be provided with AGM-158 JASSM air-to-surface missiles, specifically for the F-16. There are already modifications of these missiles with a range of 900 km. These missiles can be used to destroy Russian military airfields and everything based there. The real breakthrough will be the transfer of American AIM-120 AMRAAM air-to-air guided missiles. The missiles can shoot down Russian Su-34s, carriers of guided aerial bombs, at a distance of up to 180 km. Army aviation helicopters may also appear. For example, the AH-64 Apache attack helicopters, which can carry up to 16 AGM-114 Hellfire missiles. These missiles are very effective, able to destroy any unit of enemy equipment at a distance of up to 12 km. Plus, we may have A-10 Thunderbolt attack aircraft. Aircraft have a wide array of weapons to destroy ground targets. Equipped with a 30 mm GAU-8 Avenger gun, ammunition - 1350 rounds. Quite effective weaponry, hits virtually any unit of military equipment: tanks, BMP, artillery installations. There is a nuance. The A-10 Thunderbolt attack aircraft operates at a distance of 3-4 km and can fall into the zone of damage of the enemy's short-range anti-aircraft systems. At Ramstein, our partners can agree on raising the level of production of artillery ammunition for the needs of the Defense Forces of Ukraine. Petro Chernyk says that at the beginning of the Great War, the Americans produced 14,000 shells of 155 caliber per month. And now it has been confirmed that by the fall, they reached the figure of 50,000 shells. Next year, they plan to reach 80,000 per month. A few numbers. The total stock of artillery ammunition of all calibers of the Russians at the beginning of the great war was 15 to 20 million, while the United States had only 2.5 million. In addition, at the beginning of the invasion, the Russians produced 125,000 artillery shells per month. Now the enemy managed to increase production by about 30%. It is about 170-180 thousand, no more. Because there are problems with gunpowder, aluminum powder, other explosive substances. If in 2022 the Russians had 5,400 regular artillery guns, the Americans had 1,000. One remark: the American military-industrial complex is almost 100% in private hands, not in state ownership. If they build a plant in the USA, they count on a decade ahead. How it should work, production facilities, staff training, technology, machine calibration, social security: pension, health care and the like. there will be more Russian mass strikes in the winter on critical objects of Ukraine. This is a possible scenario. Instead, the state should strengthen its air defense capabilities. It has already been announced that Ukraine will receive an additional Patriot air defense battery and missiles for these air defense systems from the United States. Romania also handed over the Patriot air defense system to us. The Patriot battery consists of 4-6 machines. Let's take at least 4 launchers, each launcher has 4 containers. We have 16 missiles at our disposal, which are guaranteed to shoot down Russian air targets. Plus, Germany will transfer 17 new IRIS-T systems to strengthen Ukraine's air defense. The IRIS-T complex has an impressive accuracy rate of almost 100 percent. There are many discussions in society and among experts about the advisability of using expensive Patriot missiles costing up to 3 million dollars on cheap -shaheeds-. I do not share this opinion. How to evaluate the life of a dead child? How many millions of dollars is it worth? And is it even worth it? Of course, no one has questions: when a Patriot shoots down an enemy Kh-47M2 -Kinzhal- missile worth more than $10 million, or, for example, an Kh-101 missile, the price of which is $13 million, - adds Petro Chernyk.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/10/ramshtajn-chogo-ochikuvaty-sylam-oborony-ukrayiny/	2024-10-09T20:57:35-07:00
They were land-based, now they are sea-based: the expert told how the IRIS-T air defense systems kno...	The ArmiyaInform reporter asked a well-known weapons researcher about the details of innovations from the Diehl Defense company from Germany , doctor of historical sciences, professor of the department of humanitarian sciences of the National Academy of Land Forces named after Hetman Petro Sahaidachny Andriy Kharuk: — I will immediately note that the basis for expanding the areas of application of the IRIS-T air defense system is quite sufficient. The complex shows phenomenal performance: according to the information of the manufacturing company -Diel Defense-, from October 2022 to June 2024, in the sky of Ukraine, the IRIS-T air defense system hit more than 240 targets with 100% efficiency. That is, every missile fired hit the target! It is not surprising that the German firm is trying to take full advantage of this success to expand its presence in the global defense market. — So where did German engineers and designers from Diehl Defense direct their eyes? — Among the latest proposals is a -marinized- version of the IRIS-T SLM complex. I would like to note that this version of the rocket is different from the basic IRIS-T SLS. - And what exactly? - At least because the marine version has a transmission line for trajectory correction in the initial and middle sections of the flight, as well as an inertial navigation system with GPS signal correction. In addition, the diameter of the starting accelerator has been increased from 127 to 152 mm, and its length has also increased. Thanks to this, the maximum launch range has increased from 12 to 40 km, and the height of hitting targets has increased from 6-8 to 20 km. -Most of the world's leading arms manufacturers are not limited to the production of defense equipment only by enterprises, but most importantly - by the achievements of engineers within the territories of their own states. It seems that in the process, as you mentioned, -marinization- of IRIS&#8211;T was not without a kind of -internationalization- of this project? - -Diel Defense- company proposes to use IRIS-T SLM from Mk 41 vertical launch installations - American production. They are very widespread in the fleets of many countries, including the German one. Here it will have to compete with medium-range missiles already integrated with the Mk 41 - the American ESSM and the British CAMM-ER. -And having such serious rivals, the Germans were not afraid to enter the market with their offer? You can see it in the comparison table. - However, each of these missiles has its own winning points and, perhaps, certain caveats&#8230; - I said about the -dimensional- points of the German complex. But there is one -but-: the currently existing variants of the IRIS-T (including the SLM) have fixed wings and tail feathers. This means that the German rocket, unlike the American and British competitors, will not be able to be placed in -quadpacks- - that is, four rockets in one launch cell. Given the relatively small (compared to American ships) number of Mk 41 modules on European frigates, this shortcoming could become critical. —That is, the further prospects of the marine variant ofIRIS&#8211;T look ghostly? — I would not say so unambiguously. And here's why. -Deal Defense- is trying to beat it with its trump card: the infrared homing head of its missile, which may come in handy under conditions of active use of EW means by the enemy. However, in the future, IRIS-T developers will have to think about creating variants of the missile with a folding wing and a tail. — Regardless of the above-mentioned -internationalization- of the world market of defense equipment, the armed forces of each country still first of all follow the rule of -to each other to their own!-. — In the Bundesmarine, IRIS-T SLM missiles can enter the arsenal of frigates equipped with Mk 41 launchers - existing (project F124) and prospective (projects F126 and F127). They would complement the ESSM and SM-2MR missiles. The new frigates of the F125 project should be the first to receive the IRIS-T SLM. The German Navy received four such ships in 2019-2022. Their characteristic feature is underarmament: large ships (displacement 7,200 tons, length almost 150 m) carry only two short-range RAM air defense systems (in addition to artillery and anti-ship missiles). However, on these frigates, the project provided for a place to install the Mk 41 modules in the future (in front of the bow launcher of the RAM module). — But, it seems that there was an almost funny situation during the design?... And how did they get out of it? — It was really a mess! That space ended up being occupied by something far more desirable: a gym! So an alternative was proposed: a container version, where an eight-charge IRIS-T SLM launcher is located in a standard container. At the same time, in the starting position, the package of transport-launch containers is located horizontally, and in the combat position, it rises vertically. Two such containers can be installed on the F125. The integration of the IRIS-T SLM with this type of frigate is also simplified by the fact that the main sensor of the F125 is a Hensoldt TRS-4D radar, the same as in the land-based IRIS-T SLM complex (only the ship uses four fixed antennas, and in ground version - one rotary). The same containerized option was offered to Greece in the modernization package for MEKO 200HN frigates, but this project was not approved. — But plans are plans, but what is happening in practice? — True, at the moment the prospects for the maritime version of the IRIS-T SLM seem rather vague. Time will tell if it will be able to break into the market, pushing the competition. Still, I think Deal Defense has a good chance, given that the company is developing new IRIS-T options: IRIS-T SLХ with a range of 80 km and a range of 30 km and IRIS-T HYDEF (respectively , 100 and 50 km), aimed at combating hypersonic targets. -Marinization- of these options will allow Deal Defense to offer potential buyers a comprehensive solution - a multi-level sea-based air defense system.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/10/buly-suhoputnymy-staly-morskymy-ekspert-rozpoviv-yak-projshla-marynizacziya-vidomyh-u-zsu-zrk-iris-t/	2024-10-09T20:43:28-07:00
An old fake about -blocking accounts of dodgers-: who and why plays along with the Russian dezi	Such information recently began to spread again on dubious sites, Telegram channels and on TikTok. In fact, the hoax about blocking bank accounts and card dodgers has been around for a year. For the first time, he started -walking- on the Internet back in October of last year. Fake messages spread the word that if you don't show up on a summons, your bank account and card will be blocked instantly. There is a lot of discussion around the potential blocking of cards for men for not showing up at the Territorial Recruitment and Social Support Centers. In fact, this is just a lie that you want to click on and that plays along with the Russian desire to disrupt mobilization and show the collapse of Ukraine in general. How can it really be? After two disregards of the need to appear at the TCC, information is entered about the person that he is wanted. For further neglect of the duty against such a person, a report on an administrative offense will be drawn up and a fine will be imposed in the future. The decision on the imposition of a fine is transferred to the executive service for enforcement of the fine. In the framework of enforcement proceedings, if the violator does not pay the fine voluntarily, the enforcement service seizes bank accounts until the violator (if he does not appeal the decision to the court) pays the fine. The procedure is no different from the theoretical consequences of non-payment of other fines - for example, for traffic violations. Lawyers point out that there is no such term as -blocking cards of evaders- in Ukrainian legislation. Therefore, if you see a headline like -banks have started blocking card dodgers-, know that it's a fake. You can ignore or complain about this message.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/10/staryj-fejk-pro-blokuvannya-rahunkiv-uhylyantiv-hto-i-chomu-pidigraye-rosijskij-dezi/	2024-10-09T20:29:09-07:00
Rustem Umyerov, together with the President of France, visited the brigade of Anna of Kyiv	This is stated in notification of the MoU. France will provide significant support to this brigade: armored personnel carriers, self-propelled artillery installations, trucks, situational awareness systems and other necessary equipment. Thanks to this help, the unit will be fully equipped for combat missions. Further steps in our cooperation were also discussed at the meeting. Rustem Umyerov informed President Macron about Ukraine's readiness to share experience in the use of UAVs and help create a training center in France for the training of drone operators. -I sincerely thank the people of France and Emmanuel Macron for their leadership and support, which significantly strengthens the capabilities of our Defense Forces. They also had the opportunity to talk with the French and Ukrainian military - the mood is fighting!-, added the Minister of Defense. As reported by ArmyInform, Rustem Umyerov is in France held productive negotiations with his French colleague Sebastien Lecorne. He informed his colleague about the situation at the front and handed over a list of the urgent needs of the Ukrainian army.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/09/rustem-umyerov-razom-iz-prezydentom-francziyi-vidvidav-brygadu-anny-kyyivskoyi/	2024-10-09T12:44:20-07:00
It became known how many military cars were detained	reported this on October 9 SBU spokesman Artem Dekhtyarenko. -Russian special services are behind all cases of arson. It is either the FSB or the GRU. Arson attacks, which are actually carried out with Russian money, with the money of the Russian special services, are actually carried out by ordinary Ukrainians. They call them simply disposable,- said Artem Dekhtyarenko. According to him, the Paliam should not hope for the money promised by the Russian curators. Often, when the arsonist sends the curator a video confirming the arson, the curator says that it was done poorly and asks to set fire to another car, saying that after that he will definitely pay. But they don't pay anyway. Then the pals risk receiving a long prison term for nothing. As reported by ArmyInform, up to 6 years of imprisonment a woman who set fire to a National Guardsman's car in Kirovohrad Oblast was sentenced.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/09/stalo-vidomo-skilky-paliyiv-avto-vijskovyh-vdalosya-zatrymaty/	2024-10-09T12:05:14-07:00

They chose between two dangers: why do Russian ships run between the base and the open sea	Why the enemy is forced to constantly take the ships out to the open sea and bring them back on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- explained Spokesman of the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Captain 3rd Rank Dmytro Pletenchuk. — In principle, this is not the first time we have observed a similar situation. They are now at the base point, there were two submarine carriers left in the sea in the morning. Most likely, they are performing the task of guarding the base, there are no signs of preparations for a massive strike yet, he said. The spokesman explained why Russian ships must constantly move from the base to the sea and back. — As for the case of going out to sea, you see again that it is not the first time it has happened recently. This is exactly the situation when, most likely, the enemy had to choose between two dangers - the danger of going to sea and meeting Ukrainian naval drones, or staying in the port and facing another kind of danger. Most likely, you observed the dispersal of the ship's crew for the purpose of its preservation, explained the military man. Earlier, ArmyInform informed that the Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reported the details of the destruction of -Moscow-.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/09/obyraly-mizh-dvoh-nebezpek-chomu-rosijski-korabli-bigayut-mizh-bazoyu-ta-vidkrytym-morem/	2024-10-09T10:43:20-07:00

This time it was possible to capture Russian soldiers. Their general portrait is rather banal: from 29 to 42 years old, all of them are ex-convicts, signed the contracts in the summer of this year, while in various pre-trial detention centers. Prisoners are united by a common -goal- — money and release from criminal punishment. Some of them were even promised an order and 60 days of leave for capturing a Ukrainian officer. However, their fate was completely different. A group of Russian occupiers failed in their mission to take a landing, dig in and wait for reinforcements and were captured. As reported by ArmyInform, in the Kharkiv direction, Russian invaders were accumulating and hiding in shelters, but they were noticed by the fighters of the 3rd brigade of operational assignment -Spartan- named after Colonel Peter Bolbochan of NSU.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/09/orden-ta-60-dniv-vidpustky-na-harkivshhyni-kolyshnih-zekiv-obiczyankamy-stymulyuvaly-uzyaty-v-polon-ukrayinskogo-oficzera/	2024-10-09T09:54:19-07:00

The ground forces reported how many people contacted the mobilization hotline	This was announced on October 9 by the Ground Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The hotline for mobilization and registration of conscripts provides operational information about military service. Citizens can get advice on their rights and responsibilities in the process of mobilization, as well as learn about current changes in legislation, by phone numbers. This greatly simplifies the process of interaction and awareness in the conditions of martial law. The call center of the Ground Forces Command ensures direct contact of conscripts and military units with the command. It functions as an information and reference service that helps resolve issues related to service, training, provision and support of military personnel. Most appeals were resolved over the phone. Also: With your questions, please call: 0 (800) 500 410 (general questions) 0 (800) 301 937 (issues of equipment, work of TCC and SP).

Sticky and dirty mines: the Armed Forces spoke about insidious Russian mining tactics	Colonel Vladyslav Voloshyn, the spokesman of the -Tavria- OUV, reported this on the air of the national telethon -Yedini Novyni- . — The enemy actively began to use just such a new mining tactic, using PFM-1 mines, which are also called -Petal- or -Petal-. These are plastic mines that contain a liquid explosive. They are poorly detected by various means of detection, mine detectors, and are quite dangerous, he said. The military reported on a new insidious mine-disguising tactic used by the Russian occupiers. - In addition, the enemy began to resort to vile and insidious tactics. He just takes this plastic mine, this plastic case, applies glue and drops it in some dirt, in some dust, in some small stones. The mine takes on the appearance of a rock, the officer said. The Russians also wrap these mines in pieces of cloth or camouflage netting, making the mine look like a pile of trash or a dirty rag. The spokesman also said that the mines installed by the Russians are insidious also because they do not have a mandatory self-destruction mechanism. That is, they can wait for their victim for years and even decades. Such mines are scattered, including remotely, by means of artillery and aviation. Also, the Russians began to develop and practice demining by dropping from UAVs. The military assumed that the insidious methods of mining used by the Russian occupiers in the Kherson direction may soon spread to Zaporozhye. Earlier ArmyInform reported that in the Armed Forces of Ukraine assumed the intensification of enemy attacks in the South.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/09/lypki-brudni-miny-u-zsu-rozpovily-pro-pidstupnu-rosijsku-taktyku-minuvannya/	2024-10-09T08:52:20-07:00

Voluntarily worked for the occupiers: a resident of Kupyansk was exposed	The Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office informs about this on October 9. The investigation established that during the occupation of Kupyansk by the armed forces of the Russian Federation, a 47-year-old local resident volunteered to work for the so-called -Pension Fund Administration of the Kharkiv region- for the position of -chief specialist of the department for the organization of work and payment of pensions.- Mostly, the collaborator was engaged in drawing up lists of pensioners so that they could receive so-called -material assistance- from the Russian Federation. The law enforcement officers collected the necessary evidence base and exposed the collaborator. The Kupyan District Prosecutor's Office of the Kharkiv Region approved and forwarded to the court an indictment against her for collaborative activity (part 2 of Article 111-1 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine). The woman will be tried in the Chervonozavod District Court of Kharkiv. As ArmyInform reported, law enforcement detained military serviceman of the 56th separate motorized infantry brigade, who voluntarily left the place of service and publicly announced his act on September 21.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/09/dobrovilno-praczyuvala-na-okupantiv-vykryto-meshkanku-kupyanska/	2024-10-09T08:19:26-07:00
Barbed wire and drones are a recipe for repelling an enemy infantry assault in the Kharkiv region	The video of the battle appeared on October 9 on the brigade's channel. A group of Russian attack aircraft advancing towards our positions was stopped by barbed wire. Therefore, the enemy did not manage to reach the Ukrainian trenches and switch to close combat. Our drones took advantage of the occupiers' delay, which began to strike at the Russians, not only preventing them from cutting the wire, but also forcing them to retreat. Some of the invaders remained forever in front of the barbed wire. -Repelling the assault thanks to coordinated actions and skill, one of the key roles in this success belongs to our UAV pilots. They provided critical reconnaissance and fire corrections that effectively halted the enemy's advance,- the battalion commented on the video.

The enemy again increased activity in the Pokrovsky direction — the General Staff of the Armed Force...	Operational information as of at 16:00 on October 9 was published by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The border regions of Sumy Oblast and Chernihiv Oblast continue to suffer from Russian artillery shelling — the settlements of Luhivka, Khrinivka, Iskriskivshchyna, Yeline, Pokrovka, Mhy, Striletska Pushkarka, Semenivka, Vodolagi, Oleksandrivka were affected. The enemy carried out airstrikes in the areas of settlements of the River River in the Sumy region; Katerynivka, Kharkiv region; Toretsk, Yablunivka, Kalinove, Vozdvizhenka, Myrolyubivka, Lysivka Oleksandro-Kalynovka and Chunyshyne of the Donetsk region. It is known that today the Russian aviation carried out six air strikes, dropping 14 guided air bombs on the territory of the Kursk region of the Russian Federation. Today, in the Kharkiv direction, Russian terrorists dropped two guided aerial bombs near Tsupivka and Lyptsi, and also twice tried to dislodge our defenders from their positions near Vovchansk. The attacks have been repelled, the situation is under control. Eleven times the enemy attacked our positions in the Kupyan direction. Ukrainian defenders repelled enemy assaults near Kucherivka, Petropavlivka, Novoselivka, Vyshnevo, and Kruglyakivka. Enemy units do not stop attacking in the Lymansk direction in the areas of Grekivka, Druzhelyubivka, Andriivka, Makiivka and Torske settlements. Since the beginning of the day, Ukrainian soldiers have already repelled five out of ten enemy attacks in this direction. The fighting continues. The Kramatorsk direction was attacked five times near Minkivka, Chasovoy Yar, Aleksandro-Shultyny, Bila Hora and Stupochky. Currently, there have been nine enemy attacks in the Toretsk direction. Actively using bomber aircraft, the enemy attacked near the settlements of Toretsk, Nelipivka, Shcherbynivka and Dilyivka, seven clashes continue until now.

Revenge and propaganda: why the Russian military is hitting civilians with KABs	This was explained on the air of the national telethon -Yedini Novyni- the spokesman of OTU Kharkiv, Colonel Vitaly Sarantsev. — If we compare with the previous period, a few weeks ago, we are now observing an increase in the activity of the enemy's tactical aviation. He began to carry out airstrikes more often and increased the use of air defense systems. If not long ago we recorded 1-2 airstrikes using up to 5 air defense systems, now this number has increased. The enemy is already launching 5 or more airstrikes and 10 anti-aircraft missiles, the highest figure was 17, he said. The military explained what caused the Russian occupiers to intensify their use of guided aerial bombs. — We associate this with the fact that, firstly, the enemy suffered a tangible defeat by losing the Aggregate Plant in Vovchansk. Therefore, he tries to divert attention a little in this way by striking civilian objects, civilian infrastructure and passing it off as his small tactical victories in destroying the logistics facilities of the Defense Forces or striking the duty headquarters, according to him, with mercenaries or by NATO instructors, the spokesman said. It is obvious that such statements of the occupiers do not correspond to reality, because we all see that, in fact, Russian aerial bombs are exploding in high-rise residential buildings, educational institutions and hospitals. -We, of course, feel where these airstrikes are aimed, and we all know that the civilian infrastructure and civilians suffer from this,- Vitaliy Sarantsev stressed. He also said that among the tasks of using anti-aircraft guns by the Russians are po-harkivshhyni/->demonstration actions with the purpose of boasting the capabilities of Russian weapons and testing the technological innovations that the occupiers introduce into their newly manufactured aviation ammunition. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that the occupiers are hitting the settlements of the Kharkiv region and the regional center with guided aerial bombs manufactured in September 2024.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/09/pomsta-ta-propaganda-navishho-rosijski-vijskovi-byut-kabamy-po-czyvilnyh/	2024-10-09T00:52:21-07:00

At the same time, it is difficult to judge how massive the installation of underground communications by the enemy is in the urban development of Vovchansk. — At the same time, regarding Vovchansk, one cannot say about the mass of this phenomenon. But, nevertheless, there are locations where the enemy tries to move between buildings, creating small underground tunnels from basement to basement. In addition, those underground communications are used, which were used earlier simply as some kind of sewage corridors or corridors for ordinary signalmen, or heating lines. They also try to use them, the spokesman explained. At the same time, in case of detection of hidden actions of the enemy in the arrangement of underground communication routes, the engineering groups of the enemy are immediately inflicted with fire damage. — I cannot say now about the mass of the phenomenon, because it is quite difficult to monitor such actions of the enemy.

Not only kangaroos and koalas: ATLAS CCV ground combat drone was presented in Australia	The first assessments of the new BMP from the Australians can cause a smile: serious experts looking at the ATLAS CCV (an abbreviation for -autonomous tactical light armored system for joint combat-) say that both this and a number of other modern armored vehicles look as if they were copied from video games. However, this is where the jokes end, and defense market experts state: BAE Systems Australia has presented a new technological achievement in the field of unmanned ground vehicles (UGV) - autonomous tactical light armored vehicle (ATLAS) Collaborative Combat Variant (CCV), ArmyInform reports. The ATLAS Collaborative Combat Variant (CCV) was first unveiled at the Land Forces 2024 exhibition in Melbourne and is expected to be a key step forward in the integration of unmanned systems into modern military operations. This cabless light armored vehicle with an 8×8 wheelbase has been specially designed to operate both on-road and off-road, providing a high degree of autonomy in both cases. BMPs were created to complement manned vehicles, both combat vehicles and main battle tanks. At a much lower cost, it also offers high modularity and adaptability, meaning there is future-proof potential. The autonomous ATLAS Collaborative Combat Variant steering system allows the vehicle to overcome obstacles, plan routes and make tactical decisions in real-time, which significantly reduces the need for direct human intervention. This capability, integrated into a broader battle strategy, is expected to make the ATLAS CCV a potential key element in future wars in which autonomous, semi-autonomous and remotely manned systems work together to achieve traditional combat objectives. However, the main role of this machine is to perform mundane, inconvenient or dangerous tasks, such as reconnaissance in a hostile environment or transporting supplies through dangerous areas. In addition to its autonomous capabilities, the ATLAS CCV, which can fit in an ordinary 20-foot ISO container, is equipped with advanced weapons. The vehicle received the Vantage Automated System (ATS), a lightweight and highly automated medium-caliber turret system with a fully stabilized 25mm Bushmaster cannon. The latter is equipped with a double ammunition supply system, has access to 260 rounds and allows accurate and effective fire at a distance of up to 2.5 thousand m. It is equipped with a human-in-the-loop guidance system, which allows to carry out controlled interaction in combat situations. The turret is mounted in a turret that has a low profile to reduce the chance of being hit. But the gun will never fire itself automatically, because each shot requires the consent of the person remotely controlling it. It is equipped with a 360-degree multi-spectral automatic target detection, tracking and classification system, which includes day cameras, IR surveillance devices, acoustic sensors, passive EW, stereo vision and LIDAR. The chassis of the HMT armored car from Supacat served as the basis for the platform. The ATLAS CCV is equipped with a 6-cylinder 6.7-liter Cummins ISB diesel engine and an Allison 3000 automatic transmission. According to official information, BAE Systems worked closely with many industrial partners to create the ATLAS Collaborative Combat Variant. Namely: Supacat in UK/Australia, Valhalla Turrets in Slovenia and Australian engineering solutions developer Marand . This not only allowed for the integration of proven technologies, but also ensured that the ATLAS CCV would be specifically tailored to the needs of key users, including the Australian Army.

Wounded, 20 hours under rubble and a day in the field alone with drones: the story of serviceman And...	In 2015, the husband and his wife left their native Luhansk - he did not want to stay in the territory where lawlessness and chaos reigned, which embodies the -Russian peace-. Later, the family settled in Kyiv, where Andriy founded his own souvenir manufacturing business. However, in 2022, the war overtook the man in the capital as well... As soon as he received the summons for mobilization, he immediately arrived at the district TCC and SP: - I already ran away from the war once , having paid a high price — I have everything left in Luhansk! So this time I decided to join the ranks of the Armed Forces! - the man recalls. He went through training at the center, received his first officer rank, later he arrived in his unit, which was defending the front against the Russian horde in the Luhansk region, near Beilohorivka. On March 10, his first combat exit. Andriy mentions that the invaders then increased the number of attacks and the use of weapons against Ukrainian positions, and he connects this with the holding of illegal elections for the president of Moscow. — The military leadership of Russia needed to demonstrate at least some result of the so-called svo on the eve of the elections, that is why they pelted us with infantry meat, poisoned us with gas, burned -phosphorus-, used everything they had at their disposal... The officer says that it was about 150 meters from the espeshka, where he was with his comrades, to the enemy positions - the Russian orcs crawled relentlessly, and the Ukrainian machine gun did not stop even when it flew into the dugout at the position and buried one of Andrii's siblings. — I dug up my comrade, he was wounded and in a state of shock. Our ammunition remained under the rubble, as well as the body of another comrade. There was nothing left for us, except to -quench- the assault of the Russians, fire at them four machine-gun belts and all the ammunition for automatic weapons that we had available - which is more than twenty stores, and withdraw from the position. ... The first enemy fire killed the wounded man when his comrades tried to drag him to the evacuation point. The officer's upper limbs were cut off with rolling pins. While he was looking for a safe city where he could bandage his wounds, the second enemy shell, dropped from a drone, cut off Andrii's leg... — I understood that with such wounds I would hardly be able to reach the rear, but I he was saved by guys who were leaving from a nearby position: they tightened the turnstiles and dragged him to the evacuation point, Andrii recalls. In the dugout, medics helped the officer, tamped the wounds and bandaged them. The forces were given some food and water, chemical heaters that were placed in the hands of the wounded helped to improve blood circulation and warm up. ... The powerful impact of another Russian projectile almost destroyed the hiding place where the wounded soldier was waiting to be evacuated. Andriy found himself covered with earth at eye level, standing, because at the very moment of -arrival- he wanted to leave the shelter, as he understood that it might be destroyed. In the cold soil, the man had to spend about 20 hours... - I understood that it was necessary to do everything possible to breathe normally, since the clay around compressed the sternum, and this could lead to death In addition, there was a lot of earth in his mouth. I spat as much as possible, dug a kind of -crater- with my chin, began to move my body to free up some space around me. And all the time I thought about how terrible my death would be, whether my body would ever be found and what would be said to my family about my death... Andrii recalls that at some point due to pain from injuries, fatigue, hypothermia and the hopelessness of the situation, he decided to die simply by holding his breath. However, it was not so easy to do this - the man's body continued to fight for life... And these irresistible instincts gave the soldier strength. He started calling for help! The officer's brothers, having heard that there was someone alive under the rubble, freed him from the earthen -homeland- - it took about 6 hours. However, they could not evacuate to a safer place for a long time - enemy -birds- were constantly -hanging- over the position. On the third day after the injury, at 7 o'clock in the morning, Andrii was sent to the rear. Due to blood loss, hypothermia, and stress, the man's health deteriorated rapidly. But even here fate was not on the side of the military. - Due to the powerful shelling directed at us by the orcs, the comrades who tried to take me to the rear were forced to leave me in the field. I was once again alone with the earth and the sky. However, I understood that I needed to hold out until dark and they would come after me. All I could do then was lay on the stretcher and wait. At that moment, the strength left my body. And I really wanted to drink - I was ready to give my life for a sip of water. In the afternoon, when the morning spring sun rose, it became a little easier - the wounded man warmed up. But the sun on the battlefield immediately became an enemy - lying in the open area in the light of day, the Ukrainian military became a target for Russian drones. Fortunately, no one was -interested- in them&#8230; - Apparently, the orcs thought that I had no chance of life. Or they wanted to use it as bait for the evacuation group, - Andrii shares his thoughts. With the onset of darkness, the Ukrainian officer's comrades returned. It was an extremely difficult way back from the front - the wounded man had to be carried for several kilometers while several enemy -birds- chased the group. And then, in the morning, in a battered car with punctured wheels, they rushed at crazy speed under shelling along a road completely destroyed. — When they carried me in their arms, I fainted from the pain, and the boys only encouraged: -you're only alive, you've endured so much, now it will be a shame to die-... ... Andrei has several operations and long-term rehabilitation behind him. Unfortunately, due to a long stay underground and nerve damage, partial paralysis of the limbs developed. However, he is still grateful to fate that he survived. — After what I have experienced, I am grateful to higher forces for every day of my life. I am grateful that I met fellow citizens for whom human life is the highest value and for which they are ready to fight, despite shelling, drones and other difficult circumstances! And I am grateful to each of them, although I do not remember their names...	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/09/poranennya-20-godyn-pid-zavalamy-i-den-u-poli-naodynczi-z-dronamy-istoriya-vijskovosluzhbovczya-andriya/	2024-10-08T20:38:10-07:00
Fakes about evaders: fake -lawyers- disperse -treason-, real ones - refute	For example, one fake -lawyer- assures that subpoenas will allegedly not be sent to evaders and those who have fled across the border. That the mobilization will apparently concern only those who updated their data on time and remained in Ukraine. It is clear that this is delusional. After all, for violating the rules of military registration, regardless of the place of stay of a conscript, administrative responsibility is provided. And for evading mobilization, criminal charges are also possible. Therefore, it is not necessary to tempt fate - it is necessary to obey the Law. Other so-called -human rights defenders- argue that an unborn third child already gives the right to a postponement and travel abroad, because, they say, it is a -living embryo-, -living soul-, etc. In fact, the law clearly states: -Conscript women and men who have three or more children under the age of 18 are not eligible for military service during mobilization.- So, for the postponement and successful departure abroad in this case, two mandatory conditions are required: There are no exceptions. Therefore, you should not believe the fakes that if you have a third child in November 2022, it -does not count.- That is, if a woman became pregnant after February 24, 2022, then this is allegedly done on purpose to avoid mobilization. Such messages, which also abound on the Internet, are insidious manipulations that have nothing to do with the law. It is not necessary to believe everything that is published in messengers. It is better to always think critically and look at the text of the law one more time, lawyers advise.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/09/fejky-pro-uhylyantiv-falshyvi-advokaty-rozganyayut-zradu-spravzhni-sprostovuyut/	2024-10-08T20:30:47-07:00
Make it to the swamp: in the East, the enemy has intensified the use of armored vehicles	The spokesman of the National Guard of Ukraine, Ruslan Muzychuk, told about this on the live broadcast of the -Suspilne Novosti- telethon. — As noted even by our servicemen who perform tasks in different directions, now the enemy is trying to use armored vehicles more often. This, first of all, is also facilitated by weather conditions. Of course, the situation may change in a few weeks. The condition of the soils may not allow the use of heavy machinery that cannot essentially advance, he said. So far, the weather favors the use of armored vehicles, because the roads have not yet had time to get wet. - Currently, the main obstacle to the use of enemy armored vehicles is the work of our drones, which destroy this equipment in advance. She does not even get to the point of opening fire on the positions. And the second is the actions that our servicemen perform with the aim of demining the terrain and possible approaches, possible enemy advance routes, the spokesman said. Thanks to these actions, it is possible to effectively stop the attempts of enemy mechanized assaults. — This was the case, for example, a few weeks ago in Kharkiv Oblast. A similar situation took place in the Pokrovsky direction, where last week our guardsmen also destroyed advancing tanks, as well as armored personnel carriers and BMPs, the guardsman said. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in Sylah defense told about the attempts of enemy troops to capture Toretsk.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/08/vstygnuty-do-bagnyshha-na-shodi-vorog-aktyvizuvav-zastosuvannya-bronetehniky/	2024-10-08T12:07:17-07:00
Britain announced sanctions against the Russian Federation for the use of chemical weapons against U...	This is stated in a statement at British government website. It is about the use on the battlefield of chloropicrin, a substance that the International Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) qualifies as a chemical weapon. The list of sanctions includes the radiological, chemical and biological defense forces of the Russian armed forces and their commander Igor Kirilov, who is directly accused of involvement in the use of chemical weapons and the dissemination of disinformation. Also included in the list are the 27th and 33rd research centers of the Ministry of Defense of Russia. The British government claims that these centers are involved in the development of chemical and biological weapons. -We will not allow such flagrant violations of the Convention on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and the international order to go unpunished. The UK is aggressively prosecuting those responsible for these horrific chemical attacks in Ukraine. Our support for Ukraine is unwavering and will continue for as long as it takes,- said Defense Minister John Geely.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/08/brytaniya-ogolosyla-sankcziyi-proty-rf-za-zastosuvannya-himichnoyi-zbroyi-proty-ukrayiny/	2024-10-08T11:57:58-07:00

Soldiers who voluntarily left their units for the first time began to return to the front instead of...	About the news about the fighters in the SZCH -chastini-zamist-uvyaznennya-pochali-povertatis-na-front-video->reported on October 8 State Bureau of Investigation. According to his data, at the end of September 2024, the Novomoskovsk City District Court of the Dnipropetrovsk Region decided not to imprison a serviceman who, in December 2023, left the location of a military unit stationed in the Dnipropetrovsk Region without appropriate orders. In the course of the pre-trial investigation of the criminal proceedings, the SBI investigators established the location of the military man and detained him. The man was informed of suspicion for voluntarily leaving a military unit under martial law (Part 5 of Article 407 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine). During the trial, the serviceman filed a motion to release him from responsibility due to his desire to continue his military service in one of the units, the commander of which gave his consent to enlistment. On the basis of Part 5 of Art. 401 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine, the court decided to release the military man from criminal liability. In addition, on October 2, 2024, the Bilyaevsky District Court of Odesa Region and the Naval District Court of Mykolaiv acquitted two servicemen of one of the mechanized brigades from criminal liability. One of them left the place of service in November 2022, the other in January 2024, during the deployment of their unit in the Vinnytsia region. On October 7, the Saratsky District Court of the Odesa Region passed a similar verdict against the deputy company commander of another military unit, who left his post in December 2024, also during deployment in Vinnytsia Region. The law enforcement officers detained the soldiers. Since the military left the place of service for the first time and voluntarily decided to continue serving, they, on the basis of part 5 of Art. 401 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine was released from custody. The leadership of one of the military brigades agreed to take these people into service, so they will continue to protect the country as part of this military unit. The DBR emphasizes that voluntarily leaving a military unit or a place of service, without valid reasons, committed in a combat environment, is punishable by imprisonment for up to 10 years. Therefore, those who first got into such a situation have a chance to return to the ranks, help their brothers defend the country and continue to live without remorse and conflicts with the Law. ArmyInform explained about SZH and desertion: how to return to the service and not sit behind bars.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/08/odyn-raz-ne-szch-vijskovi-yaki-vpershe-samovilno-zalyshyly-svoyi-chastyny-zamist-uvyaznennya-pochaly-povertatys-na-front/	2024-10-08T11:09:47-07:00
Becoming a military chaplain: how long must the mandate last before entering into a contract	This is reported by the correspondent of ArmiyaInform. The mandate for the right to carry out military chaplaincy activities is issued by the State Service of Ukraine for Ethnopolitics and Freedom of Conscience (DESS). The right to carry out military chaplaincy activities is terminated by revocation of the mandate of the DESS. Currently, one of the grounds for revocation of the mandate is the failure to conclude a contract for military service at the positions of the Military Chaplaincy Service within three months from the date of issuance of the mandate. However, there are not rare cases when persons who have received a mandate, for objective reasons, do not have time to conclude a contract for military service in the positions of the Military Chaplaincy Service. In view of this, the Interfaith Council on Military Chaplaincy Issues under the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine proposed to extend the term of the mandate before concluding a contract to six months. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that at the Interconfessional Council under the Ministry of Defense discussed the need to standardize and differentiate the terminological definitions of -military chaplain-, -chaplain- and -volunteer chaplain-, and that the council decided submit a proposal on charging additional payments to chaplains who are in the war zone.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/08/staty-vijskovym-kapelanom-skilky-maye-tryvaty-diya-mandata-do-ukladannya-kontraktu/	2024-10-08T10:52:04-07:00
Blatant sloppiness and a bit of luck: the Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reported the details o...	Captain 3 rank Dmytro Pletenchuk, spokesman for the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, reported the details of the destruction of -Moscow- on the air of the national telethon -Yedini Novyni-. - It was one of those operations that actually took place in a fairly short time. I can't say that we didn't prepare for it, so it's such a synergy - a little bit of luck, a lot of preparation and, accordingly, calculation. This is how virtually the entire vertical of our Naval Forces worked, he said. The military informed about the duration and details of the operation. — The operation itself lasted a little more than an hour. It should be noted here that in fact both target detection and destruction took place at the expense of the Coastal Missile Artillery Forces of the Naval Forces with the approval of the next vertical headquarters. Having received the appropriate permission, we inflicted the appropriate fire damage, the spokesman said. Separately, the officer emphasized that it was Ukrainian weapons that managed to destroy the enemy cruiser. — What is important is the case that all this was done due to the use of Ukrainian weapons systems. This became a landmark event, because this complex was developed precisely for this purpose. This was not the first successful use of it - even before that, one of the frigates, carriers of cruise missiles and Kalibr, had the opportunity to meet the Ukrainian Neptune in the Black Sea, after which it went for repairs, Dmytro Pletenchuk emphasized. He said that for the enemy, the attack of Ukrainian missiles was a surprise for which he was not prepared. — Among the interesting details, I can note that, in fact, to some extent, it became unexpected for the enemy. It can be noted that when I talk about character, it can be attributed to Russian sloppiness, arrogance. For which, as a result, they paid quite dearly, said the spokesman of the Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Dmytro Pletenchuk said that the cruiser -Moscow- had three echelons of air defense, but due to Russian carelessness and self-confidence, this did not help. — The cruiser actually had three echelons of air defense. One gets the impression that two of them were simply empty, i.e. there were no corresponding servicemen at the posts. Nevertheless, the fact is that the standard weapons on this ship are more than enough to repel air attacks. Let me remind you, there are 3 types of these long-range weapons, it is an analogue of C- 300, the medium one is the -wasp- and the close one - there are also suitable installations that can cut down targets moving quite quickly in the air with dense machine gun fire, they did not work, the military said. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that the Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reported what the Kremlin is afraid of .	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/08/krychushhe-nehlyujstvo-ta-dribka-udachi-u-vms-zsu-povidomyly-podrobyczi-znyshhennya-moskvy/	2024-10-08T10:44:13-07:00
The Defense Forces spoke about the attempts of enemy troops to capture Toretsk	The spokesman of the National Guard of Ukraine, Ruslan Muzychuk, told about this on the live broadcast of the -Suspilne Novosti- telethon. — In the Toretsk direction, the enemy is trying to carry out assault actions, trying to increase the -gray zone- around the city of Toretsk itself and settlements. In particular, these are attempts to take under fire control logistical routes and those areas through which the enemy is trying to advance, in particular near the settlement of New York and is trying to advance near the settlement of Nelipivka, he said. In addition, the occupiers are trying to take under fire control logistical routes near Toretsk itself, thus expanding the so-called -gray zone-. Attempts of enemy offensive actions are stopped by units of the Defense Forces, in particular, the 12th Azov Special Purpose Brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine. During the assaults, the occupiers try both to act in small infantry groups and to use armored vehicles. Those infantry groups that the enemy sends for assaults are destroyed. Now we can see that in some places the enemy is also trying to attract armored vehicles to support these assaults. In particular, last week, both in the Pokrovsky and Toretsk directions, the National Guard soldiers destroyed more than 10 units of various armored vehicles, which the enemy tried to use to strengthen their assaults. These are, in particular, tanks. The T-72 tank was destroyed. It is also an armored personnel carrier that the enemy uses both for fire support and for transporting personnel, said the spokesman of the National Guard of Ukraine. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that Russians have entered the eastern outskirts of Toretsk, there are battles in the city for every entrance.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/08/u-sylah-oborony-rozpovily-pro-sproby-vorozhyh-vijsk-ohopyty-toreczk/	2024-10-08T10:33:37-07:00

The President: Drones, EW and the missile program are priority areas for the Defense Forces	President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said about this in his evening address. According to him, today the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, General Oleksandr Syrsky, reported on the needs of the army, and the government officials on those opportunities that have already been implemented and that can be provided during this year. This applies both to our current needs and to the planned supply for the next year. The priority is the maximum development of the domestic sector, domestic production, and therefore all private initiatives, all forces of Ukrainian entrepreneurship, which is already working and can work even more for the sake of defense. Among the identified key areas are drones for our military, and this must be such a supply that not only constantly increases in volume, but also evolves, develops according to the needs of war. Production must quickly adapt to the needs of the front and to the new possibilities of using the weapons available to us. Another fundamental direction is EW, and here the private sector, Ukrainian entrepreneurs are already significantly helping Ukraine. -And it can be much more. We will also attract additional investments from partners, and this week, in particular, there will be work on this,- the President said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy emphasized that special emphasis is placed on the development of the state missile program. -And in all its elements, in all missile achievements of Ukraine, there should be much more combat implementation both on the front and on the territory of Russia. The result is needed faster. All relevant tasks are now being implemented,- he said.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/08/prezydent-drony-reb-i-raketna-programa-priorytetni-napryamky-dlya-syl-oborony/	2024-10-08T10:08:53-07:00

Anti-aircraft guns -from wheels-: when were the aerial bombs used by the Russians to hit the Kharkiv...	What this indicates and what the enemy is trying to achieve through the massive use of anti-aircraft missiles, told spokesman of OTU -Kharkiv- Colonel Vitaly Sarantsev. — The trend of using CABs has increased. If last weeks we tracked up to five airstrikes with the use of three to four, or sometimes seven anti-aircraft missiles, now this number has increased. The enemy began to carry out more airstrikes, began to use a larger number of anti-aircraft missiles. This shows that he has not abandoned the use of tactical aviation, he said. The officer noted that the intensity of the use of this aviation ammunition is such that the enemy is forced to use newly manufactured bombs. — The intensity of use of this type of weapons is such that its production actually works -from wheels-. We have information that he is using against us the ammunition that was produced at his factories just a few days ago. Literally in September they were made and already now they got to the front, already now he started using them, the spokesman said. The military explained what this indicates. - This indicates that he has exhausted his old stocks and his logistics are starting to work, his production is simply -from wheels- supplying all this ammunition to the front, - remarked Vitaly Sarantsev. He reminded what purpose and objective the enemy is using this munition. - One of the options is demonstration actions. The opponent is trying to show that he has it in his arsenal, that he can use it. The second task is to demoralize personnel who simply see this application. In this way, the enemy is trying to psychologically influence units of the Defense Forces, he explained. In addition, perhaps the most despicable task of using anti-aircraft guns is testing ammunition in combat conditions by bombing Ukrainian cities and at the cost of Ukrainian lives. -It's also an element of the test,- said the soldier. — The adversary does not stand still, he tests his ammunition, tries to monitor all the effects of their use, taking into account all factors - that is, weather conditions, times of the day, seasons, humidity, and so on. He has turned the entire front line into a testing ground where he tries to use his designs on us, both the military and the civilian population. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that the enemy hit KAB for a residential building in Kharkiv. There are deads.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/08/kaby-z-kolis-koly-vygotovleni-aviabomby-yakymy-rosiyany-byut-po-harkivshhyni/	2024-10-08T09:58:20-07:00

When we found out we hit it, it was euphoric! — the operator of the Patriot air defense system Vikto...	The conversation with Viktor took place on October 8 at the Yedyni Novyni telethon. According to Victor, his unit showed great results in the destruction of various targets even on the S-300. -These are Su-34, Su-35, K-52 and Mi-8 helicopters, as well as Kalibr cruise missiles. Later, Shahed UAVs were added to the list. Due to the fact that our unit was so effective, the command chose us for training on the latest technology of a foreign model. This was the Patriot air defense system. At that time, we did not have a choice between different foreign air defense systems, but I am very pleased that the choice fell on us and it was the Patriot system, because we have been dreaming about this system for a long time, - said Viktor. The training lasted 3 months, although the program itself was designed for 9 months in America. -But due to the fact that we had experience working with such systems, although not so perfect, plus combat experience and our motivation - all this gave its result. That's why we learned in three months. We could have done it faster if our partners had allowed us to do it, but we had to work it all out for at least 3 months,- Viktor recalled. According to him, the first downing of the Russian -dagger- took place on May 4, 2023. -I did not take part in this operation, but my colleagues who took part in this operation were shocked at how quickly it happened. They did not even understand how quickly it happened, because we did not expect it. Then the analysis began and we didn't know what we hit at the time. When we found out what we hit, it was euphoric. We knew we were already in history. Because no one has done this before us. Of course it was cool. The second operation was on May 16, when there was a massive combined attack, very difficult. We also did not expect it, but during the attack we shot down six -Kinzhal- aeroballistic missiles and ten -Iskander-M-. That's how we showed the results then,- Viktor said. He recalls that his team had no room for error. -We could not do otherwise, because we did not know where these rockets were flying. Because Kyiv is the decision-making center, it is various state institutions and critical infrastructure. Therefore, we had no right to make a mistake. Adrenaline probably lasted another day. It was all running through my head, whether we did everything right or whether it was all done correctly,- Viktor is still worried. He also warned against overly victorious moods. -The enemy is constantly learning, constantly improving his means of air attack, he is constantly analyzing, he takes all these mistakes into account in new attacks. He also analyzes our social networks a lot. That is, what our statesmen, the media, various public organizations that have some information say, they analyze it all and then take it into account in the next attacks. Therefore, information hygiene is very important in this matter,- Viktor noted. According to him, it is important not to stop the work of air defense and not to give the enemy any information about it. -The enemy now, in addition to relatively expensive Shaheds, the price of which, of course, is not the same as that of the Dagger, began to use UAVs of barn production. But I, as an operator, see only targets on the indicator. Targets with parameters. For me, it makes no difference whether it is -shahed- or not. By parameters, they can be the same. Although one can be combat, and the other is generally just plywood with a motor,- Viktor said. According to him, the change of Patriot operators lasts 4 hours. But if there is combat work, the shift can be 6 hours or 8 hours. It all depends on the situation at hand. Victor lovingly talks about his air defense system. -This is a very highly intelligent machine. This is the first. Secondly, this complex was able to achieve what we could not achieve with the S-300, which is the shooting down of ballistic missiles. It is the dream of every air defenseman to grow to such heights. My dream has come true and I am very happy about it!-, Viktor assured. As reported by ArmyInform, the USA provides additional battery Patriot and winged aerial bombs.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/08/koly-my-diznalysya-shho-zbyly-cze-bula-ejforiya-operator-zrk-patriot-viktor-pro-zbyttya-rosijskogo-kyndzhala/	2024-10-08T09:42:13-07:00
Holes, cracks and communication passages: in the Kharkiv region, the enemy is dug out from under the...	About what the underground shelters and communication routes of the occupiers are and how the Ukrainian military destroys them on the broadcast of the marathon -Social News- said the spokesman of Kharkiv OTU, Colonel Vitaliy Sarantsev. — This situation is really observed in those areas where the enemy is not conducting active assault actions, but has gone on the defensive. There, of course, he tries to dig in as much as possible - he digs holes, digs communication passages, makes closed gaps, and he does this in our direction as well, he said. However, the Defense Forces are actively and effectively countering the -worm tactics- of the Russian occupiers, destroying several enemy shelters at a time. -We report the destruction of shelters every day, that is, we destroy several dozen enemy dugouts, trenches, blocked gaps, sometimes together with the enemy, thanks to our artillery or thanks to FPV drones,- the spokesman assured. He explained that in different parts of the Kharkiv direction, the occupiers resort to the -mole method- in different ways and for different purposes - for shelter or for movement. — If we talk about advancement, then such a story takes place in Vovchansk, where the enemy finds houses located not far from each other. They simply break through the lines of communication between them for further safe and hidden movement. That is, from basement to basement, they can dig a tunnel and move in small groups to small sections of the terrain, the military explained. However, such actions of the enemy are possible only within the limits of dense urban development. It is almost impossible to resort to them in the territories of villages, moreover, such a method is completely unsuitable for the open space between forest plantations. - As for other destinations, where the territory is more open, it simply digs holes to hide from FPV drones. At the same time, in defensive actions, he can inflict damage on us from there, the spokesman said. At the same time, of course, the enemy arranges communication routes between such shelters, which can also be either completely underground or significantly buried. — He excavates side entrances, makes trenches, connections between these norms. That is, he works quite actively in this direction and is quite actively digging in, the spokesman said. However, the enemy can set up underground shelters and communications only if he is not detected by the Ukrainian military. - Of course, in those moments when he manages to do this, when he remains unnoticed by our intelligence tools. If it is placed, then in most cases the enemy is doomed, Vitaliy Sarantsev emphasized. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that the occupiers in the north of Kharkiv Oblast take into account the features of the relief and lay underground routes.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/08/nory-shhilyny-ta-hody-spoluchennya-na-harkivshhyni-voroga-vykolupuyut-z-pid-zemli/	2024-10-08T09:26:22-07:00

For the purpose of illegal enrichment, the director of the fund together with his wife not only issued certificates to evaders, but also facilitated their departure outside Ukraine. In addition to his wife, the director of the fund was also assisted in his criminal activities by a volunteer of the indicated charitable organization and another man from Sumy, who looked for clients and acted as mediators. The suspects valued $8,000 for assistance in helping them to leave Ukraine without hindrance, and the volunteer certificate cost the evaders 500 euros.

Veteran's certificate in action instead of a paper one: the Council supported changes to the legisla...	Today the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine adopted relevant changes to the current legislation. From now on, the status of the main document of a veteran is given to an electronic certificate instead of a paper one. Draft Law No. 11376 was developed by the Ministry of Veterans Affairs together with the specialized parliamentary committee. Today, the paper certificate itself has the status of the main document. And only after receiving it, at the request of the veteran, an electronic ID card can be created - the veteran's e-ID card in Action. -The transition to the e-Certificate as the main document will help speed up the provision of services, reduce the time for checking the status, which will improve the quality of service to veterans and their families. And you can get a paper certificate if you wish. Thank you to the parliament for the support!-, noted the Minister of Veterans Affairs of Ukraine Nataliya Kalmykova. Veteran's e-certificates will allow you to instantly check their authenticity in real time, which in turn eliminates the possibility of using fake or outdated documents. The transition to electronic IDs facilitates efficient documentation management for organizations and institutions and reduces costs for printing and storing paper documents. It will also contribute to the improvement of administrative procedures, faster and more efficient access to social guarantees. It is also important that in case of loss of a veteran's paper ID, a person will be able to use an electronic ID without any problems. It is worth noting that the Ministry of Veterans, together with the Ministry of Digital Affairs, implemented a project to introduce a veteran's e-Certificate in the Diya mobile application. To date, more than 300,000 veteran e-Certificates have already been generated in Diya.

We are building muscles: in the north of Kharkiv Oblast, the Defense Forces are strengthening their ...	Instead, the Defense Forces not only effectively repel enemy attacks, but also strengthen individual units and take other measures to disrupt the intentions and plans of the Russian occupiers. Colonel Vitaly Sarantsev, the spokesman of Kharkiv OTU, told about this on the broadcast of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon. — The situation remains consistently difficult. The enemy continues to put pressure on the Defense Forces of Ukraine. It is not giving up its aggressive intentions and aims to move forward, he said. However, units of the Defense Forces of Ukraine give a decent rebuff to the enemy, disrupting his intentions and plans. — We are standing firmly in our positions, we are giving the enemy a decent rebuff, and the loss of our positions is currently not allowed. There were 6 combat encounters yesterday. The enemy tried to advance in Vovchansk and the nearby village of Staritsa, the spokesman said. On the other hand, in other areas of the invasion in the north of the Kharkiv region, the enemy has given up offensive actions for the time being. — At other locations, he regroups, takes measures to engineer positions, conducts aerial reconnaissance, remote mining of possible routes of movement of the Defense Forces, as he considers it. It is also building up the communication system, building up the management system, the military man said. The measures taken show that the enemy is preparing to resume offensive actions. -We understand that the enemy is preparing for active assault actions and sooner or later, when conditions are favorable for him, he may switch to attacking our positions,- Vitaliy Sarantsev explained. Instead, the Defense Force actively and effectively engages the enemy, and also reinforces individual units and improves positions by counterattacking under favorable conditions. — We are also preparing for any development, we are preparing a worthy meeting for the enemy. We are also strengthening our units, our artillery and mortar calculations. We are also taking certain actions so that the adversary, who intends to move forward, understands that it is not necessary to do this, but to return to oneself in Russia and develop one's own country, said the spokesman of Kharkiv OTU. Earlier, ArmyInform reported whether the occupiers in the north had increased Kharkiv Oblast.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/08/naroshhuyemo-myazy-na-pivnochi-harkivshhyny-syly-oborony-posylyuyut-pozycziyi/	2024-10-08T07:46:53-07:00
The enemy entered the trench and died, the Russians were filled with explosives at the gas station: ...	One of the Ukrainian fighters came out of the dugout and engaged the occupier in hand-to-hand combat, grabbed his weapon and eliminated him at close range. The battle itself took place east of the village of Robotyne in Zaporozhye. Another melee video shows two Russians trying to hide under a small fence.

Not all chaplains are military: the need to standardize definitions was discussed at the Interdenomi...	This is reported by the correspondent of ArmiyaInform. Pastoral mentoring of servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine is carried out by priests of various denominations, organizational subordination and legal status. Sometimes they are all collectively called military chaplains or they themselves position themselves as military chaplains. Whether this is correct was discussed during a meeting of the Interdenominational Council on Military Chaplaincy at the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. The issue was raised by military chaplains, of whom there are already more than 300 in the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Military chaplaincy in its current format has been in existence for the third year. During this time, a professional class of clerics who provide pastoral guidance while serving in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine managed to crystallize. A military chaplain is primarily a contract military service member. Accordingly, only those chaplains serving in the Armed Forces of Ukraine should be called military chaplains. Accordingly, chaplains who meet the spiritual and religious needs of military personnel, without being in military service themselves, may be called chaplains or chaplains-volunteers, if they also support the military materially. At the meeting of the Interdenominational Council, this issue was discussed in detail and it was proposed to regulate it accordingly in such a way as to differentiate between military chaplains and civilian chaplains. In addition, there was a proposal that civil chaplains should belong to a certain Church and report this, and the Church, accordingly, should be responsible for the activities of a chaplain belonging to it. Representatives of the Interdenominational Council also drew attention to the problem of self-employed chaplaincy, when chaplaincy services are performed under the guise of public organizations by persons who do not belong to any Church. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that The interfaith council on issues of military chaplaincy under the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine at its meeting on October 8 decided to submit a proposal to charge additional payments to chaplains who are in the war zone.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/08/ne-vsi-kapelany-vijskovi-potrebu-unormuvannya-vyznachen-obgovoryly-na-mizhkonfesijnij-radi-pry-minoborony/	2024-10-08T07:34:11-07:00

UAH 30,000 for combat chaplains: the Inter-confessional Council submitted proposals to the Ministry ...	This was reported by the correspondent of ArmiyaInform. The task -Satisfying the spiritual and religious needs of the personnel of the Armed Forces of Ukraine- is currently not included in the list of combat (special) tasks, for the performance of which an additional monthly additional reward in the amount of 30 thousand hryvnias is paid in the case of a serviceman's stay in active groups of troops (forces) state defense forces. The meeting participants noted that this oversight has a negative impact on the motivation of military chaplains during pastoral mentoring and performance of official duties.

The interfaith council on issues of military chaplaincy decided to address the Minister of Defense of Ukraine and the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine with a proposal to normalize this issue. Appropriate wording should be provided in the list of combat (special) tasks. This will restore the right to a fair exercise by military chaplains of the law regarding their social protection as military personnel.

Rotation of enemy forces: did the occupiers increase in the north of Kharkiv region	Colonel Vitaly Sarantsev, the spokesman of the OTU -Kharkiv-, told about this on the broadcast of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon. — They rotate constantly. This is an internal rotation — the enemy is trying to change the units that perform combat tasks in forward positions, he said. The military emphasized that this is an internal rotation aimed at restoring enemy soldiers from those units that are in advanced positions. — This is exactly internal rotation. Roughly speaking, these are the brigades that entered almost from the very beginning, and that were preparing during these several months. This is an internal rotation, which aims for the personnel to complete the combat task, to rest, regroup in different assault groups and in a few days again go to the front positions, for combat shifts, - the military explained. At the same time, the rotation of the forces of the Russian occupiers, which is taking place in the Kharkiv direction, takes place without any significant increase in enemy forces and means. -We are currently not observing a global accumulation of forces and means on the territory of the Russian Federation,- the spokesman said. However, the enemy still uses certain new forces. These are mostly the few engineering units or units that use unmanned aerial vehicles. — There are small reinforcements of engineering units that will carry out the task of demining or demining territories. There is a strengthening of units that deal with unmanned aerial vehicles, but, I emphasize once again, there is currently no global accumulation of forces in this direction, - Vitaly Sarantsev concluded.

He did not reach Moscow - the SBU detained one of the Kremlin's ideologues of the war against Ukrain...	The Security Service of Ukraine reported this on October 8. The figure is an assistant to Putin's ex-advisor Serhii Glazhyev, one of the main -moderators- of the seizure of Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk regions and the developer of the -Information War Strategy-, which justified Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. During 2016-2024, Chistylin prepared a number of -analytical materials- for the Kremlin, in which he supported the armed aggression of the Russian Federation and the -integration- of the temporarily occupied regions of Ukraine into Russia. Providing assistance to the Russian special services, the attacker became the author of numerous publications aimed at carrying out information sabotage against our state. Chistilin also took an active part in promoting the interests of the Kremlin outside of Russia. Among other things, he organized interference in election processes in the countries of Eastern and Central Europe in favor of Moscow. Acting allegedly on behalf of the Ukrainian public, the person involved took part in holding so-called -round tables- in European countries. During such events, he spread Kremlin narratives, hoping to reduce support for Ukraine from Western partners. After Chistilin's participation in one of these -forums-, he was detained in interaction with the law enforcement officers of the Republic of Moldova when he tried to return to Moscow through the territories of third countries. Thanks to comprehensive measures, the person involved, who left Ukraine even before the start of the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation, is now in custody and has received suspicion under two articles of the Criminal Code of Ukraine: Part 2 Art. 111 (treason committed under martial law); Part 3 Art. 436-2 (justification, recognition as legitimate, denial of armed aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, glorification of its participants). Currently, the facts of his assistance to the military intelligence of the Russian Federation are being documented, in particular, in the creation of mechanisms for circumventing the sanctions introduced against Russia. The figure faces life imprisonment with confiscation of property.

The Russian army launched a ballistic missile attack on a civilian ship in the ports of Odesa: there...	In two days, Russia attacked a second civilian ship that was in the ports of Odesa. Palau-flagged ship -OPTIMA- was damaged by a ballistic missile. This was reported by the Deputy Prime Minister for the Reconstruction of Ukraine - the Minister of Community Development and territory of Ukraine Oleksiy Kuleba. One person is said to have died. Five more foreign citizens, crew members, were injured. They are currently receiving medical attention. Only today the ship came in for loading. However, within a few hours, the aggressor country became the target. In two days, the enemy damaged two ships that were supposed to take cargo from Ukraine. This is a targeted practice of intimidation and obstruction of the work of the Ukrainian Maritime Corridor. -In this way, the aggressor is again trying to destroy shipping in the Black Sea and undermine Ukrainian efforts to guarantee food security. The consequence of this can only be an increase in instability in sensitive regions of the world that depend on food imports, and unrest in international relations,- noted Oleksiy Kuleba. The minister emphasized that it is important that the port infrastructure is protected from terror and that free and safe navigation is guaranteed. -We must continue to strengthen our counter-intelligence defense and, with the force of arms and the force of diplomacy, bring the enemy to justice,- Oleksiy Kuleba summarized. As ArmiyaInform reported, Russian troops struck the Izmail district with the help of drones. The main target of the attack was the port and border infrastructure. As a result of the impact, two men, truck drivers, were injured.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/08/armiya-rf-atakuvala-balistykoyu-czyvilne-sudno-v-portah-odeshhyny-ye-zagybli-ta-poraneni/	2024-10-07T21:12:53-07:00
- It is the most difficult thing to restore a person-. ArmiyaInform interview about the new system o...	—Ms. Valentina, a few hours ago you had a meeting with relatives of soldiers who returned from captivity. What challenges did you see for yourself after communicating with them? - I can't talk about it in detail. But now the first issue is the development of a complex service as soon as possible: medical care, rehabilitation and reintegration measures in one of the regions of central Ukraine. We need to train specialists who will work with those returned from captivity. This is a very sensitive topic and a very sensitive story. Practice shows that in working with our boys and girls, the attitude of the staff towards them and the professionalism of the work are of great importance. First of all, this concerns the emotional and psychological component. Therefore, it is very important: to create a quality service for military personnel. - Tell me about yourself and your previous professional experience. - I have a medical education, worked as a doctor. Then she worked for more than five years in the Office of the Commissioner for Human Rights of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine. Therefore, the concept of -human rights- is not an empty word for me, and these very words have become a red line and a kind of vital pillar for me throughout my life. Then I went to reform the health care system, when these processes were just starting - from 2018. We launched and recorded fundamental changes in the approaches to the financing of the health care system, and patients felt their rights. She also worked in the non-governmental sector - in particular, there were international projects, including the development of rehabilitation in the field of health care. Then came the time when I was called to the reform team in the defense sector. And this is much more difficult and responsible work than all my previous experiences. Because I am responsible for the changes, and I have to calculate the risks that these changes may affect. For me, changes are made, first of all, for the person. If we talk about the system of the Ministry of Defense, then this is a military serviceman. It is for their sake that we are making these changes. If a serviceman is treated in a hospital, he is a patient. If he needs psychological help, then he is essentially a serviceman-client. Not so long ago, I joined the military service. My current service is to preserve the life and mental health of the serviceman, to preserve the human capital in the troops as much as possible. A person is the most difficult thing to restore. We can repair a drone or buy a new one, and a person can be rehabilitated and restored, including psychological restoration, which is much more difficult. Banal: it takes 18 years for a person to become competent. Therefore, we do not have the right to spend human capital thoughtlessly. On the contrary, it is necessary to do everything to solve mental health problems at the initial stage, when minimal efforts are sometimes enough for this, when it is necessary to provide the serviceman with psychological training for self and mutual help. For this, we need to build not only the psychological system as best as possible, but also all the systems in the complex: medical, psychological, social. — Psychological support in the Armed Forces. What coordinate system are we in now when talking about this topic? - We are currently conducting an audit to understand what kind of system this is, who is in it, who are these specialists, what is their education. We understand what knowledge and skills a psychologist must have to provide psychological assistance to military personnel, including after participating in combat operations. At the moment, I am not sure that a psychologist with a higher education is a quality psychologist. And this is a very complex component, in which there are many components - education, experience, readiness to perform one's duties well, motivation. So now our frame of reference is to determine where we are in general, what we need, what we need for educational institutions. We need to monitor the quality of education and training of psychologists. After all, it is not so much about the fact that such a specialist will not be able to help. Insufficient expertise in psychological help can do a lot of harm. - So we are at the foot of the mountain? - Roughly speaking. — In 10 years of war, what has not yet been implemented, but should have been implemented yesterday, in your opinion? What is desperately needed, given the challenges of a large-scale war? - These changes should have started to be implemented even when Ukraine became an independent state. For me, as a representative of the defense system, it is important that soldiers who have survived a traumatic event recover as quickly as possible - but recover well, and be able to return to the army and perform combat tasks. Because we now receive a lot of servicemen who are not ready for combat operations, but who, nevertheless, perform combat tasks. And because of this approach, irreversible psychological processes can occur for people. We have several stages for change. It is necessary to start from the very beginning. For example, when a person enters the military service, he passes a psychological test in the TCC and SP, which must be adapted to new realities. At most, its results should be used further in a non-formal way. Already at this stage, we need to understand what kind of person this is, where he can best prove himself, in which branches of the military, etc. —Within the boundaries of the BZVP, it is planned to introduce psychological training as well, according to you. Please tell us in more detail what it is about, how much time it takes? — There is such a training, you just need to control the quality of psychological training. First of all, the standard should be somewhat updated, slightly expanded, and the tools for preparation should be improved. Today we had a meeting with the Deputy Minister and everyone agreed that the psychological component during the BZVP is important, because it is preparation for combat, for service in conditions of constant stress. Our servicemen, who leave the BZVP, must have the strength, inspiration and ability to perform combat tasks. Motivation and willingness to face a reality that goes beyond the normal experience of a civilian is very important. Therefore, we need to get involved in basic military training, review the psychological component and control it. - And who will conduct such psychological training in educational centers? - Trained instructors. First of all, we have to conduct training for instructors. They also need to be selected, trained, and prepared&#8230; And foreign partners who have the appropriate methods and experience are ready to help us with this. We also have to monitor the psychological state of the instructors themselves. After all, these people also burn out, lose motivation, etc. —Tell us more about the pilot project for comprehensive recovery of military personnel that you announced the other day. Why is it right and useful - and what has happened so far? Now we are developing a mechanism so that the recovery service fully meets the needs of the serviceman who receives it and the implementation is controlled by the customer - the Ministry of Defense. It is primarily about standard, quality and availability. This is a program under which servicemen who participated in hostilities and need recovery are sent for 14 days to institutions outside the Ministry of Defense system, where specialists work with them, including necessarily military psychologists. If desired, it can be with or without families - this is already a more ethical and personal issue. We have neither the time nor the opportunity to build appropriate rehabilitation zones or to modernize existing sanatoriums. Therefore, we followed a system that has proven its effectiveness in the civilian health sector. We will purchase such a service from capable facilities that can meet the requirements for providing a psychological recovery service. Yes, we will test them, check them, standardize them. We will recruit and train civilian psychologists who will work alongside military professionals. An important point is that such a service will be provided at a single, calculated price. There are clear tariffs in the health care system, which are approved by the Cabinet of Ministers, there can be no other tariffs, and it is forbidden to demand any additional money from a military serviceman who is on recovery. Such an approach will make any corruption impossible. And in general, in an ideal world, I see it with an additional recreation area, where there are pools, there are elements of rehabilitation, where specialists with enormous experience work. We will try to create such an environment as much as possible. But for now, we have the task of getting the system up and running and providing psychological recovery first, but for this package to be effective, to help the Defenders and the Defenders get back on track. —It is known that this package of services for the psychological rehabilitation of military personnel should be operational in the fall. Can everyone get such services? Or just the wounded? — All who need psychological recovery. First of all, as I have already said, these are military personnel who suffered psychological injuries in hostilities. It does not depend on the injury. Those who are injured and are in hospitals should receive medical rehabilitation. A psychologist or clinical psychologist works in medical rehabilitation. This is also an important component, because all wounded (not only in rehabilitation) need to be accompanied by a psychologist. Because mental health and physical health are essentially inseparable. - Will such services from the military be paid for? - Free for military personnel. This will be done at the expense of the Ministry of Defense. - And who will determine the military's need for such recovery? - Psychologists after the unit leaves active hostilities. When the brigade goes out for recovery, a combat stress control team works with the soldiers. They, too, should direct this recovery. - When, according to your forecasts, will the first military serviceman be able to use such a package of services? The first few groups will work in several places at the community's own expense. And this, I think, will be sometime in October. It is important for us now to adjust the program, work out the -bottlenecks- and correct them, develop a base of specialists. — I will start with the fact that this year our team launched for the first time the project of the Ministry of Defense on the reintegration and provision of medical assistance to soldiers who returned from captivity at their own facilities. And now we are working on its expansion, building rehabilitation for this category of people. One of the main problems we have faced is the limited resource of specialists. We understand that many doctors have gone abroad. Do we have the ability to create several centers and recruit specialists there? I'm not sure right now. Currently, we are building one large center where we will gather specialists, train them and create a powerful base. It is not as simple as it seems - there are not so many specialists in rehabilitation and in the civilian world. We are currently working on the expansion of such a center in one of the regions in central Ukraine. We expect that such a center will be able to receive hundreds of people at once in the near future. At the same time, all of them will be provided with professional comprehensive assistance according to a single standard that will take into account all the nuances. Our Defenders and Defenders go through real hell in captivity. And there are many, many nuances. - The office you lead was created only in May. What is the biggest challenge you have faced in this position? Did you manage to overcome it? — Today we lack specialists who are ready to work and who understand state processes. We need not only psychologists, but also digital scientists, lawyers, managers of government processes, business analysts. We are working on it. - What would be a victory in the Russian-Ukrainian war for you? - I would very much like for us to win so that the enemy no longer gets up from his knees&#8230;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/08/lyudynu-vidnovyty-najskladnishe-intervyu-armiyainform-pro-novu-systemu-psyhologichnogo-vidnovlennya-vijskovyh/	2024-10-07T21:10:07-07:00
The most insulting thing is when you hear: -Why are you here and not there?- About the war since 201...	How many meters were there to enemy positions in Novomykhailivka? But which legendary military man was the commander in Ivan during the anti-terrorist operation? A military man told our correspondents about this: -Strokovu served in Kharkiv, in the Air Defense Forces. It was in 1993-1995. In 2014, an anti-terrorist operation began. The summons came. He ended up in the ZSU again. He served in the 81st Airborne Brigade. They performed tasks in Druzhkovka, Kramatorsk, Sloviansk, went to Mariupol. By the way, our commander at that time was already Lieutenant General Yevhen Moysiuk. In 2022, after the start of a large-scale invasion on February 26, he went to the TCC. The Kyiv 23rd separate battalion was formed there. By the way, volunteer Mykhailo Kholmatov helped our battalion a lot with supplies. We immediately came to the defense of Kyiv. And only later, when the Kyiv region was liberated, we were sent to Donetsk region in Novomykhailivka. We performed tasks there for about two months. I was wounded there. Almost all types of weapons were used by the enemy there. In most cases, these were -Tornadoes-, and phosphorus was often used by the enemy. Their aviation also worked, -Hradi-, tanks. The worst was when the tank was working. We counted his every shot. We knew that if he fired 21 shots, then he left one for retreat. Our positions were at a distance of 150 meters from the enemy in some places. The landing where we stood, the enemy in front of was completely destroyed by our rotation, there was nothing left of it. ...One of the awards from the Ministry of Defense was for the performance of combat missions in Novomykhailivka. After I recovered, I returned and I was put in the battalion as a driver for evacuating people from positions. We -from scratch- picked up and delivered to Shakhtarsk and Kurakhove. When it was announced on the walkie-talkie that there was a -300th- on the front, you got into the car without thinking. You just go to the point where the guys are standing. It is about 800 meters to the position itself. We tried to arrive as quickly as possible and evacuate the wounded to the right place. Drones were not bothering us much back then in 2022. Not what it is now. And I also brought people to the positions in my transport. Later, at that time, I was sent to serve at the capital's TCC as a person of limited fitness. Where I am serving now. ... When I went to war in 2014 and in 2022, my wife was against it. And I ask her: who will protect you? The most difficult thing in my current job at the TCC is when people come and say -why are you here and not there.- This is the hardest... I have a wife, two children, an eight-year-old grandson. I am a happy grandfather... But the most important thing is victory. And she will be behind us-. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/08/najobrazlyvishe-koly-chuyesh-chogo-ty-tut-a-ne-tam-pro-vijnu-z-2014-go-poranennya-ta-sluzhbu-u-tczk-istoriya-voyina-ivana/	2024-10-07T20:57:00-07:00
Russia is increasing the costs of the war: the expert named the consequences for Ukraine	Does this decision indicate that the Kremlin is betting on a strategy of exhausting and protracted war against our state? What are the consequences for Ukraine? ArmyInform asked military expert Petr Chernyk about this: -Up to $145 billion is quite a lot. 6.5% of their gross domestic product. Let me remind you that there was more only at the end of the 80s of the twentieth century, when the USSR calculated its military budget in the range of 10 to 15% of GDP. By the way, it was such a large military budget that became one of the prerequisites for the collapse of the Soviet Union. Why do the Russians resort to this? Yes, indeed, this is not very good news for us. This means that the enemy is showing readiness to continue a grueling full-scale war against Ukraine in the coming year. This is the third largest military budget of any country in the world. The largest budget in the USA is more than 800 billion dollars, the second in China is more than 200 billion dollars. In this context, a completely logical question arises: will Ukraine be able to withstand Russian aggression in 2025? It will last, I'm optimistic. The total resource for national security and defense in 2025 is 2 trillion 223 billion UAH. That's up to about $50 billion. This is a lot for Ukraine. Plus international aid. If you add up all the packages of projected financial aid from the European Union, the G7 countries and NATO, and add Ukraine's defense budget, the total is more than $130 billion. So, we collectively reach relative parity with the Russian Federation. In the competition for the quantity and quality of weapons and military equipment, Ukraine is clearly ahead of the Russian Federation in terms of the quality of weapons. We receive effective weapons from partner countries: small arms, armored vehicles, such as the M2 Bradley BMP, air defense systems, unmanned systems, etc. An important point. The increase in spending on the military budget of the Russian Federation exceeds the combined spending on education, health care, social policy and the national economy. This will lead to pressure on the Russian population in -social- issues. the Kremlin has nothing to pay for the war, so it will have to be done by -ordinary Russians-. I do not believe in a rebellion of the Russians from below. But it is obvious that such -approaches- to budget formation will complicate everything in Russia. Of course, discontent will grow. At some point, one of the -towers of the Kremlin- may take advantage of this dissatisfaction and replace Putin. The rivalry between us will continue until the Russian Federation finally disintegrates. And this large militarized budget is a sign that the Rashists are not going to give up on the destruction of our country.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/08/rosiya-zbilshuye-vytraty-na-vijnu-ekspert-nazvav-naslidky-dlya-ukrayiny/	2024-10-07T20:50:49-07:00
Excrement, blood, barbed wire and… manicures. Army Inform photo report on psychological sur in the o...	The faces of people in uniform are concentrated, helmets and weapons are wrapped in plastic wrap, some have wrapped their shoes in plastic wrap. It can be seen that someone is nervous, and someone is afraid. But no one had any questions. To the right is an obstacle course. Unlike the usual army ones that appeared at the beginning of the last century, this one is psychological. While the instructors are igniting flat tires, checking the presence of empty cartridges and imitation grenades, conducting briefings, we talk to Lieutenant Serhiy Kashuba, an officer of the special psychological training group of the Department of Training of Specialists of the Russian Armed Forces: - This is a challenge for the personnel. Each cadet must overcome his fears, be at the limit of his physical and psychological capabilities, and in fact, the strip itself is not just a set of physical exercises. This is a slice of knowledge from tactical and fire training, as well as technical expertise. In addition, we see how an informal leader is formed in the collective, who can then become the commander of the department. The strip is a universal event that allows you to reveal the inner potential of military personnel and demonstrate what they are worth. Consists of 10 plus one obstacle. The first group of cadets begins to move through the blocked smoky gap. They light a smoke bomb, the caustic smoke starts to irritate the throat and gets into the eyes. Unexpectedly, an automatic burst sounds, cartridges fly right at the cadets' heads, but the chain confidently overcomes the first obstacle. The next stage is crawling under barbed wire, which also has its own characteristics - scattered organic waste from livestock, etc. I don't know what is written there to enhance the effect, but I understand that it is very difficult for the cadets. The instructors add to the horrors - real blood, though not human, pours on people's heads. But still, the impression is shocking. The smoke from the tires thickens, a light breeze blows it aside, and through the smoke the next obstacle is visible - the wall. She is slightly above average height, so they overcome her with the help of each other. And here, too, there are difficulties. The fact is that a paratrooper usually carries up to 40 kg of load on him - body armor, RPS, weapons, BC, water, etc. Therefore, jumping from a wall is primarily a blow to the spine. A few such jumps of an untrained person - and a protrusion is guaranteed. Therefore, it is very important not to jump from the wall, but to descend carefully on your hands. The instructors warned about this more than once, but one of the cadets shows audacity and jumps. Unable to resist, he falls to his knees and gets up only with the help of his colleague. I hear the instructor who was standing next to me say: -I warned you!- The next location is the -fallen forest-. Basically, this is a set of bars - both horizontal and at an angle. It is also overcome as a team. This obstacle does not cause difficulties and the department moves on, through tires hung on racks, which burn brightly with black smoke. The faces of the cadets are already steaming, the film is being unwound, but no one is paying attention to it. Cries of -I'm hiding!- are heard. This means that it is possible to move on, that the sectors are identified and taken under observation. The next stage is a destroyed bridgehead, and immediately after it is a destroyed column of enemy vehicles. She is real - burnt and battered, dragged here from the front. Among the equipment is a black and red tank with open hatches, burnt dozens of times. One of the exercises is tank neutralization. The instructor loudly reminds what to do, and grenades fly into the hatch, grenade explosions are loud from time to time, finally broken and the column of fire is behind. And ahead is a concrete pipe. And here the nerves of one of the cadets can't stand it. She is picked up and taken out of the lane. The instructor shrugs his shoulders, saying that it happens, we're all human. Other cadets stubbornly climb through the pipe. Someone is holding a machine gun incorrectly, instructors are correcting mistakes, and the group is already gathering in front of a concrete trench and quickly, covering each other, passes through it, through smoke and gunfire. The final location is house cleaning. The group gathers around him. The clothes are black, the face is covered in dirt, but the eyes are burning. I notice a manicure on the nails of one of the cadets and feel that there is something surreal about it, but at the same time beautiful and natural. Now are the times&#8230; To clean the house, you need to open the door and throw a grenade inside, jump into the house, clean it, go through it, jump out the other side and finally exhale. Passed&#8230; I approach Lieutenant Kashuba and ask what turned out to be the most difficult: - Overcoming your fears, probably, and yourself. No obstacle is insurmountable. But overcoming your aversion to blood, to excrement, to everything else is difficult. It is difficult not to feel sorry for yourself, sometimes to behave courageously and to show the qualities of a warrior. This is difficult. And when a person gets used to all this, as we say - -once a warrior, then a warrior forever-&#8230; Photo of the author and Natalia Kravchuk	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/08/ekskrementy-krov-kolyuchyj-drit-ta-manikyur-fotoreportazh-armiyainform-pro-psyhologichnyj-syur-na-smuzi-pereshkod/	2024-10-07T20:42:33-07:00
Willy Wonka was mobilized to the Armed Forces: the Russian military again -finds mined chocolates-	In particular, over the past few days, they have been talking about explosives in the guise of fast food and showing a photo of a chocolate bar with an explosive device that tears off the fingers of anyone who tries to open it. Such chocolates are -scattered- in the Zaporozhye region. Apparently, Willy Wonka was mobilized into the Armed Forces. At least such thoughts creep in when you imagine hungry Russian occupiers gathering chocolate in the fields. Actually, the fake about mined chocolates is not new. On enemy telegram channels, similar information -walked- back in January of this year. The goal of such fakes is obvious: against the background of mass looting of military stores by Russian soldiers, in particular, in Kurshchyna and the occupied Ukrainian territories, to force them to restrain themselves at least a little. And it is also traditional to accuse the Armed Forces of inhumanity. It is interesting that even in Soviet times, lies about blades in foreign chewing gum, mined children's toys, lighters, and packs of cigarettes were popular. As we can see, nothing has changed in propaganda methods over many decades, as well as in the marauding habits of the Russian army.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/08/villi-vonku-mobilizuvaly-do-zsu-rosijski-vijskovi-znovu-znahodyat-zaminovani-shokoladky/	2024-10-07T20:30:07-07:00

The basis for the new -special purpose- version of the armored vehicle is a modified Pandur Evolution platform with a 6×6 wheel formula. One of its key features is a remote-controlled combat module equipped with a 30 mm automatic cannon that provides powerful fire cover. To increase protection against modern threats such as drones, the armored vehicle has a special protective net . Several containers are also installed on board for transporting and launching the Switchblade 300 Block 20 barrage ammunition, which our editors told in one of her materials. These UAVs provide additional capabilities for reconnaissance and strike operations. The new version of the Pandur Evolution, aimed at equipping special units, has three key modifications that distinguish it from the standard version. First, the chassis of the car was shortened in the rear part, which made it possible to reduce the total weight of the car to 15 tons (without additional equipment). This lightening of the structure improves the mobility of the machine and facilitates its transportation. Secondly, a ballistic driver's cab was installed, which increases the level of protection when driving in active combat conditions. The third modification concerns the engine cooling system, which has also undergone modernization, which increases the reliability of the machine in difficult operating conditions. The total weight of the machine is 19.5 tons, including the maximum payload of 3 tons. The Pandur Evolution is equipped with a Cummins ISLe 450 diesel engine with a capacity of 335 kW, which, in combination with a 6-speed ZF automatic transmission, provides high performance and maneuverability. An armored engine cooling system protects the driver, allowing the surface to be used for material transportation or equipment. Standard armor of the Pandur family provides the crew with protection against shrapnel, small arms rounds and mines. Although details on the armor protection of the new variant have not been released, it is believed to be reinforced with additional armor from Rheinmetall Protection Systems which complies with STANAG 4569 standards (probably level 3 or higher) providing enhanced protection in combat conditions. Design features and additional equipment indicate that the new version of the Pandur Evolution is ideal for special operations. A ballistic driver's cabin and a protected engine cooling system allow the machine to operate effectively in extreme conditions, ensuring the protection of the crew and resistance to external threats. These characteristics make the Pandur Evolution for special forces an important element in the arsenal of special operations forces. The dimensions of the base machine (2.6 m wide and 2.2 m high) allow it to be transported by a C-130 aircraft. The presented Pandur modification is only a basic platform for future AGMS vehicles, which provides for the possibility of further adaptation and modification of the armored vehicle for specific tasks and missions. In the final versions, additional equipment and reinforced armor are expected, which will make it even more versatile and effective in combat conditions.

A one and a half ton thermobaric aerial bomb was defused in the Pokrovsky district of Donetsk region	This was informed by the department. Rescuers were contacted by local residents who discovered an explosive object. Specialists of the State Emergency Service identified the dangerous find as an ODAB-1500 volume-detonating aerial bomb. Together with the employees of the National Police and local authorities, people's access to the danger zone was restricted. After a thorough survey of the area, pyrotechnicians neutralized the bomb. The State Emergency Service reminded that if a suspicious find is discovered, it should not be touched and it should be moved to a safe distance of at least 100 m, and then call 101. ODAB-1500 is a thermobaric projectile from the times of the USSR. 10 meters from the target, it releases a liquid in the form of an aerosol and ignites it. This is called a volumetric explosion. This airbomb is quite a rare item compared to others. It belongs to the old generation of two-stroke thermobaric ammunition. The enemy has already used her in Donetsk region. Earlier there were reports that the enemy was installing a UMPK kit on these aerial bombs, which turned it into a glider. UMPK allows the use of aerial bombs at significant distances - 50-70 km. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/07/u-pokrovskomu-rajoni-donechchyny-zneshkodyly-pivtoratonnu-termobarychnu-aviabombu/	2024-10-07T11:49:23-07:00
During the occupation of Kherson Oblast, people were deprived of liberty and tortured: 29 more trait...	This was notified by the SBU. According to the results of comprehensive measures, the identities of 29 more participants of the -Main Directorate of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation- created by the Rashists on the left bank of the Kherson region were established. Among them are former employees of law enforcement agencies of Ukraine. According to the case file, the occupying body is carrying out the Kremlin's task of carrying out mass repressions against the civilian population of the region. Being in the ranks of the so-called -department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation in the Oleshkiv District-, the perpetrators kidnap local residents and imprison them in Russian torture camps. In the cells, the victims are subjected to numerous tortures, including with the use of electric current. Also, prisoners are left in cells without food and water for a long time. In addition, henchmen of the enemy, together with the occupiers, ransack the homes of kidnapped people under the guise of searches. During such raids, criminals steal all the private property of the victims, including cars, office equipment, furniture and household appliances. Another task of the occupying body was the protection of Russian -electoral committees- and armed escort of enemy agitators during the pseudo-referendum on the -joining- of the region to the Russian Federation. On the basis of the collected evidence, the investigators of the Security Service informed in absentia about the suspicion to all 29 collaborators who acted as part of the criminal organization. The extras are immediately suspected under eight articles of the Criminal Code of Ukraine. Since the collaborators are hiding on the temporarily occupied left bank of the Kherson region, comprehensive measures are being taken to find and punish them. The investigation was conducted under the procedural guidance of the Prosecutor General's Office.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/07/pid-chas-okupacziyi-hersonshhyny-pozbavlyaly-voli-ta-katuvaly-lyudej-zaochni-pidozry-otrymaly-shhe-29-zradnykiv/	2024-10-07T11:27:51-07:00

-Vanyok- no harm: the Russians are attacking in the area of ​​New York and Chasovoy Yar	Major Anastasia Bobovnikova, spokeswoman of Luhansk OTU, told about this on the air of the national telethon -Yedini Novyni- . — To the northwest of New York is the village of Nelipivka. Now the fighting is going on for this village. The tactics of the Russians are similar to those they use in Toretsk. They level the city with artillery and then constantly storm in small groups of 3-4-5 people. There are constant assaults throughout the day, she said. The situation in Chasovoy Yar, which the enemy is trying to bypass from the flanks, is also difficult. — The situation near the Temporal Ravine is also difficult, but it is under control. Strong units are stationed there and they do not allow the enemy to advance, the spokeswoman assured. The situation is relatively calmer in the Seversky direction, but enemy offensive actions are taking place there as well. The spokeswoman reminded that recently the Defense Forces destroyed 5 armored fighting vehicles and about 20 units of enemy manpower in the direction. - The use of technology is atypical in our area. After all, apparently the enemy saves equipment, whatever it is, even the old Soviet one. -Vanyok- is not a pity, the equipment is a pity, the military woman explained. She said that yesterday the enemy tried to storm here on motorcycles. - They also use motorcycles in this direction. Just yesterday they also tried to storm us on motorcycles. Likewise, the enemy suffered losses - about 20 -200- people and motorcycles were also scrapped, the officer reported. Earlier ArmyInform informed that Russians have entered the eastern outskirts of Toretsk, fighting is going on in the city for everyone entrance.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/07/vanok-ne-shkoda-rosiyany-atakuyut-v-rajoni-nyu-jorka-ta-chasovogo-yaru/	2024-10-07T10:42:50-07:00

In Lviv Oblast, a border crossing agent faces up to 7 years in prison	The Special Prosecutor's Office of the Western Region reported this on October 7. It was established that he ordered the subordinate not to conduct proper checks, instead forcing him to immediately enter information into the -Hart- system. At the same time, he emphasized that this or that transport -is under the management's control.- Later, the suspect personally returned the documents to his -clients- for customs formalities. In this way, he managed to transport 26 men to the European Union, who are subject to mobilization during the war. The border guard is currently in custody. The involvement of other persons in the criminal scheme is checked. ArmyInform reminds that it is better not to break the law, but to use the aggregator of vacancies in the Armed Forces or recruiting centers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/07/na-lvivshhyni-prykordonnyku-perepravnyku-zagrozhuye-do-7-rokiv-uvyaznennya/	2024-10-07T10:25:52-07:00
Born to crawl: the Armed Forces explained the difficulty of controlling ground drones	The platoon commander of ground robotic systems Serhiy Kraynyak told about the functions that robotic platforms can perform and how to overcome difficulties in their operation on the air of the national telethon -Yedini Novyny-. — First of all, these are logistics missions, evacuation missions, as well as a large niche of combat drones, which are focused on the fire damage of the enemy. These are both kamikazes and combat platforms armed with turrets, machine guns, and grenade launchers, which are aimed at direct damage to the enemy, he said. At the same time, it is more difficult to use ground drones than aerial ones. — The main difficulty of using ground systems lies in the fact that they are used in completely different conditions. The conditions of their application are much more difficult than for aerial drones, in which the only field of application is airspace. It will be the same both in Kharkiv Oblast and Kherson Oblast. That is, we only need a radio horizon, good communication and we can work at affordable distances, the military said. On the other hand, with ground platforms, everything is more difficult, because the drone has to move on different surfaces with complex terrain. In view of this, he needs high traffic. - He must be able to overcome the obstacles that are on the front, because the roads on the front are extremely difficult, the terrain is beaten, everything is riddled with shells, there are ruins of houses, trees and the like. Therefore, he should be able to overcome all this, - emphasized the commander of ground drones. There are also problems with the operator's communication with the ground drone. — Difficulty, first of all, with communication. Because it moves on the ground, there are a lot of dead zones for communication and it is very difficult to precisely organize communication in such a way that it can move without losing control of a certain route, the officer explained. He emphasized that the field of application of ground drones is quite young, but extremely promising. — In my opinion, the platforms should develop to the point that we can sit tens and hundreds of kilometers away in a protected place and control the platforms during real combat, evacuation and deliver the necessary elements to the front line and minimize the participation of fighters in this to maximize their to protect the enemy from fire damage, explained Serhiy Kraynyak. The military is confident in the prospects of further work on the improvement of ground drones, in particular, in the plan to use artificial intelligence. — At the moment, we have to go through this evolutionary path so that we have platforms that can withstand difficult operating conditions, have high throughput and sufficient connectivity to work smoothly in difficult conditions. Currently, we have to go through an evolutionary path in order to technically reach the parameters so that the platform can perform combat missions. I think that in the future it will be possible to integrate a lot of interesting things, including artificial intelligence, programming platforms for autonomous movement and the like. At the moment, we are still in the early stages of development, ground platforms are still behind air platforms, one step ahead, he said. Earlier, ArmyInform explained what becomes of in the way of finicky ground drones.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/07/narodzhenyj-povzaty-u-zsu-poyasnyly-skladnist-keruvaty-nazemnymy-dronamy/	2024-10-07T10:12:23-07:00

Major Anastasia Bobovnikova, spokeswoman of Luhansk OTU, told about this on the air of the national telethon -Yedini Novyny- . — It is the hottest now in the Toretsk direction, the battles are being fought in Toretsk itself. The situation is unstable, battles are taking place literally at every entrance, she said. According to the spokeswoman, it is currently difficult to estimate what part of the city is controlled by the enemy, because during the fighting units of the Defense Forces counterattack and return lost positions. — the Russians entered the eastern outskirts of the city and advanced somewhat along Tsentralnaya street, in the direction of the Tsentralnaya mine. But the situation is constantly changing — sometimes we repulse their fire points, then they destroy ours somewhere. But we constantly restore their positions and try to return what the occupiers captured, we do not allow them to advance, - the military woman emphasized. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in the East, the Russians are continuously storming, the situation in the region of Toretsk and New York is the most difficult.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/07/u-toreczku-tochatsya-boyi-za-kozhen-pidyizd-rosiyany-uvijshly-na-shidnu-okolyczyu-mista/	2024-10-07T09:23:36-07:00

They even dig with their nails: the occupiers take into account the peculiarities of the terrain in ...	The head of the planning department of the 13th brigade of operational assignment -Charter- told about this on the air of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon Lieutenant Colonel Anton Baev of the National Guard of Ukraine. — The most difficult thing for us is the conditions of our terrain, our area, where there are very deep ravines and very relief streams. The enemy does not use the traditional system of fortifications in the form of long trenches. They equip single burrows, which are very difficult in our realities and in the circumstances of our area to clean and pass through, he said. It is extremely difficult for the fighters of the Defense Forces of Ukraine to clear such shelters. — This is very painstaking work, every 5-10 meters is very difficult for our infantry. We can go through it for 3-4 hours. Therefore, it is difficult a little bit, but we will work, the officer assured. Enemy shelters are extremely varied and in some places very extensive. Clearing such shelters is not easy, even with the help of grenades. - It is like a single hole that just goes underground for two or three meters, has certain bends at different angles, which makes work difficult. Even throwing grenades into these holes does not always give a certain result, because there are also corners of these holes, said the guardsman. On the already liberated territories, the fighters of the Defense Forces saw entire underground mini-towns dug by the occupiers. - There is also information and we have already seen in those territories where we have already regained control that there are small underground towns that are connected to each other by some tunnels there. The enemy digs constantly, digs very efficiently, and this, of course, complicates the work, said the soldier. He said that the occupiers dig exclusively by hand with a chance tool, because the Defense Forces do not allow him to use any equipment. - Everything is done by hand. It is impossible to bring engineering equipment here, we do not give such an opportunity, he assured. However, by hand the Russian invaders dig regularly and continuously. — What makes a Russian soldier different is that he will dig even with his fingernails to dig. That is, they should be given credit for this, they dig constantly, with anything, any means at hand, said Anton Baev. In view of this, the situation with enemy shelters is constantly changing, because in a few hours the enemy is able to dig quite a lot. - That's why you look at the situation - today there is one, and tomorrow there will be twice as much as yesterday. Therefore, it is necessary to constantly keep it under control and watch, the officer explained. Every day in the Kharkiv direction, the Defense Forces discover and destroy dozens of enemy shelters, often managing to do this together with the occupiers who are hiding there. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in the Armed Forces revealed the secret of thermal ammunition for -dragon- drones.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/07/ryyut-navit-nigtyamy-okupanty-vrahovuyut-osoblyvosti-relyefu-na-harkivshhyni/	2024-10-07T08:32:20-07:00

28 assaults were repulsed by the Defense Forces in the Siversky, Kramatorsk and Toretsk directions	Major Anastasia Bobovnikova, spokeswoman of Luhansk OTU, told about this on the broadcast of the Suspilne Novosti marathon. — The enemy uses artillery, aviation, drones. This is already typical in these areas. In total, over the past day, the enemy fired 1,500 shots at our positions, launched 4 missile strikes and conducted 28 assaults. However, more than 200 people were killed and wounded, she said. During the assaults, the Russians mostly use outdated Soviet equipment, which the enemy has in limited quantities. Its occupants use it as a means of delivery in order to get as close as possible to the positions of units of the Defense Forces. - Currently, the main tactics of the Russians are small group assaults. The vehicle is being used, but is limited to -taxi- functions to transport manpower for assaults, the spokeswoman said. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in the East, the Russians are continuously storming with infantry and Soviet troops, the most difficult is the situation in the region of Toretsk and New York.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/07/28-shturmiv-vidbyly-syly-oborony-na-siverskomu-kramatorskomu-ta-toreczkomu-napryamkah/	2024-10-07T08:09:33-07:00
They got it from under the ground - our drones hit a buried enemy howitzer	The video of the defeat appeared on October 7 on the brigade's channel. The occupiers took care to protect their cannon: they kept it in a capon below ground level and lowered the muzzle after firing. This allowed the Russians not to be afraid of artillery fire, since only a direct hit could hit the -revenge-. This is exactly what our pilots ensured, who hit the muzzle of the howitzer twice, turning it from a formidable weapon into scrap. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the -Sharp Cartouche- UAV unit of the National Guard of Ukraine made a video guide of the road of death along which the Russians are trying to enter their positions near Hlyboky.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/07/z-pid-zemli-distaly-nashi-dronari-vrazyly-zakopanu-vorozhu-gaubyczyu/	2024-10-07T07:54:48-07:00

The suspect received the order via messenger. He was promised to be paid for the -work-. To carry it out, he involved an accomplice, to whom he gave false information about the alleged staging of setting fire to a car in order to receive insurance benefits. An accomplice made a flammable liquid and set the serviceman's car on fire at night. He recorded his actions on a mobile phone. A resident of Sumy was also exposed, who, while looking for a job in Telegram, agreed to a customer's offer to set fire to military vehicles for a monetary reward.

The man prepared for the campaign for a long time and carefully. For half a year, I studied information on social networks, how and where to cross the border. In the end, he contacted an unknown person who promised to help him cross the border. -The men agreed on a payment of $5,000. Dniprovets transferred the money to the stranger's account in the manner indicated to him and waited for further instructions. Instead, the latter deleted the correspondence and blocked his number,- the report said. Then the man decided to act alone. He reached Uzhgorod and headed towards the border. He was stopped halfway by a border guard. Dniprovets was confused in the explanations, and then admitted the real purpose of being near the border.

The Ukrainian military will be able to mobilize directly to units without TCC	This was announced by the head of the Main Personnel Department of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Colonel Roman Horbach, at a briefing on certain issues of military service, mobilization and military accounting. Yes, conscripts and volunteer reservists can now choose a military unit for service without going to territorial recruitment and social support centers. In turn, commanders of military units are empowered to issue referrals to the VLK to determine suitability for service and to staff combat units with volunteers who wish to serve on the draft during mobilization without the participation of the TCC. The introduced changes simplify the procedure for enlisting volunteers for mobilization as much as possible. From now on, under the new rules, if a conscript joins the army on mobilization, a reference (recommendation letter) from the unit is not required. Then, through the recruiting mechanism, he responds to the selected vacancy and joins the unit directly, without the participation of the TCC. Also, the recruiting time is significantly reduced. These changes are a guarantee that each conscript will be able to enter the service in the military unit to which he actually wanted to enter. An important point. The new rules work for both priority and non-priority units. The list of military units whose commanders will be able to draft conscripts and reservists (except for reservists who have signed a contract for military service in the military reserve) will be determined by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. As reported by ArmyInform, from now on military service Reservists and reservists living in regional centers should report to the territorial recruitment and social support center within 7 days after sending the summons by mail.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/07/ukrayinski-vijskovi-zmozhut-mobilizuvatysya-napryamu-do-chastyn-bez-tczk/	2024-10-07T05:03:10-07:00

Where does napalm for drones come from: the secret of thermal ammunition was revealed in the Armed F...	Features of the use of -dragon- drones on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- revealed by the commander of the BPAC shock battalion -Achilles- of the 92nd separate assault brigade named after the basket captain Ivan Sirk, captain Yuriy Fedorenko. - -Drakarisy- is a type of ammunition that was developed back in the Soviet Union. Its remnants are now being actively used by the Defense Forces, he said. To a large extent, the effectiveness of the use of this thermal munition was facilitated by persistent hot and dry weather, which lasted until the beginning of October. -A fairly dry autumn and strong winds gave us the opportunity to gain a certain tactical advantage on the battlefield due to the burning of landings, which leads to the destruction of both enemy positions and various formations - both open with ammunition and certain observation and firing positions,- he explained Yury Fedorenko. He emphasized that -the creativity of the Ukrainian mind is limitless- and disclosed some details of the use of thermal ammunition. This became possible due to the fact that the peculiarities of the use of -dragon- drones by the Ukrainian military have already become known to the enemy. — The question is not in the drone itself, but in the type of ammunition. This type of ammunition can, after a certain modification, be put on an fpv-kamikaze drone of a certain size, the officer said. After she tried to apply it in one of the brigades of the Defense Forces, the idea was picked up and developed in other units. After long-term use by Ukrainian drones, the Russians also learned about the specifics of the ammunition. They also began to use similar weapons. However, the enemy does not have such successes as the Ukrainian military. This is primarily due to the fact that the occupiers have no need for the widespread use of -dragon- drones, as they have an advantage in MLRS and use prohibited phosphorous ammunition. — The enemy has rocket fire systems and there are phosphors, which one way or another the enemy continues to use on the battle line. Unfortunately, fire damage due to phosphors is very and very significant. Therefore, one way or another, the enemy has partially taken over the tactics of use, but at the moment, the Defense Forces, due to this type of ammunition in such a combination with FPV drones, manage to achieve more significant results on the battlefield than the enemy, he concluded. Also, the commander of the Ukrainian drones reported some tactical and technical characteristics of the thermal ammunition. - This is a disposable ammunition. As for the time of its burning - more than a few minutes, I will not specify specifically. As for the area it can cover, it depends on the density of planting, 50 meters and more, said the military.

Optimizing the arms race: the US introduced a family of autonomous cruise missiles	The Barracuda series includes three variants: Barracuda-100, Barracuda-250 and Barracuda-500, each compatible with different payloads and deployment mechanisms to support a wide range of missions. And as stated in the presentation release posted on the official portal of this company from California, which is engaged in defense technologies and specializes in autonomous systems, the Barracuda family is an autonomous vehicle (AAV) specially designed for ultra-scale production and mass use, ArmyInform reports. Designers from Anduril believe that they have succeeded in realizing the task in a new family of cruise missiles, when Barracuda missiles, combining advanced software and a simplified design, will provide a highly intelligent, inexpensive and flexible mission system. ​ Arms market specialists from IKK Defense Express (DE) emphasize that demonstrated by Anduril Industries the Barracuda family of cruise missiles takes a completely new approach to the cost and timelines of producing such long-range weapons. Thereby, it is proposed to break the paradigm that a cruise missile is an expensive product that requires high-cost equipment and components. -That's why the Barracuda is all about using low-cost materials: 50% fewer parts, 95% less tooling required for production, 50% less time per unit and 30% less cost than existing models.- - stressed in DE. These are the production design parameters that quotes edition Air &amp; Space Forces Magazine, announced at Anduril Industries during the presentation. On the other hand, Defense Express stated that the American company also announced these features and the need for such missiles in a concise and very original video: Presentation of the -Barracuda-M- cruise missile family. Video: Anduril Industries An interesting feature of this video presentation of the Barracuda-M project is that it states that -these missiles can be assembled with a screwdriver and a wrench.- And it was also added that these are the missiles the USA needs to confront China. -Another feature of these missiles is that they should be launched not only from specialized carriers, but also from pallets. That is, it is about the implementation of the decision Rapid Dragon, when a cruise missile is simply dropped from a cargo plane, any, even An-26,- noted experts from IKK DE. As for the missiles themselves, three types of these winged weapons are currently reported to be in development: the Barracuda-100, the Barracuda-250, and the Barracuda-500. The exact characteristics of each have not yet been named, but it is stated that the maximum range of the cruise missile from this family will be more than 500 nautical miles, i.e. more than 900 km, time in the air more than 120 minutes, maneuvers with overload in 5G and payload capacity from 100 pounds (45 kg ). Barracuda's modular, open systems architecture and common subsystems enable rapid integration and testing of new commercial sub-component technologies, allowing mission capabilities to be adjusted as needed. Designed as a software-defined and hardware-supported platform, Barracuda can be continuously upgraded to meet mission requirements. Barracuda-100, a compact modular variant designed for ground and air operational concepts. The missile is capable of both ground- and air-launched operations, with a range of over 157 kilometers when launched from the air and over 111 kilometers when launched from the ground. This model supports a payload of up to 16 kilograms, accommodating both kinetic and non-kinetic types. Barracuda-250 is intended for wider operational use in various armed forces with support for multiple payloads, platforms and operational concepts. It has a range of over 370 kilometers when launched from the air and over 278 kilometers when launched from the ground, with a payload of 16 kilograms. Barracuda-500 is designed for long-range missions and mass production. A flight range of more than 926 kilometers when launched from the air, it can carry a payload of more than 45 kilograms, including both kinetic and other types of payload. The Barracuda family is designed to be flexibly deployed on a variety of air, land and sea platforms, supporting multiple mission sets. The vehicles are compatible with fifth-generation aircraft internal weapons bays, fourth-generation aircraft and helicopter external guides, MFOM launchers, common launch tubes (CLTs), surface vessels, and can be placed on pallets for deployment from transfer aircraft.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/07/optymizacziya-peregoniv-ozbroyennya-u-ssha-predstavyly-simejstvo-avtonomnyh-krylatyh-raket/	2024-10-06T20:55:03-07:00
In the capital's military institute, the specialization where the most women study was named	This was reported by ArmyInform acting head of the press service of Taras Shevchenko KNU Military Institute, Lieutenant Oleksandr Brytvych. — The highest percentage of women among those who entered is observed in the humanities specializations. -Military Psychology- is the most popular, he noted. According to him, specializations with a scientific and precise bias, such as -Geo-information systems and technologies-, are less popular among women. We will remind you that this year the Military Institute of Taras Shevchenko Kyiv National Universitychanged the conditions of the admission campaign and started training specialists under the educational program -International cooperation in the field of defense and the military field-.

Enemy media actively distribute staged videos about the Armed Forces: what did they make up this tim...	Recently ArmyInform reported , that propagandists accused Ukraine of the fact that our military allegedly attacked the Kursk nuclear power plant with four HIMARS missiles, which were -heroically intercepted- by Russian air defense. Of course, this is a fake from the first word to the last. However, he is far from the only one. Enemy media began to more actively distribute staged videos about the alleged -atrocities of the Armed Forces- in the Kursk region. Yes, the Russians claim that they discovered a video of the killing of civilians in Kurshchyna, which was allegedly recorded by a GoPro camera on the helmet of a dead Ukrainian soldier. The propagandists show only a few seconds of a video taken in a dark room, from which no conclusions can be drawn either about the events themselves or about their participants. Enemy propagandists also recorded a whole series of videos with nonsense from an elderly man who introduced himself as an -evacuee resident of the Kursk region.- He did not restrain his imagination - he talked about a man hanged in a church, a raped woman whose head was also cut off, Polish and Georgian mercenaries who kidnapped people and kept them in the basement. In order to properly terrify the Russian public, you cannot invent anything better than unsubstantiated stories. In order to shock their audience even more and to emphasize that -nothing is sacred- for the Ukrainian military, enemy propagandists spread fakes about deliberately burning fields with unharvested crops and about a man who allegedly died in his garden while digging potatoes. In addition, the stories of women are spreading, who claim that there are apparently mass shootings of civilian cars and drone attacks on villages with incendiary munitions. It is characteristic that people who share such stories have not seen anything like this with their own eyes. They sincerely admit that these are rumors heard from acquaintances. There is no reason to be surprised - all Russian propaganda is built on gossip, lies and manipulation.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/07/vorozhi-media-aktyvno-poshyryuyut-postanovochni-video-pro-zsu-shho-vygadaly-czogo-razu/	2024-10-06T20:37:52-07:00
How to hide in the woods: making the mobilized invisible in Britain on Interflex	An ArmyInform correspondent told about how they are taught how to choose and arrange shelter in the forest during the BZVP as part of the Interflex multinational training mission in Great Britain. The forest is big, and you won't find a tree to help you. This Ukrainian proverb pops up in my head again when the instructors give us the task of finding and equipping a good individual shelter on the edge of the forest. This must be done quickly and imperceptibly for a conditional enemy who is watching us from the side of the field. Given these conditions, we have only a few minutes to emerge from the depths of the forest, choose a good place and quickly arrange the simplest shelter. However, the Danes have many other sayings about the forest: -Skoven har ørre og marken har øjne- - -The forest has ears, and the field has eyes-, -Ringer du i skoven, får du sva- - -When you call in the forest, there is an answer you will get- and even -Æren er det fejreste træ i skoven- - -Honour is the most glorious tree in the forest-. So they talk about the forest, apparently, they know a lot not only about military science, but also about folk signs and observations. This is noticeable in the way they teach us, combining practice and theory - first they visually demonstrate the result we should achieve, and then explain how exactly it can be done. During one of the exercises, we have to discover in in the forest in front of us are two instructors who imperceptibly approached us during the line-up. We have already failed the first part of the test - while we were lining up, enemy scouts or saboteurs crept up to us at a distance of less than 50 meters, and none of us noticed them. Now we have to visually detect them in the forest during our daily activities camp According to the conditions of the task, we cannot go deeper into the forest and only move along it. We have at first 3, then 5, and finally 10 minutes to identify the conditional enemy, because none of us managed to do it in the first moments of time. The whole department looks into the forest thicket and, in the end, the first of us notices one of the instructors It succeeds only because he has moved. We look for the second one even longer, but in the end, the most vigilant among us manage to spot it too. I am ashamed to admit that I did not see either the first or the second, so I pretend that I did notice one. I randomly point out the likely location of the hypothetical enemy to the instructor and he nods approvingly - I was lucky enough to guess the outline of a hand in a slightly strange silhouette behind a hump near a tree trunk. Lesson learned - we made sure to get close to the enemy and take a position in shelters of natural origin can be completely imperceptible. Now they will explain to us how to do it, breaking down the whole process into the smallest details and visualizing each of them. In order not to reveal all the secrets, I will mention only the obvious things - individual camouflage, silent movement in the lowest profile, choosing a position with the guaranteed possibility of a direct shot and the desired presence of personal protection against enemy counterfire. Instructors explain and demonstrate several more important elements, emphasizing that combining them all at the same time is an incredible, almost impossible luck in real conditions. So they should be prioritized, sacrificing the less important ones. For example, clear visibility for a shot may be more important than individual safety, and movement in the lowest possible profile may be traded for movement speed if there is a high chance that the enemy will not detect you while moving. Or on the contrary, it is better to be slow, but silent and inconspicuous. Five instructors are lined up in front of us on the opposite side of the road. Dressed in the same uniform and having identical camouflage, they stand at a distance of 12-15 meters from each other. It would seem that they should be equally visible, but they are not. -Get the point?- - asks the chief instructor and explains in detail why we can see the far left instructor in the row best and in contrast, the far right one is practically invisible, and the three between them are also visually perceived in completely different ways. There is no magic in what was demonstrated - only knowledge, abilities, skills and experience. Anyone can achieve this with due diligence, careful practice and vigilance. We should use this knowledge when choosing and setting up personal positions on the edge of the forest. We advance towards the edge of the forest. Now we will apply the acquired knowledge in practice. Training as part of Interflex's multinational training mission in Great Britain. It's only nine in the morning, we've been working for about three hours, so we have more than 12 hours of theory and practical training before the end of a tiring day. >	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/07/yak-shovatysya-u-lisi-mobilizovanyh-roblyat-nevydymymy-u-brytaniyi-na-interflex/	2024-10-06T20:30:32-07:00
-The number of dead exceeded the number of wounded-: OTU -Kharkiv- explained the reason for the huge...	The tactical episode of the city battles in Vovchansk was told by the spokesman of the OTU -Kharkiv- on the telethon -Yedini Novyni- commented Colonel Vitaliy Sarantsev of the ZSU. — With regard to the use of armored vehicles, the largest such richest case was at the beginning of last week. Then the enemy used a large number of personnel and a significant amount of armored vehicles, which under the cover of two tanks tried to storm the positions of the Defense Forces in the Vovchansk region. They tried to advance to the Aggregate Plant, but were met by the fire of our artillery and the strikes of our FPV drones, he said. Enemy losses during this assault were colossal. — The enemy lost a lot of personnel in that direction. At least on my rotation it happened for the first time when the number of dead exceeded the number of wounded. This shows that the intensity of the battle was such that the enemy simply did not have time to withdraw their personnel or take the wounded — they all died simply during this assault, the spokesman explained. Today in Vovchansk, the enemy again tried to attack the positions of units of the Defense Forces, but did it on foot without using armored vehicles. Fire from the Ukrainian military forced the occupiers to abandon the task. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that during the described assault in Vovchansk irreversible losses of enemy manpower twice exceeded sanitary. On other days, the Russian occupiers lose their manpower in the same massive way - last day, the enemy's irreversible losses amounted to almost 40%, and the day before yesterday more than 37% of the total number of losses.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/06/kilkist-zagyblyh-perevyshhyla-kilkist-poranenyh-v-otu-harkiv-poyasnyly-prychynu-velycheznyh-vtrat-voroga-u-vovchansku/	2024-10-06T11:06:31-07:00

Tactical training in the trenches: future commanders of the Armed Forces train in Britain	The details of the preparation were reported at the General Staff of the Armed Forces. Under the guidance of experienced instructors from Finland and Australia, our servicemen master key techniques and strategies for storming enemy trenches. The trenches are where the real battles take place, and they require the highest level of skill. First, the soldiers are shown the basic methods of storming trenches at the platoon level, methods of cover by fire support groups. The main aspects of preparation and analysis of intelligence data, assessment of the situation on the battlefield, development of terrain layouts and preparation of a plan to storm enemy trenches are also discussed. An important element is the rules for handling the wounded in the trenches and careful movement in the trenches. After the theoretical part, the platoon commanders proceed to the planning stage, taking into account all the necessary information. They practically practice assaults both during the day and at night, improving the coordination of actions. Thanks to these classes, our servicemen improve all the necessary skills that will be needed to liberate the Ukrainian land from the enemy. -May these efforts contribute to the strengthening of Ukraine's defense capabilities and bring us closer to victory over the aggressor. We thank our partners from Australia and Finland for their support and cooperation in training our defenders.

He said that one of the tactical actions of enemy units is the laying of underground logistics routes in the direction of Ukrainian positions. -This tactic of the enemy is not new.

He noted that the Russians use this tactic regularly. In most cases, for battles in the city or suburbs, than in forest belts. -Indeed, it should be determined what they know how to dig. We see from our offensive actions how difficult it is for us to -smoke out- the enemy from their holes that they dig. Such buildings are sometimes even multi-level,- said Volodymyr Degtyarev. The representative of the press service of the -Chartiya- NSU brigade spoke separately about the technical capabilities of the enemy units. -We know that the 7th regiment of the 11th corps is standing against our brigade from the enemy's side, which is mainly formed, or rather, continues to be formed, from the recently held convict colonies,- he said. According to him, although the -quality of their personnel- is very low, their technology is at a good level. The enemy is actively using EW means against Ukrainian aerial reconnaissance. -We constantly apply updated solutions for aerial reconnaissance. However, literally in a week or two, the enemy has an answer. But, I would like to emphasize, we have a very well-established surveillance system, including aerial surveillance, thanks to drones, which takes place 24/7, day and night,- emphasized Volodymyr Degtyarev. He emphasized that the fighters from his unit can see even in the rear of the enemy. -We can prepare in advance, prevent the approach and any active actions of even small groups. Not to mention some attempts to break through with the use of a large amount of equipment,- Volodymyr Degtyarev, a representative of the press service of the 13th brigade of the Charter State University, Volodymyr Degtyarev, said. As reported by ArmyInform, the Ukrainian military is actively ground robotic platforms of various types are used, performing tasks of various purposes. The occupiers are trying to ape the successful experience.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/06/vorog-prokladaye-pidzemni-marshruty-ta-formuye-polk-iz-zekiv/	2024-10-06T02:42:43-07:00
The Three Laws of Robotics: What's Getting in the Way of Picky Ground Drones	What prevents the enemy from effectively using ground drones on the air of a national telethon told an officer of the 2nd separate detachment of the Special Purpose Center - Omega- of the National Guard of Ukraine with the call sign -Stig-. — We saw ground complexes trying to deliver some keys, food items, ammunition. They are also trying to install some turrets with automatic machines, machine guns that drive autonomously and are controlled from a remote control by certain operators, he said. However, it is difficult for the Russians to effectively use ground-based drones for a number of reasons — the lack of robotic platforms with high-quality running gear, a lack of trained operators to operate ground-based drones, and even the terrain. — There are certain nuances in the application of ground complexes, because you are very limited in the terrain of application. If you have any construction debris, destruction, then you cannot apply these complexes. You can't use them in the forest either, explained the soldier. Difficult terrain can be overcome only by a skilled operator who controls a ground drone with high cross-country ability and appropriate technical characteristics of the chassis. Simpler platforms are very picky about the terrain - they need a straight road. -Plus we have to understand that mine-explosive barriers also affect the use of these ground complexes,- the officer noted. Ground-based robotic platforms, judging by their weight and technical characteristics, can indeed be blown up by both anti-vehicle and anti-personnel mines. After all, as soon as Ukrainian UAV operators detect enemy ground drones, they immediately attack them and destroy enemy equipment. -Despite all these nuances, if the operators of our strike drones detect such a complex, it will be destroyed almost immediately, as well as all the equipment they use,- assured the officer with the call sign -Stig-. Previously, ArmyInform showed how Ukrainian FPV -drone destroyed a Russian ground drone that went a little crazy as well as Ukrainian ground drones dropped a cache with ten Russians in the air, stormed enemy positions, hit the occupiers from an ambush, landed the invaders in the air with a charge of 200 kg of plastid and repeatedly successfully mined the area - left -surprises- and -split- Russians into atoms.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/06/try-zakony-robototehniky-shho-staye-na-zavadi-vybaglyvym-nazemnym-dronam/	2024-10-06T02:22:26-07:00

How civilians became military for two days: intensive from the legendary 46th. Photo report ArmyInfo...	On the chevrons there is a silver -Barbut- type helmet and golden wings. The 46th Airmobile Brigade conducts the -Start Your Journey- basic military training intensive for civilians. Several hundred applications were submitted. Specialists of the recruiting group selected a little more than fifty men and women. Different age. Different professions. Some had served and fought, but most were on the territory of a military unit for the first time and wore a uniform for the first time. From socks and uniforms to body armor, helmets, sleeping bags and combat weapons, the cadets were provided with all the essentials and equipment for living and training in the field. These days, they live according to the routine of military personnel. The course program was written in minutes. Classes were held at several educational locations using the carousel method. Tactical exercises and weapons handling techniques, fire training including combat shooting, tactical medicine, engineering and mine training, piloting, control and counter-UAV. As Colonel Andrii Khoruzhiy, deputy commander of the brigade, said, -I am the head of this course. I was authorized to create this plan with the Basic General Military Training Course in mind. This course is fundamentally different from the general BZVP course - it lasts 30 days, and in 2 days we gave civilians the opportunity to familiarize themselves with what the army is, and then decide whether they want to serve in our brigade. Our task is to motivate these people to choose our team. If they choose another DSHV brigade, we will not be offended by them, because DSHV is one big family. We support everyone and everyone supports us.- Lt. Col. Bohdan Krasko, head of the training department of the 46th separate airmobile brigade of the DSHV, gave details: — We chose the main key features of the BZVP — these are fire training, tactical training, tactical medicine, the procedure for countering UAVs, as well as UAV control itself, engineering training. In general, all servicemen who come to the DSHV brigades go to the training center. The training center provides basic general military training. For 30 days, they have classes on fire, tactical medicine, attention is paid to mine safety, direct mining, studying the operation and countermeasures of UAVs, throwing grenades and much more. In particular, they learn the basics of survival, the concept of field hygiene. So that, being in positions, I understand how to take care of myself, how to look after myself, to make sure that there are no frostbites, overheating and any other ailments, the names of which I may not even know. They even teach cadets how to cook their own food - that is, not only know how to open a dry ration and heat it up, but also understand what you can eat and what you can't. How to get water. Taking into account the experience of the DSHV teams, changes are constantly made to the training program. During the day, the cadets went through all the training locations. They were shown samples of weapons that are in the brigade - both of domestic production and of allied countries, and there were also trophy weapons. On the firing line, they tried to hit targets - many succeeded. Samples of mine-explosive devices - both ours and trophy ones - were presented at the engineering training site. From time to time, the drone of UAVs was heard from the sky - they were training future operators, on the tachmed - some sitting, some lying down, diligently turned the turnstiles, other cadets trained with automatic weapons. As one of the course participants answered: -Now I understand much better what my husband told me - even if the war doesn't touch you, you should be ready for it.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/06/yak-czyvilni-na-dva-dni-staly-vijskovymy-intensyv-vid-legendarnoyi-46-yi-fotoreportazh-armiyainform/	2024-10-05T21:00:46-07:00
During the defense of Kyiv, he finished the course reading to the students: the story of deputy comb...	The following story is about Major Vadym Prokopets, a deputy combatant in one of the units of the Security Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Before the large-scale invasion, the military man taught at Taras Shevchenko Kyiv National University. He is a candidate of physical and mathematical sciences, an associate professor. How is it — to hold lectures during the defense of Kyiv? But why did Vadim join the army, despite his armor? He told our correspondents about it. My decision to join the military was not spontaneous. In 2018, a terror defense battalion was formed in our area, and an acquaintance invited me there. I signed a reservist contract that same year. Attended schools and training that took place in the battalion. And when the full-scale invasion began, I already knew where I was going, what position I was in, and where my machine gun was. When the invasion began in 2022, I jumped right in from day one. I was deputy chief of staff of the mobrobot battalion — recruited people for our service... We didn't sleep at all for four days, forming the battalion. About the quarrel with the TCC, the parents of his students in the battalion and the collapse of the Russian Federation: the story of deputy combatant Oleksandr Panarin Since 2022, I have been serving in this unit all the time. He performed the duties of an operational on-duty command post, and simply a deputy chief of staff, performed the duties of a company commander. Now I have a new position — the deputy commander of the artillery battalion. Since July last year, our unit has been performing tasks in the Kharkiv region: these are Streleche, Krasne, Morokhovets, July There we covered the state border. I won't say that there were intense battles there, but the constant shelling was annoying. Then we were transferred to the Donetsk direction, with the 93rd brigade we were in Klishchivka, Andriivka. We fought there for two months. Then there was a rotation, then again — Klishchiivka. Then they transferred it to Lyman. And after that, with the 5th separate assault brigade, they performed combat missions near Bakhmut, then — Sumshchyna on the border with the Kursk region... Therefore, I can say that our battalion has very good combat experience. Before the beginning of the large-scale invasion, I worked at the physics faculty of Taras Shevchenko Kyiv National University. Position — Associate Professor of the Department of Optics. My workplace is saved... By the way, literally two days ago, while on vacation, I stopped by my native faculty. At the very beginning, on March 22, my native university helped with protective equipment — they gave me a bulletproof vest and a helmet, which was an invaluable help at the time. I am the author and co-author of textbooks and study guides for our students in the subjects I taught. He prepared another textbook, but did not have time to publish it. This is from analog electronics. The manuscript is already ready, it remains to -comb- it and submit it to the publishing house. I was supposed to hand it in for printing in the spring of the 22nd, but it's lying at home, my hands can't finish it. Waiting for the end of the war. My professional experience and knowledge of electronics came in handy during the service: our unmanned systems platoon received defective initiation boards of the detonation of the ammunition of an FPV drone. After investigating the board, I found the reason, and repaired these boards, which were then used during combat work. …By the way, my student, whom I taught, came to our battalion. It was in the early days, at the end of February 2022, when people were accepted into the unit. It was just that there was light masking then, it was dark... I have a stack of papers, I use my phone to shine the light so that I can write clearly. I am asking for the next name. He says: -Ananyivskyi-. I'm like: stop, something familiar. And he: -Well, I'm your student!...- What's more, this student came to our battalion with his father. Another moment came to mind. During the defense of Kyiv, my university asked me to complete the course -Introduction to Analog Electronics-. And what to do: I finished reading the course in the evenings, via Zoom. ...By the way, I had reservations as a teacher from the very beginning. It still works. But, you see, my motive is very simple. I know that if Russia comes here, there will be no Ukrainian universities, no Ukrainian education, no Ukrainian science, nothing. That's why I decided — to take up arms.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/06/pid-chas-oborony-kyyeva-dochytuvav-studentam-kurs-istoriya-zastupnyka-kombata-i-vykladacha-vyshu-vadyma-prokopczya/	2024-10-05T20:50:24-07:00

Strictly speaking, this agreement is only part of the agreement to re-equip the vehicle fleet of the special-purpose units of the Ministry of Defense of Belgium. Initially, this program was to be implemented by the Jankel Armoring Limited company, which undertook to re-equip 199 -Mercedes- for the Belgian commandos. However, Jankel went bankrupt and its assets were taken over by NP Aerospace. French edition of Solondais positions NP Aerospace as a leading British manufacturer and integrator of advanced armor systems. Such enterprises, in particular, specialize in the conversion of commercial vehicles, -hanging- protective -armor- on them. Regarding the implementation of the contract with BeMOD, in addition to the production of new LTTV vehicles for the Belgian military, this agreement also includes lifetime technical support for the LTTV vehicle fleet, which NP Aerospace will use its proven Vehicle Systems, Services and Parts business unit to deliver. In addition to the LTTV contract, NP Aerospace has also signed an operational support agreement with BeMoD for its Rapid Response Vehicle (RRV) fleet, the intellectual property of which is now owned by NP Aerospace. The LTTV vehicle is designed to provide a modular and configurable tactical support vehicle that benefits from the use of rotary units that allow you to quickly change the role of the machine for the versatility of the operating platform. With a payload of over 3 tonnes, depending on the final vehicle specification, the LTTV has 3 main variants to support special operations, including an ambulance variant. Along with a user-customizable, fully integrated set of military subsystems that includes a detachable ballistic protection package, a rollover protection system (ROPS), weapon mounts and communications equipment. BeMoD's Lt. Col. Jean-Francois Gennot said: -We are very pleased with the acquisition of the assets of Jankel Armoring Limited by NP Aerospace, which has enabled us to modify our current contracts and maintain our special equipment fleet. NP Aerospace's long track record in this sector is very promising and we look forward to a long and hopefully fruitful collaboration.- James Kempston, CEO of NP Aerospace, commented: -Following our recent announcement of the acquisition of the assets At Jankel Armouring Limited we are indeed very pleased to announce the award of this major contract which has been offered to us by the customer BeMoD. We are currently preparing everything so that the LTTV program will work and meet the expectations of customers.

Why is Russia lying about the Ukrainian presence in Syria	At first, the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service claimed that the special services of NATO countries and Ukraine were allegedly preparing a -provocation with the use of chemical weapons- in Syria together with local -armed groups-. And now the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, Sergey Lavrov, says that Ukrainian instructors are allegedly training international terrorists in Syria together with the United States. At the same time, the Russians traditionally do not provide any evidence. As explained by the head of the Center for countering disinformation of the NSDC, Lieutenant Andriy Kovalenko, the main focus of the narrative of this disinformation campaign is aimed at the Middle East, the countries of the Global South, as well as the American information field. — This is an attempt by the Russians to create an information background that Ukraine is, they say, a -terrorist state.- Now this is a key information threat at the international level, he noted. In fact, it is Russia that is one of the causes of instability in the Middle East and can carry out a provocation in Syria. Previously, Russian propaganda justified the use of chemical weapons in Syria by the forces of Bashar al-Assad, and Moscow also maintains relations with the Taliban, Hezbollah, Hamas, and ISIS. That is, Russia provides political support to authoritarian regimes that have killed thousands of civilians, further undermining global security. Against the backdrop of rising tensions in the Middle East, Kremlin propaganda is trying to use this situation to create a negative context around Ukraine. In this way, Russia continues to promote the narrative of alleged -Ukrainian terrorism- in order to discredit Ukraine in the eyes of the international community.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/06/navishho-rosiya-breshe-pro-ukrayinsku-prysutnist-v-syriyi/	2024-10-05T20:30:39-07:00
The military told what tactics the enemy is using in the South	This was reported by the spokesman of the -Tavria- OUV Colonel Vladyslav Voloshyn in a national telethon -The only news-. The spokesman noted that the enemy rarely uses heavy armored vehicles and weapons in such assaults. He mainly uses small high-speed vehicles such as motorcycles, buggies, ATVs. -They are designed to quickly overcome the distance from one trench to another, so as not to blow up on the mine-explosive barricades that are installed in front of the defense line to stop heavy equipment,- added Vladyslav Voloshyn. According to the colonel, light equipment quickly overcomes them and does not blow up. So the assault team goes into the trench, followed by the entrenchment team. -Such tactics brought success to the enemy in other directions. Therefore, most likely, he will continue to use it in the Zaporozhye region as well,- the spokesman noted. As reported by ArmyInform, on The number of assaults in the Zaporozhye direction decreased, but the intensity of the attacks did not decrease.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/05/vijskovi-rozpovily-yaku-taktyku-vykorystovuye-vorog-na-pivdni/	2024-10-05T11:09:54-07:00

The occupiers executed four Ukrainian soldiers in Vovchansk — the prosecutor's office	This was reported by the head of the Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office Oleksandr Filchakov. To date, prosecutors have already started a pre-trial investigation into the fact of violation of the laws and customs of war, related to the intentional killing of four prisoners of war — servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, who were executed by the Russian military on the orders of the command in the summer of 2024 on the territory of the aggregate plant in the city of Vovchansk. The specified facts are documented thanks to cooperation with the Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. The reason for starting the investigation was the interrogation of Russian prisoners of war, during which testimony was obtained regarding the commission of the specified crime. -Of course, the investigation of such crimes has its difficulties, especially due to hostilities that make it difficult to access the place of events. However, this case is unique, as the person who may become a suspect in the specified proceedings is also in Ukrainian captivity,- Oleksandr Filchakov said. This opens up an opportunity not to use the procedure of absentee proceedings (in absentia), but to conduct a fair trial and issue a verdict with the actual execution of the punishment. If the suspect is found guilty, he may be sentenced to life imprisonment. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that the intensity of Russian assaults in Vovchansk significantly increased, as a result of which the number of irreversible losses of the enemy in the Kharkiv direction exceeded sanitary losses, also 11 occupiers surrendered. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/05/okupanty-stratyly-chotyroh-ukrayinskyh-vijskovyh-u-vovchansku-prokuratura/	2024-10-05T08:54:17-07:00

What is known about the Russian aircraft that crashed in Kostyantynivka: ArmyInform report from the ...	ArmiyaInform correspondents visited the place where the debris fell. As a result of falling debris, a fire broke out in the private sector, a residential building burned down, several others were damaged by fire. At the crash site, part of the wing can be seen, as well as the landing gear and many small parts. Fortunately, none of the local residents were injured. At first, there were several versions in the information space: the downing of the Su-34 or Su-25 by the Defense Forces of Ukraine, the -friendly fire- of a Russian aircraft on its own, or the crash of a Russian fighter jet. However, the version with the plane was not confirmed. Currently, the most likely version is that it is a Russian heavy combat unmanned aerial vehicle -Sukhoi S-70 Okhotnik-B-. This is particularly indicated by the atypical gray pixel camouflage, which is not found on the Russian Su-25. Also, in the video of the device falling, you can see a silhouette similar to the Russian S-70 UAV. CONFIRMED: Russian -Hunter- Sukhoi S-70 Okhotnik-B UCAV was shot down by Russian Su-57 fighter jet with AA missile. Why? No answer, for now. https://t.co/mpPpc0LvtG pic.twitter.com/foCGeO5igZ — Clash Report (@clashreport) October 5, 2024 Head of the Center for countering disinformation of the NSDC, Lieutenant Andriy Kovalenko reported , that the Russians have been developing the -hunter- for quite a long time, since 2009. So far they have produced three units and three more are under development. Russian media later reported that the UAV had lost control, so the Russians shot it down so that it would not be delivered to Ukrainian forces relatively intact for examination by experts. There is also eyewitness video showing that the UAV was shot down by an air-to-air missile fired by a Russian aircraft at close range. After the missile hit the target, the plane immediately turned around and flew towards the temporarily occupied territories. All this happened in the sky above the battle line. According to Russian developers, the Hunter UAV is designed not only for reconnaissance. It can deliver bomb strikes in a pair with the Su-57. The cost of such a UAV is estimated to be $15 million. It is stated that its speed is up to 900 km per hour, and its range is up to 3,000 kilometers. It can carry up to 7 tons of bomb load. It has a jet engine as a power plant. These drones are not officially adopted by the Russian army, it is likely that it was a test in combat conditions, which ended in disaster for the enemy. Currently, we are waiting for official information from the Defense Forces of Ukraine regarding the type of enemy aircraft and the circumstances of the event.

There is a change in the Strikers team: the American army will receive new armored vehicles	As note experts of the defense portal Army Recognition, such modernization is part of a large-scale program to update the mechanized units of the US Army with the aim of increasing their combat effectiveness in the conditions of modern armed conflicts, ArmyInform reports. The Dragoon Stryker, currently in service with the US Army and officially known as the Infantry Carrier Vehicle-D (ICVD) Dragoon (-Dragoon-), is a variant of the Stryker family of armored vehicles developed by General Dynamics Land Systems. It was created in response to the need for increased firepower in the Stryker Brigade Combat Teams (SBCT) of the US Army. Development of the Dragoon Stryker began in the mid-2010s, when the Army realized the need for better-equipped vehicles to counter potential adversaries with their own armored vehicles. The Dragoon Stryker entered service with the US Army in 2018, significantly increasing the firepower of SBCT units. It was quickly deployed in various brigades, becoming an integral part of the mechanized forces of the US Army. Despite its effectiveness, advances in technology and battlefield needs prompted the Army to seek further improvements, leading to the development of the ICVVA1-30mm, which will replace the Dragoon with more advanced systems and improved capabilities. The ICVVA1-30mm, which replaces the older Stryker Dragoon variant, is designed to provide enhanced capabilities, including increased firepower and increased engagement ranges. The integration of the 30mm Medium Caliber Weapon System (MCWS), a key upgrade from its predecessor, is at the heart of these improvements. This new system allows troops to engage targets from greater distances and with greater accuracy and lethality, offering a significant tactical advantage in combat. Such modernization has been going on for several years. In 2022, Oshkosh Defense, a subsidiary of Oshkosh Corporation, delivered the first upgraded Stryker Double-V Hull Infantry Carrier Vehicle (ICVVA1) of the US Army. The delivery was part of a contract for 269 platforms that included 30 mm MCWS. The origins of this upgrade date back to June 2021, when the US Army selected Oshkosh Defense, along with partners Pratt Miller Defense and Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, to integrate the 30mm MCWS on the Stryker ICVVA1 platform. In addition to armament, the ICVVA1-30mm has significant improvements in other critical areas. It is equipped with advanced -day/night- optics, which significantly improves the machine's ability to identify and hit targets in different lighting conditions. The upgraded platform also enhances situational awareness by providing troops with real-time, high-resolution data about their surroundings to improve decision-making in rapidly changing combat scenarios. The machine is built on the state-of-the-art DVHA1 base chassis, which provides numerous performance improvements, including increased power for better mobility and durability in challenging environments. In addition, the upgraded chassis has the large electrical power needed to support the machine's advanced electronics and systems. With 269 such platforms to be delivered under the contract, the ICVVA1-30mm will soon become a cornerstone of the US Army's armored vehicle fleet. The US Army is replacing ICVD Stryker Dragoon 8&#215;8 armored vehicles with more modern combat platforms ICVVA1-30mm.

Why are the occupiers scaring the residents of Kherson region with contaminated water	In particular, the so-called governor of the Kherson region, Volodymyr Saldo, in a comment to Russian propagandists, lied that the Ukrainian authorities were preparing to use chemical and bacteriological weapons to pollute the reservoirs of the Kherson region. At the same time, propagandists present Russia as a -savior-, thanks to which ru-propaganda seeks to strengthen the authority of the Kremlin in the occupied territories. This is not the first time Russians have spread fakes about water pollution in the Kherson region. For example, as early as August, enemy telegram channels were spreading reports about an alleged outbreak of a bacterial infection in Kherson, which threatened residents of Ukrainian-controlled areas. Propagandists claimed that the disease was caused by -pollution of the Dnieper by the bodies of Ukrainian soldiers- and the failure of sewage treatment plants. It was outright nonsense. With similar statements, collaborators and Kremlin proteges in the occupied territories are trying to discredit the Ukrainian government in the eyes of the civilian population. And by accusing Ukraine of preparing to use prohibited types of weapons, the Russians often cover up their own crimes or prepare an information cover for the preparation of provocations. Statements about the possible use of chemical, biological, or bacteriological weapons are intended to cause panic among the population and discredit the Armed Forces . Therefore, you should not believe them.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/05/navishho-okupanty-lyakayut-meshkancziv-hersonshhyny-zarazhenoyu-vodoyu/	2024-10-04T20:41:47-07:00
Jackson, but not Michael: the tank commander told how his crew fired 280 rounds a day	As he says about himself: -I have two and a half years of combat experience, and it all started simply: I came to the military commission, said that I was a volunteer, I wanted a contract. Sent to the 1st tank division. I wanted to get into intelligence, but when they heard that I had a higher education - the Dnipro Metallurgical Academy, the battalion chief literally locked me in the tankers.- He talks sparingly about the beginning of the large-scale invasion: — We fought near Chernigov&#8230; I was a tank gunner. Then near Lysychansk. The most memorable thing was how we as a crew stood in closed positions. And it turned out that we -poured- all day (at the enemy. - Ed.), we had about 10 conveyors per day, which is 280 shots. And it turned out that our batteries died, and we were already working manually, and we could not even move ourselves. Then the crew stood in one position for a week - they fired from there, loaded there, slept there, ate there. In the end, the Russians calculated the landing where the tank was standing and began to -cover-. It was not possible to withdraw independently, so another tank came after Jackson's tank. He tried to pull the car out of the landing, but the cables broke, and the tank stopped right in the middle of a clear field. Jackson, smiling, recalls that situation: — We were ordered to leave the tank, and we ran to the second tank. It's funny to talk about it now, but we ran to that car and we don't know what to do next. And here the drone flies. At that time, we were used to the fact that only our drones flew. Well, we waved our hands at him, and literally in a minute or two after us, the 120-mm mortar started working. That's where it became ridiculous. Then the two crews simply jumped into the tower and drove away. They settled down miraculously - one gunner in his place, I climbed under his feet, into the conveyor of the loading mechanism, the tank commander was next to me, the mechanic sat in the commander's place, and the tank commander remained outside, and drove from above, because there was no other way. Arta is hiding, the tank is humming, we are going&#8230; So they ran away. That same evening we returned and collected our tank. After those battles, Jackson was offered a new position - a tank commander, and he went to training. When asked what has changed with the new position, he thinks a little, then calmly says: - Now there is more responsibility, I would say. Because, as a gunner, I was responsible for the cannon, for hitting the target. And now I have to completely lead the crew, know the duties of all members, when necessary, help them, give them hints. Currently, the responsibility is much higher. Currently, there are two young soldiers in his crew, and while there is time, they are undergoing adjustment. Everyone understands that there are new battles ahead, so they are studying hard.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/05/dzhekson-ale-ne-majkl-komandyr-tanka-rozpoviv-yak-jogo-ekipazh-robyv-po-280-postriliv-za-den/	2024-10-04T20:30:49-07:00

More than 400 -evaders- and 13 people on the -scheme -disabled--: a criminal group for avoiding mobi...	Details of the exposure and announcement of suspicion in the high-profile case of the organization of a scheme to evade mobilization in Kharkiv were reported in Kharkiv Oblast Prosecutor's Office and Security Service of Ukraine. The head of one of the inter-district medical and social expert commissions of the Kharkiv region is involved in the organization of a corruption scheme to evade mobilization. Together with his 12 accomplices, he organized a scheme to evade mobilization. Among the organizer's -assistants- were his subordinates, heads of various medical institutions in Kharkiv and the region, as well as other civilian mediators. One of the figures, in addition to holding the position of director of the primary health care center, is a deputy of the city council in Kharkiv Oblast. Group members used personal connections to find potential clients. For money, the dealers helped evaders avoid the draft on the basis of fake disability certificates. The impersonators made false documents about the alleged presence of diseases, which are the basis for registration of disability. To do this, they falsified all the medical documentation from the history of their client's -disease-, including his stay in inpatient treatment. Then the event organizer ensured the preparation of a fictitious decision of the medical and social expert commission on the appointment of a disability group. -Clients- did not even come to a medical institution, and all the necessary documentation about -disability- was received by mail or through intermediaries. This allowed men to deregister from the military register and go abroad. According to the preliminary estimates of the law enforcement officers, as a result of the illegal actions of the members of this criminal group, more than 400 people of draft age from different regions of Ukraine were able to illegally avoid mobilization. The cost of such -services- ranged from $2,000 to $5,000. The amount depended on the urgency of the -order-. Law enforcement officers conducted 89 searches at the places of work and residences of members of the criminal group and in their cars. During the investigation, a large number of conscript files, draft records, mobile phones, computer equipment with evidence of illegal activity, money in the amount of more than half a million US dollars, almost 80 thousand euros, more than 1 million UAH and even Russian rubles, which , probably obtained by criminal means. The law enforcement officers detained the dealers, they are in custody. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in Khmelnytskyi, an official was detained who earned $6 million from swindlers. ArmyInform reminds that it is better not to violate the law, but to use the aggregator of vacancies in the Armed Forces or recruiting centers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/04/ponad-400-uhylyancziv-i-13-osib-na-shemu-invalida-u-harkovi-vykryly-zlochynnu-grupu-z-unyknennya-mobilizacziyi/	2024-10-04T10:53:18-07:00

A military serviceman reported corruption: for the first time in the history of Ukraine, the whistle...	This was reported by at NAZK. The payment was made in accordance with the decision of the Appeals Chamber of the Higher Anti-Corruption Court dated November 9, 2023 in case No. 991/2197/22. In 2020-2021, the military serviceman held the position of director of the internal audit department of the Ministry of Defense. In 2021, he filed a statement with the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU), in which he reported that he had been offered an illegal benefit of UAH 24 million for acting in the interests of a certain LLC. It was about attracting specialists to conduct an unscheduled internal audit of the execution of a state contract. The audit group had to draw up a positive report based on the audit results regarding the completeness, quality and compliance of the performed works with the terms of the contract. This would allow the company to receive full payment of more than UAH 400 million for the arrangement of the special facility and claim future contracts from the Ministry of Defense (Part 3 of Article 369 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine). Based on this fact, NABU registered a criminal proceeding under Part 3 of Art. 369 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine. The specialized anti-corruption prosecutor's office (SAP) carried out procedural management and maintenance of the prosecution in court. The Supreme Anti-Corruption Court (SCAC) issued a verdict in the case on March 24, 2023, appointing the defendant &#8211; the former deputy head of one of the departments of the Ministry of Defense was sentenced to 4.5 years in prison. At the same time, the court refused to pay the reward to the whistleblower, motivating the decision by the fact that he officially reported the discovered crime within the scope of the exercise of his official powers and therefore has no right to a reward. The whistleblower appealed the said decision and at the end of 2023, the Appeals Chamber of the VAKS satisfied his appeal and awarded the payment. According to Art. 53-7 of the Law of Ukraine -On the Prevention of Corruption-, the whistleblower can receive 10% of the amount of the monetary amount of the subject of the corruption crime or the amount of damages caused to the state from the crime after the court's conviction. However, the amount of the reward cannot exceed three thousand minimum wages established at the time of the crime. The possibility of rewarding corruption whistleblowers was introduced back in 2019. Until now, the courts have passed two positive decisions on payments, but due to the lack of regulated payment procedures, the actual execution of court decisions was impossible for a long time.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/04/vijskovosluzhbovecz-povidomyv-pro-korupcziyu-vpershe-v-istoriyi-ukrayiny-vykryvach-otrymav-vynagorodu/	2024-10-04T10:28:51-07:00

Among the main problems are failure to provide access to original documents, delays in providing information, and incomplete responses to requests, which makes it difficult to conduct a full audit. This is the first attempt by the Ministry of Defense to verify the activities of -Spetstechnoexport- in the last two years, since the transfer of the enterprise in 2022 from -Ukroboronprom- to the sphere of the Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense. The audit is currently ongoing, and a final assessment of the company's performance will be available after its completion. As part of further reforms of the Ministry of Defense, it is planned to liquidate special importer companies with the transfer of their functions to the Defense Procurement Agency in order to avoid duplication of functions and increase the efficiency of defense processes.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/04/specztehnoeksport-peredaly-pid-upravlinnya-minoborony-iniczijovano-audyt-diyalnosti-kompaniyi/	2024-10-04T08:11:23-07:00

The Ministry of Defense told how the introduction of standards allows producing weapons cheaper and ...	- How do the standards affect the production of OBT? - All the material values ​​of the modern world are made according to the standards. The more complex the technique, the more standards are applied to it. Thousands of standards are applied to the smartphone. A car consists of a million small parts and all of them are manufactured, tested and tested according to standards. Armaments and military equipment are no exception. The development of new technologies stimulates the change of standards and vice versa. This is an inextricable circle, that is, it is appropriate to recall Deming's PDCA cycle here - Plan (Plan), Do (Do), Check (Check), Influence (Act) - which is described in the international standards of the ISO 9000 series. By the way, these standards are the basis NATO quality standards AQAP series and European standards EN 9100 series. International standardization bodies consider standards to be the most effective method of innovation. - How do standards affect the quality of products or services? - Modern standards are the basis and guarantor of quality. Equipment manufactured and tested in accordance with standards is a priori of high quality. The development of technology stimulates the renewal of standards and vice versa. In the world, this process has acquired a frantic rhythm. Some standards are updated almost every year. Countries that invest resources in standardization are today leaders in world markets, including OBT. Because their products are of high quality and are in demand. — How do standards affect the scaling of production? — Standardization became an effective tool for introducing and scaling innovations as early as World War II. In preparation for the war, Nazi Germany rationalized its industry by completing five tasks: general typification, numbering, unification of products, improvement of technology, rational choice of enterprise size. This led to a 20-fold increase in aircraft production alone from 1933 to 1939. A key factor was the standardization of aircraft engines and airframes. Great Britain and the United States had similar approaches. At the beginning of World War II, more than 6,000 standards were in force in the USSR. Over 2,000 new standards have been implemented over 5 years and over 1,000 have undergone changes. This was due to wartime conditions, the need to save resources, the change of scarce materials to non-scarce ones, the introduction of new technologies and production methods. The best start to scaling any production is to develop a standard that manufacturers can implement. — What priorities does Ukraine have for the standardization of air defense systems? — The military standardization body is the Main Department of Technical Evaluation and Quality Control of Air Defense Forces. The activities of the General Directorate are aimed specifically at solving problems related to the quality of air defense systems, scaling their production, development standards, the introduction of NATO standards and standards in the field of defense of the member states of the Alliance. In 2023, we identified work priorities. This is the development of general technical requirements for OVT products and their components. Compliance with these requirements will ensure the unification, compatibility and interchangeability of OBT products, will create prerequisites for the rapid introduction of innovations and scaling of production. This will significantly strengthen the domestic defense industry and the defense capability of the country. On September 12, standardization specialists held a seminar on the problems of developing standards for a comprehensive system of general technical requirements for OMT. Representatives of 5 research institutions and more than 30 representative offices of the customer took part in it. Discussed problems, prepared proposals for interaction with developers and acceleration of standards development.

The Armed Forces stopped 132 assaults: the situation remains tense in two directions	This is reported by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The situation in the Pokrovsky and Kurakhiv directions remains tense - the enemy is concentrating the main offensive efforts there. In addition, today the occupiers are actively attacking in the Lyman direction. The terrorist state launched three missile strikes with three missiles, 48 ​​airstrikes, dropping 97 anti-aircraft missiles. The invaders also used 788 kamikaze drones for strikes and fired more than 3,000 shots at the positions of our troops and populated areas. In the Kharkiv direction Russian terrorists three times unsuccessfully stormed the positions of our units in the Vovchansk and Starytsia districts, and also dropped ten aerial bombs on Cherkassk Lozova, Starytsia and Bochkovo. In this direction, 110 occupants were killed, one tank, seven artillery systems, 11 vehicles, 33 UAV and four units of special equipment. Eleven times the enemy attacked our positions in the Kupyan direction. In the vicinity of Sinkivka, Kurylivka, Pischany, and Pershotravnevo, units of the Defense Forces repulsed nine assaults. Clashes continue in the Vyshnevoi and Petropavlivka districts. On the Lymanskyi direction today, Russian troops attacked Ukrainian defenders 13 times in the areas of Makiivka, Novosadove, Torske, Druzhelyubivka, Grekivka and Dronivka settlements. The enemy once tried to dislodge our defenders from their positions in the Spirn region in the Seversky direction by assault. Having received a severe rebuff, he left. In the Kramatorsk direction Ukrainian soldiers repelled six attempts by the invaders to advance. The enemy concentrated its efforts in the Andriyivka, Bila Hora and Stupochky areas. In addition, with the support of bomber aircraft, the enemy attacked Chasiv Yar. Toretsk, Dachne and Nelipivka were attacked nine times in the Toretsk direction, in addition, the aggressor's aircraft bombarded the areas of Katerynivka, Druzhba and Kleban-Bik settlements. The main efforts of the enemy continue to be concentrated in the Pokrovsky direction, here, during this day, the aggressor attacked our positions 28 times in the areas of Sukhoi Balka, Hirnyk, Promeny, Novotoretsky and Krutoy Yar. In this direction, the occupiers lost 288 soldiers killed and wounded. One tank, two BBMs, seven vehicles, two BM-21 -Grad- anti-aircraft guns, one reconnaissance UAV and one artillery system were destroyed. Also, the Ukrainian defenders caused significant damage to two artillery systems, two cars, five armored vehicles and one tank. In the Kurakhiv direction the invaders are also quite active - at this time of the day, 23 enemy attacks were recorded attacks Two of them are ongoing. The main battle continued in the districts of Novooleksandrivka, Tsukuryny, Georgiyivka, Kostyantynivka, Trudovoy, Vozdvizhenka, Antonivka, and Katerynivka. Four times today the enemy stormed the front edge of our defense in the direction of Maksimivka and Bogoyavlenka in the Vremivsk direction. In the Orichivsk directiontwo attacks by Russian invaders near Kamianskyi and Novodanilivka were stopped. The Defense Forces of Ukraine continue the operation in the Kursk direction, where the enemy carried out six airstrikes, using 13 guided air bombs. Soldiers of the 110th Separate Territorial Defense Brigade, the 68th Separate Yeger Brigade named after Oleksa Dovbush, the 57th Separate Motorized Infantry Brigade named after Koshoy Ataman Kostya Gordienko, and the 425th Separate Assault Battalion confidently held lines and cause significant losses to the enemy. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the 414th battalion of unmanned aerial systems -Birds of Magyar- -na-terytoriyi-rf/->summarized the results of their work in the Kursk region.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/04/zsu-zupynyly-132-shturmy-na-dvoh-napryamkah-sytuacziya-zalyshayetsya-napruzhenoyu/	2024-10-03T21:11:07-07:00
Guided air bombs of the Russian Federation: an expert told how to fight them	— The most vexing problem that currently exists on the battle line, despite the large artillery shafts, FPV drones, is the use of rocket-guided aerial bombs. Why are they so painful? Because the bomb itself cannot be shot down. So far, such technologies have not been invented. Is it possible in the future, yes, if a countermeasure is developed. the Russians use two main calibers of KABs: FAP-250, FAP-500. For example, FAP-500 are high-explosive aerial bombs weighing 500 kg. Explosives - up to 200 kg. That's a lot. The length is up to 4 meters. Bombs are equipped with universal planning and flight correction modules. The main carrier is the Su-34 fighter-bomber. Can take on board up to six such bombs. Su-34s can launch these bombs without entering the zone of action of Ukrainian air defense, that is, they can strike from a distance of 40-50 km from the contact line. Now there are already examples of launching KABs even from 70 km. Of course, we are not even talking about the accuracy of hitting targets. The lack of accuracy of the rifle is compensated by the high power of these ammunition. Let's model the situation conditionally. The carrier aircraft accelerates to 900 kilometers. Accordingly, the bomb has an even greater inertial velocity. And at this gigantic speed, a 500 kg aerial bomb reaches its target and causes colossal devastating losses. the Russians managed to improve the glider module itself, its aerodynamic qualities and improve aiming. There is even a version of the aerial bomb with GPS navigation. the Rashists are destroying Ukrainian -bulwarks- with KABs and destroying all buildings where defense can be maintained. Such tactics allow the so-called large infantry shafts of the Russian infantry to advance in Donbas. It is necessary to destroy the Russian military airfields where the Sukhoi Su-34 fighter-bombers are based, Petro Chernyk believes. Long-range cruise missiles such as the AGM-158 JASSM can do this. It is an American high-precision air-to-surface cruise missile. There are already modifications of these missiles with a range of 900 km. The second option is to hit the Su-34 and airfields of the Russian Federation with drones. — Again, the network of airfields in the Russian Federation is quite large. It is very difficult to destroy it all at once. Another very interesting option is how the Defense Forces counter the KABs. The F-16 can carry up to 6 AIM-120 AMRAAM missiles. It is an American air-to-air guided missile. Can destroy air targets at a distance of up to 180 km. Let's simulate the situation. The Su-34 of the Russian Federation must approach the point of the strike mission, the standard operating distance to the targets is approximately 40-50 km. F-16, accordingly, covers this distance with a missile, the operational range of which is up to 180 km. And then it's a matter of technique and skill of the pilot - our plane shoots down the KAB carrier - Su-34. — The Su-34 aircraft can still evade one or two missiles, because it is equipped with a number of technological devices: heat traps, including lasers and aerosols that -blind- the missile warhead. But if 2-3 missiles went in the direction of the Su-34, then it is doomed. So far, there is no confirmed information that this particular type of missile was provided to us by the Americans as part of the military-technical assistance. F-16s were already operating in Russian cruise missile interceptor mode. And it is likely that AIM-9 Sidewinder short-range air-to-air missiles are already in use. They were provided to us, but the range of these missiles is 20 km. Of course, they can be used to shoot down cruise missiles and -shahedis-. It must be understood that our F-16s will not enter the range of Russian S-300, S-400 air defense systems and enemy Su-30 and Su-35 fighters in order to get the KAB carriers. This is absurd. Do not forget, the Rashists have long-range R-37 air-to-air missiles. According to open data, it is considered to be an aircraft missile with one of the largest range characteristics. But there is a nuance. Its use requires targeting by an A-50 long-range radar detection and control aircraft. The Russians still have R-27 missiles, as well as R-73, R-74 short-range missiles. I emphasize that as soon as AIM-120 AMRAAM missiles appear, it will definitely be a powerful and serious weapon against Su-34 aircraft as carriers of air defense systems.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/04/kerovani-aviabomby-rf-ekspert-povidomyv-yak-z-nymy-borotysya/	2024-10-03T21:00:46-07:00
Hezbollah learns forgery in the Russian Federation: footage from the war in Ukraine was borrowed fro...	In particular, Middle Eastern propagandists, who learned forgery from Russian methods, are spreading a video of the destruction of an alleged Israeli tank by Hezbollah. In fact, this is a fragment of a video from a drone about how the Ukrainian anti-tank unit 66 OMBr destroyed the Russian T-90 Proryv battle tank, famous in enemy propaganda, near Liman in Donbas. This video was shared on Twitter by the information agency ArmiyaInform on October 8 last year. The fake was detected by French OSINT channel Random Debunk. OSINT (Open source intelligence) is open source intelligence that gathers military, political, economic and other information from the Internet. Often, OSINT analysts find operational information by conducting social media monitoring, radio monitoring, and using publicly available Earth remote sensing data (such as Google Earth). In particular, on the night of February 24, 2022, just before the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, OSINT researchers from the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in Monterey, using Google Maps, tracked a large traffic jam on a road in Russia leading to the Ukrainian border. An hour after this information was made public, Russian troops began an invasion.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/04/hezbolla-vchytsya-u-rf-fejkorobstvu-kadry-z-vijny-v-ukrayini-zapozychyla-v-armiyainform/	2024-10-03T20:49:39-07:00
Armored car -Buran- ASV: the expert told about the enemy BBM, which was captured by the ZSU	According to the Ukrainian military, the -trophied- Russian car was relatively new and, as one of the soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said, -in the middle of the armored car there was a rather familiar smell, like in the Zhiguli-. Taking into account the fact that this BBM is quite rare, the ArmyInform reporter asked Andrii Haruk, a well-known weapons researcher, doctor of historical sciences, professor of the Department of Humanities at the National Academy of Land Forces named after Hetman Petro Sahaidachny, about it. — I will note right away that -Buran- is not formally a military armored car. It was created as a private initiative and was supplied to a wide variety of consumers, from the Belgorod region's energy companies to the Moscow metro (why does the metro have its own armored car, don't ask, I don't understand). - So who was the creator of this car? - I will start with the fact that -Buran- was created by the RIDA company from Nizhny Novgorod. Previously, this firm was known as -Nizhny Novgorod Aviation Society-, but relations with aviation did not work out, so the company switched to more down-to-earth matters. - Did you manage to find out the specifics of the creation and functioning of this armored car? - The design of the -Burana- is based on two main principles - the use of a ready-made chassis and modularity. It was based on the GAZ-3308 -Sadko- truck, which was positioned as a replacement for the GAZ-66, but never gained much popularity. The armored car is equipped with a diesel engine of the YaMZ-534 series, one of which (with a power of 136 hp) is also installed on a truck. But on the -Buran- they used the YaMZ-53442 variant with a capacity of 210 hp. Gearbox - at the request of the customer, mechanical or automatic. The armoring is declared according to level 2 of STANAG 4569 - that is, it withstands the impact of a 7.62x39 mm armor-piercing bullet from a distance of 30 m. - And what, exactly, is the modularity of the -Burana- chosen by the Russians? - The basis is the -Buran- SS platform (Chassis Cab - -chassis and cab-) with a single-row two-door cab. One of the modules can be installed on this platform, which gives options: &nbsp; —One gets the impression that with this vehicle and its variants, the Russians once again tried to -catch up and overtake America-, because the modularity of combat armored vehicles has been used in the USA for more than a decade. By the way, how long has this BBM been produced in Russia? And is it only in the Russian Federation? - I would like to note that the first samples of -Burans- appeared in 2017. Since 2019, the car has been produced under license in Belarus under the name -Asilak- - with a less powerful (150 hp) YamZ-53444 engine, and since 2021 - in Armenia as -Lusan-. In both cases, the volume of production is probably small and hardly exceeds half a hundred copies. - At first glance at this car, it can be confused with other armored vehicles of the invaders, right? frame chassis In my opinion, the disadvantages of a frame structure for an armored car are an increase in the weight of the car and its height. In addition, -Tiger- is superior to -Buran- in terms of passability and security. Well, as a -civilian- machine, it doesn't even have turrets for armament. - How could this BBM attract the enemy army? - The Buran did not arouse interest in the Russian military. Instead, a certain number of such armored vehicles in the ARS6 variant (or perhaps a single copy at all) was purchased for the Kadyrov 141 special motorized regiment. In its composition, -Buran- -lit up- at the beginning of April 2022 in the battles for Mariupol, but after that it did not appear anywhere. In 2022, machines in the ASV variant were purchased for energy workers of the Belgorod region. Probably, it was one of them that became the Ukrainian trophy - especially since the camouflage is similar. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/04/broneavtomobil-buran-asv-ekspert-rozpoviv-pro-vorozhu-bbm-yaku-zahopyly-zsu/	2024-10-03T20:41:21-07:00
Only old men go to battle, or What do Dutch F-16s have in common, Sergey Zhadan and the Terminator	She also stirred up Russian propagandists, who ->already bombarding from the fact that the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine will receive another batch of legendary aircraft. Speaking of the Dutch F-16s, the Russians are trying to manipulate official statistics, talking about the seemingly extraordinarily high number of accidents experienced by these aircraft in the Royal Netherlands Air Force. What is wrong with the Russians' fiction about the F-16, explains ArmyInform. , which the enemy propagandists are trying to promote, the F-16 Fighting Falcon is as if it is an outdated aircraft that cannot be effective in Ukraine when repelling Russian aggression. At the same time, attention is paid not only to the year of creation and adoption of fighters, but also to the time of production of specific machines. The history of the combat aircraft from the moment of its first flight really more than half a century. The -Fighting Falcons- were in service with the Royal Netherlands Air Force for as many as 45 years - the first fighter from the F-16s purchased by Holland arrived at the Leeuwarden air base on June 6, 1979. In total, during the operation of the aircraft, the Royal Netherlands Air Force received 213 F-16 fighters of various modifications (177 F-16A, 36 F-16B), which were manufactured by the Dutch company Fokker. Deliveries were made between 1979 and 1992, so the -latest- Dutch F-16s entered service in 1992. Does the long stay in the formation indicate the low quality of the aircraft? Not at all. Rather, it is proof of the high quality of tactical and technical characteristics of fighters capable of performing combat tasks equally effectively both in the early 1980s and in the early 2020s. The first combat missions of the Dutch F-16s date back to the 1990s. The Royal Netherlands Air Force then took part in NATO operations in the Balkans: During Operation No-Fly, 18 Dutch F-16 fighters were based at Villafranca Air Base in Italy. On 12 April 1993, they became the first NATO aircraft to enter Bosnian airspace for -combat air patrol-. In the future, the F-16s operated in -swing mode-, simultaneously providing air superiority and support for UN forces on the ground. In particular, on November 21, 1994, almost 40 NATO aircraft, including 4 Dutch F-16s, bombed Udbina Airport in Croatia. 20 Dutch F-16s were involved in combat operations over the territory of Yugoslavia during Operation Allied Force. In one of the air battles, it was the pilot of the Dutch F-16 who shot down the Yugoslav MiG-29 fighter with an AIM-120 missile. The Dutch Fighting Falcons then participated in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan from 2001 to 2014, based first at Manas Air Base in Kyrgyzstan, and later in Kabul, Kandahar and Mazar-e-Sharif. In view of the absence of the enemy in the air, their main task became reconnaissance and strikes on ground targets. In 2011, Dutch F-16s participated in NATO's joint operation -Unified Protector- (Unified Protector) in Libya. And in 2014-2018, they participated in the Inherent Resolve operation against the Islamic State (ISIS) in Iraq and Syria. During all these operations - patrolling the airspace, conducting reconnaissance, conducting air battles, striking ground targets - the Dutch F-16s proved their high combat qualities, and the Dutch pilots demonstrated excellent combat training. Of course, during the long period of active operation of a large number of aircraft, moreover, in the conditions of hostilities, it was not without troubles. In total, Dutch F-16s suffered 44 crashes, in which the Royal Netherlands Air Force lost 15 pilots and 36 aircraft irretrievably lost. However, according to official figures from the Ministry of Defense of the Netherlands, since the retirement of the last problematic F-16 aircraft on September 21, 2006, things have been going well, and in 18 years the Dutch Fighting Falcons have had no casualties. At the same time, at least more than 60 combat vehicles were in service and in active use. In the Netherlands itself, pairs of F-16s patrolled the airspace of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg and monitored hydraulic structures, using special equipment to detect possible defects and weakening dams. A total of 61 F-16 fighters were in service with the Royal Netherlands Air Force as of 2021. All of them underwent regular technical inspections, repairs and modernization. Given the many decades of operating experience and the local production base, they are particularly high-quality. Obviously, today, the basic configuration of the Dutch F-16 can be considered Block 15OCU with updated navigation systems and ALQ-131 Block-2 EW modules, guidance of high-precision Lantirn weapons. They are quite capable of using the full range of major weapons, including AIM-120 and JDAAM missiles, as well as AGM-154 JSOW high-precision, medium-range guided bombs, etc. So, if the Dutch F-16s can be considered old in terms of age, they are by no means outdated or inferior. In their 50s, they are similar to 50-year-old Serhiy Zhadan, who joined the ranks of the Defense Forces of Ukraine and can give a head start to fighters younger than him. The famous Terminator meme saying -Old, but not obsolete- fits perfectly with them. The model has been in service for many years, but has not lost its relevance and is able to effectively perform combat tasks. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that the new US aid package to Ukraine includes Joint Standoff Weapon's cruise bombs.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/04/u-bij-idut-lyshe-staryky-abo-shho-spilnogo-v-niderlandskyh-f-16-sergiya-zhadana-ta-terminatora/	2024-10-03T20:30:25-07:00

Each task of a sapper is associated with a risk to life, since you have to work in close proximity to the enemy. The key in this field is maximum concentration and composure. It requires physical training and a high level of self-control. -Thanks to their work, the enemy stops and suffers huge losses on the battlefield. And our brigade can fulfill its main task — to win and protect the lands from the invaders!-, the brigade commented on the video.

Switzerland will provide funds for demining Ukraine	About this during the meeting agreed Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Reconstruction of Ukraine Oleksiy Kuleba and Ambassador of Switzerland to Ukraine Felix Baumann. Felix Baumann noted that while in the position of ambassador, he visited the regions several times, which gives him the opportunity to independently assess the needs of Ukraine. He also emphasized that Switzerland has been implementing support programs for our country for a long time. These are issues of decentralization and recovery programs, as well as joint projects with Ukrzaliznytsia and assistance in preparation for the heating season. Currently, the Swiss government offers additional aid programs to Ukraine. -Another important focus of our cooperation remains the Early Recovery projects, within the framework of which the Swiss government plans to allocate 1.5 billion Swiss francs for reconstruction projects in Ukraine for the next 4 years,- the ambassador said. Of these, 1 billion will be directed, as before, to the self-government, demining and humanitarian aid sectors. The rest of the amount will be directed to recovery programs with the involvement of the Swiss private sector. -To emphasize the seriousness of our intentions, our representative will work here, who will be responsible for the implementation of this project. Right now, a delegation of the private sector is working in Kyiv, which is familiar with the needs of Ukraine in the areas for which the ministry is responsible, in the medium and long term,- said Felix Baumann.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/03/shvejczariya-nadast-koshty-na-rozminuvannya-ukrayiny/	2024-10-03T11:44:02-07:00

After Ugledar: where did the enemy aim next as long as the weather is dry	This was suggested by the officer of the 4th separate detachment of the Omega Special Operations Center on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- of the National Guard of Ukraine with the call sign -Docent-. - Ugledar stopped the enemy, there was a huge number of enemy personnel, he was partially destroyed, but still the power of the enemy remained and now the next target of the enemy will be the city of Selidove itself and its surroundings close to Pokrovsk. These are their primary tasks, he said. The officer explained the tactics of the Russian occupiers and suggested how they would try to advance. — They are trying to bypass populated areas, go through landings, somehow wedge themselves into our defenses, where there is a certain weaker resistance. That is, they are trying to pass our positions from all sides. Most likely, they will act from the side of Selidovoy, because there is almost a direct road to Pokrovsk, - said the soldier. He reported that the enemy is pulling up previously accumulated reserves and concentrating most of its forces in the specified direction. -It is observed that the enemy has equipment, there is infantry capable of carrying out assaults on our positions in the future,- said the guardsman. The change of season prompts the occupiers to take more active actions, as natural autumn will soon come and dirt roads may become impassable after the rains. — While the intermediate roads, the roads in the fields between plantings, are still stable. There was no significant precipitation. The enemy is trying to move close to our positions with both wheeled and tracked vehicles. That is, he is taking advantage of this weather now and wants to go on roads with a harder surface in the future, - said the soldier. The officer reported that the occupiers have an advantage in artillery and they have enough ammunition. And although the accuracy of Russian artillerymen is not high, the density of enemy fire creates serious problems for Ukrainian soldiers. -Unfortunately, the enemy has an advantage in artillery, the enemy's projectiles, such an impression has not ended recently, it still inflicts fire damage. The enemy's shots, as a rule, do not hit the target, but the enemy's artillery still has an advantage, - reported -Docent-. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that ZSU left Vugledar due to the threat of the environment: the enemy has activated reserves, but the defenders of Ugledar are already burning the equipment of the occupiers in new positions.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/03/pislya-vugledaru-kudy-naczilyvsya-vorog-dali-doky-stoyatyme-suha-pogoda/	2024-10-03T10:42:01-07:00

The president is counting on progress with partners in the joint shooting down of Russian missiles a...	He said this in his evening address. The head of state noted that today in Kyiv <a href=-https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/03/mark-ryutte-nazvav-pidtrymku-ukrayiny-svoyim-priorytetom-na-posadi-genseka-nato The first visit was made by the new head of NATO, Mark Rutte, and this is his landmark visit to Ukraine, immediately after acquiring the powers of the Secretary General of the Alliance. And the main thing now is to really fill such a priority with solutions. -It is clear how important it is to fully implement each of our agreements with our defense support partners. Timeliness in support is stability at the front. The front must be strengthened. And long range must finally be provided exactly as it is needed to end this war. Everyone in the Alliance understands what the needs are,- said the President. Volodymyr Zelenskyy added that anti-aircraft defense for Ukraine is no less important before winter, and also real progress for the joint shooting down of Russian missiles and drones. -We see that one of the main reasons for the lack of security in the skies of Ukraine, and in particular near the borders of NATO — our neighbors — is the lack of decisions on joint work and joint defense. What works in the skies of the Middle East and helps the defense of Israel can also work in the skies of our part of Europe — in Ukraine, helping to save lives in the same way. There are special technical solutions, there are quite effective tactics. Today, we talked about this in particular with Mark Rutte, we will continue to convince all partners that we need to implement what is needed for effective protection of the sky,- said the President.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/03/prezydent-rozrahovuye-na-progres-z-partneramy-u-spilnomu-zbytti-rosijskyh-raket-i-droniv/	2024-10-03T10:24:37-07:00

Family-style espionage — a brother and sister from Kharkiv got 15 years	The Security Service of Ukraine reported this on October 3. They turned out to be two local residents, a brother and a sister, who were remotely recruited in 2023 by a staff member of the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces (better known as Gru). According to his instructions, the agents monitored the routes and schedule of the railway echelons of the Defense Forces. The perpetrators paid special attention to the places of temporary stops and unloading of military equipment and ammunition. The enemy planned to use the intelligence information to prepare airstrikes against the strategically important infrastructure of Ukrzaliznytsia, as well as to plan sabotage. SBU employees exposed both agents in advance and, after documenting their crimes, arrested them in March of this year. According to the investigation, the traitors came to the attention of the occupiers because of their anti-Ukrainian posts on pro-Kremlin channels. During the investigation, it was established that the perpetrators also collected information about the bases of Ukrainian troops in the Balaklia and Izyum districts. During the search, mobile phones and computer equipment with evidence of correspondence with the Russian special services were seized from the detainees. On the basis of the evidence collected by the investigators of the Security Service, the court found both perpetrators guilty under Part 2 of Art. 28, Part 2 of Art. 111 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (treason committed by a group of persons under martial law according to a prior conspiracy). As reported by ArmyInform, the Security Service detained a 23-year-old contract worker of one of the military units of Ukraine, who in May of this year voluntarily left his place of service and corrected Russian airstrikes in the Vinnytsia and Sumy regions. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/03/shpygunstvo-po-simejnomu-brat-ta-sestra-z-harkova-otrymaly-15-rokiv/	2024-10-03T09:41:38-07:00
CPD: the Russians are spreading false claims about the attack on the Kursk NPP	reported this by the head of the Countering Disinformation Center, officer of the Defense Forces of Ukraine Andriy Kovalenko. According to him, the Russian claims about the alleged attack on the nuclear power plant by four HIMARS missiles, all of which were intercepted by the Russian air defense system, are an outright lie. -Of course, since no one attacked the NPP, there is no point in this. the Russians show some kind of fire in a chicken coop and on the video there is an explosion on the ground. What is the purpose of shelling the nuclear power plant? She is far away. There is nothing to do with the attack on the Kursk NPP,- said the head of the CPD. As ArmiyaInform reported, recently pro-Kremlin Telegram channels distributed a fake memo from the Embassy of Great Britain in Ukraine, in which Britons are advised to avoid contact with TCC and SP employees, not to maintain eye contact with them, not to respond to racist statements on their part and not to sign no documents.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/03/czpd-rosiyany-poshyryuyut-nepravdyvi-zayavy-pro-ataku-na-kursku-aes/	2024-10-03T09:36:20-07:00

About this informs October 3 State Border Service of Ukraine. -The quest for illegally crossing the border for a resident of Kirovohrad Oblast has ended in Rivne Oblast,- the report says. Seeing the Ukrainian servicemen, the man started shouting at them in Polish. The border guard immediately detained the unknown person. The violator turned out to be a 53-year-old native of Kirovohrad Oblast. He tried to enter Poland illegally, but got lost and ended up near the Ukrainian-Belarusian border. He explained to the border guards that he was given advice on the route of movement in one of the messengers by an unknown person who allegedly volunteered to help in illegally crossing the border. Having set off, the man followed the route indicated by the stranger. -Since I planned to get to Poland quickly, I decided not to take extra things with me, I didn't even grab water. However, something went wrong during the illegal trip, he got lost and walked through forests and swamps for almost a day,- the DPSU reported. But instead of going to the border with Poland, he ended up near the border with Belarus. -I thought that the forest here was the same as ours in the Kirovohrad region, more pine, but it turned out that there is a swamp, a swamp, grass up to the chest, an impassable -jungle-. There are no people anywhere. I heard dogs barking, chickens clucking and realized that there must be people somewhere. I had no idea where I was. Then I decided that I had enough of these adventures, I would make my way to people. I came across a pond, from which I drank water, because before that I had to collect dew from plants,- said the detainee. An exhausted man ran into Ukrainian border guards. Seeing people in military uniform, he thought they were Polish border guards, so he addressed them in a foreign language. The man was brought to administrative responsibility under Art. 204-1 of the Criminal Procedure Code -Illegal crossing or attempted illegal crossing of the state border of Ukraine.- ArmyInform reminds that it is better not to violate the law, but to use the aggregator of vacancies in the Armed Forces or recruiting centers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/03/hotiv-vtekty-do-polshhi-dobu-blukav-lisom-pyv-rosu-z-roslyn-j-opynyvsya-bilya-kordonu-z-bilorussyu/	2024-10-03T08:11:27-07:00
Jump over mines: the task of the enemy's light vehicles was explained in the Armed Forces	Colonel Vladyslav Voloshyn, the spokesman of the -Khortytsia- military training center, drew attention to this on the broadcast of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon. — The enemy received light buggies from the reserve base of motor transport in the southern district. Quad bikes, motorcycles, light cars are used by the enemy precisely in such assaults, when they are carried out by the forces of small groups of infantry up to a detachment of up to ten people. They use these vehicles to quickly move infantry on the battlefield. This infantry moves quickly from its point of departure to our fortifications, clings to our fortifications there, and continues such assaults in order to gain a foothold. And already after that, other groups approach and capture these trenches, these fortifications, the spokesman said. He explained exactly what the advantages of light high-speed maneuver vehicles are on the battlefield. — There are mine-explosive barriers on the battlefield, they are designed to prevent powerful and heavy equipment from passing through. Light vehicles such as buggies or motorcycles pass through anti-tank mines. That's why they use just such means to overcome this certain distance quickly, - explained the military man. The officer said that the enemy is currently storming in small infantry groups for the purpose of combat reconnaissance, and then move on to more active and massive assaults. - Basically, these are small infantry groups that engage in reconnaissance and search operations. That is, small groups of infantry try to start, to start a battle, to conduct reconnaissance, to identify our fire means, to identify the weak points of our defense, and only then they prepare to conduct assault actions continuously. And now we can say that this is already ongoing reconnaissance and reconnaissance, - said the spokesman of the -Tavria- OUV. At the same time, the occupiers in the South have not decreased their means of attack, they do not feel any shortage of ammunition and are hitting in the direction of the positions of units of the Defense Forces of Ukraine with almost all the weapons available in the Russian army. Earlier, ArmyInform reported, are there signs of Russian preparations for a major offensive in the South.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/03/proskochyty-po-minah-zavdannya-legkyh-transportnyh-zasobiv-voroga-poyasnyly-u-zsu/	2024-10-03T08:01:15-07:00

The General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces announced that the Ukrainian military successfully destroyed the rare and very valuable Nebo-M radar station with the help of ATACAMS ballistic missiles. This Russian radar is a very difficult object to defeat, because it works in stealth mode, scanning the horizon for aerial objects. According to available information, the enemy has only 10 working systems of this type left. The fighters of the 63rd and 60th brigades decided to compete against the Russians on motorcycles. In total, six suicide motorcyclists went to our positions. How many arrived - see in the stream. These and other topics are discussed by our presenters - junior lieutenant Serhii Lipko and lieutenant colonel Serhii Misyura. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/03/potuzhnyj-udar-po-rosijskyh-aerodromah-madyar-palyt-rosiyan-i-tehniku-strim-iz-pryfrontovogo-mista/	2024-10-03T07:32:41-07:00
Enemy KABs on Kharkiv: why are the Russians hitting the city and why are they succeeding in it	Why do the Russians manage to beat Kharkiv Oblast on the air of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon? Vitaly Sarantsev. — The trend of using tactical aviation has grown significantly. Yesterday, 17 strikes were carried out on the border area and, in particular, on Kharkiv, 17 bombs were dropped on border settlements and on the city itself. As a result, more than half a hundred civilian buildings were destroyed, he said. The military officer explained that the enemy is trying to justify such terrorist tactics by deceptively and manipulatively shifting responsibility to the Ukrainian military and the Ukrainian authorities. -Such terrorist tactics of the enemy continue - he tries to justify it on his information resources, presents it as a self-attack, although we all know what and how and from whom it is flying at us and at the civilian population,- said the officer. The activation of the enemy's use of tactical aviation was caused by the loss of the Aggregate Plant in Vovchansk and other defeats widely known in the media. The occupiers are also trying to influence the mood in Ukrainian society in this way. — They actively use them in order to make a little excuse for the loss of the Aggregate Plant. In addition, they constantly try to keep the population in a negative tone, destabilize the situation. By striking KABs against the civilian population and civilian infrastructure, they fuel all this with information as well, that is, they drive a wedge between the army and society, try to discredit the military-political leadership, the spokesman explained. He told what is the main plan of the Russian invaders in this regard. — Their main message is that we are allegedly shelling our own infrastructure, our own cities, our own population in order to create informational noise and thereby cover up the discontent about the loss of Ugledar's defense forces. But here everyone can see it, it's all in plain text. It is written, we understand that it is simply an element of the information war that the enemy is waging against us. Of course, the use of KABs is his terrorist tactic, which he can't give up because he just doesn't know any other way, the officer said. The military also explained why it is so difficult to fight with this type of weapon. — First of all, this is due to the fact that the adversary has retrofitted this type of ammunition, added a universal planning and correction module to it, which allows you to drop these bombs outside the range of our anti-aircraft defenses. He drops them far from the contact line, far from the Russian-Ukrainian border. In fact, he makes these resets after several tens of kilometers, the spokesman said. In view of this, the means of Ukrainian air defense cannot stop these terrorist actions of the military army of the Russian Federation. The enemy takes advantage of this and drops bombs anywhere, as long as they fly in the direction of Ukrainian territory. - KAB is a fairly powerful ammunition, but at the same time it is not accurate, it flies where it wants. Its flight path depends on many factors - weather conditions, humidity and air temperature. That is, there are a lot of things that need to be taken into account so that he more or less accurately reaches his goal. But we understand that all this is not taken into account, that the enemy drops these bombs wherever he wants and hits the civilian population there, explained the spokesman of Kharkiv OTU. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that last day, the Russians again hit the Kharkiv region with anti-aircraft missiles, as a result of which 20 people were injured, including a three-year-old child.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/03/vorozhi-kaby-po-harkovu-navishho-rosiyany-byut-po-mistu-i-chomu-yim-cze-vdayetsya/	2024-10-03T07:21:00-07:00

Away from shelling: local residents are being evacuated from the border of Sumy Oblast	Why this is necessary, on the air of the national marathon -Edyny Novyny- explained the spokesman of the OTU -Siversk- Vadym Mysnyk . — The regional military administration carries out additional emergency evacuation. Currently, we are trying as much as possible to evacuate people from those communities that suffer the most from terrorist shelling from Russia, because the Russians in most cases hit civilian infrastructure, civilian residential buildings, any enterprises, educational and medical institutions. With this tactic, Russia confirms its status as a terrorist state, he said. The spokesman noted that despite the fact that the evacuation has been going on for the second year, there are still local residents who categorically refuse to leave. Therefore, certain categories of the population are forcibly evacuated. — The evacuation process continues for the second year. Unfortunately, there are sections of the population that fundamentally refuse to leave. But we are trying to evacuate the vulnerable categories of children and people with disabilities immediately under mandatory evacuation in a forced manner so that they are not harmed, - the military officer explained. He emphasized that by refusing to evacuate, local civilians are primarily putting their own lives and health at risk, as well as preventing the Ukrainian military from effectively repelling the Russian invaders. — Unfortunately, people remain in some border settlements, and this is a zone of active hostilities. Of course, the civilian population is very vulnerable, first, neglecting their own safety. Secondly, it is not very convenient for the military to conduct hostilities when the civilian population is nearby, - concluded Vadym Mysnyk.

Capital repair program in -lnr-: two years to repair one or two houses per city	According to Artem Lysohor, the head of the Luhansk Regional Military Administration, the list includes 32 settlements. Of these, only five were occupied in 2022, and four settlements remained dilapidated. However, most of these towns and villages did not suffer significant destruction from the hostilities. The pace of recovery raises questions, as in an average of two years, each city will account for only one or two majorly renovated houses. However, the main problem is the lack of contractors willing to participate in the restoration work, which has already become an ongoing problem. As Artyom Lysogor noted, in Seversko-Donetsk contractors leave houses half-restored, replacing windows and doors, but avoiding repairs to important water supply, heat supply and sewage systems. Despite this, the cost of the work is calculated as per the fully executed order, which creates opportunities for corrupt practices. As reported by ArmyInform, from October 1 in the occupied territories of Luhansk region, the autumn conscription has started, which is actually another stage of legalized forced mobilization.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/03/programa-kapremontu-v-lnr-dva-roky-dlya-remontu-odnogo-dvoh-budynkiv-na-misto/	2024-10-03T00:21:09-07:00

According to Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office, the attack was carried out from the settlement of Stroitel in the Belgorod region of the Russian Federation. using two Su-34 aircraft that dropped five guided aerial bombs, tentatively identified as D-30SN UMPB. The speed of the projectiles was about 600 km/h. Three bombs hit the city directly. In the Shevchenkiv district, a hit in an open area was recorded. In the Saltiv district, an aerial bomb hit a five-story residential building. The impact injured 10 people, including a three-year-old child. All victims received injuries of varying degrees of severity. -For such Russian strikes to stop, Ukraine must receive the necessary and, most importantly, sufficient help from the world, from partners. Every leader knows exactly what to do. It is important to be decisive-, reacted to the attack President of Ukraine . In addition, two aviation munitions hit the suburbs of Kharkiv - on the territory of the Dergachyv community. Prosecutors and police investigators are working on the spot to record the war crimes of the Russian army. As reported by ArmyInform, yesterday the Russian troops once again shelled the city of Kramatorsk in the Donetsk region. , hits were recorded in several locations.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/03/aviabomba-vluchyla-u-pyatypoverhivku-v-harkovi-postrazhdalo-10-lyudej-sered-nyh-tryrichna-dytyna/	2024-10-02T21:03:52-07:00
About the return of prisoners, the rights of conscripts and the soft power of Ukraine. ArmyInform in...	About the exchange of prisoners and cooperation with the UN, about the International Committee of the Red Cross and the rights of conscripts and much more, the ArmyInform correspondent asked the Commissioner of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine for human rights, Dmytro Lubinets. Mr. Dmitry, the other day you stated that about 40% of those returned from captivity are persons who had the status of missing under special circumstances and were not confirmed by the ICRC. What is the difficulty of returning such people from captivity? How does this process take place from a legal point of view and what are its difficulties? - Legally, a person is considered to be in captivity after his confirmation by the ICRC through the National Information Bureau. Other sources of information that may testify to the fact that the missing person is in captivity are the testimony of servicemen released from captivity and the identification of a person based on the results of appropriate examinations. In addition, I exchange information with the Russian ombudsman regarding the missing defenders of Ukraine. In this way, it is also sometimes possible to find out the possible stay in captivity of a missing person. Difficulties may arise from the fact that the Russian Federation itself does not know where they are keeping this or that Ukrainian prisoner of war. However, relatives of missing persons should remember that the confirmed status of captivity does not affect the exchange procedure: both confirmed and presumed missing persons are returned. —You have more than once reported on cases when conscripts have conflict situations with the TCC. Does your team monitor these cases on social media themselves or do they contact you? Can you provide any statistics on such requests? Are there statistics on court appeals by conscripts? Whose side does Themis take? — About cases of conflict situations between the TCC and SP and conscripts, I learn from my team through appeals from citizens and from social networks and the media. We receive dozens of requests every week, and as I have already reported, in most cases we do not find violations. However, I would like to emphasize that there are violations in some of the appeals, and we are responding to them. Regarding court statistics, I do not have such statistics. But I note that in the last month there have been positive decisions about canceling the draft of the reserved ones. Also, many resolutions of the TCC on bringing conscripts to administrative responsibility are repealed. — Recently, videos with demonstrative executions of Ukrainian prisoners of war have appeared quite often on the Internet. You report that you will forward these materials to the appropriate authorities. How many such cases have been recorded since February 24, 2022? — In April, the Prosecutor General's Office reported that since March 2022, they had become aware of 54 cases of executions of Ukrainian prisoners of war at the hands of Russian occupiers during an attempt to surrender. We do not have more recent statistics, but more and more often Russian soldiers kill Ukrainian soldiers who surrender themselves as prisoners. This is recorded by both law enforcement agencies and international organizations. In September alone, I responded to executions twice. The Institute for the Study of War published a report on September 6 that also noted this. I believe that this is done, in particular, in order to demoralize Ukrainian society and reduce resistance. However, seeing such actions, we must become even more determined in the fight against the aggressor and bring the perpetrators to justice. - What chance does our country have that war criminals will be brought to justice for war crimes, violations of the Geneva Conventions? - On August 21 of this year, Ukraine finally ratified the Rome Statute, but the problem at the moment is that our criminal legislation not yet harmonized with the European one. Therefore, the process of bringing to responsibility will be quite long. In particular, because the Russians are committing tens of thousands of war crimes in Ukraine, and each crime must be thoroughly investigated. Steps are being taken for this. The Prosecutor General recently reported that Ukrainian law enforcement officers have a joint plan with the International Criminal Court to investigate Russian war crimes in Ukraine. National courts already regularly sentence Russian servicemen for crimes committed in Ukraine. —Are you comfortable working with the ICRC? What is the difficulty of working with this organization? I have repeatedly criticized the International Committee of the Red Cross for not fulfilling its mandate, especially because they do not visit Ukrainian prisoners of war. It is the only organization that has this right. Yes, the Russian Federation really deliberately and publicly violates any norms of international humanitarian law and does not allow the ICRC to the places of detention of Ukrainian prisoners of war. However, the ICRC has been silent all these years about Russia's violation of IHL. It got to the point that recently in Donetsk, Russia killed three full-time employees of the ICRC and wounded two more. These were citizens of Ukraine. Reacting to these cynical murders, the president of the ICRC did not mention Russia in a single word. Instead of condemning it, demanding an explanation from the Russian Federation, they remain silent. This is not neutrality, this is inaction. If the old methods do not work, then it is time to implement new ones, to find ways to fulfill your responsibilities. The ICRC's biggest donors should also understand this, so that the resources provided by them are used effectively. After my constructive criticism, ICRC representatives refuse to join meetings with families of prisoners of war. To our official invitation to the last meeting in Odesa, they replied that they -kindly- and -understandingly- ask to treat this. —What about the UN? Do you not think that the organization has -outlived itself- and is not effective? - It is worth considering that the UN is a very extensive organization with many projects and directions. We have good cooperation with some. For example, with the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine. They record the crimes that the Russian Federation commits in Ukraine and call a spade a spade. So, in their recent report, they called Russian strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure a war crime and potentially a crime against humanity. However, there is also the UN Security Council, where the Russian Federation is still one of its five permanent members. It is one of the main bodies of the UN, which is responsible for maintaining international peace and security. Only the Security Council has the right to make decisions binding on all UN members. The situation, when the Russian Federation is still a member of the Security Council, is absurd, because Russia itself has been brazenly violating international security for the past dozen years, not only in Ukraine, but also in other countries. — International humanitarian law during the war in Ukraine. Does it work? - International humanitarian law works unilaterally. Ukraine adheres to it, but the Russian Federation does not. Ukraine does not prevent, and even encourages international organizations to come and monitor the state of observance of the rights of civilians, Russian prisoners of war. In particular, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine officially appealed to the UN and the ICRC to join humanitarian response measures in the Kursk region. Such visits would also debunk Russian propaganda about Ukraine's alleged non-compliance with IHL. Russia absolutely does not comply with IHL: daily targeted attacks on residential buildings and civilian infrastructure, torture of prisoners of war, forced displacement of children. In the de-occupied territories, the National Police has registered more than 104,000 criminal proceedings for war crimes since the beginning of the full-scale invasion. —How does the new law on mobilization correlate with the rights of people in a state under martial law?—The Constitution of Ukraine clearly defines which rights and freedoms cannot be restricted during martial law. At the same time, all other rights may be limited by Presidential decree. Based on the existing restrictions in the Presidential decree on the introduction of martial law in Ukraine, during the preparation of the law on mobilization, the restrictions were taken into account and applied. Also, recently on my social media pages, I published a series of posts explaining the new legislation on mobilization, which talked about notification of conscription, deferment, verification of military records and liability for non-performance of duties. The procedure for each of these processes is clearly described there. And if your rights are violated, you can contact the Office of the Ombudsman. —How do the mobilization processes in Ukraine correlate with the global experience of mobilization processes?—The Russian-Ukrainian war is the largest war in the world between the regular armies of two states since World War II. Therefore, currently, in modern conditions, no country in the world has faced the same challenges in mobilization issues as Ukraine. We don't know how other countries would handle it. However, the key thing for me is that, in the conditions of martial law, the mobilization processes must take place with respect for the constitutional rights and freedoms of a person and a citizen in Ukraine. - Please name the three main issues veterans come to you with. Can it be resolved quickly? - Protecting the rights of veterans is a priority area of ​​work of the Office of the Ombudsman. Last week, together with our partners, we organized a forum in Vinnytsia, where we discussed issues of veteran policy. Veterans contact me mainly regarding the delay in the process of processing and reviewing documents, the issue of establishing the status of a participant in hostilities, the provision of appropriate medical services, or the violation of their right to receive benefits from loan payments. In some cases, it is possible to renew veterans' rights quickly - one letter from our institution is enough, but it also happens that the process can take a long time. —Name the three main problematic questions that the relatives of the dead and the missing turn to you with. What is the complexity of such appeals? — General problematic questions voiced by relatives of the dead and missing persons during meetings and personal receptions are: Responding to the violation of their rights, I direct relevant requests and letters to the relevant state bodies. We regularly hold meetings both in our institution and in the regions with the families of missing, prisoners of war and fallen servicemen, where we provide answers to their questions. —How do you manage to get children out of the hands of children? What is the most difficult thing about this mechanism? How do you interact with relatives? And if these are orphans, what is the difficulty? How does Qatar fit into this story? Are there other countries that help us in this as a third party? — Thanks to the work of the state bodies of Ukraine, in particular the Office of the Ombudsman, non-governmental organizations and intermediary countries, it has already been possible to return 948 Ukrainian children from the territory of the Russian Federation and the TOT of Ukraine (as on September 25, 2024). Separately, I am grateful to Qatar, because currently the dialogue with the Russian side takes place through the mediation of this country. There are countries that are ready to help privately, so I cannot name them. If the deported children have relatives in Ukraine who want to become their guardians, then of course we cooperate with them. If these are orphans or children deprived of parental care, then the situation is more difficult, even at the level of finding a child, because they are abducted en masse from children's homes in the temporarily occupied territories, after which they can be given for adoption to Russian families with a much higher chance, which, I emphasize, is illegal. Children can change their personal information, making it difficult to find information about their whereabouts. Every child return case is a great achievement. However, there are still nearly 20,000 children who need to be returned. One of the mechanisms for this is the International Coalition for the Return of Ukrainian Children, which has already been joined by 40 countries. Within the boundaries of the coalition, there are projects in which we invite participating countries to join. The main goal of the Coalition is to coordinate mutual efforts and intensify cooperation to solve the problem of illegal deportation and forced relocation of Ukrainian children by Russia. — A delegation of children liberated from the Russian Federation spoke at the UN, met with representatives of foreign countries. How can the results of these meetings be evaluated, did it help foreign partners to understand what challenge Ukraine faced? — Of a direct cause-and-effect relationship between the decisions of our international partners and the fact that they listened to the children's speech, we, of course, cannot install. However, when they see real people in front of them, hear their stories, they begin to understand that behind the numbers in the statistics of deported and forcibly displaced Russian children are real destinies. It is a soft power that I believe is making an impact. - What story related to the rights of native fallen soldiers struck you the most? - Every story of native fallen of our Heroes and Heroines is always a tragedy. Accordingly, every violation of the rights of family members of fallen soldiers affects. After all, support and protection of families who have lost a loved one is the minimum that the state is obliged to provide. We also monitor the right of family members of deceased (deceased) servicemen to receive one-time cash benefits paid to the families of the deceased. An analysis of more than 130 appeals on this issue received by the Ombudsman's Office in 2023 revealed numerous facts of delay or inaction by TCC and SP employees in submitting requests to the military unit to obtain documents, as well as delays from the command of military units in providing documents. - What happy end story from your work would you like to share? - We have a lot of happy end stories: these are the long-awaited meetings of those released from captivity with their relatives, the return of Ukrainian children, the renewal of veterans' rights. I will recall the story of the reunion of a mother-prisoner of war and her son, who had not seen each other for more than two years. During the exchange on May 31, the boy finally met his mother, who had returned home from captivity. The woman was on Azovstal. I would like to note that the boy was brought home by the Office of the Ombudsman from the TOT of Ukraine. Such stories inspire and give even more energy to work. - What would be a victory in the Russian-Ukrainian war for you? - The Ukrainian Peace Formula, which is based on the UN Charter, provides for the restoration of a just peace for Ukraine. This will be a victory, including the restoration of the territorial integrity of Ukraine, the withdrawal of Russian troops and the cessation of hostilities, as well as the release of all prisoners and deported persons. This is the 4th point of the Peace Formula, for which I am responsible as the Ombudsman of Ukraine and work on its implementation every day. Ukraine's victory is actually important not only for us, but also for the entire democratic world. Not everyone is fully aware of the threat posed by the potential loss of Ukraine. This will mean the destruction of world security and a return to the era of empires and colonies, in which no human rights will be discussed at all.

the Russians invented a tourist attraction for foreigners, but they were wrong: what went wrong	Recently, pro-Kremlin Telegram channels circulated an alleged memo from the Embassy of Great Britain in Ukraine, in which Britons are advised to avoid contact with employees of TCC and joint ventures, not to maintain eye contact with them, not to respond to racist statements from them and not to sign any documents. In fact, the brochure, the photos of which are distributed by propagandists, does not exist - it is a poor forgery of the Russian fakers themselves. In comments representatives of the diplomatic service informed Ukrinform journalists that the British Embassy in Ukraine did not print such flyers, and the information on the Internet is fake. In addition, when creating a fake, the Russians made a mistake - they indicated that in Ukraine there is a general mobilization of conscript men from 25 to 65 years old, and not from 25 to 60 years old, as it actually is. So, the purpose of this fake is to discredit TCC and joint ventures in the eyes of foreigners, to sow the false opinion that citizens of other states are also subject to mobilization in Ukraine, and TCC employees can supposedly -mobilize- them just from the street.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/03/rosiyany-vygadaly-pamyatku-dlya-inozemcziv-ale-pomylylys-shho-pishlo-ne-tak/	2024-10-02T20:52:11-07:00

The projectile hit the cleavage: the soldier Jackson told how our tankers knocked out an enemy tank ...	Our correspondent was told by a participant in the battle with the call sign -Jackson- about one of these episodes, which took place among the tankers of the 1st separate Siver tank brigade. That day, the commander of the tank unit set a task: to take a position. If necessary, hold the defense and wait for the approach of light armored infantry. Two -sixty-fours- moved towards the specified position, but in the war, not everything is going as planned. That time, Russian tanks overtook them and had already entered the mentioned position. As tankman Jackson recalls: — The most frightening thing was that no one expected that a Russian -80- would -fly- at us from the right side across the field. She jumped out and immediately fired a shot at the tank of our brothers. The projectile hit the -décolletage-, in front of the mechanic-driver. The second shot of the Russians was at us, but thanks to the mechanic-driver we managed to dodge. He counted to five and yanked the lever. Our tank literally jumped to the side, and we dodged that shot. Since our second tank was hit, the Russian expected that we would roll back, run away. It would be logical. But the crew and I decided to go to the end, press the Russian, and moved forward. And then it turned out to be simple - the Russian rolled out, aiming the cannon at the place where the tank was hit and where, according to his calculations, we should be. But we had already passed him and were behind him. And I just had to aim clearly and shoot. I remember that I wanted to see live and up close how the turret of a Russian tank flew away, but it turned out that I only fired one shot - there was a problem with the loading mechanism. With that single successful shot, -Jackson- managed to hit the engine and transmission compartment and completely destroy the engine of the Russian tank. He stood in the middle of the field. Our tankers waited for the Russian crew to get out, to either take them prisoner or destroy them, but in vain. In the meantime, tankers got out of our knocked out tank. Mehvod, unfortunately, died, the tank commander received burns, and the gunner was stunned. When the tankers were already on the armor, an order was sent over the radio to leave immediately - because they heard from the intercepts that the Russians were already directing artillery, and the tankers, together with their surviving comrades, rolled back. the Russian -eighty- still stood in the middle of the field, a little later another of our tanks simply shot and burned it. Not a single Russian tanker ever got out of the tank.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/03/snaryad-vluchyv-u-dekolte-voyin-dzhekson-rozpoviv-yak-nashi-tankisty-yedynym-postrilom-pidbyly-vorozhyj-tank/	2024-10-02T20:36:34-07:00
Cooperation causes damage: the US Army tested a Finnish mortar	As informs the official portal of the Scandinavian arms manufacturer, field tests took place in the first decade of September within the conference Maneuver Warfighter Conference in Fort Moore, Georgia, USA, ArmyInform reports. A crew of Soldiers demonstrated a variety of successful fire missions using US Patria NEMO 120mm Turreted mortar ammunition. A mortar system integrated into the US Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV) and Fire Direction System (FCD), which has become a key achievement in the US-Finnish joint effort. Since 2020, Patria has been conducting a turret mortar feasibility study, including Foreign Comparison Tests (FCT) with the US Army. This study focuses on Patria NEMO, the world's leading turret-mounted mortar system, renowned for its versatility and effectiveness in a variety of combat scenarios. The Patria NEMO 120mm mortar complex is a remote-controlled turret weapon that can fire both direct and indirect fire, including while moving. One of its key features is the ability to simultaneously hit multiple rounds (MRSI), which allows hitting a target with up to six mines at the same time. In addition to a high level of protection, the NEMO system is designed to be light, compact and adaptable to different platforms: tracked vehicles, wheeled armored vehicles and naval vessels. The Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV) is a tracked military vehicle designed to replace the aging M113 series. The AMPV fulfills a variety of roles on the battlefield, offering enhanced protection, mobility and modularity. It is built on a tracked chassis similar to the Bradley fighting vehicle, which ensures high performance in various terrains and operating conditions. BAE Systems produces the AMPV, which is designed to perform a variety of mission types, including troop transport, logistical support, command operations, and medical support. Its configurations include a general purpose transport variant, a mission control variant for mobile command centers, medical evacuation and treatment vehicles, and a mortar transporter capable of providing indirect fire support. The main advantages of the platform include improved armor protection against small arms, artillery shrapnel and improvised explosive devices, which ensures better protection of personnel. Its high mobility allows it to operate effectively alongside other armored vehicles such as the M1 Abrams and M2 Bradley, making it a vital asset in modern warfare. AMPV's modular design, which allows it to adapt to different requirements on the battlefield, provides important flexibility and a sense of readiness for different combat and support roles. The US Army is looking to expand the capabilities of its Armored and Stryker Brigade Combat Teams by equipping them with rapid and accurate indirect and direct fire capabilities. These efforts are aimed at ensuring reliable protection of work crews, while reducing their physical load and minimizing the impact of impulse noise and blast overpressure. &nbsp; Patria NEMO 120 mm Turreted Mortar System integrated into the US Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV).

About the quarrel with the TCC, the parents of their students in the battalion and the collapse of t...	This time, our correspondents spoke with the deputy commander of one of the battalions of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Oleksandr Panarin. Before serving in the Armed Forces, he taught at a school and university. How does Oleksandr measure the result of the teacher's work? Should the -Defense of Ukraine- school course be changed? But why did the hero of this interview quarrel with the TCC for several days? About it in our article. — Can a person who taught at a university or school apply his skills during military service? — I will tell you more, it was teaching skills that helped me adapt to the army. At first, I was a platoon commander in the unit for a month, but in fact during March 2022 I was engaged in setting up the vital activities of the battalion, because the unit was created from scratch according to the wartime staff. From the second month of service, I was actually assigned to the position of deputy company commander from the MPZ, then company commander, then battalion psychological officer, and now I am the deputy battalion commander. Before the army, my teaching load included pupils, students and even graduate students. And this teaching experience gave me the opportunity to establish normal work with subordinate soldier personnel. In our unit there were people from different social strata, different worldviews, but when they got together, it was necessary to communicate with them in simple words, without any clever constructions. And previous experience helped me in this. — Did I understand correctly that you worked in a school before teaching at a university? — No, at the same time. I had a load of 0.75 in a general secondary school in Kyiv. And one and a half rates of workload at the university. — What tasks did your unit perform at the beginning of the Russian invasion? — The battalion carried out the accumulation of servicemen for the Ground Forces and was responsible for the defense of one of the districts of Kyiv. Already as a company commander, together with my unit, I had an area of ​​responsibility and built defensive structures on the outskirts of the city. — Today society is discussing how to replace and update the school subject -Defense of Ukraine-. What is your vision on this subject? — I even joined the process of reforming -Defense of Ukraine-. I guess I risk being a bit involved: my wife is also an educator and was the moderator, actually, of the working group that developed the new program of the school course -Defense of Ukraine-. My position is, of course, it's all in time. Definitely. It's our big mistake that we didn't do this in 2014. We must understand today that Russia as a geopolitical entity will sooner or later cease to exist in the format in which it exists, that is, the Russian Federation within those huge borders. It will remain what is territorially called ethnic Russia. Because they will separate from it on a national basis, just like in 1917 and 1991, when there were previous disintegrations, in fact, in the form of the empire, in fact, in the form of the Soviet Union. Now will be the next stage. The Russian ethnicity itself will continue to live on the border with Ukraine. And she will continue to hate us, because a priori she will not consider herself to be guilty of not preserving her state, but us for the fact that we destroyed it. In addition to the practical component of this school subject, there is also an ideological one. I have in mind what we demonstrated first in 2014, in February-March, and then in February-March 2022, when the whole society stands up for the protection of the Motherland, for the protection of the state. And in this course at least elementary practical foundations will be laid. So that every graduate of the school knows what a weapon is, what a takmed is, etc. If every Ukrainian has this basic knowledge, then the enemy will think about whether to attack Ukraine. By the way, the enemy is currently copying us. They began to introduce a course where they learn to fly UAVs into their similar subject. They copy what we do. This also shows that the enemy is also watching this: how we raise our children, our future soldiers. Therefore, I am only in favor of these changes in the school curriculum. Children should have an understanding of the old truth: if you want peace, prepare for war. — And how would you rate the generation of your pupils and students in general? — In the first days of the large-scale invasion of those who said, -will anything come of this young generation?-, there were queues to the TCC are less than those about whom they said this. Do you understand? Those who were told that -there will be no people of you-, they just proved that their generation is absolutely normal and cool. Unfortunately, among my former students, who also enlisted in the army, there are already dead people&#8230; When the large-scale invasion began, I wrote on my social media that I was joining the army. Although at first they did not want to hire me as a teacher at TCC. Because he had the right to postponement. And I had to fight with the TCC for several days so that I would still be called up&#8230; And we discussed all this in social networks with my students. Parents of my students even served with me in the unit. Then there were funny moments with them during the service. I am a co-author of school textbooks on history, which are used by Ukrainian children. According to the amount of circulation, at least every third schoolchild in Ukraine studies using textbooks, where I am a co-author. And then in the unit, my parents came up to me and said that they had found a textbook with the same last name as mine. And I answered that yes, I am the author. — How can the result of a teacher's work be measured? — The result is my pupils and students. Perhaps only doctors and teachers can understand this euphoria when, having invested your knowledge and efforts in children, you later see the result. I always tell students that the result of my work is not in the test or exam they take. And when, in a few years after graduating from the university, they, walking down the street, will not go to the other side, but will come up and say hello, this will mean that I have done my job well. We never have an instant result, we all work for the future. Sometimes for a very long time.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/03/pro-svarku-z-tczk-batkiv-svoyih-uchniv-u-bataljoni-ta-rozpad-rf-intervyu-iz-zastupnykom-kombata-oleksandrom-panarinym/	2024-10-02T20:22:59-07:00

Every week, our soldiers ensure a truly tangible defeat of the occupier — Volodymyr Zelenskyi	He said this in his evening address. -First of all, with regard to Donetsk region, with respect to areas where it is particularly difficult now. I thank each of our combat brigades for their true resilience and true courage,- the head of state said. The President emphasized that every week, despite everything, our soldiers ensure a truly tangible defeat of the occupier. -And this is the most important thing — to exhaust the enemy and provide Ukraine with the opportunity to convince its partners of precisely such steps that can fundamentally and strategically change the military situation,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy emphasized. He added that Ukraine very much needs determination from its partners in the long-range issue. -Individually, I want to thank every leader, all friends of Ukraine for understanding that the pressure on Russia is not enough now, and that is why - only why - the Russian leadership does not take diplomacy seriously. We need more strength,- said the President.

At home, the waves also help: the elements destroy the protective structures of the Kerch Bridge	Unprecedented measures of the Russian occupiers to strengthen the security of the illegal extension to the Ukrainian Crimea on the air of the national telethon -Yedini Novyni- commented the spokesman of the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, captain 3rd rank Dmytro Pletenchuk. — The enemy sees that the danger to this object, which they allegedly already protected as much as possible, still exists. And it, as a minimum, is not decreasing. Therefore, they are forced to react somehow. It is probably impossible to push the air defense to infinity, although they are trying. But, nevertheless, seeing the danger of using marine drones in particular, they are trying to block the water area, he said. However, there is nothing new in these actions of the occupiers - they have resorted to them before. The elements also make their corrections. -The weather makes adjustments to the plans of the occupiers, and periodically these structures are hit by the elements, so they are forced to restore them,- the spokesman noted. He emphasized that the Russians have objective reasons to worry about the safety of the bridge, as Ukraine has not given up its intentions to eliminate this illegal extension to the Ukrainian Crimean Peninsula. — I can confirm that the Russians are charging air defense there as much as possible. And it really seems that they are much more concerned about the safety of this facility than the safety of facilities within the Russian Federation itself. This is objective - you can see that the effectiveness in some cases is much greater right on the enemy's territory. Therefore, it can be concluded that they are trying to protect this building as much as possible, said the military officer. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that defensive structures of the occupiers in Crimea can withstand neither storms nor bribes, so the -shopopalo- that is being built next to the Kerch bridge will not be completed this season.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/02/vdoma-i-hvyli-dopomagayut-styhiya-rujnuye-zahysni-konstrukcziyi-kerchenskogo-mostu/	2024-10-02T10:42:33-07:00

We are also grateful to the Ministry of Economy for maximally helping to invest, finance and expand our production capacity. But at the same time, our businesses are not fully loaded this year. Additional funding is required. Ukrainian defense industry is growing - here are a few examples. This year, we are producing more artillery pieces per month than any other country in the world.

We see a huge development potential for those who now decide to invest in the Ukrainian defense industry,- said the Deputy Minister of Defense. According to him, the Ukrainian sector already demonstrates high efficiency and is ready to implement the most modern technologies. -That's why I call on both private investors and the governments of countries to invest resources in the Ukrainian defense industry,- he emphasized. The advantages of Ukrainian weapons are that they are easier to maintain and repair for our military. -This weapon is already known in the Armed Forces. We don't need to waste the military's scarce time on their training. In addition, it is easier to get feedback on Ukrainian weapons from the Armed Forces. In this way, manufacturers are continuously improving their products,- he explained. Ukraine already has a successful example of cooperation. -The Danish government was the first to start direct financing of Ukrainian defense enterprises, in particular the production of self-propelled artillery units -Bohdan- for the Ukrainian army,- said the Deputy Minister of Defense. According to him, the priority of the Ukrainian military is new modern technologies. -First of all, drones. In particular, deepstrike, which fly deep into the enemy. In addition, we offer to finance the production of reconnaissance, surface drones, as well as ground robotic systems,- noted Dmytro Klimenkov. He also stated that among the priorities are missiles, anti-tank complexes, armored vehicles and the latest artillery installations. -We are not limited to a narrow nomenclature and are ready to discuss a wide range of weapons. -Ukraine offers investors reliable projects in the field of defense, which have already proven themselves effectively on the battlefield,- he summarized. As reported by ArmyInform, Denmark is the first among foreign partners z-daniyeyu/->started direct financing of Ukrainian defense enterprises.

Who dominates the Black Sea: the response of the Navy	He told about this on the air of the telethon -Society. News- on October 2. -I can say about such a status quo. Because, unfortunately, in the waters of the Black Sea, yes, in fact, Russian ships were rejected, but in the airspace over the waters of the Azov-Black Sea region, Russian aviation still dominates,- he said. According to him, these are various classes of aircraft and helicopters. -They mostly use helicopters for anti-drone combat and patrolling. Airplanes are used both for patrolling and for conducting reconnaissance, inflicting fire damage. Drones are used in countless numbers, virtually all available drones in the Russian Federation,- noted Dmytro Pletenchuk. A Navy spokesman emphasized that the adversary uses drones to conduct reconnaissance. -And, unfortunately, this presence is permanent. Yes, they periodically lose drones and are afraid to enter the damage zone,- he explained. In his opinion, that is why enemy troops returned to the practice of using strategic aviation. -Therefore, I cannot say that the advantage at sea is now on our side, unfortunately. But the absence of the Russian surface fleet is also a significant result,- he summarized. As reported by ArmyInform, after unsuccessful attempts to use tactical aviation and strikes by the Defense Forces of Ukraine on airfields in Crimea, Russian occupiers returned to the practice of using strategic aviation for operations in the Black Sea area.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/02/hto-dominuye-v-chornomu-mori-vidpovid-vms/	2024-10-02T00:41:27-07:00

Russia was caught in another fake about the destruction of the Ukrainian F-16	The claim was quickly denied by the X Network itself, which added a comment: -The photo shows a US Air Force F-16 that crashed in 2019.- The original image did not have the Ukrainian coat of arms on the tail of the plane, which indicates that the photo was -edited- by the Russians. Russian resources actively -dispersed- information about the alleged loss of four F-16 fighter jets as a result of an -unexpected missile strike- on September 26. This untrue information was presented without any confirmation or concrete facts. Now, finally, the fakers managed to get -proof- - a photo of one plane from 2019. In addition, pro-Russian sources spread a fake that a mural with a -lost- fighter jet had appeared in Arlington near Washington, where the Pentagon is located. what are we paying for?-. Such fake messages are aimed at manipulating public opinion. These are fabrications created to reinforce the narrative about the -inefficiency- of Western aircraft.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/02/rosiyu-spijmaly-na-chergovomu-fejku-pro-znyshhennya-ukrayinskogo-f-16/	2024-10-01T20:36:25-07:00
A symbiosis of stealth and precision: a new cruise missile with a flight range of 2,000 km was prese...	-With more than 20 years of experience in the design and production of combat-proven cruise missiles, Lockheed Martin (LM) has developed the AGM-158 XR concept to offer a significantly increased attack range that can be rapidly manufactured and delivered to the U.S. military,- noted in the official release of this well-known arms manufacturer from the USA, ArmiyaInform reports. The JASSM-ER and LRASM samples became the basis for the development of this missile with an increased range. The AGM-158 XR retains the characteristic trapezoidal profile and inconspicuous design characteristic of missiles of this family. However, the new ammunition has increased dimensions, which makes it possible to equip the missile with additional fuel and a heavier warhead. This will provide the ability to launch from long distances, thus increasing the safety of aircraft and their ability to inflict more damage on enemy forces. According to forecasts, the AGM-158 XR will have a launch range comparable to Tomahawk-class missiles or even surpassing it, which is approximately 1,600 km. The AGM-158 XR is designed to be compatible with a variety of platforms. It can be installed on all aircraft such as F-35, F-22, F-15 capable of using JASSM or LRASM, except F-16. The company is also studying the possibility of placing this missile on board aircraft that vertically take off and land. There are prospects for creating ground modifications. The video released by LM does not differ in details, other than general phrases such as: -greater range of confrontation-, -reduced time for development and production- due to JASSM-ER solutions, etc. Defense Express (DE) ICQ experts noted that for Ukraine, one of the main ones is that the AGM-158 XR is not suitable for the F-16. This is due to the fact that the missile has increased in size to achieve a much longer range. Which one, by the way, was not announced at Lockheed Martin. -It is also not said how much the XR has grown in size, but the photo shows that the tail section of the rocket is indeed significantly elongated. In addition, JASSM-ERs are 4.26 meters long and 63.5 meters wide. Also, so that no one has doubts, the description of the new missile clearly states that the AGM-158 XR carriers will be F-35 of all versions, F/A-18E, F-15E, as well as all bombers, i.e. B-1, B-2, B-52, and the latest B-21,- DE researchers emphasized. At the same time, weapons market researchers stated that for the F-35, increasing the size of the missile is not of particular importance, because even the usual JASSM does not fit into the internal weapons compartments. That is why the Joint Strike Missile is integrated under this fighter, and all AGM-158s are still launched from external pylons. But for many potential operators of this missile, as IKK Defense Express believes, the lack of integration with the F-16 is unlikely to be a problem. In particular, the AGM-158 XR is unlikely to appear in the very near future, as only a mock-up has been shown so far, indicating that it can be developed quickly. Moreover, it is primarily intended for the United States, and only after satisfying the primary domestic needs, if, of course, it is ordered by the Pentagon, will be exported exclusively to -selected- countries, which with an extremely high probability will be armed with the F-35. At the same time, under certain alternative scenarios where the US would need to quickly arm partners with long-range cruise missiles for the AGM-158 family of cruise missiles, there are alternative launch methods. The first is sea or land, because objectively nothing prevents adding an accelerator to a missile and launching it from a ship or a land-based launcher. And such work is already underway with the anti-ship LRASM, which will be integrated into the Mk 41 universal launch cell. Lockheed Martin has set a production plan of 1,100 JASSM-XR missiles annually, with the possibility of releasing different models depending on market demand. Today, the company continues work on the rocket project, which will take several years. In the near future, tests in the air are expected. The American company Lockheed Martin has developed a new variant of the JASSM-XR cruise missile.

The battalion from Obolon liberated Vovchansk, was in the hell of the Serebryan forest and shoots do...	Mobilized at the beginning of a large-scale invasion as a junior lieutenant, Valery worked his way up from the officer of the planning group to the battalion chief of staff and recently received the rank of major. In a conversation with the ArmiyaInform correspondent, Valery Lubarsky talked about the combat path of the rifle battalion, technological the development of the unit and anti-aircraft drones, thanks to which 13 enemy UAVs have already been shot down. Next is his direct speech. I am a lawyer by profession, I worked as a lawyer in Kyiv for a long time in civil and economic cases . He graduated from the military department at VIKNU, had a military lawyer certificate. They led groups, taught people how to choose equipment, orient themselves in the terrain in the Crimea (even before 2014) and in the Carpathians. These skills really suited me during my service: working with maps, sense of distance. Civilian life was active, practiced Brazilian jiu-jitsu for over 10 years. Already in the ranks of the Armed Forces, he received a black belt. I tried surfing, cycling, skiing, and by the way, I got the nickname -Skier-. I had no military experience before the large-scale invasion. In 2014, he completed a short course in the -White Wolf- organization, now they are part of the -Alpha- SBU unit. For a long time, he visited the -Ukrainian Legion- - a paramilitary organization known to many in Kyiv. They provided a good base, taught the elements of the Combat Statute, takmed, the basis of fortification. He independently read military literature, trained in shooting, and had a basic culture of handling weapons like a civilian owner. Since the fall of 2021, I have been thinking about a reservist contract. Soon after, the Law -On the Foundations of National Resistance- was adopted, and for me it was an important signal that systematic work had begun at the state level in the field of territorial defense. Before the Russian invasion in February, my wife and I went on vacation to Georgia, where us and the beginning of the great war. At that time, our 4-year-old son was in a village near Vyshhorod. On February 24, I decided, first of all, to get to Ukraine, hide my son and wife in a safe place, and after that to mobilize. In the end, I managed to send my family abroad, and I stayed at the station in Kyiv, sat in the car and thought: -Goodbye to my old life.- In the 129th battalion of the TrO, I was assigned to the position of officer of the headquarters planning group, because I had the rank of second lieutenant and knew how to work with maps and information. I was mobilized on March 5, and on the first day I was given a blank card with the words: -This should be the battalion commander's working card.- They began to set up a situation on the northern outskirts of Kyiv, to go to the positions. At that time there were a lot of people who wanted to serve, the number of the battalion was about 40% more than the regular number. Everyone, let's say, was -squeezing- concretely, but everyone looked at each other and completed the tasks. About a month later, the 244th separate rifle battalion was created and I was offered the position of deputy chief of staff there, which scared me at first . The battalion mainly consisted of residents of Kyiv, mainly shellmen, partly from the Podilsky, Shevchenkivskyi districts. A day after the assembly, we left for Bila Tserkva, where we had a designated line for setting up a defense line. There we were under the command of one of the brigades, preparing fortifications from scratch. We made a plan for defense taking into account the topography of the area, tried to think creatively: ambushes, mobile fire groups, etc. Then we had about 800 people, almost all of them voluntarily mobilized. There were some people with ATO/OOS experience, ex-contractors and even with Afghanistan experience. We conducted training and night outings in the Kyiv region, and this helped us a lot in the future. The commanders tried to show leadership as much as they could so that the people felt confident. There was no such thing as: -I'm an officer, you're all scrambling, and I'll chase you.- In August 2022, we received combat orders to advance to Kharkiv Oblast. Prior to that, our two combined companies had already gone to the East, they fought hard enough there, in particular, they defended the Lysichan refinery, then in Bakhmut, they had battles near Girsky, Zoloty. They just hit the shaft of the enemy's artillery in the summer of 2022, there were the first losses and in general there was no flow. In the Kharkiv region, our battalion took the line along the Pecheneg reservoir, I organized the first advanced KP, there they began to form the first unit of UAVs. According to our state, it was not provided for then, but it was necessary to fly. Later we interacted with the SSO group, they began to give us the first live broadcasts, targeting. We then transferred them to the 14 OMBr, to which they were subordinated, and they were already hitting targets with American M109 Paladin self-propelled guns with our correction. Preparations for the Kharkiv counteroffensive were conducted covertly. At one point, I even thought that it had started, but it turned out to be radio training, the combrig sounded convincing. However, in a few days, our offensive did begin, in which two of our companies took part as assault troops. During the retreat, the Russian troops blew up bridges, tried to blow up the dam of the reservoir, but they did not succeed. When the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation had already broken through the enemy's defense line, we went to the settlements near Vovchansk, cleared them in a day and immediately received orders to occupy Vovchansk and its surroundings. We entered the city literally after the CCO group. In the city and, in particular, at the Aggregate Plant, they found an enemy ammunition depot, two damaged 120 mm mortars, and our mortarmen collected one worker from them and called him -Frankie- - Frankenstein. He helped us a lot and on that rotation and later in the Serebryansky Forest, because we had only 60-mm mortars in the state at that time. They tried to conduct a counter-battery fight, because almost from the first evening they started shelling us from the territory of Russia. It was possible to track down and destroy or damage up to 3 enemy mortar units. In Vovchansk itself at that time there were many civilians, people almost fought for the humanitarian. We organized security, generators to pump out the sewage, start the heating. At that time, the Russians left Kharkiv Oblast and already on their territory began to go in other directions, and we did not know their exact actions and intentions. There was a feeling that we were a little like -death rowers- there. The 14th brigade, in fact, did not follow us, they were sent to the offensive on Izyum, and we were given to the 4th tank brigade. We were very well received in the 4th OTBr, the brigade commander and the headquarters treated us with respect. We were instructed to make a plan for defense, I was then the TVO of the chief of staff and defended all our plans. In the end, we resisted this plan until December while we were there. A tragic story stuck in our memory: we saw a video from an enemy drone, which dropped a grenade and killed our soldier an hour and a half before. Ours shot down this drone and it was with a memory card, at that time -maviks- were launched with cards. Katsapas did not erase the material from her for a week, we received some intelligence. The tragedy of history was that we saw the last minutes of our soldier. In the Kharkiv region, we found traces of slave labor in the construction of Russian positions. There was a prison at the Aggregate Plant, where the occupiers kept, including illegal migrants from Sri Lanka. On the outskirts of Vovchansk, in a chalk mountain, there was a regimental stronghold, huge shelters were hollowed out in the hard ground, and this was done in a short time. I was amazed then. Now we don't let them dig like that anymore, our bombers fly all the time. In general, we observed the attempts of the Russian DRG, there were mortar firefights, and we started practicing the use of SPG-9 from closed positions. In December 2022, we were replaced by another unit of the TrO and we returned to Kyiv. At the end of February, the battalion went to the Kreminny direction to Serebryansky lis under the command of the 95th ODSHBr. At first there was a negative interaction, some of their sergeants called our soldiers -disposable-, -meat-. We took it harshly, we told the commandos and brigade commanders of paratroopers that we will beat your sergeants if they don't shut up, they will get a -melon-. , there was close coordination from our side, soldiers and sergeants fought well, some officers showed themselves excellently in acute situations. Everything was constructive. In some places, our experienced fighters taught the young addition of paratroopers, as they were in positions together. And, in this way, mutual respect and cooperation were gradually established. At that time there were assaults, one after another, up to ten a day. All this with armored vehicles, they drove infantry 30-50 meters to our trenches. Before that, UR-77s were thrown at us, TOS-1 -Solntsepok- worked, we all encountered the Terminator BMPT there for the first time, the Russians threw T-90M -Proryv- tanks into battle. Katsaps pressed, rushed into the trenches, threw grenades from under-barrels, plus constant mortar and artillery fire. Such was the density of hostilities. Since April, the intensity of assaults began to decrease, probably they transferred forces and means to other directions. However, from March to June we had significant losses. I gnashed my teeth and raged for every person I lost, I couldn't take it as a statistic. Then it was generally like a cold shower after Kharkiv region, where there was mostly success. In June 2023, we left for recovery in Chernihiv region and carried out so-called stabilization actions there: counter-sabotage actions, work of mobile fire groups, etc. And constant training, since autumn every week there was a field trip with a -legend-, in addition to constant training at shooting ranges. After conditional recovery, the battalion went east in March 2024 and was attached to one of the assault brigades . In the spring, the Russians periodically attacked with armored groups, tanks and BMPs drove through the fields from Bakhmut. For example, on April 12, we had a battle: our battalion destroyed two tanks: one was shot down with NLAW from a trench, and the other was shot down with FPV drones, the allies destroyed a couple of BMPs. Later, Russian attack aircraft were captured. Opposite us were the -Kadyrivets-, they were engaged in dropping drones a lot, and there was also a large unit of the army corps of the so-called -Luhansk People's Republic-. They encountered storm-z stormtroopers. After that, large-scale assaults stopped and the Russians switched to the tactics of small infantry groups, which, for the most part, still works. First, they entered through Ivanovske, then the Katsaps got stuck in the forests near Chasovoy Yar, Klishchiivka, in which very soon -green grass- grew and it became a huge problem. Now the enemy chose the direction of concentrating the main efforts in the direction of Pokrovsk and Toretsk. They can afford a strategic offensive operation in only one or two directions. All other directions they have are mostly active defense, small groups, many drones, mining from copters, shelling from MLRS, anti-aircraft missiles. We are actively looking for people in the UAV unit. We have a full-time platoon, in which the corresponding full-time positions are clearly prescribed. In our battalion, various types of drones perform the functions of surveillance, bombing, field logistics, as well as anti-aircraft copters to destroy enemy reconnaissance UAVs. Since the beginning of June, we have destroyed 13 such drones — SuperCam, three -Orlan- and nine ZALA. Most recently, a Russian drone was shot down at an altitude of more than 3,000 m. We have vacancies for UAV operators, medics, several officer vacancies - we have created staff groups for unmanned systems, EW. We have social elevators working well for people who want to responsibly contribute to the service, especially at the battalion level. We're plus or minus the enemy on drones. It is provided by the state, small volunteers, -Sternenka Community-, -Return alive-, private donors make collections. For example, in the spring we had a shortage of drones and my friend collected 4 or 5 Mavic 3T for us, which is more than a million hryvnias. There were many such episodes, war is a bottomless pit. These are our -eyes- at night, this is critically important. Our brigade purchases through tenders, drones are also provided by the authorities of Kyiv. Professions such as mortars, LNG operators, AGS, which stop the enemy's offensive are also needed. If you are a surveyor in civilian life, then this is a 60% ready mortar. In the battalion you will be taught, you will form a skill and you will work. To sum up, the recommendation of the chief of staff of the infantry battalion TrO is that you need to get a profession in civilian life that will push you into the Defense Forces. Get a specialization in UAV, Tacmed, Radio-Electronic Intelligence, Radio Affairs. There is a high probability that you will be taken hand and foot to a good unit, where proactive people are valued. in the Armed Forces or recruiting centers .	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/02/bataljon-z-oboloni-zvilnyav-vovchansk-buv-u-pekli-serebryanskogo-lisu-ta-zbyvaye-orlany-istoriya-majora-lyubarskogo/	2024-10-01T20:11:52-07:00

The conversation with the soldier was made public on the brigade's page . -When the operation was just beginning, the top management explained to us the essence of where we need to move and then we have already acted. Of course, we had advance planning and even a few days ahead of the assigned tasks in our direction. At certain moments, it seemed that the Rashists would demolish everything in their path with KABs and FPV-shkas, however, our troops prepared quite effectively and had a variety of EW devices,- says Bizon. According to him, when he entered enemy positions with his comrades, he took twice as many shells and stores with him, because it is always better to have a surplus than at a critical moment to think about whether you will have enough ammunition. -When we finally flew, many katsaps were caught off guard. In addition, we did not waste much time and continued to advance, entering other villages. Now a new stage of the war has come, this has never happened in history, but these events will forever be etched in the books... The most important thing now is to keep this momentum and we are sure that it will play its role at the level that the higher command planned and sees it.- Bison notes. The defender says that, in general, the whole operation is a continuous and large-scale assault. Bison, together with his brothers, built fortifications in order not to be cut down by debris, and then simply continued to go forward and forward. -Many of the Rashists themselves surrendered to us as prisoners, some of them were -three hundred- and already after being wounded, they also surrendered. Once a situation happened that will also be immortalized for ages. An active battle began, katsaps were everywhere, but none of our men even flinched. We just kept going forward and singing the national anthem of Ukraine. It seems to me that such a moment also morally suppressed the enemy, because they saw our determination and cohesiveness of actions to such an extent that we went into battle even with a song,- recalls the soldier. Bison was wounded during one of the combat missions. That evening, they left with his group for an assault and an enemy FPV drone flew into their armored car... -This is a war and everyone is aware of what can happen. Civilians of Russia were afraid of us, because they mistakenly believed that we would act like their military, but we are human and do not have such cruelty. The Ukrainian people are strong and wise, but behind the Russians you can immediately see anger towards the whole world and envy, which, probably, makes them shoot cars with civilians, torture people and commit other crimes... We are not like that, we just want to return our people to their native flag constitutionally defined territories,- Bizon assures. He was a private entrepreneur in civilian life. Two young daughters are growing up in his family, and he jokingly says that one day he will tell his children about all the awards he received in the difficult struggle for Ukraine. -My first state award was for the storming of the city of Yampil. Then I was awarded the medal -For Military Service to Ukraine-. After that, we were transferred to Luhansk region, there was a very large enemy assault and we repelled the landing, and quite successfully, after which I was awarded the Order -For Courage- III degree. Now for our next operation, I know that they applied for the award of the Order -For Courage- of the 2nd degree. Of course, it motivates, gives even more determination and is pleasant, but the main reward for each of us will be Victory,- Bison emphasizes. ArmyInform told about a locksmith who became a harpist.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/01/zhyteli-kurshhyny-boyalysya-nas-bo-dumaly-shho-my-diyatymemo-yak-yih-vijskovi-boyecz-bizon-pro-vijnu-na-rosiyi/	2024-10-01T11:57:05-07:00
Echelon defense and mining: how the border defense with Belarus is arranged	Andriy Demchenko, the spokesman of the State Border Service, told about how the border protection in the North is organized on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny-. — Each unit defending this direction independently builds engineering and fortification fortifications. This includes a trench line, dugouts, firing positions, and observation posts. Local authorities are also involved in this, in order to carry out the necessary work in our border area on a larger scale and more powerfully, so that it is such an echelon defense, he said. In addition, units of the Defense Forces mine the most threatened areas and carry out round-the-clock video surveillance along the state border. — As for the border line, then, of course, obstacles are necessary to prevent attempts to pass, including subversive groups. For this, the most threatening directions are mined, where the enemy's equipment can follow. Also, these are means of local control, i.e. video surveillance systems, which are deployed along the entire length of the border with Belarus so that we can actively and constantly monitor both our border and what is happening on the other side, said the spokesman of the State Border Service. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in the North Russian sabotage and reconnaissance groups are trying to penetrate Ukrainian defenses and terrorize civilians.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/01/eshelonovana-oborona-ta-minuvannya-yak-oblashtovano-zahyst-kordonu-z-bilorussyu/	2024-10-01T11:42:22-07:00

The crew of the drone consists of two people, and the drone itself can be transported on the roof of the -Cossack- or another armored combat vehicle. The drone can overcome significant obstacles thanks to the unique wheel lifting mechanism. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the Khorne group unit of the 116th mechanized brigade captured two soldiers of the 119th regiment of the 106th airborne division of the Russian army.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/01/prohidnyj-tyhyj-ekonomichnyj-nashi-bijczi-pokazaly-odnokolisnyj-nazemnyj-dron/	2024-10-01T11:37:18-07:00
Tactical replacement: at sea, the enemy made a bet on strategic aviation	He told about this on the air of the telethon -Edyny Novyny- spokesman of the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, captain 3rd rank Dmytro Pletenchuk. — They returned to the practice of using strategic aviation in our direction. This also did not happen for a long time, they unsuccessfully tried to solve problems at the expense of tactical aviation, and returned to this very practice, he said. The spokesman noted that the occupiers did not succeed immediately and recalled the damage to a civilian grain carrier by a Russian missile launched from a Tu-22 missile carrier of the enemy's strategic aviation. — Now they can see a way out of such tactics. In any case, we try to repel these attacks as much as possible. I have in mind the Defense Forces of Ukraine as a whole, because this is the work of a large air defense force, that is, the Air Force in the first place. -We, in turn, chat in the same way, because the Navy is actually the first to meet all the objects that enter our territory from the south from the sea,- the officer explained. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that the Navy of the Ukrainian Armed Forces explained why the Russians throw their sailors into infantry assaults.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/01/taktychna-zamina-na-mori-vorog-zrobyv-stavku-na-strategichnu-aviacziyu/	2024-10-01T11:28:51-07:00

We have built a very effective defense system. Currently, we apply all our latest military developments and control enemy activity along the border in our difficult natural conditions. This is our front line and we are trying to destroy the enemy even before the approach of the border, he said. He noted that thanks to the Kursk operation in the north, the number and activity of Russian sabotage and intelligence groups has significantly decreased, and he also emphasized that the offensive in Kursk allowed the Defense Forces to seize the initiative and impose on the Russians an agenda beneficial to the Ukrainian military. — The Kursk operation is given due to the fact that earlier we were in constant tension that the enemy might carry out some offensive actions in the direction of Chernigov, Sumy, Kharkiv.

In his opinion, the enemy's plan is to seize part of the Donetsk region, advancing from the south. — Priutne is located a little south of such a settlement as Velika Novosilka.

The tradition of creating military icons was revived in the Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra	Launched in 2024, the initiative to revive the Lavra icon painting school aims to restore the ancient craft of Baroque icon painting, which has sustained the spirit of warriors for centuries. According to the general director of the Reserve Maksym Ostapenko, this is an important stage in the preservation of cultural heritage. -With this project, we aim to revive an important part of Ukrainian cultural heritage - a military icon, which has always been a symbol of protection and spiritual support for soldiers. In times of war, when a nation is fighting for its freedom, the restoration of these traditions is of particular importance. The project not only brings lost crafts back to life, but also strengthens national identity by combining history, culture and faith. Military icons should become talismans for our defenders and symbols of the unity and stability of the Ukrainian people,- Maksym Ostapenko noted. During the event, the vicar of the Holy Dormition Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra, Avraamiy, consecrated the icons and emphasized that in times of war, spiritual support is of particular importance. The State Secretary of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine Lyudmila Daragan added that this is only the first stage of the joint project to create combat glue nodes for the armed forces brigades. -Our struggle for freedom, for the right to live on our land, is waged not only with weapons, but also with the power of our faith. By the power of boundless prayer of millions of Ukrainians. Our warriors on the battlefield are doing impossible things. Today, as in the past, the presence of icons in combat units supports the spirit of heroes and increases confidence in our victory,- states Secretary of Defense Ludmila Daragan. Consecrated icons were handed over to three military brigades of the Armed Forces of Ukraine: the 95th Separate Assault Polis Brigade, the 96th Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade of Kyiv and the Independent Presidential Brigade named after Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytskyi. These icons are a revival of Ukrainian baroque traditions and will become spiritual talismans for our defenders, said the author and curator of the project, Deputy Director General of the Reserve Svitlana Kotlyarevska. The images written for three military brigades depict the patrons of the soldiers, in particular Archstrategist Michael, who is the personification of the heavenly protector of the Ukrainian army. The work on these icons lasted for several months, the artists - icon painters Lilia Belska and Yurii Guzenko, recreated the authentic techniques of the 18th century Lavra icon painting, combining national and sacred symbols. -This will spiritually support our defenders, because they are far from their homes, from their loved ones, from temples. Thus, they will have the opportunity to offer their prayers to God through the chaplains, through joint prayer and through the icon,- noted Andrii Gul, military chaplain of the separate presidential brigade named after Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytskyi. The icons created within the -Military Icon- project are made in accordance with the heraldry of military units. In addition to large brigade icons, servicemen will be able to receive miniature personal icons created according to the original. This will enable soldiers to always have a spiritual amulet with them even in the hottest spots of the front.

At the exhibition, visitors will see fifty photos, these are portraits of our defenders, taken directly in combat positions or in location; the consequences of Russian aggression and the lives of civilians who are in the de-occupied territories or near the front line; military training and combat work of artillery and other weapons, etc. The photos are taken at different times, from the beginning of the full-scale invasion to the present day. — The authors aimed to show the efforts, the price of these efforts, made by all the Armed Forces of Ukraine — boys and girls, in order to achieve our Victory, as well as photo-fixing the crimes of the Russians. I am proud of our team, I believe that after looking at these works, our descendants will know what war is, what struggle is, what the price of this struggle is and the price of Victory, which we will certainly win, - said Georgy Spasokukotskyi. My attention was drawn to Oleg Palchyk's photo work -Ukrainian Cossacks writing a letter to Puil and his mare Lavrov-, taken in September 2023 in the Kyiv region. This is what Giorgiy Spasokukotskyi said about its creation: - French artist Emerick Louisset came to Ukraine and was inspired by what is happening in our country. He said that such a thing is impossible in France, even if someone attacks France - not everyone is ready to fight for it. He was delighted with what he saw and wanted to understand the reason why. When he saw Ilya Ripin's painting -Zaporozhians writing a letter to the Turkish Sultan-, he wanted to make a photo with this plot. After all, our war lasts much longer than 10 years&#8230; We called for the brigades. Here are not disguised people from the street, but professional soldiers with combat experience, some of them have been fighting for more than 2.5 years. You can view the exhibition -Length to War- online at the website a> Territorial Defense Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

Everyone flies! There is a green light for the creation of private drones	This was notified on September 30 by the Deputy Prime Minister for Innovation, Development of Education, Science and Technology, Minister of Digital Transformation Mykhailo Fedorov. According to the Deputy Prime Minister, the need for professional drone operators is constantly growing. There is a demand for this profession in military units, so educational institutions that provide quality knowledge are needed. -Since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, dozens of private training centers for UAV pilots have appeared in Ukraine, but there is no unified system for regulating their activities. The government has adopted a resolution that will start the certification of private UAV schools. Educational institutions will be able to receive a certificate and officially train operators who, after successfully passing the exams, will be able to take the positions of UAV operators in military units of all components of the Security Forces and the Defense Forces,- said Mykhailo Fedorov. In order to obtain a license, an institution must: — conduct training in the operation or manufacture of drones — have 3+ drones for pilot training and certification — have training programs for pilot training on these devices — hire 3+ certified instructors to conduct training. Earlier ArmyInform told , that defense developers from Brave1 won the -Championship of Ukraine- for startups. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/01/litayut-vsi-ye-zelene-svitlo-stvorennyu-pryvatnyh-dronaren/	2024-10-01T05:09:05-07:00

The brigades received the tools they had been asking for for a long time — to carry out high-quality recruiting, the result of which is a targeted call for volunteers. This resolution is a tool that allows you to significantly reduce the time of recruiting and guarantees that everyone will be able to join where his or her desires and skills coincide with the needs of the defense,- commented the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Rustem Umyerov.

Killer of the FSB was detained in Zaporizhzhia - in hot pursuit - immediately after the attempt - SB...	About this declares the Security Service of Ukraine. It is noted that the counter-intelligence of the Security Service on a hot pursuit detained an FSB agent who attempted to assassinate one of the officials of the Melitopol City Council in Zaporizhzhia. -According to the instructions of the Russian special service, the killer laid in wait for the official in the entrance of a residential building, and then hit him several times on the head with a hammer. Despite numerous injuries, the victim survived. For the conspiracy, the attacker acted under the guise of a utility worker who was carrying out technical work in the apartment building where the official lived,- the counterintelligence officers said. After committing the crime, the suspect was preparing to flee to the temporarily occupied part of the Zaporizhzhia region through the territory of the EU. He planned to use one of the -evasion schemes- to cross the state border. Employees of the Security Service -on a hot trail- established the location of the hired killer and detained him while trying to escape. The figure turned out to be a recidivist who lived in temporarily occupied Melitopol. -The man came to the attention of the occupiers when, even before the full-scale invasion, he was serving a sentence in a Russian prison for premeditated murder. In June 2024, he was finally recruited and sent to special training courses at the training center of the FSB in the temporarily captured part of the territory of the region,- the special service informed. There, under the guidance of instructors of the Russian special service, the agent was engaged in fire training, knife fighting techniques and practiced conspiracy measures. To carry out an enemy mission, the killer arrived in Zaporozhye, pretending to be a migrant. After arriving in the city, he began tracking the work and residential addresses of his victim, as well as the main routes of her movement. In order to -cover his tracks-, the agent constantly changed the addresses of rented apartments, and communicated with his Russian curator through fictitious nicknames in an anonymous messenger chat. In the case of the murder of a Ukrainian official, the occupiers promised their accomplice to hand over a house in Melitopol that belonged to local residents who were forced to leave it due to the occupation. The perpetrator is in custody. He faces life imprisonment with confiscation of property. How reported ArmyInform, the head of the FSB intelligence group, which operated in Zaporozhye, received a life sentence. His accomplice was sentenced to 15 years in prison.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/01/kilera-fsb-zatrymaly-v-zaporizhzhi-garyachym-slidom-vidrazu-pislya-zamahu-sbu/	2024-10-01T04:32:04-07:00

Patriot in two months, F-16 - longer: the Ukrainian military is mastering the weapons of partner cou...	About this on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- told First Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Lieutenant General Ivan Havrylyuk — After analyzing more than 2.5 years of the active phase of the war against the Russian Federation and the training of our servicemen on various types of weapons provided by partner countries, each type of weaponry has its own program of retraining and retraining of our servicemen. But, at the same time, our servicemen were mostly people who already had an appropriate level of training on typical Soviet-made models. That is, if the training program for artillery systems takes about six months in partner countries, our servicemen were allowed to undergo training and show high results upon completion of training within two months, he said. He noted that it also takes about two months to train air defense military specialists capable of performing combat missions using the Patriot air defense system. Instead, F-16 pilot training takes longer because mastering the aircraft's control in the air is only part of a fighter pilot's basic military training. Regarding training on F-16 aircraft or other aircraft of NATO partner countries, we understand that a more comprehensive approach is necessary here. Because simply learning how to fly a plane in the air does not mean that you have achieved the level that is necessary today in the battle to gain at least a temporary advantage in some areas, let alone complete air superiority over the Russian Federation, which we currently have is very annoying, especially to the border areas, and to military personnel on the front line, using a huge number of guided aerial bombs, the military explained. Another important aspect is the training of technical specialists capable of servicing aircraft and the arrangement of the relevant infrastructure. - In addition, the training of technical personnel for maintenance and support in combat condition of these aircraft is of great importance. Also, the infrastructure and planning of the full complex of the use of these aircraft in interaction with the radio engineering forces, with the Air Defense Forces of the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Ivan Gavryliuk noted. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that the Ministry of Defense named the main achievements of Ukraine in the production of its own weapons, how to eliminate the advantage of rf in the mobilization resource and informed that the ratio of the number of Ukrainian and Russian artillery shells on the battlefield has improved.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/01/patriot-za-dva-misyaczi-f-16-dovshe-ukrayinski-vijskovi-opanovuyut-zbroyu-krayin-partneriv-u-pryskorenomu-rezhymi/	2024-10-01T04:03:42-07:00

Vovchansk, a factory and 20 armored vehicles: the Russians tried to cover the armor with bodies	Exclusively for ArmiyaInform, the spokesman of the Kharkiv OTU, Colonel Vitaly Sarantsev, commented on the results of the repulse of the Russian assault in Vovchansk: -Yesterday morning, the enemy began assaulting the positions of the Defense Forces of Ukraine in the area of ​​the settlement of Vovchansk. The enemy's armored vehicle advanced, on board of which the enemy's assault groups were placed. Covering was carried out by two tanks. The equipment on the approaches to the position of the defense forces was detected and it was hit by fire with the help of artillery and FPV drones. In total, during the past day, 20 units of armored vehicles were destroyed and damaged in Vovchansk alone — 2 tanks and 18 armored vehicles. The total loss of enemy manpower in the Kharkiv direction amounted to 202 people, of which 135 were irreversible and 67 were medical. The intensity of hostilities was such that the number of irreversible losses of the enemy exceeded sanitary losses for the first time.- As we can see, everything again ended with a sold-out concert at the Kobzon, the extraordinary scale of which is clearly visible in the photos and videos circulating on the Internet. In the analytical report of the Institute for the Study of War on the course of repelling large-scale Russian aggression for September 30, 2024 stated that -a Russian war blogger said that Russian forces recently attacked Aggregatny Zavod, but did not specify the result.- Ukrainian military man, volunteer of the 24th separate assault battalion -Aidar- Stanislav Bunyatov reported that the Russians engaged 17 MT-LB, 3 tanks and more than 100 paratroopers to the assault in the urban development of Vovchansk. According to his data, the losses of the enemy amounted to: 16 -motoliga- were destroyed, 1 tank was damaged (it was able to retreat with the remains of armored vehicles). -Now the guys are finishing off the rest of the infantry, the bulk has already been sent to the kobzon,- the soldier said. Later, he specified enemy losses, noting that apart from armored vehicles, the invaders did not count a hundred dead soldiers and another 25 wounded: The accuracy of the calculations of the enemy's manpower lost here is obviously approximate. However, the order of numbers, judging by the comment of the spokesman of the -Kharkiv- OTU, Colonel Vitaly Sarantsev, regarding the losses of the enemy in the Kharkiv direction in general and the photo and video materials distributed on the network, is close to reality. The main reason for the senseless assault of the Russians with the use of a large number of armored vehicles in the urban development of Vovchansk is quite understandable. This is their loss of control over the Aggregate Plant, which was finally liberated from the occupiers by units of the Defense Forces of Ukraine. -It is difficult to imagine something more senseless and merciless than the order of the Russian commander, who has just been &lt;encouraged - ed.&gt; for the loss of the aggregate plant. But the whole Russian army is involved,- stated on the Byt Ili channel. The desire of the Russian command to cover up its own stupid decisions leads to even more stupid decisions - and so on ad infinitum. The desire of the Russian commanders to cover the -fifth point-, to cover the image media defeat from the loss of the plant, and to gain respect in front of the higher command prompts them not to count on the losses. -Today in Vovchansk, snipers sacrificed 2 companies of paratroopers and 17 units of equipment. We are waiting for the howl in the Katsap pubs-, said the administrator of the Telegram channel -✙ MAGNAT ✙ -. He did not make himself wait long - cheerful reports about -hard rolling- and -vigorous progress- quickly changed to desperate whining in the comments to the extremely careful reports of Russian propaganda channels that all is not well for Russians in Vovchansk. However, they can only write the truth in anonymous comments, because the administrators of propaganda zhu-channels have long been under close surveillance by the Russian special services and allow -freedom- only within clearly defined frameworks. -A fool again. And now again the -net- will begin to oppress,- wrote an enraged propagandist of Russian fascism from one of the smaller Russian propaganda telegram channels, hinting at censorship of ZU propagandists. Larger Russian propaganda resources do not even dare to make such extremely cautious statements, knowing that authorized persons in civilian clothes may come after them. Commentators, however, are bolder because they are harder to calculate. Here are some samples of their typical posts. The devastating meat-armor assault of the Russian invaders in Vovchansk demonstrated that trying to cover the armor with bodies is an unproductive idea, because both the soldiers will be torn to shreds and the armor will burn. However, it is unlikely that any conclusions will be drawn from this in the Russian army, where equipment is more expensive than the lives of personnel, and winning relations with the higher command are more valuable than everything else combined. Earlier, ArmyInform wrote about the successful repulse of enemy assaults by units of the Defense Forces of Ukraine using a large number of armored vehicles in the Kupyan direction and on the Lipetsk section of the Kharkiv direction.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/01/vovchansk-zavod-ta-20-bronemashyn-rosiyany-sprobuvaly-prykryty-bronyu-tilamy/	2024-09-30T23:21:56-07:00

The end of the war, elections in the USA, -Plan for victory- over the Russian Federation: the expert...	-The world is very globalized, where each country has its own interests. Russia attempted to restore -superpower status- by attacking Ukraine. the Russians want to significantly expand their geopolitical influence in the world and Europe, reduce the role of the United States and NATO. This is impossible without the seizure of Ukraine. Even Lenin said that losing Ukraine is the same as losing one's head. Where are we now in this war? In my personal opinion, we have already reached the middle. Only I can't specify where that middle is. Was it already last summer or autumn, or maybe it is some other period of time. Why do I think so? Because there are all the main signs that the search for a formula to get out of this phase of the war, to put it very correctly, has begun. What is the argument for my reasoning? The first is the big peace conference in Switzerland that took place in June of this year. More than 80 countries took part in it. An unprecedented phenomenon since the Second World War, there has been nothing like it since. The second argument is the visits of a huge cavalcade of diplomats, European and Ukrainian, to China. And a whole series of very specific statements by leaders of various influential countries, for example, Turkish President Erdogan. He stated that he is ready to mediate between Russia and Ukraine in ending this phase of the war. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz also reflected a few weeks ago that, they say, he is ready to talk to Putin. This means that the search for the formula has begun. It will definitely be finalized. In my personal opinion, it will happen next year. A lot will depend on who wins the US presidential election. At the moment, by a small margin, Kamala Harris has more positive momentum than Donald Trump. But everything can be solved literally overnight, because the American electoral system is very specific. It is about the electoral college of the USA. As a rule, they do not violate the will of those people who vote one way or another, but there may be exceptions. Albert Gore won the election from George W. Bush, but the electorate voted his way. Similarly, Hillary Clinton won the 2016 election over Trump, but again voters voted differently. Therefore, it will really be decisive who will sit in the chair of the president of the United States. I want to express a personal position and dispel fears about the possible election of Trump. He now strongly reflects that he will become president and -end the war- in three days. US leadership is governed by the system of checks and balances defined by the United States Constitution. That is, there is a balance of power. Let's not forget that Trump has already been the president of the United States once. And the aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine has already been ongoing, although not full-scale. There were no overly big bows towards Russia or Putin. And there were sanctions to block the construction of the Nord Stream-2 gas pipeline. Plus, American liquefied gas went to European Union countries en masse. And this is clearly a powerful blow to the Russian Federation. There are also the interests of the most powerful US military-industrial complex in the world. Almost everything there is 99% owned by private firms. General Dynamics, McDonnell Douglas, Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin got a taste of very big money. I am sure that the owners of these strategic US enterprises will find the keys to the hearts of even personalities like Trump. It is necessary to understand that the axis of evil has been crossed. It definitely includes Russia, North Korea, China and Iran. The situation in the Middle East is especially influenced by Iran. Since 1989, a theocratic regime headed by ayatollahs has been in place there. They have an eschatological vision of the world, that is, they are really ready to burn the world with nuclear catastrophes under the banner of Allah. And even, despite the sanction, build a pretty good military-industrial complex. Shahedi is a fairly successful example of this. It was also confirmed that the Iranians provided the Russians with artillery ammunition of up to 122 mm and 152 mm caliber. According to Western media, Russia has allegedly already received or is about to receive several hundred Fath-360 ballistic missiles from Iran. The warhead of the missile is 150 kg, the flight range is up to 120 km. But there is also other information that they allegedly suspended the process of transferring these missiles there. The Americans are now very heavily leveraged in part of the nuclear deal with Iran. Let's not forget that $150 billion of oil belonging to Iran is frozen in world bank accounts. Is a potential Iranian strike on Israel possible? Iran has already carried out a massive combined missile-drone strike against Israel this year. But there was no escalation after that. Now Israel is attacking Hezbollah facilities in Lebanon, let's remember the unique -pager- operation. And somehow Iran is in no rush to give its Lebanese proxies more support than they can afford. China's position will also depend on the White House election. They play on the sly and take their time. Let's not forget that the Chinese are far from being true friends of the Russian Federation. They have a very old and long -history of relations- with Russia since the middle of the 19th century. Two treaties humiliating for the Chinese are Aigun and Peking. Then the territory along the Amur River passed to Moscow. China was weakened by the Opium Wars, and the Russian Empire, of course, took advantage of this. The Chinese are playing their strategic game, fighting for the next world order and who will play the leading role there. At the moment, it would be very beneficial for China to freeze the battle line of the Russian-Ukrainian war. But as long as the Kursk bridgehead exists, things will not stop like this right now. In fact, the issue of the Kursk bridgehead will be decisive at the point of potential negotiations and how the potential demarcation line will be drawn. — the Russians destroyed the Yalta-Potsdam system of international relations. The formation of the next system will take place in a different way, perhaps not even in force. But there is a nuance, everything will greatly depend on what this system will actually look like. Now, of more than 200 countries on the planet, two-thirds are autocracies, only one part are democracies. But the most important thing is: in the larger historical context, we have already defeated the Russians. Why? Ukrainian statehood survived. For Moscow imperialism, for Russian identity, an independent Ukraine is not at all acceptable as such. And we are, we exist. This is a win. For the first time, we have the full support of the entire civilized world. I really like historical parallels. At the beginning of the 20th century, Ukraine had at least five enemies. The second is our infighting, the lack of unity in the actions of the Ukrainian national forces, which did not compromise in the name of national interests. Plus the unfavorable international situation. This time we are not fighting for the restoration of the Ukrainian state, now we are fighting for its preservation. Even if there is a truce and the Russians take a break after the cessation of hostilities, they will use this time to strengthen their own military capabilities. I emphasize that the next phase of the Russian-Ukrainian war is inevitable. Next year, the Kremlin has budgeted the largest amount since the Soviet Union - more than 140 billion dollars. It is actually the third largest military budget of any country in the world, at 6.5% of GDP. It was more only in the 1980s in the Soviet Union, which reached 15%. Therefore, the next phase of this war is inevitable and only a matter of time. How is it composed, for whose benefit? I am sure that sooner or later, when Moscow's imperialism begins to pour down for real, we will definitely take back all our territories.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/01/zavershennya-vijny-vybory-v-ssha-plan-peremogy-nad-rf-ekspert-rozkryv-detali-geopolitychnoyi-shahivnyczyi/	2024-09-30T21:00:06-07:00
What is known about the holidays that Ukrainians celebrate on the first of October	On this day, we honor modern defenders of Ukraine and Ukrainian heroes of different eras. Modern soldiers multiply and develop thousand-year-old Ukrainian military traditions. In the Ukrainian tradition, this holiday is associated with the Day of the Intercession of the Holy Mother of God. In connection with the transition of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine and the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church to the New Julian style of the calendar from last September, in 2023 the Day of Defenders was moved from October 14 to October 1. The idea of ​​the intercession of the Mother of God — protector from enemies — has deep roots from the times of Rus and the introduction of Christianity in 988. Prince Yaroslav the Wise built a church at the Golden Gate in Kyiv as an expression of gratitude to God and the Holy Mother of God. The Feast of the Intercession of the Holy Mother of God was one of the most important Cossack holidays, which is why it got its second name — Cossack Protection. It was on the Feast of the Intercession — on October 1 that the Cossacks held councils at which they elected a new hetman or members of the chieftainship. At the same time, a unique type of icon appeared — -Cossack Protection-, where Ukrainian Orthodox hierarchs, hetmans and Cossacks are depicted under the omophorion of the Mother of God. Also, the veneration of the Intercession by the Cossacks affected the huge number of churches named after the Intercession of the Holy Mother of God and on toponymy. Today, many villages in Ukraine bear the names Pokrovka, Pokrovske, Novopokrovka, etc. Protection of the Blessed Virgin Mary: history of the holiday, folk signs During the Ukrainian Revolution of 1917–1921, the traditions of the military Cossack community were revived. They became the basis for the development of the armed forces of the Ukrainian People's Republic, the Ukrainian State, and the ZUNR. First of all, this can be seen in the names of military formations and military terminology, which was used to denote ranks, positions and military structural elements: Cossack, squad, chotar, bunchuzhny, half-hundred, centurion, kurinny, osavul, colonel, chieftain of a brigade, chieftain of a division, chieftain of a corps . This was reflected in the uniforms and appearance of the soldiers of the Ukrainian military formations of those times. -Mazepinka- cap, black caps with colored brims, Circassians and other elements of ancient Ukrainian military clothing. Fighters often shaved their heads following the example of the Cossacks, leaving only a herringbone. During the Second World War, natives of different parts of Ukraine and Ukrainians of the world, who were in regular armies or became partisans, served in auxiliary formations or on the front lines, went through the entire war or died in the struggle, side by side with other peoples they fought against Nazism. Soldiers of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army took up arms to protect Ukrainians from both totalitarian regimes — Nazi and Communist. They fought for the restoration of Ukrainian statehood, followed Cossack military traditions. The symbolic day of the creation of the UPA — October 14, 1942, which then fell on the Intercession of the Holy Mother of God. The struggle of the UPA was a continuation of the Ukrainian liberation movement of the period of the Ukrainian Revolution of 1917–1921, the underground fighting Ukrainian military organization and the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists in the 1920s–1930s. Today our army has become one of the most capable armies in Europe, having 10 years of combat experience behind him. Already during the Russo-Ukrainian war, Ukraine reformed and modernized the Armed Forces according to the latest standards, as well as restored uniquely Ukrainian military traditions, strengthened the ideological component of patriotic education of personnel. In battles with units of the Russian regular army, our army became professional and became one of the most important institutions of the country. Today, Ukrainian society trusts the Armed Forces the most. The modern Armed Forces inherited the headdress, insignia and slogan from previous generations. -Mazepinka- is a headdress with a front wedge-shaped cut, part of the Ukrainian military uniform. It stylistically imitates the appearance of Cossack headdresses of the second half of the 17th century, when Ivan Mazepa was hetman. This is how they were depicted in contemporary portraits. -Mazepinky- began to be worn by Ukrainian snipers during the First World War. Later, this headdress became widespread in other Ukrainian formations — the Galician Army, the Carpathian Sich, and the UPA. Since 2017, the -mazepinka- has been the official headdress of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The sleeve trident is a badge of distinction worn on the sleeves of uniforms by the soldiers of the UNR Army and Chief Ataman Simon Petliura himself. -The cloth trident, the colors according to the types of weapons, the forms according to the drawing,- said the order of July 30, 1919. A simple trident, without details, was easy to make in the conditions of continuous hostilities and the small and unstable rear of the UNR Army. Continuing the Petlyur traditions, modern defenders of Ukraine wear tridents on the sleeves of their uniforms. -Glory to Ukraine! -Glory to the heroes!- — the slogan of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army. Currently, it is the official salute in the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Appeal -Glory to Ukraine! -Glory to the heroes!- was approved in the spring of 1941 by the II Grand Assembly of the OUN led by Stepan Bandera, and on October 4, 2018, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine approved the greeting -Glory to Ukraine! -Glory to the heroes!- as official in the Armed Forces and the National Police. According to the materials of the Ukrainian Institute of National Remembrance	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/01/shho-vidomo-pro-svyata-yaki-ukrayinczi-vidznachayut-pershogo-zhovtnya/	2024-09-30T20:51:12-07:00
Dates -end of war- from -numerologists-: what's wrong with them	This time, the mysterious -numerologist- experts set December 12, 2024 as this day. In this delusional fakers compare the dates of the beginning of the First and Second World Wars with the date of the invasion of Russian troops into Ukraine. The so-called numerologists emphasize the fact that Russia started the war against Ukraine on February 24, 2022, and if you add up all numbers of this date together, the result will be the number 5. The same number is obtained as a result of calculations of the dates of the beginning of the First and Second World Wars. And also on the date - 12.12.2024. Such -calculations- are not new. Even at the beginning of the large-scale invasion, -number magicians- predicted the end of the war on March 14, 2022. Then this date gradually shifted, predicting new and new days of victory / peace / surrender. Actually, the war with Russia did not start on 24.02.2022, but in 2014, so completely different dates should have been taken for calculations. In addition, the authors of the plot manipulate the beginning and end of conflicts, -adjusting- them to the desired result. Spreading misinformation, Russian narratives, swaying the psyche are additional tools in the war that the enemies are waging against Ukrainians. Not the last role in the information war is played by Russian so-called numerologists and fortune-tellers. A battalion of Russian fortune-tellers-experts, synchronously with the media, picks up key messages regarding military operations, the greatness of -Mother Russia- and the future of Ukraine. This is how they zombify a credulous, mystic-loving audience. And this way of spreading Russian narratives is almost the simplest. This requires very few improvised means: a bright manicure, massive rings on the fingers, a hanging tongue and a memorized technique of the main Kremlin messages. Unfortunately, since the beginning of the invasion, military-political schedules have become so popular that for many, they are the only source of true information that non-critical thinkers sincerely believe.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/10/01/daty-zavershennya-vijny-vid-numerologiv-shho-z-nymy-ne-tak/	2024-09-30T20:37:26-07:00
And again Gatling: Polish gunsmiths created a system to fight drones based on a 12.7 mm machine gun	How goes in the information message posted on the official portal of the Polish Army, this system was developed to combat low-class drones - nano and micro, as well as other small flying objects, ArmiyaInform reports. This type of defensive solution is a short-range anti-drone weapon, also known as a -weapon of last resort,- and is used when the drone is relatively close to the target. The system is ideal for protecting critical infrastructure. The basis of the armament of this system is the WLKM 12.7 mm multi-barreled machine gun, designed according to the Gatling scheme, which effectively hits targets at a distance of up to 2 thousand. meters It is worth reminding that Gatling machine gun is one of the most famous first rapid-fire weapon systems, the predecessor of the modern machine gun. Invented by Richard Gatling, the system became famous for its use by the Northern States Army during the American Civil War in the 1860s, when it was first used in combat. The System Zwalczania Dronów combat system was the result of a collaboration between Zakłady Mechaniczne Tarnów and WAT. The main goal of the development is to provide an effective solution to combat UAVs while maintaining a balance between cost and functionality. The system uses affordable ammunition, the latest target detection and tracking technologies, which makes it a reliable tool on the battlefield. The system is equipped with remote control and can work both in manual and automatic modes. The flexibility of the design allows it to be installed on various platforms, from stationary facilities to mobile vehicles and marine vessels. A key component is the WLKM 12.7mm Gatling type machine gun developed by Zakłady Mechaniczne Tarnów. The weapon uses 12.7 mm x 99 NATO (.50 BMG) ammunition and has an adjustable rate of fire from 250 to 3,600 rounds per minute. The maximum range of fire reaches 2 thousand. meters Queues can have 50-200 shots, which gives flexibility when firing at different types of targets. The machine gun is equipped with four rotating barrels, which are driven by an electric motor with a voltage of 27 V. Also, the system is integrated with an optoelectronic head, which includes daytime and thermal imaging cameras, as well as a laser rangefinder. The radar system allows detection of UAVs, including small drones, at a distance of up to 15 kilometers. System Zwalczania Dronów supports three modes of operation: — manual mode — the operator fully controls the system and independently directs the machine gun to the target; — semi-automatic mode — the system helps in tracking the target on the basis of video analysis, which reduces the burden on the operator; - automatic mode - the system autonomously detects, identifies and accompanies targets, but the final decision to open fire remains with the operator. Remote control allows the operator to be at a safe distance from the combat zone. Control is carried out through a panel with a large screen, on which information from cameras is displayed, which allows the operator to more accurately assess the situation and increases his safety. System Zwalczania Dronów is a modern and multifunctional solution for combating drones. The powerful WLKM 12.7 mm machine gun, integrated surveillance and automatic tracking systems make this weapon an effective tool for modern military operations, ensuring safety and flexibility in operation. Practical tests of the anti-UAV defense system System Zwalczania Dronów.

I miscalculated — the former head of the TCC went on trial in Zaporizhzhia	The State Bureau of Investigation reported this on September 30. In the summer of 2023, the SDB employees exposed the former head of the TCC. He is accused of groundlessly charging increased payments to his close subordinates in the amount of more than UAH 1 million. During the investigation of this case, new facts of abuse of the military were revealed. In the same year 2023, the official decided to use military personnel to repair his new house. Instead of service, they worked in construction while maintaining full financial support. The official illegally issued orders for the deployment of military personnel and signed documents on baseless charges and payments. The exhibitor was informed of a new suspicion. He is currently accused of abuse of office and aiding and abetting military service evasion. As reported by ArmyInform, reported about the suspicion of two friends from the Rivne region, who organized a scheme to avoid mobilization. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/30/pronarahuvavsya-u-zaporizhzhi-pishov-pid-sud-kolyshnij-nachalnyk-tczk/	2024-09-30T11:41:41-07:00

It passes from the temporarily occupied Crimea and also runs along the recently built railway branch, which passes north of Mariupol along the Priazov region, he said. At the same time, the Defense Forces are striking the enemy's logistics routes. - These logistics routes are under our fire control. But Russia is still redeploying units and supplying ammunition, fuel and lubricants, the spokesman said. At the same time, the enemy did not use these logistical routes to transfer significant forces and resources from Southern Ukraine to Kurshchyna. - They did not transfer significant parts and units from Zaporizhzhia, from the Southern direction to Kursk. Yes, indeed, they transferred several consolidated divisions of specialists. However, they are constantly supplying here with supplies and ammunition, Vladyslav Voloshyn emphasized. Earlier, ArmyInform reported, where in the South are the Russians preparing to storm and what the occupiers are doing on the territory of the Zaporizhzhya NPP.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/30/pivdenno-zahidna-zaliznyczya-okupantiv-rosiyany-nalagodyly-logistyku-po-pryazovyu/	2024-09-30T11:11:01-07:00

The military explained that the occupiers have improved the tactical and technical characteristics of the KABs, thanks to which these ammunition can now hit at a greater distance. — the Russians are trying to make structural changes to the very design of guided aerial bombs. Previously, they flew at a distance of 15, 20 to 30 kilometers. Now they have made changes and they are already flying further, the spokesman explained. The shelling of Zaporozhye was caused by the improvement of Russian aerial bombs. In other words, the occupiers are hitting the city only because they can. — They tried to use them in Zaporozhye, inflicted several blows with these bombs. It's a success for them. Unfortunately, for us this is the terror of the local civilian population, because civilians live in the center of Zaporozhye and we see how many losses and victims such strikes cause. the Russians saw that they were succeeding and terrorized Zaporizhzhia almost all week with these guided aerial bombs, Vladyslav Voloshyn emphasized.

Nothing is in vain if we remember Heroes: an art exhibition for the Day of Defenders of Ukraine open...	It was organized by the Department of Humanitarian Support of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine together with the National Union of Artists of Ukraine. The exhibition presents the works of three artists: People's Artist of Ukraine Viktor Kovtun, military serviceman Vasyl Telichka-Evert and Volodymyr Rebrov. All three artists were presented by the head of the NSHU Kostyantyn Chernyavskyi: — Viktor Ivanovich Kovtun — People's Artist of Ukraine, head of the Kharkiv organization of the Union. Viktor Ivanovych lives in Kharkiv, he has not left anywhere. He painted two portraits of fallen heroes, which after the end of the exhibition will be solemnly handed over to the families of the fallen as a sign of our respect. The second artist is Vasyl Telychko-Evert, a member of the NSHU and a military serviceman, who at the beginning of the large-scale invasion volunteered to join the ranks of the ZSU. Here are his works directly -from the trenches-. These are drawings of his fallen brothers. The third artist is Volodymyr Rebrov, a future member of the NSHU, who presented very interesting graphic works. They can be called both portraits and, at the same time, images of the souls of Ukrainian soldiers, Ukrainian heroes. The head of the NSHU noted that both oil painting and drawings in graphic techniques are presented at the exhibition. And although this exhibition is small, it touches every chord of the soul. Pain, courage, anger and pride of the Ukrainian people, love for the native land and faith in our inevitable Victory are concentrated in the pictures. — On the eve of the celebration of the holiday of defenders of Ukraine, it is a great honor for the NSHU to participate in this exhibition, which is dedicated to our defenders — those who died, and those who live and fight, — noted Kostyantyn Chernyavskyi. The senior soldier of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, artist Vasyl Telychko-Evert talked about his works: - These are images of my brothers, which were taken in a small album that was in a backpack. Unfortunately, you don't carry a sketchbook, paints, or brushes with you in your gear, but a notebook and a pencil were always with me. Here are the guys who left us. They were alive when I painted them, and now their earthly life is over. But, as our chaplain says, with God there are no dead - everyone is alive. Everyone has a choice how to spend their life. I am proud that I knew and was friends with these brothers of mine. Vasyl Telychko-Evert said that an exhibition of his sketches called -Diary- was held in the artist's house. — I redrew my entire platoon. These were life sketches - someone is cleaning a weapon, someone is resting after dressing and portrait sketches - who is laughing, who is serious, I already knew their characters. In general, I'm a painter and I've done painting exhibitions. And he began to use pencil and paper only with the beginning of a large-scale war. Therefore, it is a diary, and an artist's diary is not always written. It is visual. I did not plan to make an exhibition of them, but the impetus to exhibit these works was the fact that the boys were gone. This is a tribute. Volodymyr Rebrov had his own motivation to create: — I draw war with a pencil on paper. There are eight works in this exhibition, and in total I have about 400 of them. These are paintings that convey some kind of emotion that every Ukrainian felt. They are colorless: only two colors are present - yellow and blue. This emphasis is immediately visible in the works. On the first day, there was a feeling of desperation, no one was prepared for what was happening. As an artist, I had to have some kind of anchor to keep me from going crazy. I ran to the subway, taking with me sheets of paper and a pencil. It became my personal salvation. When I started posting these works on social networks (I posted my first drawing on February 26, 2022), they were actively shared, and I realized that this was saving not only me, but also many Ukrainians. The artist is sure that in these drawings there is a chronicle of a large-scale war from the beginning to the present day. He published two volumes of the book -War through the eyes of a Ukrainian artist- with poems by poets and portraits of heroes. Currently preparing for printing the third volume, which will be released at the end of December. - In these works, I honored heroes, supported cities that suffered, or simply wanted to show what a special people we are - beautiful, courageous, brave. I believe that one day there will be a place where I could show all these paintings at the same time, said Volodymyr Rebrov. At the opening of the exhibition, relatives of fallen heroes Danylo Podybayl, a soldier of the 128th battalion of the 112th brigade of the Russian Army, and Nina Kvashi, a combat medic of the 5th company of the 2nd battalion of the 72nd OMbr named after the Black Zaporozhets, who were portrayed by Vasyl Kovtun, were present. The mother of the deceased, Maria Podybailo, thanked the artists and the organizers of the exhibition for the fact that they engrave the memory in the ages: - Nothing is in vain if we remember our Heroes. These portraits are a type of a large number of warriors. They are all Heroes - both those who are alive and those who have fallen. There is no need to separate them, Maria Podybailo concluded. The exhibition will continue in the premises of the Central House of the Armed Forces of Ukraine until October 13.

About this on the air of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon and the national telethon -The only news- Colonel Vitaly Sarantsev, spokesman of Kharkiv OTU, told. — The enemy went on the defensive there. He builds fortification equipment, arranges his positions for personnel, firing positions for means of destruction. Also, in some places, it conducts remote demining with -Pelyustka- mines and anti-tank mines, he said. Also, the enemy performs an internal rotation, evacuating casualties and bringing new fresh forces into position. — In these directions, the enemy conducts internal rotation, that is, there are personnel who performed certain combat tasks and now the enemy is evacuating current losses and also recruiting new personnel. This does not speak of any significant accumulation of any groups. This is a normal rotation, this is a replenishment of the current incomplete team, he said. At the same time, the military officer emphasized that the Russians are carrying out these and other measures precisely with the aim of resuming offensive actions. — The enemy receives provisions, receives ammunition wherever he can. He is building up the communication system, he is building up the control system, he is making wire communication there. This indicates that sooner or later the enemy will create the conditions for an assault and will continue its offensive actions again, Vitaliy Sarantsev said. Also, the occupiers are intensifying aerial reconnaissance with the aim of identifying the positions and routes of movement of the fighters of the Defense Forces of Ukraine and inflicting fire damage on them. At the same time, the Ukrainian military hinders the actions of the occupiers by all available means, in particular by destroying their shelters. In the operational information of OTU -Kharkiv- every day there are dozens of such destroyed enemy positions. - They are constantly building fortification equipment, constantly building some kind of fortifications for personnel - trenches, covered gaps, dugouts - this is really the case. But, at the same time, we also monitor their actions and, if you read our messages, we destroy several dozen shelters of enemy personnel every day, and sometimes together with the enemy. For this, both artillery and unmanned aerial vehicles - FPV drones are used. . Earlier, ArmyInform reported that vidmovyvsya/->the enemy suspended offensive actions north of Kharkiv in the Hlyboke-Lyptsi area, but did not abandon previous plans.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/30/pidgotuvatysya-do-shturmiv-v-zsu-nazvaly-golovne-zavdannya-okupantiv-na-pivnochi-harkivshhyny/	2024-09-30T08:27:05-07:00

Vadim Mysnyk, the spokesman of OTU -Siversk-, drew attention to this on the broadcast of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon. — The situation is changing, some units can be replaced, but this does not give anything in terms of quantity.

So we're continuing our operation, carrying out the command's tasks, and I think we'll see the results in the near future, he said. The military noted that the front for the enemy is also stretched for tens and hundreds of kilometers, so he is forced to control it along its entire length, moving units to certain areas for this purpose. — For them, it is tens and hundreds of kilometers, and they are also forced to make certain movements, taking into account the transport infrastructure and the natural features of the area, such as rivers, forests, and so on, the spokesman explained. He said that on the opposite side of the battle line, the Russians are forced to field units of varying quality, which are not always properly trained and staffed, may not have any combat experience. - On the other side of the border, there are units of various types - both conscripts and border guards, as was the case in Kurshchyna, and quite a few combat units are arriving.

- Sweet couple: neighbors for setting fire to a military car - shines - 10 years behind bars	This is reported by the SBU. The impersonators turned out to be a 24-year-old local resident and her 40-year-old neighbor, who were looking for quick money on the Internet. -The woman was approached by a hostile representative and offered money in exchange for her cooperation. The main targets of the enemy were military vehicles that were undergoing maintenance in Prykarpattia after completing combat missions at the front,- the Security Service of Ukraine says. In order not to search for and burn these cars herself, the accused involved an accomplice. When going -on the job-, the attacker followed the steps of the conspiracy: he acted in the dark, hid his face and wore protective gloves. However, such measures did not help the attacker. The arsonist himself and his accomplice were arrested in hot pursuit after setting fire to a camouflaged minibus. During the searches, mobile phones were seized from the detainees, which they used to coordinate their criminal actions and communicate with the customer. On the basis of the received evidence, the investigators of the Security Service notified both henchmen of the Russian Federation of suspicion under part 2 of Art. 194 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (intentional damage to property by arson).

-Solntsepyok- due to image defeat: Aggregate plant became the number one target for the occupiers in...	The reasons for the fixation of Russians at the Vovchan Aggregate Plant on the air of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon and the national telethon -The only news- explained the spokesman of OTU -Kharkiv-, Colonel Vitaly Sarantsev. — After the Defense Forces liberated this facility, it became the number one target for the Russian occupiers. They have concentrated all their firepower on this location, they are inflicting fire damage with all the available weapons and with the use of the TOS-1A heavy flamethrower system, and they have also dropped aerial bombs on it, he said. The spokesman said that, in addition to shelling, the enemy is also trying to storm the plant. -We understand the importance of this object for the Russian occupiers, who will continue to try with all their might and using every opportunity to get there,- said the military officer. The officer explained why the Defense Forces' resumption of control over this facility hit the enemy hard. - First, it expanded our area of ​​control over this part of the city. This allowed us to more actively carry out certain logistics activities. And, of course, this caused a certain psychological effect for the enemy, who is demoralized in a certain way, said Vitaly Sarantsev. The spokesman explained that the loss of the plant was a powerful image blow for the enemy. -The events that took place in Vovchansk made a depressing impression on him, so we are observing the deterioration of the enemy's moral and psychological state,- he said. In view of this, the enemy is trying to recapture the plant at any cost. — The adversary tries to establish new units, tries to carry out internal rotation. He is replacing the personnel who performed combat missions there, replacing them with fresh forces, fresher and more prepared to continue assault operations in that direction, the spokesman said. At the same time, he noted, it is currently about intensifying Russian shelling and replacing the enemy's personnel without significantly increasing their number. Instead, units of the Defense Forces take all appropriate measures to arrange reliable defense of the plant. — This object is under our control with all security measures being observed so that we do not suffer losses in personnel and weapons, the spokesman of the Kharkiv OTU emphasized. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that Russian commanders sentenced the soldiers to a senseless death at the Vovchansk Plant, trying to hold the object with the help of sabotage, starvation and execution of soldiers. ArmyInform also informed, how many occupiers were captured during the restoration of control of the Defense Forces over the territory of the Vovchan Aggregate Plant, and explained that part of the personnel of the Russian invaders is demoralized by the fact that the Russian army lost the plant.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/30/solnczepokom-po-imidzhevij-porazczi-u-vovchansku-czillyu-nomer-odyn-dlya-okupantiv-stav-agregatnyj-zavod/	2024-09-30T07:04:45-07:00

About how the Russian military arranges trenches, passages and tunnels on the broadcast of the marathon -Suspilne Novosti- Colonel Vitaly Sarantsev, the spokesman of Kharkiv OTU, said. — The practice of building underground tunnels is not new. The opponent previously resorted to it in other directions and even raised the issue of introducing additional small departments or units in the units that will deal with these works. In their opinion, this is a quite effective tool that allows you to carry out covert engineering work and then move personnel between certain locations, he said. The Ukrainian military observed the enemy's installation of underground passageways and tunnels in the urban development of Vovchansk last week and took appropriate measures to force the Russians to stop these actions. - We observed these actions of the enemy last week, at the moment I have no information about their continued actions, because we have taken certain measures to force them to stop. At the moment, I do not know whether these actions are already taking place in some other areas, the spokesman said. He emphasized that the enemy is constantly learning and resorting to non-standard actions with the aim of accomplishing the invading tasks assigned to him, and also told how the occupiers are setting up underground communications. — Works are done manually. Roughly speaking, they go into a building where there is some basement, where it still remains, and try to dig into the side of another building from this basement. In this way, they try to move from building to building in order to accumulate personnel there and in the future to carry out some assault actions. That is, only human labor is used, - explained Vitaly Sarantsev. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that Russian invaders resorted to -mole tactics- in Vovchansk and dug tunnels, why do the Russians need underground passages and told how the invaders tried to hold the plant in Vovchansk with the help of undermining, starvation and the execution of soldiers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/30/lizut-po-pidvalah-yak-rosiyany-oblashtovuyut-pidkopy-tuneli-ta-pidzemni-hody-u-vovchansku/	2024-09-30T05:56:49-07:00

Faced with an enemy tank at close range and survived! The anti-tanker - Moisei - told about his amaz...	About the soldier was told on September 30 Airborne assault troops of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. On his personal account are 15 units of destroyed enemy equipment and dozens of Russian vehicles that went to a -concert- in Kobzon. Another three dozen pieces of equipment were destroyed by his subordinates, for whom their commander is a mentor and a leader, for whom they are ready to go through fire and water. -We were driving along the field road to MTLB when we saw a tank coming towards us. It was a long way to the front, so we were sure that it was our equipment. But when they compared it to a formidable combat vehicle, and saw a -zetka- on board, they realized with horror whose it really was,- says -Moisei-. The crew of the enemy tank did not immediately find out that they had crossed paths with Ukrainian equipment on the road, and this gave the Sicheslav paratroopers a small chance for salvation. -The Russian tankers, it seems, didn't quite know where they were, that's why they didn't immediately shoot our transporter at the entrance. We had time to drive away from them a little more, after which I ordered to hurry up and hide in a ravine near the road. Running into the landing nearby was, in my opinion, reckless,- the paratrooper explains. The tank eventually noticed that they had missed the Ukrainian MTLB, so they quickly turned around the steel monster and shot the paratroopers' multi-purpose tractor with two shots, which caught fire and started burning. After that, a large-caliber machine gun began to abundantly, but in vain, pour a hail of lead on the empty landing, where, in the opinion of the enemy tankers, Ukrainian fighters were hiding. According to Moisei, this happened in March 2022 near Avdiivka. Then the anti-tankers were saved by a seeming miracle and, undoubtedly, by the coolness of their commander, who did not lose his temper in a difficult situation, but acted clearly, as befits a well-trained military leader. Moses also remembers well his first miraculous rescue, which happened to him in the distant 2014. He was then a private soldier in one of the Dnipropetrovsk military units. -It was necessary to get out of the surrounded Ilovaisk. There was no confidence that we would be able to do it. But our unit succeeded: the combatant then made several correct decisions, which actually saved us: yes, there were wounded during the exit, but everyone returned alive. Then I understood for the rest of my life what an experienced commander at the head of a unit means,- says Moisei. In the fall of 2022, he had to escape certain death for the third time. It happened in the Kharkiv Region, near Yampolivka, when the Siecheslavs were chasing the Russians, liberating Ukrainian towns and villages. Then his anti-tank calculation took up a position near the village, preparing to destroy any equipment that tried to leave it. But the Russian Ural with infantry in some strange way managed to jump out of the settlement unnoticed, after which he began to drive into the rear of Moisei's anti-tank calculation. The situation was then saved by the crew of the Czechoslovak UAV, which noticed the approach of the enemy's equipment in time and reported the danger of its anti-tank gunners. Having changed their position in a flash, the paratroopers under the command of Moses attacked the enemy Ural with infantry. Then they destroyed four more trucks of the occupiers, one of which, after being hit by an anti-tank missile, set off good fireworks, because it was completely filled with ammunition. The paratrooper is philosophical about his amazing rescues. -Just hoping for a miracle in an extreme combat situation is hopeless. First of all, you need to rely on yourself and your comrades, know your military specialty well and learn to master your emotions, no matter how difficult it may be - this is exactly what can save a soldier's life. That's why I tell my subordinates to never relax, but to constantly prepare, because luck, although a -lady- and capricious, loves the learned and brave,- says Moisei. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the 25th Sicheslav Airborne Brigade of the Airborne Forces of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine using the Ratel S platform -z-desyatkom-rosiyan/->destroyed an underground passage with enemy personnel near Novogrodivka. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/30/zitnuvsya-z-vorozhym-tankom-vprytul-i-vyzhyv-protytankist-mojsej-rozpoviv-pro-svoyi-dyvovyzhni-poryatunky/	2024-09-30T05:16:58-07:00
Probing defenses and terrorizing civilians: Russian DRGs operate in the North	About what the Russian saboteurs are doing on the northern border of Ukraine on the broadcast of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon the spokesman told OTU -Siversk- Vadym Mysnyk. — The threat is not going anywhere, the activity of using DRG remains. But, in view of the fact that the border is a front line with all the relevant features, the use of the DRG here is not always optimal for them, he noted. Also, the Defense Forces actively use technical means to detect enemy saboteurs in a timely manner. However, there are isolated cases of attempted penetration of Russian DRGs into the territory of Ukraine. Their tasks remain traditional — probing the Ukrainian defense zone and terrorizing civilians. - The tasks are the same. They check our lane and defense system. And they also terrorize the local population. There were many cases when they destroyed the cars of civilians, and the civilians themselves were destroyed. If they have the opportunity, they carried out such attacks, - explained Vadym Mysnyk. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that Defense Forces forced the enemy to practically abandon the use of DRG in Sumshchyna, therefore minuvanni-misczevosti/->Russian saboteurs on the northern border focused on mining the area.

Thanks to cooperation with Denmark, Ukraine received a new efficient method of producing modern weap...	About this informs September 30 Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. The Armed Forces have already received the first samples of artillery manufactured within the framework of this cooperation. The first joint project was the production of Bohdan self-propelled artillery units for the Ukrainian army. Financing was provided by the Danish government. During the visit of Danish Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen to Kyiv, Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Dmytro Klimenkov discussed with a foreign delegation such a format of support for the Ukrainian defense-industrial complex. Dmytro Klimenkov also described how the -Danish model- of supporting the Ukrainian defense industry works: The main selection criterion is compliance with the priorities of the Armed Forces. -The -Danish model- is a cheap and effective approach to the production of modern weapons and ammunition. The world currently lacks the capacity to produce more weapons, so it is very important that the Danes are now helping to modernize the Ukrainian military industry,- noted Dmytro Klimenkov. According to him, for Ukraine this is defense independence and an investment in the economy. -We have our own facilities, technology is shared with us. Localized defense production in Ukraine will allow not only to reduce dependence on foreign supplies, but also to respond more flexibly to the needs of the front, quickly adapting the production of weapons to the requirements of hostilities,- he said. Dmytro Klimenkov called on other partner states to scale up the -Danish model- and join the initiative. As reported by ArmyInform, Denmark invests almost 600 million euros to strengthen the defense industry of Ukraine. Of which 175 million euros will be allocated by the Government. Another 400 million euros will come from surplus profits of frozen Russian assets.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/30/ukrayina-otrymala-novyj-efektyvnyj-sposib-vyrobnycztva-suchasnoyi-zbroyi-zavdyaky-spivrobitnycztvu-z-daniyeyu/	2024-09-30T04:50:50-07:00

But, at the same time, he carries out engineering equipment of positions, arranges firing positions, tries to conduct aerial reconnaissance with the aim of identifying units of the defense forces and inflicting fire damage, he said. In the area of ​​the Krasne point of the Lipetsk community, the enemy resorted to remote mining of roads with the help of UAVs. On the possible routes of the advancement of units of the Defense Forces, the enemy mines the roads with anti-tank mines and installs -Petal- and POM-2 anti-personnel mines. -The enemy has increased aerial reconnaissance with the aim of detecting units of the Defense Forces and is trying to identify our routes of movement in order to try to inflict fire damage in the future,- the spokesman said.

They were preparing a series of terrorist attacks against the command of the Armed Forces: a residen...	About this informs September 30, the Security Service of Ukraine. In the spring of 2023, attackers were preparing a series of terrorist attacks against the command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and SBU special agents who are carrying out combat missions on the southern front. -To do this, the agents monitored the places of temporary bases and the movement routes of Ukrainian defenders in the territory of the region,- the report says. They sent the received information to the FSB via messenger in the form of markings of military facilities on Google maps with a detailed description and photos. -According to the received coordinates, the occupiers planned to carry out targeted strikes using missile weapons,- the SBU explained. The FSB was also preparing a plan for the physical elimination of Ukrainian servicemen through the activation of explosive devices that were to be installed in the areas where the Defense Forces are concentrated. To prepare terrorist attacks, the enemy agency received money from its Russian curators, which went to the bank details of the group's resident. SBU counter-intelligence agents exposed the agents in advance, documented their crimes step by step, and detained them during a special operation in Zaporizhzhia in early May 2023. As the investigation established, the resident of the group turned out to be a 52-year-old local resident.

Four -chimneys- DRG: the NATO instructor -didn't smoke- what happened. BZVP in Britain	However, the main principles of actions of subversive and reconnaissance groups and basic skills should be possessed by all fighters. Therefore, during basic military training, close attention is also paid to this component. The correspondent of ArmiyaInform told about how Ukrainian mobilized people are taught to set up ambushes during the BZVP training within the borders of the Interflex multinational training mission on the territory of Great Britain. Today, our unit is a sabotage and reconnaissance group in the enemy's near rear or -gray zone- between our and the enemy's positions. The combat mission of the DRG is to ambush an enemy vehicle. According to intelligence data, she should travel along a known route at a certain time. Quietly Came, Quietly Gone is only half of us. According to the conditions of the task, we really have to come quietly, stealthily and quickly, but then make a good noise by destroying the enemy target. After that, you should just as quickly and silently dissolve in the forest and leave without loss to the pre-determined assembly point. We are practicing the task for the fourth or fifth time already - I have already lost my mind. It is already dusk in the forest, it will soon be evening and it will be time to leave for the base. By the end of the fourth day of the field trip with continuous intensity from 5 in the morning to 10 in the evening, I had practically no strength left - I am holding on to moral and willpower. And I'm not alone. After another workout, which was again somewhat improved compared to the previous one, we all hoped that this was the last exit and that we would finally be given some rest before leaving for the base. However, the instructor has other plans - the transport is due to arrive in an hour and a half, so we will have plenty of time to polish our skills one more time. This time, we advance to the road where the enemy SUV should pass. In a line-out division, I get a position on the extreme left flank. I was moved here from another position closer to the center of the right wing, where I already knew every tree, bush, hole and hump. On the edge of the left flank, everything is unknown, so you will have to act as if for the first time - just like in real combat conditions. This is one of the important elements of training - we are constantly changing places in the group during the exercises. This allows you to acquire the necessary skills to act in different positions. We quickly prepare - we fill stores, check and repair equipment, some update the damaged in the previous release of camouflage. The instructor gives smoke grenades to four of us - two on the extreme flanks and two in the center. One of them goes to me. I examine the ammunition, I remember the procedure for bringing the check into combat readiness. At a brief meeting, we receive introductions - the identification of an enemy vehicle and the probable time and route of its movement. We determine the order of advance, the moment of opening fire on the target for the task of destroying the enemy's vehicle, and the order of actions when withdrawing. Choose your current location as the gathering point after completing the mission. The DRG commander and the unit commander this time are one and the same fighter. Despite the mandatory rotation, when everyone in the group becomes the commander in turn, it is he who commands most often and we are happy to accept it. It was not by chance that he was appointed to head the department - out of all of us, he is the best fit for this role. During quieter training exercises, when everyone is fresh and energetic, he demands that he be traded for other fighters so that everyone can try themselves in the role of commander. However, this is a final assessment session to show what we have learned. Besides, everyone is dead tired, so he will be in command himself. We are moving forward. We have to get to the edge of the forest quickly, silently and inconspicuously. Despite the first faint twilight, it is not an easy task - you have to crawl through a thicket of nettles. Those who fall into areas of a prickly blackberry-like shrub fare the worst. However, we get to the firing line in time and send a signal of readiness from the edges to the center, where the commander is. I see two brothers on the right who pick up and transmit my signal from the flank to the center. In the forest, it is a lot of luck to see not only the nearest neighbor, but also the second one behind him. Our chosen positions combine protection with camouflage. How to achieve this, we were taught in several previous classes. It is not easy in the forest, but the instructors are generally satisfied with the result - each of us found a good shelter. The distance between fighters within 12-15 meters is also quite acceptable. Now we have to wait. Being able to do this is also an important element of preparation. At this time, we should rest, but not relax our vigilance in order to instantly react to any change in the situation. At the end of the fourth grueling day, this is especially difficult to do, but we hang on. Visibility is deteriorating. I have a particularly hard time with this with two pairs of glasses, tactical on top of medical. However, the car with the fog lights on is impossible not to notice - it appears from where, where it is expected. The SUV drives slowly, enters a turn cautiously, as if a predatory animal is sneaking along a forest path. As soon as the car of the conditional enemy turns, we make the first aggressive salvo. The forest is undermined by the sounds of mass firing. 5-7 quick shots from eight fighters at close range are capable of dealing critical damage to an unarmored target. Punctured wheels, broken glass, a body riddled with dozens of bullets - and the car is out of order. The SUV stops and activates the emergency horn. This means that the mission is complete - the enemy transport is destroyed. In real life, it would most likely explode and catch fire, because there were more than enough hits in the area of ​​​​the tank, when after the first 50-60 shots we made about the same amount, but slower and more aimed. Now our task is to withdraw without loss to a pre-determined assembly point. Keeping quiet no longer makes sense, because after the massive fire from the forest thicket, the enemy definitely knows about our presence. So now we can not only give visual signs to the neighbor, but also, if necessary, echo with him. However, it is inconvenient to shout from more than 20 meters away to my brother, with whom we have to throw smoke grenades at the same time. So we communicate with signs. I see that he communicates not only with me, but also with his neighbors on the right, coordinating the moment of the throw with them as well. Our -chimneys- fly out and start smoking at the same time as two more on the right flank. If there was any time gap between the throws, it was only a fraction of a second. We wait until the grenades work at full power and begin to leave after the dense smoke envelops the entire forest edge. At the assembly point, the main instructor for this class is already waiting for us, who at the same time is also the main supervisor of our platoon. -I don't know Ukrainian and I didn't understand how you managed to establish communication so masterfully, but the simultaneous first volley and the throwing of smoke grenades are impressive - you did it perfectly,- he says. The instructor notes that this level of communication is a very important achievement and we must do the same on the battlefield when we return to Ukraine. -Do the same- is the highest praise from him, because he usually talks about what, where, and how exactly we need to improve. Exhausted but satisfied, we set off for camp. Before the arrival of the buses, it is still necessary to check the equipment and move all the things. But these, with the exception of cleaning weapons and personal matters, are the last tasks for today. Tomorrow we are promised a day off - there is also a day off within the borders of the Interflex multinational training mission on the territory of Great Britain. True, they take place -according to the scheduled schedule of the weekend-, but that is a completely different story.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/30/chotyry-dymovuhy-drg-instruktor-nato-ne-vkuryv-shho-stalos-bzvp-v-brytaniyi/	2024-09-29T20:51:40-07:00
Winged by the sea: an attack drone that accelerates on water up to 70 km per hour was presented in P...	As said the developers of this device from PMG, a long-range unmanned system concept that they produced, has advantages over marine analogues due to its built-in autonomy program, low energy consumption, high speed, the ability to move over waves, an inconspicuous water trail that a watercraft leaves behind, as well as low thermal and acoustic signatures, ArmyInform reports. In turn, the authors of site mil.in.ua who visited the Polish Military exhibition stand Group, deployed within the MSPO 2024 defense industry exhibition in Kielce, learned that this drone can carry a 50-kilogram warhead. The design of ReconSea (the name of which can be translated from English as -Sea Scout-) uses the technology of -underwater wings-, which is exotic for the niche of profile drones, represented by three hydrodynamic surfaces directed downwards and a motor submerged under water. At the same time, PMG said that the performance of their device is affected by its high water resistance. The use of a foil design, in which the drone glides over the water like hydrofoils, provides greater independence from weather conditions, but also reduces the detection of a barrage drone due to its quiet movement and minimal footprint left on the water. This, in turn, makes it difficult for enemy units to detect and detonate the drone, which may want to immobilize it. The downward hydrodynamic surfaces of the wings allow the drone to rise to a height of 50 to 80 centimeters above the water at high speeds. This technology reduces water resistance, which contributes to the development of a maximum speed of up to 70 km/h, while ensuring stability and controllability even in the presence of significant turbulence at sea. The drone is equipped with a 9 kW electric motor that provides a range of up to 100 km at cruising speed, making it ideal for extended operations on the water. ReconSea can work both in stand-alone and manual mode. In the autonomous mode, the control is carried out due to the inertial navigation system with the possibility of satellite correction, which allows the drone to independently perform complex maneuvers and avoid obstacles. In manual mode, operators can control the drone via a fiber-optic cable, providing a high level of precision and agility during missions. Polish Military Group is developing its own ecosystem for integrating drones into a single coordinated network. This will allow in the future to create swarms of drones that work in synchronous mode to perform joint combat missions. Such coordination will open up new opportunities for the application of ReconSea in tactical and strategic military operations. Company representatives said that the sample presented at the exhibition is only a prototype that is undergoing research tests. They plan to complete the tests in a few months, presenting a refined model.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/30/okrylenyj-morem-u-polshhi-predstavyly-udarnyj-dron-shho-rozganyayetsya-na-vodi-do-70-km-za-godynu/	2024-09-29T20:42:20-07:00
In the swamps, they cry about soldiers without kidneys: lies about -black transplantology-	Of course, this is just a lie. It is part of a multi-year campaign called -black transplantology-, which Moscow has been conducting since 2014. For example, in August, the same pro-Kremlin media, citing the same so-called Mykolaiv underground, spread lies about mysterious -black transplant specialists- who arrived from the West and drive mysterious -foreign medical vehicles- in the Sumy region. And in September - about the fact that allegedly Ukrainian children with disabilities are illegally exported to the countries of the European Union to be sold for organs. At one time, the Center for countering disinformation at the NSDC made a large analytical study on this topic, where he described in detail more than 13 thousand (!) similar Russian throws from 2014. The -black transplant- campaign is one of the most savage and beloved -in the swamps.- They invented underground clinics, selling organs in exchange for tanks, and satanic networks of kindergartens - a lot of nonsense that could not be born in the heads of adequate people. And the purpose of such fakes is quite simple: to discredit the Ukrainian military and political leadership and to create a negative image of Ukraine on the international arena. Fake artists try to primitively play on emotions, causing negativity towards everything related to Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/30/na-bolotah-volayut-pro-vijskovyh-bez-nyrok-brehnya-pro-chornu-transplantologiyu/	2024-09-29T20:30:26-07:00

The story of the rescue of four wounded: combat medic Yulian told the details	Under what circumstances can a medic be injured at the front? But what depends on the survival of the injured person during evacuation? Military serviceman Yulian told our correspondent: -I became a doctor in the army, because in civilian life I also practiced medicine. 18 years of experience. Although at first he was an ordinary shooter for a week or two. Then they saw that I was understanding, so they appointed me as a platoon medic. &#8230;Once one of the groups of our brigade was on a mission, they were wounded on the way out. There were four servicemen in the group, not all of them could go out on their own. As soon as I heard about it, I immediately said that I would go and get them. According to the data transmitted over the walkie-talkie, the enemy worked hard on that group. We went to the evacuation together. On the spot, they saw that one of our soldiers had broken legs, others were wounded, some in the stomach, some in the chest. I was hurt too&#8230; It was in the Robotyny district. We then went to evacuate our fellow man. We were immediately spotted, they began to cover us with a mortar. Then they saw that we are not afraid of them, and they already started working on us with drones. And, unfortunately, one caught up with us. I received a wound in my arm - an artery was hit, and shrapnel entered the liver, intestine, and right leg. First put a tourniquet on the arm. He was on me for 5 minutes, then I put on an Israeli bandage, and then slowly began to loosen the tourniquet. And constantly watched so that the bleeding did not resume. I am currently rehabilitating after my injury. &#8230;In general, in military medicine, it always turns out that every minute during assistance is worth its weight in gold. For those medics who are just going to the front, I advise you to pay special attention to analgesia, dressings, and applying a tourniquet. Well, of course, not everything always depends on the doctor, because a lot depends on the evacuation transport. If the driver is experienced, motorable, if he clearly navigates the situation, then this increases the chances of saving the injured person.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/29/istoriya-poryatunku-chotyroh-poranenyh-bojovyj-medyk-yulian-rozpoviv-detali/	2024-09-28T20:43:53-07:00
Putin's nuclear blackmail is a bluff, or How the enemy cleverly manipulates terms	He said, a -critical threat- to Russia's sovereignty, even with conventional weapons, would be grounds for a nuclear response. Such statements are obviously heard in the Kremlin, when it is necessary to warm up the electorate, to raise the rating after another failure or crossing of previously declared -red lines- by the Defense Forces of Ukraine. But Putin's nuclear threats are no longer working even in the West, where similar statements no longer cause such a stir as before. In Ukraine, they are generally treated with irony, because Russian propaganda and threats have not worked here for a long time. -Putin's nuclear blackmail is a fear of Ukrainian weapons, which deprives the Russian Federation of strategic weapons depots, harms Putin's ability to continue terror . This is a horror film about fear. Nothing more,- said Lieutenant Andriy Kovalenko, head of the CSDP of the NSDC. Everyone has already perfectly understood how the katsaps cunningly manipulate terms, for example: war is theirs; arrival - debris; explosion - bang; terrorist - foreign specialist. With the help of changing names, they can twist their legislation like a dam they have to. For example, they wrote in their doctrine that a nuclear warhead will fly over all countries that launch UAVs on the territory of the Russian Federation. This caused general euphoria and a wave of -victory -. The next day, the UAV flies to Moscow, hits a high-rise building under the action of EW. The average katsaps hunkered down in anticipation of the promised nuclear attack on the Western aggressor, turned on the televisions, and there some governor says: -a UFO flew over us today.- In other words, there is no reason to use a kernel. Similar threats with a kernel have already burst like soap bubbles many times. When our army sank the Moscow fleet, when it destroyed enemy warehouses and military facilities in the Crimea, when it attacked oil refineries... In the end, when the Armed Forces entered the -originally Russian- Kursk region, all previous repeated threats of nuclear weapons turned out to be the same bubble. It turned out that the dictator is not capable, as he promised, -to use all the means that are at our disposal to protect Russia and our people,- and called everything that is happening there just -large-scale provocation.- So even now, the only thing that the Kremlin's powerful and aging dwarf wants to achieve with his threats is to disrupt Western support for Ukraine. After all, they sound against the background of the discussion about whether the West can allow Ukraine to strike with long-range weapons on the territory of the Russian Federation. Maybe And in the end it will allow.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/29/yadernyj-shantazh-putina-cze-blef-abo-yak-vorog-hytro-manipulyuye-terminamy/	2024-09-28T20:31:06-07:00
40 units of enemy equipment are affected! Continuation of the epic battle in Kharkiv region	The video appeared on September 28 on the channel of the 92nd brigade's Achilles air defense battalion. -In the area of ​​Pishchany, the enemy resorted to a mechanized assault with the involvement of more than 50 units of heavy equipment. It was the largest offensive that the unit had to repulse, which only emphasizes the priority of the enemy's goal - the exit to the Oskil River,- the battalion commented on the video. The 92nd brigade, as well as units of the 77th Airmobile Brigade of the Russian Air Force, the First Operational Brigade of the NSU -Bureviy-, and the 43rd Mechanized Brigade took part in the repulse of the assault. -We inflicted critical losses on the enemy even before his equipment approached our positions, thereby disrupting his plans. On September 26, the ACHILLES air defense missile battalion had 40 units of damaged and destroyed equipment in the Kupyansk direction alone, where every episode was recorded,- the battalion noted. The current video is the second part. The first part can be viewed here. As reported by ArmyInform, the crew of the Achilles air defense missile battalion of the 92nd separate assault brigade named after the basket commander Ivan Sirk hit the Russian self-propelled gun 2C5 -Hyacinth-S-.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/28/40-odynycz-vorozhoyi-tehniky-urazheno-prodovzhennya-epichnogo-boyu-na-harkivshhyni/	2024-09-28T11:31:50-07:00
Evacuation by quad bikes: combat medics told how they save the wounded in Donetsk region	Report spread by the -Return Alive- fund on September 26. The commander of the evacuation group with the call sign Sokil in civilian life was a traumatologist, he was the director of a city hospital in Prykarpattia. He says that during work in the Bakhmut direction, it was necessary, in particular, to first evacuate the military with a quad bike and then transfer them to an evacuation vehicle. -Boys on landings, if possible, take them to where the ATV can still go. Because he doesn't always have the opportunity to drive around &#8211; everything is so full of craters from the explosions... We wait for the ATV to bring us the wounded, we pick him up, stabilize him if necessary, and when he is in better condition, we take him to the stabilization point,- says Sokil. The driver of such an evacuation quad bike with the call sign -Mavka- says that the distance from the point where the wounded person is taken to the point of transfer to the evacuation vehicle can be up to 5 kilometers. -We drive in the zone serious fire control of the enemy with mortars, drones, artillery. Then we transfer it to the car, there the intensity of enemy fire is already a little lower, but still there are no guarantees,- says -Mavka-. He recalls that during the evacuation, the wounded from Bakhmut were evacuated by car. There was no need for a quad bike there, because it was an asphalt hard surface. -And here are the fields. Mobility, inconspicuousness, minimal dimensions are required here. Because if the evacuation is going by car, it is a minimum of three people. The machine is large, less maneuverable, it is much easier to beat it with the same ATGM, artillery. And the target, accordingly, is fatter: because it can lead either a lot of BC or a lot of infantry. a quadricycle &#8211; you go alone, and the target is no longer so fat,- says Mavka. The difficulty of night evacuation, in the words of the military, is the saturation of the sky with enemy drones. -They see everyone who comes in and who comes out. When you don't get shot at, it's probably a lucky coincidence. Maybe the battery in the drone died or they were cleaning the mortar at that moment. That is, these coincidences give you the opportunity to work in silence. Even a year ago, there were not so many drones, it was possible to work much easier. Now every second is everything. You can't struggle, fall, turn over in the pits. You feel a constant responsibility and burden, because you understand that you can't go anywhere from the field, especially with a wounded person,- Mavka states. Other difficulties of night evacuation include poor visibility or eruptions, from , for example, KABA, 5 meters deep. The price of a quad bike on which you can evacuate is approximately 370,000 hryvnias.

Shell, charge, shot! Armed forces are in place! — our stormtroopers shot a clip about their exploits	The video appeared on September 28 on the battalion channel. -One more year together. The most difficult areas of the front, historical operations. The team!-, the battalion captioned the clip. As reported by ArmyInform, on Russian television the 225th assault battalion of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which made another breakthrough of the border of the Russian Federation, was called elite and equipped with -the best Western equipment-. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/28/snaryad-zaryad-postril-zsu-na-misczi-nashi-shturmovyky-znyaly-klip-pro-svoyi-zvytyagy/	2024-09-28T10:36:20-07:00
- Threatening - the rhetoric of the Russian Federation about nuclear weapons begins to lose its mean...	This opinion was expressed by the head of the Council of Reservists of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Ivan Tymochko on the air of Suspilnyi on September 28 , answering the presenter's question about how much Ukrainians should be afraid of such statements. -Now Russian rhetoric is beginning to lose its meaning and threatening color after a non-nuclear country (Ukraine) conducted a successful military operation on the territory of the nuclear state of the Russian Federation. I mean Kurshchyna. All theories and analyzes that were previously evaluated (and these were just theories, because after Hiroshima and Nagasaki there were no nuclear strikes on the territory of sovereign countries) were considered as such that a nuclear country would use at least tactical nuclear weapons. But, as we can see, they did not apply it, they did not know at all what to do with it,- commented Ivan Tymochko. He also recalled that the power of warehouse explosions in the Russian Toropts, according to various estimates, was approximately 30 kilotons. -And one tactical nuclear bomb is 10 kilotons. That is, roughly speaking, we will say that two full-fledged tactical nuclear bombs exploded there&#8230; And we understand that a nuclear bomb is also accompanied by a radioactive background, contamination of territories. What am I leading to? Such an effect of the impact as the Russians imposed (that, they say, radioactive ash everywhere) did not occur. The power of the explosion does not pose a threat. In addition, there are no such concentrations of armed forces in modern conditions of war, as it was during the Second World War: when brigades, divisions, million-strong armies advanced,- Ivan Tymochko recounted. He stressed that a tactical nuclear strike on a military compound would have -very little effect.- -At the very least, it certainly won't change the course of events in specific directions, but it will cause a flurry of negativity. Apply to the civilian population? We understand that this will be the reaction of all nuclear countries, including China.- Ivan Tymochko reminded that China is one of the opponents of Russia's use of nuclear weapons. As reported by ArmyInform, all the statements of Vladimir Putin and Alexander Lukashenka about nuclear weapons -i-putina-pro-yadernu-zbroyu/->should be considered as a -single network of information campaign-.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/28/zagrozlyva-rytoryka-rf-pro-yadernu-zbroyu-pochynaye-vtrachaty-sens-pislya-operacziyi-zsu-na-kurshhyni/	2024-09-28T10:16:34-07:00
- Hit your own! - the Russians hit their own soldiers who were going to surrender	The video of another war crime by the occupiers was released on September 28 on the brigade's channel. During another assault in the Kurakhiv direction, the brigade, as well as neighbors on the flanks, stopped a convoy of enemy vehicles. The group of invaders was able to land in the landing, but after some time decided to surrender. Our drone accompanied her. But on the way, the occupiers killed their own. -Seven of them got off the landing. Just a catch. As soon as the pilots began to withdraw from the invaders, the Russian army conducted a valiant attack. On their own. A few were cut down well - not all of them fell into the good hands of our brigade,- the soldiers of the 33rd brigade commented on the impressive video. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the 33rd mechanized brigade showed how the operators of the anti-tank missile complex -Stugna- hit several units at once enemy armored vehicles.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/28/byej-svaih-rosiyany-vdaryly-po-svoyih-bijczyah-yaki-ishly-zdavatysya/	2024-09-28T10:10:26-07:00
Out of shit and sticks, our stormtroopers unpacked the enemy FPV drone	The video with the dissection of the FPV drone was released on September 28 on the battalion channel. The drone's ammunition was made from a pipe filled with explosives and metal balls wrapped in tape. -It's good that they do everything randomly, and this drone, the combat part of which is assembled from what -grandfather had in the garage-, just fell at the entrance to the dugout. It is good that we are far ahead in this direction, and the problems we are solving are increasing the effectiveness of the warhead and creating different types of projectiles for different tasks, and not where to ``steal a pipe to make an impressive element''. - commented on the video in the group. At the same time, the fighters of -Black Swan- are urged not to relax. -This does not mean that victory is tomorrow. This realization says that we are on the right track, but there is still a lot of hard work ahead,- the stormtroopers noted. As ArmiyaInform reported, on Russian television the 225th Assault Battalion of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which made another breakthrough at the border of the Russian Federation, called elite and equipped with -the best Western technique-.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/28/z-lajna-ta-palok-nashi-shturmovyky-provely-rozpakovku-vorozhogo-fpv-drona/	2024-09-28T10:02:46-07:00
-Partisan- on the occupiers — the new artillery system hits more accurately -Grada-	Photos of the -Partizan- combat test were published on the brigade's channel. -We developed it ourselves and with the help of volunteers. An expensive structure was welded for us, which was installed on a pickup truck. The pipes themselves, guides, were taken from the Russian trophy BM-21 -Grad-. Electronics were connected in the unit by themselves,- explains the jet battery commander Davyd. He controls the battle at the command post. The experience of working on the -Grady- allowed him to achieve the number of shots and the flight range of the projectile on the new installation. -The BM-21 has a long range - this is the principle of operation. With the new installation, we hit 4 out of 6 shells in the area of ​​the target. This is a good indicator. And the range was not affected at the same time - we work at the same distance as on ordinary -BMs-, &#8211; comments David. He noted that the firing was conducted deeper than the front edge of the landing, where the enemy's UAV calculations were hidden, which constantly harass the infantry with drops. The platoon commander Oleksandr, who directs the fire at the firing position, is happy: the machine is much smaller than the -Grad-. Therefore, it is easier to disguise it. -We can get closer to the demarcation line. Do not drive the installation far into the waiting area. If the target does not require the work of a whole package, we worked out 6 shells or less, and there is no need to drive a whole big machine,- says Oleksandr. The division plans to -bring the installation to perfection- and start work on a second similar machine. As reported by ArmyInform, the operators of the Black Raven 93 strike drone battalion of the Kholodny Yar mechanized brigade hit Russian transport.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/28/partyzanom-po-okupantah-nova-artylerijska-systema-bye-tochnishe-grada/	2024-09-28T09:44:33-07:00

Magical! Guardsmen showed how 52 million rubles are burning	The video of combat operation appeared on September 28 on the unit's channel. -52 million rubles turn into rubble in a few seconds. The T-72B3 tank, which should have been the pride of the Russian army, meets its fate at the hands of Ukrainian troops. An accurate shot, and armor no longer saves from justice.

-Soldier's path-: stories of the mobilization of Ukrainians gathered an audience of millions	This is reported by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. -The way of a soldier. Mobilization- is a reality project that looks behind the scenes of the mobilization process. It depicts the stories of three Ukrainians who decided to serve in the Armed Forces. During filming, the participants talked about difficulties, training, growth, facing the reality of war and going through all levels of training for service. Filming of the tape lasted for 2 months. The project was created with the assistance of the Ground Forces Command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the Main Directorate of Communications of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Borys Chekmaryov, nicknamed -The Philosopher-, half-jokingly calls himself -the face of mobilization- after participating in the project. Boris perceived the project as a challenge he set for himself. Commenting on his participation, he gave valuable advice to future military personnel: -It is worth remembering that the war for freedom begins with one's own head and its first opponent is fear. Therefore, I would like people to know that being afraid is one of the least effective ways of dealing with fear, as only you learn to manage it, your service will become much clearer to you and you will have more influence on it.- Chekmaryov also added that there were cases when strangers who saw the project approached him to mobilize to the unit where he was serving. The project started on the My-Ukraine+ channel on August 4. During the 7 weeks of the show, 1 million viewers in cities with a population of over 50,000 were contacted by the project's episodes on the TV channel. In general, together with cities with a population of less than 50 thousand and digital platforms of the channel, the project gathered more than 2 million viewers.

Our platoon captured four Russians, another eight enemies were killed - Lviv paratroopers about batt...	The material was distributed by the press service of the military unit. Kostyantyn, a platoon commander of one of the airborne assault companies of the 80th Infantry Division, and Serhiy, an assault pilot, recall the first hours of fighting on enemy territory. -To be honest, we have been waiting for this breakthrough for a long time. It is somewhat similar to the liberation of Kharkiv Oblast in 2022. We have long been waiting for such an opportunity to show the enemy our strength and power,- says platoon commander Konstantin. According to the officer, the tasks were varied. -We had several combat fronts at once. One of them is to go as far as possible, deep into the enemy's positions, to clear the territory for a further offensive. On August 7, our platoon captured four Russians, and another eight enemies were killed. We provided medical assistance to one of the wounded on the spot, and in this way even saved his life,- recalls Kostyantyn. Stormtrooper Serhii says about the beginning of the offensive. -The first day was quite busy. They captured the occupiers, took away their weapons, fed them, and warmed them. Mostly, these were young guys, conscripts. One of them, the poor man, even burst into tears and was happy that he was captured,- says Serhiy. And platoon commander Konstantin recalls that while they were advancing to their position, the enemy met them with fire. -Our Bushmaster was hit with an RPG. The car even rolled back and thus managed to save the soldiers, -Bushmaster- is a super car. The boys saved themselves and took more advantageous positions. Then they captured enemy mortar positions, equipment, enemy vehicles,- says the officer. The paratroopers expect enemy losses from this operation: territory, personnel, reserve and ammunition. Purpose: to make it easier for the military in other directions. -With each success, the boys are gaining more and more strength, zeal and desire. We are doing our job and we are ready to continue doing it for all Ukrainians and for our future,- says Kostyantyn about the motivation of his brothers. Earlier, as ArmyInform wrote, fighters of the 22nd separate mechanized brigade of the Ground Forces told about the first clashes with the enemy in Kurshchyna, in particular, how they managed to take 28 prisoners and destroy the DRG with one shot. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/28/nash-vzvod-vzyav-v-polon-chotyroh-rosiyan-shhe-vismoh-vorogiv-bulo-vbyto-lvivski-desantnyky-pro-boyi-na-kurshhyni/	2024-09-28T07:56:02-07:00
The Russians disguised their cannon with a fence and a doghouse. It didn't help	The video of the combat operation was published on the -Birds of Magyar- channel. Enemy tanks, self-propelled guns hiding in the hangar and several more conventional guns were also hit. Attention was also paid to the personnel of the enemy. One of the occupiers, in order to hide from the drone, crawled under a bush where his comrade was already hiding. This greatly facilitated the work of our pilots.

The Armed Forces commented on whether we should be afraid of Lukashenka's and Putin's statements abo...	This opinion was expressed by the head of the Council of Reservists of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Ivan Tymochko on the air of Suspilnyi on September 28 , answering the presenter's question about how much Ukrainians should be afraid of such statements. -This is due to several points. First of all, all world intelligence says that it was not brought to Belarus as a nuclear weapon, but launchers and carriers. These are different things. The warhead itself is not nuclear there. The second point: Russia violated all international treaties when it violated the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, simply ceasing nuclear weapons to a non-nuclear country that at one time did not have this status. This means that the balance of power has been disturbed and now the world community is faced with the question: to remain silent or to strike a pre-emptive strike in order to somehow insure itself,- comments Ivan Tymochko. In addition, according to his words, Lukashenko understands that the situation in the country is far from stable. -And in order to mobilize his electorate, to create an external threat in order to reject an internal one, he starts talking about -some kind of nuclear strike,- Ivan Tymochko summarized. As ArmiyaInform wrote, at one time the DPSU informed that the situation was being instigated by Belarus continues mainly in the information field, both on the border with Ukraine and on the borders with the neighboring states of the European Union. The Belarusian army is not ready for an independent invasion, however, there are Russian troops on the territory of a country that is an ally of the Russian aggressors.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/28/u-zsu-prokomentuvaly-chy-varto-boyatysya-zayav-lukashenka-i-putina-pro-yadernu-zbroyu/	2024-09-28T06:53:23-07:00

This is the technique the invaders use during assaults by small groups of infantry. — These are signs of preparation for the fact that in the near future assault actions will be carried out in the Zaporizhzhia direction. In addition, on the front line, the enemy is already concentrating the personnel of the assault groups in advanced positions. Therefore, we will wait for the fact that the enemy will start to activate in this direction, the military officer said. The officer noted that the enemy will most likely try to improve their current tactical position to create conditions for larger-scale offensive operations. — Assaults will be carried out in order to improve their tactical position, move the configuration of the battle line to their advantage. Now the enemy wants to prepare just such assaults so that it will be comfortable for him to carry out offensive actions in the future, he said.

The Armed Forces explained why the Russians are so interested in Vugledar, Kurakhovo and Pokrovsk	This opinion was expressed by the head of the Council of Reservists of the Ground Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces Ivan Tymochko on the air of Suspilny September 28. -Populations there are located in such a way that if you try to occupy one of them, a specific one, there is a great chance for the Russian army to be hit by flanking strikes of Ukrainian artillery. Therefore, they are trying to level the line there and create a bridgehead in order to both push back the Armed Forces and develop coverage of the Donetsk region in the south, as well as create potential bridgeheads for an offensive on the mainland territory of Ukraine, in particular, in the direction of the Dnipropetrovsk region&#8230; We recall the KAB attacks on Zaporozhye, for example&#8230; All this should be considered within the framework of one operation,- says Ivan Tymochko. He emphasized that it is important for the enemy to capture Vugledar, which is an industrial mining town and was created only in the 60s of the 20th century. -It is heavily networked with railway tracks, there is a network of mines - and these are underground points for storing weapons and equipment, it stands at a height. It is important,- says Ivan Tymochko. Kurakhovo is a railway junction station, nearby is the Kurakhiv Reservoir, almost 40 km long. -That is, this is a line where they can build defenses and control the distribution of water to the nearest settlements,- argued the military man. Pokrovsk is a city on a ledge, to the side of the Kramatorsk-Slovyansk agglomeration. -This is the task before the Russian troops: to occupy the Donetsk region,- summarized Ivan Tymochko.

How the Ukrainian underground works during the occupation: details from the GUR	About this an officer of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine told the Italian publication Il Foglio on condition of anonymity. According to him, Ukrainian partisans are behind this. It is known that occupiers and collaborators were killed and seriously wounded as a result of the explosions. According to the intelligence officer, every task carried out by the resistance movement is an incredible risk for a vigilante, but people still continue to help Ukraine - mostly for ideological and patriotic reasons. The underground also transmits important information about the movement of forces and resources of the aggressor state of Russia, which allows Ukraine to react in a timely manner - to strengthen defenses in the necessary areas of the front or to strike at concentrations of enemy troops and equipment. Sometimes unknown patriots of Ukraine paint symbolic graffiti on the streets of occupied cities - they exert psychological pressure on the enemy. -This is a signal to the occupiers that this is not their land. Our people are nearby, they have not given up their intentions to return their land,- said an employee of the Military Intelligence of Ukraine, his quotes GUR MOU in a telegram. Contrary to what many believe, the Ukrainian underground does not gather together to plan active activities. The curator of the resistance movement explained that agents can live in the same hallway and not know that both are working with Ukrainian intelligence. This is a necessary condition to ensure the safety of the underground, because the Russian special services do not stop hunting. -They act according to the principle: throw a stone at everyone and maybe hit a spy,- the Ukrainian intelligence officer said, adding that sometimes it is necessary to reduce the activity of underground people in order not to expose them to danger. Citizens of Russia, who in this way are fighting against Putin's criminal regime, also cooperate with GUR MOU. One of their activities is silent sabotage, for example, at enterprises of the military-industrial complex of the Russian Federation. -If a piece of military equipment is made incorrectly or a drawing is incorrectly made, it also brings some destructiveness,- the intelligence officer said. As reported by ArmyInform, the SSO Resistance movement reminded of itself in Crimea, returning the correct spelling to the city of Yevpatoria. This is despite the fact that the peninsula is allegedly completely controlled by the Russian -Ephesbeshniks-.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/28/yak-praczyuye-ukrayinske-pidpillya-v-okupacziyi-detali-vid-gur/	2024-09-28T00:28:14-07:00

Robert, a driver-mechanic, has been serving in the 25th Brigade of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces for a year and a half, in civilian life he worked on construction sites. — At first, it was not very attractive to join the tankers, because tanks are mostly the first equipment destroyed. You drive along the highways, there are only towers, and you think: oh no, what tankers, - he recalls with a smile. Tank commander Vladyslav also served in the brigade for a year and a half. -As soon as we entered this direction, we destroyed two tanks with direct fire during the day, in the area of ​​the settlement of Karlivka,- he says. Vadim remembers his first combat encounter with the enemy at the beginning of a large-scale invasion near the village of Verkhnotoretske in the Donetsk region. - It was hell there. I was ready to face the enemy, but it was very difficult. We left with one tank, when the enemy had four. The enemy attacked very actively with the use of airplanes, -Grads-. In the early days, no one could believe that they had reached such a frenzy. It was difficult to come to terms with the fact that this is a real war, he says. One of the crew's most difficult tasks is to destroy an enemy shelter at close range. The building in which the Russians were hiding was located almost in the center of the city, surrounded by a lot of vegetation, so there was no other way to destroy it. — We had the worst situation in Novogrodivka. Our task was to go out and destroy the houses in which the Russians were hiding. Worked with the support of BMP. It was a very close distance - 15 meters, and after the shot nothing was visible, - says Vlad. He used to live in Novogrodivka, so he knew the area well - and this helped a lot in the task, since the tank drove in at dawn and it was difficult to navigate. In addition, there are many Russians around. — After the shots, everything burns, a lot of dust rises, the streets are narrow, it is impossible to turn the tower. And while rolling back, we passed a turn, and our BMP was driving behind us, which could not control itself and crashed. As a result, the crew climbed onto our tank from there. And we rolled back after pi***s. They understood everything, there was an interception that -the Khokhlyat tank was rolling,- recalls mechvod Robert. With the massive appearance of drones on the front, the tactics of using tanks have changed a lot. - Before there was a war - tanks against tanks, and now there are FPV drones. They can quickly find you and destroy the tank. Nowadays, tanks are used more from closed positions, says Vadim. It was the same at the beginning of the war, he recalls, because then the enemy had a significant advantage in technology. Tanks fired from closed firing positions to engage targets that were not in line of sight, and this was much more effective. The paratroopers say that the Russians are currently using an interesting tactic in the Pokrovsky direction — they move mainly on foot without the support of armored vehicles. - They value life force less than iron. And yet they end a little. If the enemy takes active actions, we are given a command, and we simply destroy them from a closed position. And it turns out very well, because the tank is a very precise thing, and it is advisable to use them in this way, - say the crew. &nbsp; According to the observations of our tankers, the Russians currently use T-72 tanks the most in Donetsk region, newer tanks such as the T-90M -Breakthrough- are not recorded. — I saw a T-90 parked in Oskol. There was knee-deep water there, I don't know how he didn't pass there, couldn't cross the crossing, - says Vadim. In addition to domestic tanks, he can also drive German Leopards, as he has undergone the relevant training in Germany. — Foreign equipment is better equipped, it is good equipment, -reportazh-armiyainform-z-donechchyny/->especially Leopard 2A4 tanks. Its strengths are good weapons, an armored capsule, various electrical systems, the gunner notes. Tankers emphasize that the most important thing in the crew is harmony. Despite the fact that they have only been working together for a few months, the guys are confident in each other. - In a few months, we went through many funny stories. It brought us closer even before we were on the same crew. We were almost always next to each other, we worked together. -Coherence is very important,- emphasizes Robert. The Sicheslav brigade says that they are actively recruiting, and about 20 people have signed contracts this month. Everyone is accompanied from the first application to the beginning of the BZVP and until the person takes office.

Reactive response to enemy electronic countermeasures: the British created a drone that hunts for el...	As indicate experts from the BuildingTech portal, the new UAV is developed on the basis of a proven jet drone Modini Dart 250, which ensured a high level of interchangeability of components and a high level of their availability, ArmyInform notes. The Dart 250EW is equipped with a set of modern sensors that allow it to hit WED complexes using a guidance system at the source of interference. The key element of this system is a dual-frequency antenna installation and the patented Modini FX-2 Flight controller. It is this controller that makes the drone capable of autonomous detection, capture and targeting of a target operating in the radio frequency range. The FX-2 Flight controller is responsible for managing all stages of the attack: from the initial detection of the source of radio waves to the precise destruction of the target. Such a system allows you to effectively suppress enemy EW, minimizing risks for operators and other combat units. Another important feature of the Dart 250EW is its Terrain following system, which allows the drone to automatically maintain a set flight height of 50 to 100 meters above ground level. It ensures the ability to covertly move the drone in difficult terrain conditions, which makes it difficult for enemy radar stations to detect. According to the contributors of the site mil.in.ua, the flight speed of the Dart 250EW presented on defense exhibition MSPO2024 in the Polish city of Kielce, exceeds 400 km/h. This makes it extremely maneuverable and hard to see for the enemy. Such a high speed allows the drone to quickly reach the area of ​​effect of enemy EW systems, guide and hit targets with minimal reaction time. When the Dart 250EW enters the area of ​​operation of an enemy EW system, its FX-2 Flight controller automatically guides itself to the source of interference by azimuth and altitude, ensuring an accurate hit on the target. This makes the drone a powerful means of suppressing enemy EW systems, effectively disrupting their operation and opening the way for further action by friendly forces. Therefore, the Dart 250EW is an innovative solution in the field of electronic warfare, combining high speed, maneuverability and accuracy of guidance, which makes it one of the key tools on the modern battlefield. The manufacturer expects a certain demand for drones of this type, since the war in Ukraine demonstrated the need for a large number of inexpensive means to defeat enemy electronic warfare systems. In addition, specialists of the Modini company are developing a reconnaissance variant of the jet drone under the index Dart 250 ISR. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/28/reaktyvna-reakcziya-na-vorozhi-reb-brytanczi-stvoryly-dron-shho-polyuye-za-systemamy-elektronnoyi-protydiyi/	2024-09-27T20:45:22-07:00

The voice in the video does not belong to me: the enemy launched a deepfake about the situation in P...	Back in February 2022, the Anti-Disinformation Center warned that technology deepfake can be actively used in information and psychological operations during the Russian invasion of Ukraine to create false videos. For example, with the statement about the capitulation of Volodymyr Zelenskyi. And there were actually a lot of deepfake videos during the large-scale war. The other day, the Head of the Donetsk regional state administration, head of the regional military administration, Vadym Filashkin notified that deepfake is spreading on the network a video with what appears to be his comment about the situation in the Pokrovsk community. The falsified video says that local residents are allegedly organizing rallies against the Armed Forces, clashing with the military, and therefore the community will be forced to evacuate the population. This information is not true. -The voice on the video does not belong to me, and the information presented repeats Russian propaganda narratives and is designed to cause tension in society,- said Vadym Filashkin and urged everyone to be careful with information on the Internet and trust only official sources. There are two main ways to protect against deepfakes: using critical thinking or technology. Again, artificial intelligence tools help to recognize a fake. But it is worth knowing that for more than a decade we have been living in the post-truth era, which is an information flow that is deliberately constructed in modern society to create a virtual reality different from reality with the goal of manipulating public consciousness. Therefore, a sensational message seen or heard during the war usually needs additional confirmation.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/28/golos-na-video-ne-nalezhyt-meni-vorog-zapustyv-dipfejk-pro-sytuacziyu-v-pokrovsku/	2024-09-27T20:30:06-07:00

9 children and a 20-year-old boy were returned to Ukraine from Russia and the temporarily occupied t...	reported the ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets about this. The age of the returnees is from 13 to 17 years. Some of them have disabilities and serious illnesses. Returned Ukrainians are from the Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk, Luhansk regions and Crimea. At the beginning of the large-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, some of the returned children were in the Oleshkiv Children's Boarding Home. Later, the occupation authorities took them to the city of Skadovsk and Russia. Through the mediation of the State of Qatar, it was possible to reunite the children with their families, who were separated for a long time by the Russians. One of the boys, who returned to his native land today, lost his father, who defended Ukraine during the Russian invasion. Some of the children will finally, after a long time, hug their relatives who are faithfully serving in various structures of Ukraine. Some returned to their grandparents, because they are the ones who can give a happy childhood in their native land.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/27/do-ukrayiny-povernuly-z-rosiyi-ta-tymchasovo-okupovanyh-terytorij-9-ditej-i-20-richnogo-yunaka/	2024-09-27T11:32:58-07:00
The General Staff showed how Canadian instructors teach Ukrainian military tactics in urban battles	Photos from the training of Ukrainian servicemen -in urban areas- were made public in the General headquarters of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. During the exercise, service members practice tactical elements such as house and room entry checks, casualty evacuation, preparation, capture, clearing and building maintenance, and more. Also, the Ukrainian military learns complex actions during the seizure of premises in the department. Important importance is given to the skills of moving among city ruins, overcoming rubble, moving between buildings, etc. Instructors emphasize that fighting can take place in one building and consist of several isolated battles and skirmishes on different floors, in different corridors and rooms. These training modules prepare our soldiers for combat conditions during the defense of Ukraine against the Russian aggressor. Canadian instructors play a key role in this process, providing a high level of training and imparting their expertise. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that Ukrainian soldiers are trained by Norwegian instructors of the Norwegian training operation -ELLISEV-, which is a component of the multinational training operation Interflex on the territory of Great Britain.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/27/u-genshtabi-pokazaly-yak-kanadski-instruktory-navchayut-ukrayinskyh-vijskovyh-taktyczi-miskyh-boyiv/	2024-09-27T11:19:45-07:00

Volodymyr Zelensky presented the Victory Plan to Donald Trump	This is stated in messages of the head of state. -I think we have a common view that the war in Ukraine should be stopped. Putin cannot win. Ukrainians must win. And I want to discuss with you the details of our plan, the Victory Plan,- the head of state said before the start of the meeting. Volodymyr Zelenskyi noted that it is necessary to put pressure on the Russian dictator and force him to make peace, and presented Donald Trump with the Victory Plan. The President of Ukraine also talked about the situation at the front, the progress of the operation in the Kursk region and its tasks, Ukrainian innovations in the fight against Russian terror, as well as the disproportionately high losses of the Russian army. During the meeting, the general situation in Ukraine, the consequences of the war for Ukrainians and the economy were discussed in detail. A separate focus of the conversation is the constant shelling of cities and civilian infrastructure by the Russian Federation and the role of American Patriot systems in protecting people's lives. Volodymyr Zelenskyi also emphasized that it is necessary to block any opportunities for the aggressor state to receive money for the war from the sale of oil and gas, as well as all channels of supply of Western components for Russian missiles. Donald Trump called today's meeting a good sign. -He (the President of Ukraine, — ed.) went through hell, and his country went through such hell, which few countries have gone through - this has never happened anywhere.

The Defense Forces explained the activation of the Russians in the Lyman direction	The head of the public relations service told about this on Army TV 63 OMBr Rostislav Yashchyshyn. -There is a whole set of reasons here. We know that they are conducting a certain covert mobilization, new personnel are constantly arriving. They go through minimal training for a few days, no one bothers with them,- said Rostyslav Yashchyshyn. The spokesman added that the occupiers had also been accumulating equipment for a long time, and when they managed to collect the amount necessary for the assaults, they used it. -But such assaults did not bring any positives for the enemy. Our main task, first of all, is to prevent armored vehicles from approaching our infantry. That is why we launch counterattacks at the beginning of the offensive,- he explained. According to the information of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, on September 27 in the Limansk direction, the invading army kurahivskomu-ta-pokrovskomu-napryamkah/->carried out six attacks on Ukrainian positions near Grekivka, Makiivka, Nevsky and Novosadovo.

68,000 women in the Armed Forces: the Ministry of Defense managed to implement systemic changes in g...	About this said State Secretary of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine Lyudmila Daragan at the international seminar on gender equality, which was held as part of the annual Richelieu Forum of Public Service in Kyiv. She said that the total number of women in the Armed Forces of Ukraine is 68,000, of which more than 48,000 are servicewomen. There are about 5,000 servicewomen directly in the combat zone. Lyudmila Daragan shared her observations of the faster integration of women in the army in the conditions of repelling a large-scale Russian invasion: -Today, women are everywhere - holding the rear, working in difficult positions, fighting in the ranks of the Armed Forces. They prove that people should be judged by their capabilities, efficiency and intelligence, not by gender.- The State Secretary of the Ministry of Defense drew attention to the changes in the gender policy of the Ministry of Defense, which were implemented in recent years. In particular, based on her own experience of serving, she noted that in 2018, women had the opportunity to serve in combat specialties. However, this opportunity remained unrealized for a long time. -The law itself was not enough. There was also an order with the seal of the DSK, which regulated officer positions for women and men separately. In 2022, after the change of this order, it was possible to overcome these obstacles,- Lyudmila Daragan said. In addition, it was possible to improve the level of material security of female military personnel. For example, in 2023, the summer women's military uniform appeared - before that, only the dress uniform was available. The participants of the seminar discussed topical issues of ensuring equality and inclusion in the context of the state policy of Ukraine. Special attention was paid to the impact of the war on overcoming gender inequality in the public service and the Armed Forces. The event emphasized the importance of implementing people-centered principles. They also discussed the new challenges that Ukraine faced due to the full-scale war: The participants noted Ukraine's significant progress in achieving gender equality and adapting legislation to European standards. The seminar became a platform for sharing experience and discussing further plans for the implementation of the state gender policy. -Ukraine demonstrates systemic success in implementing inclusive approaches. Progress in overcoming gender inequality, the active involvement of women in various spheres of public life, as well as the integration of the principles of inclusion, in particular in the system of the Ministry of Defense, are important steps on the way to European and European integration,- Lyudmila Daragan emphasized.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/27/68-tysyach-zhinok-u-zsu-minoborony-vdalosya-vprovadyty-systemni-zminy-u-gendernij-polityczi/	2024-09-27T08:58:38-07:00
-Dismissed- evaders with -difficult diagnoses-: -family contract- informed about suspicion	This was reported by the Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office. A 29-year-old doctor, who is a member of the permanent military medical commission of the RTCC and SP, and his 61-year-old father organized a money-making -scheme- for those willing to -de-register- from the military register. The father -recommended- his son to his acquaintances as a proven person who has -influence and official connections- to avoid mobilization. In the future, clients came for an -appointment-, received the necessary medical documentation about -difficult diagnoses- with the help of the doctor's son. Then these documents were sent to the Military Commissariat with the mark -unfit for service- due to -bad- health. This allowed men to deregister from the military register and go abroad. The father did not tell petitioners the full amount, but usually said they would end up paying about $4,000. First, customers had to hand over a deposit in the amount of 40,000 UAH, and then another 2,600 USD. Law enforcement officers exposed the father and son and informed them of the suspicion. They face imprisonment for up to eight years with confiscation of property. Earlier, ArmyInform informed that law enforcement officers reported the suspicion to the military army of the Russian Federation, which during the occupation tortured civilians in the village of Velikiy Burluk of the Kupyan district of the Kharkiv region.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/27/spysuvaly-uhylyantiv-z-vazhkymy-diagnozamy-simejnomu-pidryadu-povidomyly-pro-pidozru/	2024-09-27T08:41:19-07:00
Army under the protection of the Virgin — an exhibition project opened in Kyiv	The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine participated in its implementation. The exhibition shows the history of the transformation of the image of the Protection of the Holy Mother of God as an important element of the culture of Ukrainian soldiers from ancient times to today, when the newest Ukrainian knights repel Russia's large-scale armed aggression. The exposition consists of paintings, icons and their lists (copies), graphics, historical documents, rare weapons and church utensils, clothing items, photos, multimedia, etc. The opening of the exhibition was attended by the Vicar of the Kyiv Diocese of the OCU, Bishop Yefrem Vasylkivskyi, representatives of the Main Communications Department of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, historians, museum curators, publishers, representatives of the media and the public. -It is symbolic that the church holiday of the Intercession is celebrated on the same day as other important state holidays - the Day of the Ukrainian Cossacks and the Day of Defenders of Ukraine. Therefore, we strive to show the historical basis of the appearance of these holidays, testify to the durability of the military tradition and reveal the special place of faith among the bravest of us. After all, right now the servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are continuing this path of struggle of Ukrainian defenders of previous generations for the independence and freedom of our Motherland,- said Diana Popova, general director of the Museum of the History of the City of Kyiv. -The symbols of protection for the Ukrainian soldier have long been icons of the Protection of the Holy Mother of God. The Virgin Mary with the approaching soldiers - those depicted in front of her - became part of the Ukrainian cult. This transformation — one might say, the -militarization- of the Mother of God — is unique to Ukrainian Orthodoxy. Let me remind you that in the first days of the full-scale invasion of the Russians in 2022, the image of the Mother of God with a -javelin- appeared in our mass culture - the corresponding chevron, among other things, is presented in the part of the exposition prepared by the General Staff,- said the spokesman of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Captain Dmytro Lykhova The exhibition at the Kyiv History Museum will last until December 1, 2024. As ArmyInform already told in the National Reserve -Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra- since last May, the program for military personnel -Spiritual restoration through culture- has been implemented.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/27/vijsko-pid-zahystom-bogorodyczi-v-kyyevi-vidkryvsya-vystavkovyj-proyekt/	2024-09-27T08:29:55-07:00
The defense forces repelled the assault of a convoy of 50 vehicles in the Kupyansk direction	This was reported by the command of the Airborne Assault Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. On September 26, the enemy once again tried to break through the positions of the Defense Forces of Ukraine in the Kupyan direction. At one of the boundaries, the column split into two parts: the larger part - 37 units of equipment - began to storm the units of the National Guard of Ukraine, the smaller part - 13 units of tanks and BBM - the position of the 77th Army. However, even with such serious forces, the enemy units were unable to complete the tasks set before them it did not succeed: paratroopers and national guardsmen showed courage, high professionalism and stability in defense, defeating the enemy and pushing him back to their starting positions. Two tanks, two armored personnel carriers and an infantry fighting vehicle were destroyed on the approach to the Dnieper paratroopers, and those who remained managed to flee in panic.

From the lie about the MH17 flight to the torture chamber: the sullen man was informed of the suspic...	The Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office informed about this.

During the large-scale invasion of the Russian Federation, he became the deputy commander of a separate assault battalion of the 101st Rifle Regiment of the 1st Army Corps of the 8th Army of the Southern Military District of the Russian Armed Forces. As part of this unit of the Russian army of occupation, the man took a direct part in the capture of the village of Velikiy Burluk, Kupyan district. In the settlement, the occupiers set up a torture chamber in the basement of the local police station, where the suspect became a -bystander-. -Grumpy- along with other Russian military illegally detained civilian men, searched their homes, and then illegally imprisoned them. Prisoners were kept in unsanitary conditions in the basement of the temporary detention center of the police station. In the torture chamber, -grumpy- personally abused and tortured illegally detained ATO veterans and citizens with a pro-Ukrainian position who refused to work for the occupying power. The suspect kicked them, punched them, and shot them all over the body, threatening to kill them. He starved the detainees, did not give them drinking water and constantly arranged -interrogations- to deprive people of sleep. People who were illegally deprived of their liberty were forced to change their pro-Ukrainian position, to provide information about other pro-Ukrainian citizens, ATO participants, law enforcement officers, Ukrainian military deployment locations, etc. Photos of the premises of the torture chamber, which the Russian occupiers turned into the basement of the temporary detention center of the police department made public in Holovny Department of the National Police of Ukraine in the Kharkiv region.

For this, they used their -flyers-, defectors, as well as Ukrainian prisoners,- said Linux. One of the biggest problems during the clearing of the 30 buildings of the plant were the basements and bunkers where the invaders held their defenses. -If we compare it with the entire history of our war, it is unlikely that we will find similar cases of capturing an industrial zone, an object of such complexity in such a short period of time,- said the intelligence officer. He described the testimony of the occupiers who were captured during the operation at the factory. -Commanders of the blocked Russians from the Russian special forces maintained discipline with total fear, violence and murder.

According to the case materials and the conclusions of independent research, the head of this financial institution, Elvira Nabiullina, was informed in advance about Putin's plans for a full-scale invasion of our country and made central bank decisions that ensured military aggression. For this, according to the investigation, Nabiullina changed the strategy of the central bank in order to support the occupation, avoid sanctions applied to the Russian Federation for invading Ukraine, and also to facilitate the financing of the occupation groups of the aggressor country. The materials of the investigation also show that the funds that are in the accounts of the Russian Central Bank, opened in foreign jurisdictions, are actually one of the tools of waging war. We are talking about almost 300 billion US dollars, which, thanks to international partners of Ukraine, are blocked in the accounts of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation all over the world. On the basis of the evidence base collected by the SBU and the OGP, this amount may in the future be subject to confiscation as the funds of a legal entity to which criminal-legal measures will be applied, as provided by law. Currently, within the framework of the relevant criminal proceedings, a new suspicion under ch. 2 Art. 437 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (planning, preparation, initiation and waging of an aggressive war) was received by the head of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, Elvira Nabiullina.

The Army+ application has received an important update	About this notified the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. At the same time, the application number is generated so that the data update status can be updated later. With the launch of Army+, a certain part of servicemen encountered the fact that information about their service is not displayed in the application. Most often, this happened due to the fact that the operators of the TCC and JV did not digitize the data on the current status of the citizen's account. To correct the data, the user had to install the Reserve+ application and send a request through it. -Only in the first four weeks of the release, more than 60,000 military personnel updated their service data, in particular through Reserve+. It was inconvenient, required another app to be installed, and didn't give the military feedback about its data update request. That's why we developed a functionality that allows you to update information about your service through Army+ in a few clicks and get an application number to further clarify the status,- said Kateryna Chernogorenko, Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine for Digitalization. How it works now in Armiya+: In total, more than 270,000 servicemen were authorized in Army+ for a month and a half of work. The application was implemented by 1,000 military units, and 7,000 electronic reports, which have the legal status of paper, were also submitted.

Under the -sight- of the enemy were units of the Armed Forces moving along the highways of the Vinnytsia and Cherkasy regions. According to the investigation, the Russian special service hoped to monitor the movement routes of Ukrainian military columns in real time in order to adjust the air strike against them. To fulfill this task, the FSB remotely recruited a 51-year-old paramedic from one of the medical facilities in Vinnytsia region, who was -elected- because of his pro-Kremlin activity in Telegram channels. -According to the instructions of the occupiers, their agent drove his car to interregional highways, where he monitored the movement of units of the Defense Forces. An episode was documented when, having discovered a military convoy, the person involved -sat on its tail- and followed it for almost 100 km. In this way, he tried to establish the route, as well as the number and types of equipment in the column,- the counterintelligence officers said. SBU operatives promptly exposed the traitor and detained him near his own residence. Before that, comprehensive measures were taken to secure the locations of Ukrainian troops. At the place of detention, the suspect's mobile phone was seized, which he used to communicate with the -liaison- of the FSB - Sergey Lebedev (better known as the blogger -Lokhmaty-) from Donetsk. On the basis of the collected evidence, the investigators of the Security Service informed the detainee of the suspicion under Part 2 of Art. 111 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (treason committed under martial law). The perpetrator is in custody. He faces life imprisonment with confiscation of property. As reported ArmiyaInform, an employee of one of the mines of the Pokrovsky district searched for locations of deployment of personnel of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and handed them over to the Russians.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/27/lyubyv-padaty-na-hvist-zsu-feldsher-z-vinnychchyny-mozhe-otrymaty-dovichne-uvyaznennya/	2024-09-27T02:48:41-07:00
Drones of the hundred-year-old -Achilles-: defenders repelled a powerful Russian armored assault in ...	The video of the repulse of half a hundred enemy armored assault was made public in the battalion of shock air defense systems -Achilles- of the 92nd separate assault brigade named after Ivan Sirk, the chieftain of Kosh. Anton Shmagailo, commander of the first shock company of the Achilles anti-aircraft missile battalion, gave an exclusive comment on the repulse of the enemy assault to ArmyInform: -The enemy used more than 50 units of armored and light armored vehicles - mainly tanks lined with steel frames (so-called -sheds-). All equipment is equipped with a large number of EW devices and additional protection against drones. The enemy's plan remains unchanged - a breakthrough to the Oskil River. Assault columns advanced almost continuously for 10 hours. No positions were lost in the area where the -Achilles- assault air defense battalion of the 92nd OShBr operates, and the battle line is unchanged. The unit destroyed 14 and damaged 26 pieces of military equipment. In total, more than 30 units of armored vehicles were destroyed by the Defense Forces as part of repelling the assault.- So, the Russian onslaught failed to get past the hundred-eyed hekatoncheir--Achilles- - the battalion's victors destroyed and damaged 40 units of military equipment. 14 units of enemy equipment were destroyed: Another 26 units of enemy equipment were damaged: Repelling an enemy assault with the massive use of armored vehicles on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyni- commented the battalion commander captain Yuriy Fedorenko. — During the period of service, which is almost 2.5 years, we have been fighting since the first day of a full-scale war, the first time in my memory when the enemy launched such a massive assault. This testifies to the fact that the adversary is given a task, without looking at the loss of manpower and equipment, to try to increase their capabilities as much as possible, efforts in particular in the Kupyan region, he said. The commander of drones expressed his admiration for the coordinated interaction of various units of the Defense Forces. - I must say frankly, I am impressed by the Defense Forces - from the tasking of the senior commander to the communication between the brigades that keep the tone. And also by the joint execution of combat tasks - when one detected, the second escorted, the third struck. The joint fire effect of artillery, anti-tank weapons and, of course, unmanned systems - those that help us identify the enemy and inflict fire damage on him, said the military. The officer told how much enemy equipment and how the soldiers of the Defense Forces of Ukraine managed to destroy it. Only during the repulse of this assault, the -Achilles- battalion managed to destroy 14 units of enemy equipment of various types yesterday. In particular, most of the equipment that participated in the shock-assault operations was destroyed by the defense forces due to the combined fire impact. The opponent had no sign of success, he said. Separately, Yuriy Fedorenko explained the components of the success of the defenders of Ukraine both in this separate battle and during the repulsion of Russian aggression against the Ukrainian people and the state as a whole. — First, we have become much better at interacting with each other. Second, tasks began to be defined more precisely, taking into account all the tricks that the enemy uses against us. And the third is the constant support of every Ukrainian, everyone who supports the Defense Forces of Ukraine, everyone who donates, the military explained. He thanked each of the Ukrainians for their contribution to the joint victory, noting that the state programs allowed drone operators to receive more drones on the front lines, but the donations of Ukrainians are also extremely important. — At the expense of state programs, objectively, we began to receive more drones. But the constant support of the Ukrainian nation makes it possible to have the minimum balance that is critically necessary in order to intensively destroy the enemy and not give him the opportunity to reach our advanced positions, he said. As reported by the analysts of the DeepState project, about 40 units of equipment were moving in the direction of Kolesnikivka and at least 9 more in the direction of Kruglyakivka. They noted that such a mechanized assault is an atypical phenomenon, because previously the enemy acted in infantry groups. DeepState suggested that this may indicate that the Russians have given the site a certain priority. -It is expected that they will try to repeat such a massive assault again, because this attempt failed.- Reporting on the achievements of the -Achilles- battalion, ArmyInform showed how the drones of the destroyed a rare Russian self-propelled gun 2C5 -Hyacinth-S-, flying -Achilles- killed more than one and a half dozen long-range Russian reconnaissance UAVs zala, supercam and -Orlan-, long-range -helmeted- Achilles hit exactly under the turret of a Russian tank and Grad won in Belgorod region, all-seeing -Achilles- saw and eliminated the invaders in Kharkiv Oblast with the help of the Stymphalian birds, and Achilles hunter fired a full yagdtash of enemy equipment at Kharkiv Oblast.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/27/drony-storukogo-ahillesa-oboronczi-vidbyly-potuzhnyj-rosijskyj-broneshturm-na-kup%ca%bcyanskomu-napryamku/	2024-09-27T02:35:18-07:00

It is not customary for us to avoid -dvizhuhy- — Arkas Commander-in-Chief about the situation west o...	The conversation with the officer was published on September 27 on the brigade page. Recently, the 3rd mechanized battalion -celebrated- a kind of anniversary - two years in this direction. -When we first entered here, it was a completely different war. -Maviks- and FPV were exotic then, and now broadcasts must be conducted 24/7. The enemy does not stand still and is constantly improving, adapting to us, responding to our decisions. We also do not stand still: we change tactics in response. There is no need to treat the enemy as weak and stupid. The battlefield is a chessboard, and you have to think about your moves 10 steps ahead,- says Arkas. He has been in this direction since the very beginning: he was a platoon commander, then a company, now he is a deputy battalion commander. He knows this direction very well — from the firing positions of the platoons to the entire battalion defense area. The understanding of war and combat changes when you rise from an infantryman in a trench to a command post, says the deputy commander. -Everything comes with experience, and experience is a priceless thing. The theory that you did not use or used somewhere on the training ground cannot be compared with the knowledge that is gained in battle. As a commander, I always try to be with the soldiers in positions. The moments when fighters of some units ask how it can be that the commander is personally in positions with his fighters are surprising. And for us, this is the norm,- Arkas shares. In his opinion, when the commander is directly with the soldiers, the soldiers feel better morally, and the commander sees the situation on the battlefield in detail. -In our battalion, platoon and company commanders are on the first and second lines of defense. At least one of the officers of the company or platoon is constantly in position. -All fighters know their commanders by face and regularly see them at ground zero,- notes the deputy commander. According to him, the tactics of the enemy have also changed during this time, and more than once. -Currently, the main task of commanders at all levels is to identify and destroy as many enemy targets as possible, as far as firepower is available, and to secure our infantry. Usually the Russians send a column of 5-10 pieces of equipment: mostly a tank with a trawl goes, then the main column: 2 tanks, an armored personnel carrier, an armored personnel carrier, all with infantry. It is this equipment that we destroy on the far frontiers, even on the approach to our positions,- says Arkas. According to him, there used to be roll after roll of equipment with a difference of an hour, 3-4 assaults per day. Over time, the Russians changed their tactics — they began to use infantry groups themselves without the use of armored vehicles. Later, they began to fly into positions on motorcycles or golf carts, in several groups, and some enemy attacks succeeded due to the effect of surprise. -Over time, we understood exactly what types of attacks there can be, and how to counter them. Thanks to the coordinated work of each unit, in particular drone operators and mortars, we manage to repel heavy enemy assaults,- the officer assures. From the command to the ordinary infantrymen in the trenches, the unit adheres to the principle of proactivity - the enemy must be constantly kept in suspense and put pressure on him. -It is not customary for us to avoid -double talk-. When our infantry sees the enemy, everything flies. Sometimes you have to calm them down there. There would be pistols - the boys would shoot with pistols. I have a fighter on pseudo -Trophy-. My former platoon sergeant. So I often stopped him: -Can you let others shoot too? Calm down a bit.- He will see movement somewhere, immediately -Arkas, let's work out? We need to cheer them up.- Our people themselves understand that if you don't show your teeth, sooner or later you'll be attacked. When the enemy has just climbed out somewhere, -lighted up-, and immediately flies towards him, he is even afraid to go out afterwards. Then you fly around their positions, and they have yellow bottles of urine lying around the trenches, because they are afraid to go to the toilet,- Arkas laughs. According to him, the current war requires round-the-clock inclusion. -I always have a work tablet on in my dugout. I fall asleep under the current and wake up under the current. I hear through a dream that both AGS and LNG are already working. I run into the KSP, and they report to me: -Arkas, they started moving, and we hit them right away.- Then they buried something near 8 occupiers. Then it turned out from the intercepts that this group was supposed to storm us. And they did not even reach the assembly point. Thank God that there are such proactive people who have fire in their eyes and have no mercy for the occupiers,- says the Deputy Commander-in-Chief. He is convinced: people are the main resource in war, it is not the equipment and weapons that fight, people fight. -Almost everything in our country rests on the bright heads of the servicemen themselves. We in the battalion maximize the strengths of each soldier and use their professional skills from civilian life. For example, a brigade is being replenished: we know that a person in civilian life was an electrician or a good car repairer, and in the brigade he took the position of a gunner. Over time, this serviceman moves from infantry and position work to more specialized work: repairing equipment, helping with equipment, etc. We always ask the military what they understand and what exactly they want to do,- says Arkas. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the 4th mechanized battalion of the Separate Presidential Brigade named after Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky destroyed the Russians, who tried to jump into our positions. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/27/u-nas-ne-zavedeno-unykaty-dvizhuhy-zamkombata-arkas-pro-sytuacziyu-zahidnishe-vugledara/	2024-09-26T21:16:23-07:00

BTR-60M -Khorunzhy-: what is the descendant of the famous armored car capable of with a new -heart- ...	About the relevant decision of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine ArmyInform reported on September 2. The editors asked Andrii Haruk, a well-known arms researcher, doctor of historical sciences, professor of the Department of Humanities at the National Academy of Land Forces named after Hetman Petro Sahaidachny, to share his impressions of this armored vehicle. — Yes, I know that the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine has codified (i.e. provided the NATO code) another Ukrainian armored personnel carrier — BTR-60M -Khorunzhy- produced by NVO -Praktyka- (famous, in particular, for its -Kozak- armored vehicles). This machine already has a certain history - it has been known at least since 2021. -Khorunzhiy- is positioned as a modernization of the BTR-60 (which is clearly hinted at by the designation BTR-60M). But I (I'll emphasize right away - I'm familiar with -Khorunzhi- only from the photo) cannot understand WHAT in the BTR-60M remained from the basic BTR-60 (probably BTR-60PB). - On what, Andriy Ivanovich, are your conclusions based? - The body is completely new, with a changed location of the motor-transmission compartment (moved from the aft part of the body to the right front). Thanks to this, the armored personnel carrier got rid of the hereditary defect of the entire family, starting from the BTR-60 and ending with the BTR-90, which is the lack of ergonomics. Now the paratroopers for entering/exiting the vehicle use a convenient ramp, as on Western vehicles and the Ukrainian BTR-4. In addition, the height of the body has also been increased, which also had a positive effect on ergonomics. The paired installation of antique GAZ-49B carburetor engines was replaced by a 210 hp Deutz diesel engine. This entailed a replacement of the transmission, in which a modern six-speed Allison automatic transmission appeared. The BTR-60 could have remained, except for the bridges, but this is also inaccurate. - In the very name of these combat vehicles, it is determined that they are supposed to protect soldiers from threats on the battlefield. What is known about the reservation of this platform? - The armor protection corresponds to the CCSA-4 class, that is, the first level of the STANAG 4569 standard. at a distance of 30 m and more, as well as from fragments of 155-mm shells in the event of an explosion at a distance of at least 100 m. This is not a very high level of protection. But thanks to this, the BTR-60M turned out to be quite light - its equipped weight is 10,800 kg (according to the developer, this is probably the weight of the -bare- chassis, without the combat module). - As far as I know, this machine has been presented to the general public before - In October 2021, the prototype of -Khorunzhoi- was demonstrated in Kyiv at the -Digital Future of the Army- exhibition in the configuration of a command and staff vehicle. A tower with a telescopic antenna mast, similar to the BMP-1KSH tower, was installed on it. &nbsp; Review of -Khorunzhy- in the KShM variant. Video: Building Tech But already in mid-November, this same prototype (board number -240-) was tested on the test site with the Turkish SARP KPVT combat module, armed with a 14.5-mm KPVT machine gun. The decision, in my opinion, is questionable in view of the relatively low reliability of the KPVT and the lack of auxiliary weapons. There are also SARP Dual modules, which provide for the installation of weapons units (machine guns of caliber 12.7 and 7.62 mm, or a 40-mm automatic grenade launcher and a 7.62-mm machine gun) and are installed on Ukrainian armored vehicles - Kozak-2M1 armored cars or MT-LB transporters. — However, in addition to the exhibition presentations, this machine went through codification and baptism of fire. What do you know about it? - February 18, 2023 -Khorunzhiy- -lighted up- for the first time at the front. The example that got into the short video differs from the first prototype in some details of the body construction, the lack of video cameras of a circular view, etc. It is armed with a hand-operated turret-mounted machine gun and crown-type protection, the same as on many Cossacks. Since then, no information about the combat use of the BTR-60M has been published. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/27/btr-60m-horunzhyj-na-shho-zdatnyj-nashhadok-vidomoyi-bronemashyny-z-novym-serczem-ta-obladunkamy/	2024-09-26T20:50:15-07:00
From the Luhansk airport to the battles in Kurshchyna: the story of Stanislav Havrysh, full knight o...	One of the names on the list of awardees is Major Stanislav Gavrish. The officer was awarded the Order of Bohdan Khmelnytskyi, 1st degree. So, now he has become a full cavalier of this high state award. Stanislav is a serviceman of the 80th separate airborne assault brigade of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. A graduate of the military academy in Lviv, later in Odesa. He says that since childhood he dreamed of the army, the service attracted him. Hardened by battles since 2014, in particular for the Luhansk airport. After graduating from the military college, he immediately went to Kharkiv Oblast to the battalion's base camp. Next is the war zone. And already on August 1, 2014, Havrysh and his unit went to Luhansk airport. -The tanks occupied the heights and fired at us from the heights. Morally, everyone could stand. Morally, everyone suffered. Everyone was ready to give their lives in case of need,- recalled he is interviewing in 2021. -On the night of August 2, 2014, there was heavy shelling from Grady.- It was the first night in the zone, we were -baptized-. By morning, ammunition was still being torn apart&#8230; We then suffered serious losses in equipment, until the morning we extinguished the fire&#8230; Then there was mortar shelling. Didn't understand at first what it was. Saw several flashes from the Luhansk side. Fields with wheat were on fire, the whole land was burned,- the soldier said. Then, in the distant 2014, the military man had to understand and see with his own eyes how treacherous the enemy is. -Entering the villages, we saw the consequences of enemy artillery shelling, the affected families. One woman buried her daughter, granddaughter, great-granddaughter. And I was left alone. Our boys were still helping with the burial,- the officer shared. In 2021, officer Havrysh went to study in the Czech Republic, where our military took courses in combat shooting. Then, along with Ukrainian paratroopers, military personnel from 10 other countries mastered the methods of firing according to NATO standards. All classes were conducted by British instructors. The officer uses all this accumulated experience during the large-scale invasion of the Russians. Works well: in September 2022, while still a captain, Havrysh was awarded the Order of Bohdan Khmelnytsky II degree by Presidential Decree. Now the officer is a participant in the Armed Forces operation in the Kursk region. And on September 16, the soldier became a full knight of the Order of Bohdan Khmelnytskyi.

What is known about the special information operation of the Russian Federation and what are the ter...	The same information with reference to -anonymous sources- was also spread by the Turkish publication Aydınlık. This publication belongs to the pro-Russian party Vatan and regularly rebroadcasts Russian propaganda and anti-Ukrainian fakes. Repeated statements and groundless accusations against Ukraine are the signature style of Putin fakers. This is a typical Russian special information operation aimed at promoting a narrative about an allegedly -terrorist- Ukraine and -Kyiv's ties to international terrorism.- In this way, Moscow is trying to discredit Ukraine in the eyes of the international community, as well as to divert attention from its own crimes, which are quite real and proven. After all, it is Russia that actively and openly cooperates with the terrorist organizations Hamas and the Taliban, and also supports the international terrorist activities of the -Wagner- PMC. In addition, it constantly lures mercenaries from many countries of Asia, Latin America, Africa and even Europe to the war in Ukraine. So, as of May 2024, according to the data of the IOU GUR, citizens of India, Nepal, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Venezuela, Cuba, Equatorial Guinea, Burkina Faso, Mali, Algeria fought on the side of the Russian army. Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Sudan, Rwanda, Burundi, Congo, Uganda and the Central African Republic, as well as Serbia and Moldova (from Transnistria and Gagauzia).	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/27/shho-vidomo-pro-informaczijnu-speczoperacziyu-rf-i-do-chogo-tut-terorysty/	2024-09-26T20:30:50-07:00
American air defense systems for F-16: defeating Russia according to the Yugoslav scenario	After all, -air-to-ground- weapons are not only -air-to-surface- missiles, but also all aviation munitions used by combat aircraft to hit ground targets. It also includes aerial bombs, air-launched cruise missiles, automatic guns, machine guns and grenade launchers. Attention to this detail in the official message is fully justified, because earlier Politco announced that the United States will provide Ukraine with unique high-precision, medium-range AGM-154 JSOW gliding guided bombs. According to the publication, the range of this weapon, which is capable of hitting enemy targets at a considerable distance, will allow Ukrainian F-16 pilots to stay at a safe distance from the line of combat, beyond the reach of Russian air defense. AGM-154 JSOW strike with a unitary warhead First of all, the AGM-154 JSOW is intended for use against poorly protected targets, such as: lightly armored armored vehicles and trucks, aircraft at base airfields, as well as anti-aircraft missile systems. Although this munition is not an air-to-ground missile and its range is more limited, it is quite sufficient to effectively destroy front-line ammunition and fuel-lubricating depots, hit enemy positions, communication nodes, and manpower. Strike AGM-154 JSOW with a cluster warhead AGM-154 JSOW is capable of hitting targets protected by enemy air defense. This makes it possible to significantly reduce or even eliminate the risk of damage to the aircraft from which this guided aerial bomb is launched. Gliding of the munition is provided by two wings that extend after launch and provide flight at a given distance to the target. When dropped from low altitudes, the AGM-154 JSOW is capable of hitting targets at a distance of up to 22 km. In the case of a high-altitude launch, its flight range can be up to 130 km. The total weight of the ammunition is about 500 kg. It can have both unitary and cluster warheads. Among the advantages of the AGM-154 JSOW should be counted the high accuracy of guidance, especially when it comes to geolocated static targets. Also, the ammunition has an infrared homing head, invulnerable to radio frequency interference. In addition, this glider bomb is inconspicuous to air defenses, so it is practically impossible to shoot it down. This makes the AGM-154 JSOW a highly effective munition capable of keeping Ukrainian F-16s safe, as they will be able to drop them without flying into the range of Russian air defense. The AGM-154 JSOW was used in a number of prominent US and other NATO military operations. Among them: The most famous of these operations is the bombing of Yugoslavia by NATO forces as part of the 78-day Operation Allied Force. At that time, the planes of the North Atlantic Alliance made about 2,300 rocket-bomb attacks on almost a thousand objects on the territory of Serbia and Montenegro. In total, 23,000 missiles and aerial bombs were dropped on Yugoslavia, including about 14,000 aerial bombs with a total weight of 27,000 tons. Among the main targets of the rocket-bombing attacks were Yugoslav air defense targets, which were hit by F-16CG and F-15E Strike Eagle aircraft, including AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapon glide bombs. The air defense of Yugoslavia failed to effectively counter the bombing and was practically destroyed. Industrial enterprises, oil storage facilities, infrastructure and energy facilities, logistics hubs, including railway and road bridges were also hit. Also, the bombing caused casualties among the civilian population and the destruction of dozens of medical and educational institutions, historical and architectural monuments, and about 40,000 residential buildings. Subsequently, the casualties among the civilian population of Yugoslavia and the destruction of non-military objects during the bombing of the country by NATO forces allowed the Russian Federation to blasphemously justify the war crimes of the Russian military during the large-scale Russian attack on Ukraine. For example, if the NATO countries could bomb Yugoslavia, then the Russian Federation seems to have the right to strike Ukraine with impunity, destroy civilian objects and kill Ukrainian civilians, disregarding any international treaties and conventions, rules and customs of war. The possible provision of AGM-154 JSOW guided air bombs to Ukraine as part of the new US aid package to Ukraine could significantly help the Defense Forces to counter Russian aggression. However, there are a number of factors that can negatively affect the use of AGM-154 JSOW against military targets of the Russian Federation. First of all, it is Russian air defense, significantly more powerful than what Yugoslavia once had. In addition, as a counterpart to the Russian KAB, a guided air bomb, the AGM-154 JSOW is a fairly expensive munition. Depending on the modification, its price is from almost 300 thousand and significantly higher. Considering the price, the number of such AGM-154 JSOW that can be transferred to Ukraine within the limits of the new aid package cannot be significant and commensurate in number with the Russian anti-tank missiles, with which the Russian army regularly strikes Ukrainian territory. Not to mention that the US has a limited number of AGM-154 JSOWs that it can transfer to Ukraine. High-quality high-precision ammunition of Western production may, in general, turn out to be less effective than cheap, low-quality Russian anti-aircraft guns, which will be taken not so much by the accuracy of hits as by the mass of use. Only the practical use of the transferred ammunition will show whether it will be possible to defeat Russian numbers with American quality and deal with Russia -according to the Yugoslav scenario-.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/27/amerykanski-kaby-dlya-f-16-zdolaty-rosiyu-za-yugoslavskym-sczenariyem/	2024-09-26T20:20:19-07:00

So that everyone who gets involved understands from the beginning what steps need to be taken, what documents to complete, in order to eventually end up in your military unit, where they are waiting for you, in the position that you yourself chose,- said Oleksiy Bezhevets. The authorized MOU also informed that this is already the 39th Ukrainian army recruiting center of this format in Ukraine. More than 18,000 citizens have already used the services of such centers.

So that people can conveniently come here or call, contact recruiters and not be afraid of anything. You can come or call, at least ten times, if necessary. The experience of the recruiting center on the right bank is absolutely positive. Kyivans and guests of the capital come and are interested.

Winter is near, autumn is already here: are the Defense Forces ready for the cold	The chief of the planning department of the 13th brigade of operational assignment -Charter- told about this on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- - Lieutenant Colonel Anton Baev of the National Guard of Ukraine. — With the change of season, we see that the forest begins to fall and the terrain begins to open up. This is good for us, because we begin to see the enemy where he was not visible. And secondly, it is a risk for our units. But we already went through it at the previous place, where we performed combat missions. We already know this situation, we know how to prepare for it, said the soldier. He said that, first of all, the change of season will affect the nature of the infantrymen's combat work. - The conditions of our area were such that it was a dense forest, our assault groups always noticed that it was difficult to work in the forests, because when we entered the forest, the visibility was no more than 2 meters. Almost blindly, our units advance through the forest, and contacts with the enemy can occur on level ground, - said the soldier. He assured that they started actively preparing for the change of season and weather conditions in the unit at least a month and a half ago. — The brigade went on combat missions for the first time precisely during the winter. We were preparing even before the exit, we calculated everything and prepared well. Therefore, this situation is not critical for us at the moment. Having some experience, we are preparing for this in advance, - emphasized the military man. The officer explained that the planning processes take place in advance, because in no case can one afford to miss the moment, especially in the conditions of war. — Our units are equipped with warm clothes and heating devices. But we understand that no matter how much you put on the front, it is a war, and any position can be destroyed along with all the property that is there, - noted the military man. He also explained the danger of a number of measures to arrange permanent residences and heating in the conditions of hostilities. Common in civilian life, they are unacceptable near the battle line. — For example, we can't put a burgher in the front positions, because it's smoke, it's unmasking. Therefore, it is necessary to purchase additional power supplies, such as EcoFlow, and some small chemicals that help warm hands, feet, and so on, the officer noted. In addition, Anton Baev drew attention to the peculiarities of arranging shelters depending on weather conditions and soil characteristics. — The soil behaves differently, the water level can rise and fall. Some means are needed that will pump water from the positions so as not to sit knee-deep in water, he noted. The -Charter- brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine prepares for all this in advance. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in Russian trenches are dug by -disposable slaves- and deliberately and purposefully shoot at their own (she explained why is this the norm for the enemy), and also informed that the occupiers use outdated Soviet armored vehicles, which, however, make a combat unit and change the methods of its protection.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/26/zyma-blyzko-osin-vzhe-chy-gotovi-syly-oborony-do-holodiv/	2024-09-26T01:49:18-07:00

-Parktronic- for the drone: the occupiers are improving the system of protection of reconnaissance U...	About how the Ukrainian defenders overcome the resistance of the Russians, on the broadcast of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon the deputy commander told Oles Malyarevich of the 92nd separate assault brigade named after the basket chieftain Ivan Sirk of the -Achilles- shock air defense battalion. — Every day, we used some solutions, because the enemy is already putting anti-aircraft missiles on these planes, and rear-view cameras to see what is flying up. This is a very difficult job, which is carried out by our best pilots and technical personnel of the battalion. This is a special mission and they are doing it successfully, he said. The classic -projectile and armor competition- — the confrontation between the means of destruction and protection — has found new manifestations in the -war of drones.- However, the technical solutions of the enemy help him only temporarily. — It happens that we shoot down one or two UAVs every day, and then we cannot do it for three or four days because they invented a solution to counter us. We gather a technical quorum of specialists, decide what needs to be done to beat them in this matter, find these solutions and continue working. This is a constant struggle of technologies, minds, - said the military man. He noted that the main task of Ukrainian drones is to deprive the Russian occupiers of seeing the positions and movements of the units of the Defense Forces on the ground. He also expressed confidence that the soldiers of the Defense Forces always surpass the enemy in terms of knowledge and creativity. - On their part, it must be admitted that there are many intelligent people who, unfortunately, work for destruction, for death, while we work for life. I am sure that our intellectual potential is much higher than that of the enemy, and we will win because of this. Not with quantity, but with quality, with intelligence, - emphasized the officer. The officer said that over the past few days, the drones of the -Achilles- attack UAV battalion shot down 16 enemy reconnaissance UAVs. - We learned to knock them down. After the war, we will tell how it was done, said Oles Malyarevich. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that reconnaissance UAVs of Russians have been shot down by drones for more than seven months.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/26/parktronik-dlya-drona-okupanty-vdoskonalyuyut-systemu-zahystu-rozviduvalnyh-bpla/	2024-09-26T00:34:42-07:00

We are talking about a mysterious building, which the occupiers will have next to the Kerch bridge. Her role is not yet clear. It can be both a hydrotechnical structure and barrier structures. -What it is will be clear when they finish it. And in this season, they most likely won't be able to do it. Because the period of storms is beginning and, accordingly, it will be very difficult to build something in such conditions. It may be a protective structure, it may be some kind of regular transition, but for now it may be a little too early to draw conclusions. In any case, we will see how they will pass in this period, which begins in the fall and ends already in the spring,- said Dmytro Pletenchuk. Also, according to the spokesman of the Armed Forces Navy, there are chances that the construction is completely useless - because from time to time the remains of any construction in the sea are washed ashore after another storm.

Destroy the enemy's artillery: the expert revealed the secret of the success of the Defense Forces o...	Military expert Petro Chernyk told ArmyInform why this was achieved and how much enemy artillery still needs to be destroyed in order to deprive Russia of the possibility of using these weapons against Ukraine. It is no secret that in order to suppress and destroy the artillery of the Russian occupiers, the Ukrainian defenders are conducting a counter-battery fight on different areas of the front. — First of all, there are a few very important questions about the artillery that need to be cleared up. Despite the fact that drones enter the great war as a very serious striking force, no one will ever replace artillery on the battlefield. Why? Of course, the drone is very good, it is a high-precision and high-quality weapon. But the drone can carry 2, 3, well, a maximum of 5 kg of explosives. Instead, 152-mm or 155-mm artillery ammunition is within 50 kg of the iron itself plus 5-7 kg of explosives, Petro Chernyk emphasizes. Another key point. Ammunition shrapnel is the primary impact force. After all, artillery ammunition can scatter them at great speed over large areas, that is, it is a much more powerful and serious striking force than a drone. Artillery therefore remains paramount in this war. At the moment, despite the use of even drones, at least 80% of the war takes place with the help of artillery. So far, the Defense Forces have set absolute records for the destruction of enemy artillery. More than 18,000 Russian artillery units were affected. That's a fantastic amount. At the beginning of this war, especially until the spring of 2023, 90% of the hits in counter-battery duels were actually done by artillery. That is, cannon on cannon. Why did we manage to work so well? Ukrainian gunners have modern means for accurate detection of enemy artillery. These are, in particular, counter-battery radars, which were provided by our partner countries as part of military assistance to counter Russian aggression. The German COBRA radar system is very effective in detecting enemy artillery. It is considered one of the world's best ground-based weapon detection systems. With a declared detection range of up to 100 km, COBRA is capable of detecting and classifying up to 40 units of artillery systems in two minutes. Plus, the American counter-battery system AN/TPQ-36 at a distance of up to 24 km can count up to 20 units of artillery barrels. And at close distances of 4-5 km, the AN/TPQ-48 and 50 systems are already operating. To defeat enemy armored vehicles, our artillery actively and extremely effectively uses -smart munitions- such as SMArt 155 and BONUS, which contain homing subelements. Let's not forget the M982 Excalibur guided munitions. In the spring of 2023, the mass use of FPV drones began. Precisely for the destruction of enemy artillery installations. — Our gunners have learned to calculate the location of the enemy's artillery installations very well. By the way, again thanks to these counter-battery systems. They were able to accurately direct FPV drones. Therefore, we have a phenomenal result for the summer of this year. More than 4,500 artillery installations of the Rosarmy were affected. If you divide this indicator by the number 72 (for example, the regular artillery brigade of the enemy is 72 artillery units. - Ed.), then more than 60 enemy artillery brigades were destroyed (damaged). But there are several nuances. Because quite understandable questions arise, why does Russia have such huge reserves in terms of artillery supply? And what is their margin of safety? At the beginning of the invasion, the regular complex of the Russian Federation had approximately 5,400 barrels and more than 10,000 in storage. Plus up to 5 thousand mortars. Currently, according to the General Staff of the Armed Forces, more than 18,000 enemy artillery systems have been destroyed. But there is a certain pitfall, I would say, in terms of calculation. It's not a bug, it's just that accounting is very complicated. — Let's take a look at the D-20 installation as an example. It is a heavy gun, has a large armor plate, and is on rubber wheels. A drone flies into it with a 2-3 kilogram explosive. A cannon is considered hit even if the wheels are burned and the sight is broken. But often after the explosion, the barrel, breech and recoil remain intact. How to count then? Is it already a decommissioned barrel or not? No, not written off, explains Petro Chernyk. Losses are not 100% destruction of artillery systems. In most cases, these are damages that only put the unit out of combat condition for a while, while keeping it repairable. - Then the Russians took the cannon to the factory, repaired it and returned it to the battle. That is, it is necessary to take into account the reverse cycle of equipment repair. It is simply impossible to calculate how many art barrels actually survived the repair. Therefore, in my opinion, 18 thousand destroyed artillery systems of the Russian Federation is not their absolute destruction. To be fair, it's an injury. It is a completely different thing when an Excalibur munition flies precisely on enemy equipment, and nothing is left of the installation. Then, of course, we can talk about the absolute destruction of technology. — Here lies the philosophy of answering the question, what is the enemy's margin of safety. And it is extremely difficult to give an exact answer, how much more needs to be hit, plus 6 or 7 thousand artillery installations, in order to completely deprive Russia of the possibility of using artillery on the battlefield, the military expert claims. It should not be forgotten that the Soviet Union produced a huge number of samples of a wide variety of artillery and delivered them, in particular, to so-called friendly countries. Russia is conducting targeted work to return artillery systems from African countries to ensure its own needs in the war against Ukraine. The Chinese are very covertly, in small numbers, but also provide the Russians with these weapons.

Three days in a coma, -Smerch- and pure victory in Japanese: the story of teacher - warrior Anton	The first story is about military serviceman Anton, a former educator and physical education teacher of the Novomykolaiv educational and rehabilitation center. What is it like to live without one kidney after being injured on the Bakhmut direction? Why did Anton's father not recognize his son's voice in September 2022? A military man told ArmyInform about this: - Before serving in the Armed Forces, I worked in an educational institution for children with severe speech disabilities. Work there was very difficult and troublesome. The groups of children were small, 12–16 students, because in such a school you have to pay more attention to everyone. He was a physical education teacher there, but most of the time he worked as an educator&#8230; Two educators were assigned to each class, who, in fact, performed the function of parents. For example, my shift starts. I take the children to the dining room. After that, they change clothes and the self-training begins. And you work with the children until the evening. Then you put them to sleep. One word, like a hen with chicks. And you come in the morning, wake up the children, dress them for lessons, and everyone should be clean and washed. You take them to breakfast, then take them to class and sit them at their desks, check for workbooks, textbooks. Morally, it is difficult&#8230; At that time, I was young, I still had enough strength. But if now, I probably wouldn't have the strength for such a job. Because, really, hard work. But then it's nice when your former, already adult students see you on the street, come up to say hello, and you understand that you worked for nothing. In 2017, I started serving in the 93rd separate mechanized brigade -Kholodny Yar-. I consider it my military alma mater. It was there that I gained combat experience. A large-scale invasion was encountered in this brigade. And on September 22, 2022, I was seriously injured in the direction of Bakhmut. There was an arrival. RSZV -Smerch-. Cartridge ammunition. It broke very close to me. Immediately such pain was not felt. And then&#8230; As a result of the injury, the right kidney is absent. They collected me, as they say, piece by piece. I have prostheses and implants inside. In total, I had 10 operations in a month and a half. &#8230;In the hospital in Dnipro, the doctors put me in a coma for three days. When I woke up after that, I did not understand anything. He calmed down only when he saw his own sister in the ward. Another interesting moment before the hospital was when he was still at the headquarters. He opened his eyes. I asked the doctor for his phone number, dialed his father, because of all the numbers at that moment, he was the only one I remembered. And when you are under anesthesia, your voice changes for a certain period. I say: -It's me, your son Anton.- And the father: -This is not my son.- Because the number is not mine. And at that moment I say his favorite phrase, -wasari awaset ippon-. This is a judo term that translates to clear victory. Only then did my father recognize me. He asks what happened. I answer that it hurt a little, but everything is fine. All in all, I'm very lucky to be alive. But for something I stayed here in this world. &#8230;In July 2023, I was already in the army. Of course, he could not return to the brigade with such a diagnosis. Therefore, at first he served for a short period in one of the RTCC. Currently, I am in another structure of the Ground Forces Command. Some of the students who studied at the educational and rehabilitation center where I taught also joined the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. And even two have already died. &#8230;By the way, I support the fact that the concept of the school subject -Defense of Ukraine- is changing now. I consider it very appropriate. And it had to be done since 2014. Children must be taught so that they are ready. Moreover, we do not know what will happen tomorrow. It is necessary for children to be able to protect themselves, their family, their relatives. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/26/try-dni-v-komi-smerch-ta-chysta-peremoga-po-yaponsky-istoriya-vchytelya-voyina-antona/	2024-09-25T20:45:34-07:00

50 kg of happiness on the enemy's head: a heavy-duty drone with a significant flight range was prese...	Warsaw defense publication Defence24 notes that, first of all, the new concept of the Polish unmanned aerial vehicle Warmate 50 attracts attention with its size, ArmiyaInform reports. In addition to the general presentation of the concept of their new creation, the Polish aircraft builders have currently limited themselves &#8230; general data about this UAV. It became known that, compared to the previous products of the company, it has much larger dimensions and, as the name suggests, a warhead weighing 50 kg. This development is distinguished not only by its large dimensions, but also by its functionality, since in this case it is the first sample of a long-range kamikaze drone created in Poland. At the moment, it is assumed that the Warmate 50 will be able to hit targets at a distance of several hundred kilometers. As follows from the publication of the IKK Defense Express defense portal, its experts believe that the Polish long-range drone kamikaze is just taking its final shape. Because, for example, regarding the power plant, there is only general information that it will be an -internal combustion engine-, the expected indicators regarding speed and specific flight range are not mentioned. There is also only a general mention that, unlike previous models, the Warmate 50 has been developed with an approach that involves -maximizing combat effectiveness through the flexibility of surveillance functions-, so it will be an unmanned aerial vehicle -intended exclusively for strike missions-. -In other words, in the case of the Warmate 50, it is assumed that this kamikaze drone will hit stationary targets at a long distance according to predetermined coordinates, and the in-flight guidance function at the command of the operator will not be available,- DE experts said. It is emphasized that the basis for the development of Warmate 50 was the Warmate 20 kamikaze drone, which is equipped with a warhead weighing 20 kilograms and the presentation of which took place in May 2024. In general, Warmate 50 is given the following characteristics - this drone will be able to fly even to Moscow. UAVs from the Warmate family are well known to drone operators from the Defense Forces of Ukraine. Within the charity project -Polskie drony Warmate do obrony Ukrainy!- Polish benefactors donated money for the purchase of dozens of drones. Our editors told in detail about these winged products from RP. The mention of -Moscow- caused a nervous reaction -from across the border-. In those swamps, the traditional great-power curling took place. In particular, some news outlets at one time compared the Warmate 50's predecessor, the Warmate 20, to the Russian Lancet. At the same time, the Kremlin troubadours shyly forgot to clarify that this ZALA -Lancet- , well somehow, VERY similar to &#8230; Israeli drone HERO. Warmate 20 in the Russian Federation was called -an analogue of that which has no analogues-, arguing that the warhead is larger than that of the Lancet and smaller than that of the Shahed/Gerany. In turn, editors from Warsaw's Polskie Radio noted: -Warmate 50 is an example of a solution that is increasingly dominating the modern battlefield. Thanks to a powerful warhead and a long flight range, the drone can significantly strengthen the operational capabilities of the Polish armed forces, especially in the context of delivering high-precision strikes on strategic targets.- Presentation of UAV Warmate 50.

Who did the propaganda win this time: fictional adventures of the Akhmatians in Kurshchyna	This was noted by the Center for Strategic Communications and Information Security. In fact, this attack by a Kadyrov militant from the Akhmat unit is a development of the plot of Russian propaganda about the mass involvement of -mercenaries from NATO countries- in hostilities on the side of Ukraine. Russian fakers have been speculating on this since 2014. The plot about American mercenaries is needed by Kremlin propaganda to promote narratives about -foreign governance- in Ukraine and the desperate struggle against NATO aggression. Putin's propaganda invents -Western mercenaries- to explain the defeats of the Russians and the successes of the Ukrainians, whom it has ridiculed for decades. And Forward Observations Group, which Russian disinformers call a -private military company,- is a tactical equipment and medical equipment company founded by American veteran Derrick Bales. It has nothing to do with military operations in Ukraine. Creating such fakes allows the Kremlin to have support among the Russian population and to explain its own military failures. The successes of the Ukrainian army are often portrayed as the result of the help of -all-powerful- Western forces, rather than as achievements of the Ukrainian military. the Kremlin also constantly tries to portray Ukraine as a state that is not capable of standing up to Russia on its own and needs -mercenaries- for support. This is part of the narrative about the weakness of the Ukrainian army and the alleged -external management- of the country.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/26/kogo-rospropaganda-pobyedila-czogo-razu-vygadani-prygody-ahmativcziv-na-kurshhyni/	2024-09-25T20:30:44-07:00

The MOU revealed the details of the restructuring of the procurement model for the Armed Forces with...	Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Dmytro Klimenkov informs about this. -It's not just about quantitative indicators of savings and procurement volumes, but also about fundamental shifts in resource management, digitalization, and the involvement of the Ukrainian manufacturer in the process of providing the army,- he said. One of the first strategic decisions of the new team was the restructuring of the procurement model for the Armed Forces according to NATO principles and with zero tolerance for corruption. -The Ministry abandoned the function of direct procurement, leaving behind only the establishment of the rules of the game. For this purpose, the Department of Procurement Policy was created within the structure of the Ministry of Defense - a key center for the development of procurement rules,- noted Dmytro Klimenkov. Direct purchases are assigned to specialized agencies: -Defense Procurement Agency- (AOZ) and -State Rear Operator- (DOT). They play a central role in meeting the needs of the Ukrainian army. According to the Deputy Minister of Defense, the division of functions is necessary for maximum transparency and prevention of corruption risks. A clear delineation of roles between the ministry and agencies ensures that each structure focuses on its tasks and also avoids conflicts of interest. AOZ took on the procurement of weapons and military equipment. DOT focused on rear support - the supply of food, fuel and lubricants, tangible property. These agencies are key elements in improving the efficiency and transparency of the procurement process for the Armed Forces. -However, as we move towards joining NATO, we are continuing procurement reform to improve efficiency and meet Alliance standards,- he said. In his opinion, one of the important steps was the decision to merge the two agencies responsible for the provision of defense needs into a single structure. Military practice showed that the parallel work of these agencies led to duplication of functions, inefficient use of resources and delays in decision-making.

-New women are giving birth-: in Kharkiv Oblast, the Russian command is fighting with -Zhukiv- tacti...	Why do Russians need this, the head of the planning department of the 13th operational brigade explained on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- appointment of -Charter- of the National Guard of Ukraine, Lieutenant Colonel Anton Baev. — It is a very common story for the enemy to discover our firepower precisely by manpower. The groups are sent precisely in order to draw attention to themselves and to draw out all our means, which begin to work actively to destroy and prevent the enemy from reaching our own infantry, he said. Such a lethal tactic for enemy infantrymen allows the enemy to identify fire positions and determine the fire system of Defense Forces units in order to then inflict fire damage on them. - In this way, our artillery and mortars are discovered - and they start working, - explained the soldier. When something goes wrong with the enemy, he does not hesitate to open artillery fire on those areas where his own infantry are. — Friendly fire is also present if everything falls apart in them, plans collapse, and they see that they are losing the initiative. Or we already proceed to certain actions and start to move a little, we make such small counterattacks, then they do not spare ammunition for the artillery and cover the squares where their units are located, - said Anton Baev. The Russian command is allowed to do so not only by the absence of any moral and ethical safeguards, but also by the presence of a sufficient number of manpower, which can be safely thrown to the slaughter, and the confidence that the losses will be replenished without delay. - We actually record from various sources - both from our air reconnaissance and from the interrogation of prisoners, which our brigade periodically takes, that our enemy is periodically replenished with manpower, - said the guardsman. Under such an approach, the quality of training of enemy soldiers does not matter at all. - This power can be different. As well as the barely mobilized and untrained ones, as well as those who have already fought a little. But there is constant replenishment, because as the fighting goes on, they lose a lot of manpower. And you have to hold on, you have to move forward, that's why they are constantly being replenished, - emphasized the officer. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that open artillery fire on own soldiers is a routine practice for the Russian military, and not an occasional excess.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/25/baby-novyh-narozhayut-na-harkivshhyni-rosijske-komanduvannya-voyuye-za-zhukivskoyu-taktykoyu/	2024-09-25T02:29:23-07:00

-The task remains unchanged-: the Armed Forces explained why the Russians are rushing to Kharkiv	What is the enemy's goal, explained by the commander of the -Achilles- air defense missile battalion on the broadcast of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon. Captain Yury Fedorenko of the 92nd separate assault brigade named after the Kosh chieftain Ivan Sirk. — For the enemy, the task remains the same - they are assigned the task of advancing as much as possible through the battle formations of the Defense Forces to the administrative borders of the city of Kharkiv with the aim of further raising firepower and inflicting fire damage on residential areas. It is important for the enemy to increase his terror, for him it is important to destroy Ukrainians, the officer said. For this purpose, the occupiers are trying to carry out shock and assault actions in the north of the Kharkiv region, first of all, on the part of the battle line that is closest to the administrative borders of the regional center. This is a shade of Hlyboke — Liptsi. However, the Defense Forces managed and continue to manage to deter the offensive actions of the enemy. It was possible to achieve this thanks to the combination of two factors - the effective actions of units to destroy the occupiers and the Kursk operation. — The defense forces managed to significantly defeat the enemy's shock-assault potential. Also, after the beginning of the Kursk operation, the enemy was forced in one way or another to transfer the reserves that were supposed to strengthen their grouping on this stretch to Kurshchyna, the drone commander explained. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that the Russians hit the two residential high-rise buildings in Kharkiv, in one of the damaged buildings, floors from the eighth to the third were destroyed, in general as a result of the heavy bombardment with six aerial bombs, it is known about three dead and more than 30 injured people.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/25/zavdannya-zalyshayetsya-nezminnym-u-zsu-poyasnyly-navishho-rosiyany-rvutsya-do-harkova/	2024-09-25T01:51:36-07:00

Good, but not enough - the Russian army bombed their own city	notified operational-tactical group -Kharkiv-. -This once again demonstrates the chaotic and carelessly planned nature of Russian military actions, which harm not only the civilian infrastructure of Ukraine, but also its own border settlements,- said the message of the Kharkiv Technical University. Such cases indicate the low accuracy of Russian airstrikes and the unreliability of guidance systems, in particular those that the enemy uses in universal planning and correction modules when equipping FABs with them. -In addition, this shows the incompetence and unwillingness of the Russian military to take into account the risks for its fellow citizens, which contributes to the deepening of the internal crisis in Russia,- - believes OTU -Kharkiv-. As reported by ArmyInform, the Russians continue bombing Suzha. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/25/dobre-ale-malo-armiya-rf-vdaryla-bomboyu-po-vlasnomu-mistu/	2024-09-24T21:27:53-07:00

Russia's war against Ukraine will end because the UN Charter will come into effect - the President	The text of the President's speech was published on his official website. -One day, in this hall, they will definitely say that Russia's war against Ukraine is over: not frozen, not suspended, not forgotten - truly over. And it will not happen because someone is tired of the war. Not because someone bargained something out of Putin. Russia's war against Ukraine will end because the UN Charter will come into force. It should work. Our Ukrainian right to self-defense must prevail. Our cooperation with peoples of the world who value life as much as we do. Our territorial integrity. Our sovereignty, the independence of our country. We are protecting what every nation would certainly like to protect for itself. And what the UN Charter guarantees for everyone,- said Volodymyr Zelenskyi. According to him, it is Russia that always has to lie to justify its war. Not Ukraine. Russia cannot refer to the UN Charter to explain what it is doing against Ukraine. Actually, in her perverted way, in her distorted world, she does refer to the Statute, but this is simply madness. -Russia remained silent because it could not explain why a Russian missile recently hit a grain ship heading to an Egyptian port across the Black Sea. Russia is either silent or lying about why its drones and missiles are detected in the airspace of Poland, Moldova, and Romania. Ukrainians are injured and die every day. Daily. Today again Russian bombs hit residential buildings. Even an ordinary bakery became a target. What is so threatening for Russia in the production of bread? Putin has no answer. And Russia never has an honest answer to the question of why its army kills children in Ukraine, -defeats- schools and hospitals, fights not for justice, but for the blackout of a neighboring nation,- the President said. According to him, Putin has nothing to say if you ask him why he is trying to drag Belarus into war, why his propagandists threaten the peoples of the Caucasus or Central Asia, or why Russia invests most not in the development of humanity, but in hatred. Russia has no legitimate reason—absolutely—for making Iran and North Korea de facto accomplices in their criminal war in Europe when their weapons kill Ukrainians and help Putin steal Ukrainian land from the Ukrainian people. -We know that some people in the world want to talk to Putin. We know that. Meet, talk, communicate. But what exactly can they hear from him? That he is upset because we are exercising our right to protect our people? Or that he wants to continue the war and terror just so that no one thinks he was wrong? This is also madness,- noted Volodymyr Zelenskyi. He reminded that from the first second of this war, Russia is doing something that cannot be justified in any way according to the UN Charter. Every destroyed Ukrainian city, every burnt village — and there are already hundreds and hundreds of them — is proof that Russia is committing an international crime. And that is why this war cannot simply -subside-. -That is why this war cannot be calmed down by talks. Necessary actions. And I am grateful to all the nations that are really helping in ways that save the lives of our people. Putin has violated so many international norms and rules that he will not stop himself. Russia can only be forced to make peace. And this is exactly what is needed - to force Russia to make peace as the only aggressor in this war, the only violator of the UN Charter,- the President urged. He reminded that now, with the approach of the third winter of this war, Russia is again trying to destroy the Ukrainian energy industry, and this autumn it is acting even more cynically. -They are preparing to attack our nuclear power plants, three of them, we have this information and we have evidence of this. If Russia is willing to go this far, it means that none of what you value matters to Moscow. This kind of Russian cynicism will continue to strike if it is given any place in the world. The UN Charter leaves no room for this. And that is why the Peace Formula also leaves no room,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy assured. He recalled how in 2022, at the height of the war, while proposing the Peace Formula, he proposed to adhere to the UN Charter — to make effective everything for which this organization was created. Each point of the Peace Formula is based on the principles, goals and norms of the UN Charter - on the rights it guarantees to countries and on the resolutions of the General Assembly, which are already supported by the majority of countries. -And there are not different versions of the UN Charter for different parts of the world. There are no regional quasi-statutes. There is no separate UN Charter for the BRICS or the G7. There is no separate Russian-Iranian UN Charter or separate Sino-Brazilian UN Charter. There is only one UN Charter that unites everyone — should unite everyone. There is only one way to a just peace - clear steps that everyone understands equally, and this is reflected in the Peace Formula. This is the implementation of the UN Charter. And we all know what needs to be done if we honestly assess the situation and really want to stop Russia's war. And the most important thing is to act. Together, of course. Of course, in unity. Without creating new and unnecessary divisions of the world into blocs or regional groups. Unity always works for the benefit of peace,- the President assured. He stated that it is necessary to prepare a second Peace Summit to end the war. All together. And invited all principled nations to join Ukraine in this process. All those who truly respect the UN Charter. -We invite China. We invite Brazil. I have already invited India. We work with African countries, with all of Latin America, the Middle East, Central Asia, Europe, the Pacific region, and North America. All are equally important for peace. All of them. No exceptions. Just as the UN Charter should work without exception. This is the process that will lead us to peace. To a just peace. Real peace. Peace that will last. We all already know how to achieve it. We have the Peace Formula. We have the UN Charter. And we have all the forces necessary to implement this. All it takes is determination. Thank you very much. Glory to Ukraine!- Volodymyr Zelenskyi said. As reported by ArmyInform, The President discussed with the US Congress defense packages and strengthening of sanctions against the Russian Federation. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/25/vijna-rosiyi-proty-ukrayiny-zavershytsya-tomu-shho-zapraczyuye-statut-oon-prezydent/	2024-09-24T21:03:31-07:00

Surface radio electronic fighter: French developers offer military sailors the Magellan drone	How informed the defense portal EDR, the mission of the novelty is to perform various tasks, starting from radio-electronic warfare, information gathering, target detection and identification, and ending with reconnaissance and surveillance of surface and underwater objects, ArmyInform reports. With a length of six meters and a displacement of 1,000 to 1,200 kilograms, Magellan is an addition to the Couach product line. from its R&D department, Couach Shipyard, to ensure a systematic response to the needs expressed by customers. According to the designers of the unmanned vessel, it was expected to embody three key characteristics: technological modularity, perfect sea characteristics and practicality of operation. The ship's hull is made of composite, carbon and Kevlar, which makes it strong and adaptable to defense needs. Couach Shipyard's research in maritime security makes Magellan a platform capable of handling the constraints at sea. The drone is highly resistant to water and was designed using self-leveling technology. Its innovative hybrid diesel-electric propulsion is based on the use of a 13 kW micro-turbine, which allows it to sail for 5 days at a speed of 6 knots with reduced noise to provide drone camouflage. Magellan features a modular technology platform design capable of carrying a large volumetric payload – over 500 liters – for the integration of end-user-selected equipment. The drone can be equipped with modules that allow, for example, to deploy acoustic buoys or ESM (electronic support measures) modules. The marine drone in the USV version contains a mission planning module, its ground or airborne control center provides mission monitoring for its user. The design of the drone has been optimized by Chantier Naval Couach's research and development department to maximize its practicality for the user. The Magellan Marine Drone is designed to be easily transported in a standard 20-foot container and retrieved without assistance thanks to its retractable mast and lifting hook without the use of a recovery system. Couach Shipyard, already recognized for its expertise in the construction of composite ships, applied its expertise to the field of drones for the first time with the Magellan. This development is the result of a high-tech turnaround by Couach following the establishment of a research and development department at the shipyard, which has already led to a significant increase in system integration skills on ships.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/25/nadvodnyj-radioelektronnyj-borecz-franczuzki-rozrobnyky-proponuyut-vijskovym-moryakam-dron-magellan/	2024-09-24T20:44:24-07:00
Defense of Zmiyny, capture and reward for battles in Kurshchyna: the story of Major Kryklyvy	One of the names on the list of awardees is Major Yaroslav Kryklyvy. The officer was awarded the Order of Bohdan Khmelnytskyi, II degree. He is currently the commanding officer of the 501st Marine Corps Separate Battalion. ArmyInform tells more about the serviceman. In 2020, Yaroslav Kryklyvy had the rank of lieutenant. During one of the exercises in the Black Sea, the officer was the commander of a marine infantry platoon in the ranks of the 88th separate MP battalion. In 2021, the officer already headed the company and, together with the unit, participated in the international Agile Spirit training. 2022. A full scale invasion. Yaroslav Kryklyvy performed tasks on Zmiiny Island. The battalion was on the island in rotation: a month there, a month at home for retraining. With irony, he says that he met a great war -on a tropical island.- The combatant recalls that on the morning of February 24, 2022, a military observation post reported a warship on the horizon. It was the Moscow missile cruiser. Several more enemy ships followed him. At first, Zmiiny fired at the cruiser -Moscow-, after that the enemy used other ships and aircraft. Yaroslav Kryklyvy became one of those captured by the Russian military at Zmiyny. First, they were taken to the temporarily occupied Crimea, then they promised to take them to mainland Ukraine, but they brought them to the territory where there was frost and a lot of snow. Yaroslav does not know the exact location, he only remembers that it took about 12 hours to fly from Sevastopol. The prisoners were kept in the camp, they were constantly interrogated by the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation, the attitude of the guards was inhumane, recalls the battalion commander: - The guards allowed themselves to do just what they wanted. There was a rat race. If you want to go, roughly speaking, for a cigarette, you will be released from the cell. They give you time, you start to run away, then they release the dog. Didn't have time - -he will bite you, no problem,- recalls In 2023, Officer Screaming commanded the 501st Marine Separate Battalion. In particular, the military is involved in the operation of the Defense Forces of Ukraine on the territory of the Kursk region. They work effectively. Yes, on September 23, the Navy Command shared video , how servicemen of the 501st battalion capture the enemy in Kurshchyna.

Why is the enemy lying about the F-16	Fake information is spreading on the Internet that the Pentagon allegedly believes that Ukrainian pilots are -unfit to perform complex tasks on F-16 fighter jets.- It is because of this that Ukraine has allegedly already lost one plane and does not cross the front line with fighter jets. The authors of the -dump- refer to interview of the commander of the US Air Force in Europe and Africa, General James Hecker, to the Air &amp; Space Forces Magazine. In fact, American General James Hacker did not make such categorical statements. Propagandists deliberately distorted the content of the general's interview in order to once again -cast a shadow- on the Ukrainian military and to quarrel Ukraine with its allies. James Hecker did not say anything about the -unsuitability- of Ukrainian pilots. On the contrary, the publication emphasizes that F-16s are successfully used to destroy Russian cruise missiles and drones. Moreover, according to the commander, Ukrainian F-16 maintenance specialists demonstrate high results. Of course, there is no statement in the original publication that Ukrainian pilots do not fly into the temporarily occupied territories or Russian airspace because of their -unqualification-. The content of the alleged Russian quotes from this interview is a complete lie. Fakers hoped that Ukrainian journalists would pick up this -deza- without checking the original text. But this time it was possible to expose the forgery. However, it often happens that our journalists, in pursuit of sensationalism, rebroadcast enemy propaganda narratives and spread fabrications ordered by the Kremlin. That is why, if the information causes even a little doubt, its sources should be carefully checked.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/25/navishho-vorog-breshe-pro-f-16/	2024-09-24T20:30:51-07:00
-The best we have-. The crew talks about the unique mortar -Rak- based on the APC -Rosomak-	This is the newest technique that has proven itself very well on the battlefield. And yes, in terms of accuracy and maneuverability, there is no time to look for something similar among mortars. The commanders of the crews of these mortars told the correspondent of Armiya TV about the advantages and technical characteristics, as well as combat missions and tasks of -Rak-. We meet with the guys in camouflaged positions during combat duty. Mortars are driven into caponiers, covered with a net and blend into the thick of the forest, but are ready to go out on a combat mission at any moment. -Rak- works on the basis of the -Rosomak- armored personnel carrier and is able to cover with accurate fire the concentration of enemy infantry. Usually our guys work on it at a distance of 5-6 km from -zero-. After receiving a combat mission, they go to the specified position, deploy in a matter of seconds and, after working, return to a relatively safe place of deployment. . Or the way the guys work now: get the target early, get closer, practice and hide back. If you stand on the defensive, close to the skirmish line, without moving, then there is a threat of detection. Therefore, the machines are deployed a little further away, taking turns to perform tasks. -Rosomak- allows you to move quickly, and -Rak- itself does not need special deployment. The guys say that the most time is spent on pointing &#8211; the machine needs some time to -find- itself in space. It happened that the system itself took longer to prepare than the combat work lasted. -In general, I like everything, cool equipment. The main thing &#8211; mobile To be honest, I thought it would last less. But he spends so much time fighting,- &#8211; Mitya admits. The Russians have a special interest in this technique, as in all foreign ones, they hunt for it. The crew commander explains that it is not a static mortar that stands in a specific place: it is not set at zero, and in general it is used very competently. -This is a fat target, the car is so double-decker,- &#8211; says Mitya, casting a proud glance at Rosomak, hidden next to us in the hood. All the fighters of the crew, and there are four of them working on the -Rak-, constantly emphasize that mortars are very important in the current combat realities. -In order to leave, he did the work and hid. So that foreign copters could not burn our positions. When it is stationary, the threat of detection is much higher. And just like here, he came, worked and returned,- &#8211; says fighter Oleg, who in the crew is responsible for supplying mines. In general, the execution of a standard combat task can take 5-10 minutes. Most of the time is spent on the machine -finding- itself on the battlefield before working on an enemy target. -Rak- &#8211; this is a 120 mm mortar that began to be developed by Poland in the mid-zeros. More than ten years passed until this weapon, based on the -Rosomak- armored personnel carrier, entered service with the Polish Army. This is its uniqueness &#8211; the Polish defense company actually developed from scratch and launched practical and modern weapons that are competitive on the world market. It became known in the spring of 2023 that Warsaw would transfer these mortars to Kyiv. The crew commander with the call sign -Bob- recalls: we trained on simple mortars in Poland, and then just during the training it became known that they were giving us -Rak-, so we immediately and switched to them. If we talk about the maintenance of this equipment, our soldiers say, there are no particular issues here either. After the fire, with the help of a compressor, powder gases are immediately blown out and liquid is supplied, which cools the barrel. The guys work on average 5 km from the front line. At such a distance, -Rak- hits very accurately. The TTX indicates that its maximum range is 12 km. But -Bob- says that during the exercises, when it came to such long-range projectiles, even the Poles themselves had not seen them. In general, adds - Mityai-, he can aim -in an apple- at 6500 m. -At this distance hits perfectly. And he can go on and on, pouring and pouring. Maybe the copters will help to hover there a little left and right. And you can take it apart,- &#8211; he explains. If we talk about weather conditions, the car performs well in various situations. Doesn't he really like the swamp? The commander adds that the car is heavy, 24 tons, and can get stuck in a rut in the field in the rain and not get out. Worked fine in the winter. -But on a flat road it goes 100 km/h, we drove like that in the field. It can drive 110 km/h on asphalt,- &#8211; - Mityai- tells not without delight. One of these trips is immediately remembered by -Bob-, the commander of the same -Rak-: we were told that they were already flying after us - Lancet- and -Supercam- had to return urgently. -He gave (gas, &#8211 ; ed.), I was already afraid of the -Supercam-, but the speed at which we were driving. But he is handsome. Inside there, you had to hold on with all your might,- &#8211; says the fighter. Now the guys are working in manual mine feeding mode, although basically in -Rak- it happens automatically. It does not affect the working time, so it is even faster to work out, say the fighters and laugh: maybe the charger sweats more, there is not much space, so it is quite uncomfortable for him. The undoubted technological advantage of the mortar is the -Topaz- digital fire control system. -The machine itself knows where it is. I can move 500 meters to the side, it will adjust the data and continue to work,- &#8211; details -Mitaya-. At the same time, the crew commander points out that it is not worth putting her stationary so that she guards -zero-, because in the era of drones, she will probably be found quickly. Our -Rak- can carry 20 mines in a cassette and another 26 on board. The fighters explain how they work: one machine is loaded while the other works at the position. When the ammunition ran out, it was immediately replaced by the next one, and so on in a circle. The car is good, it cannot be compared with Soviet equipment, the crew members sincerely say: -It has cruise control here , music can be heard in the cabin, even inside the tower. When we've worked it out, and we go back, we drive under a hundred, we turn it on via AUX for ourselves.- When asked if the Russians are afraid of such weapons, the crew says: previously, during combat work, the occupiers simply did not understand what was the matter &#8211; when a couple of mines landed very precisely in each landing. They heard their negotiations, they simply did not understand that this is how mines fall one after another. Mainly, says the commander, they work on foot: - they, the Russians, are constantly trying to advance, then ours detect accumulations of manpower, warehouses in landings, where they are entrenched- . TheRak is a very accurate weapon, both crew commanders agree, and compared to other mortars, it is the best the Defense Force has. -He can attack well, also has a flurry mode &#8211; when three mines in a row are released under different trajectories. We also shot like that, only two, because for the third we need a clear horizon &#8211; it should take off at such an angle that it is too close to the collision line,- &#8211; says -Mitya-. -Bob- says that once a day six left in three crews. Then the Russians wanted to develop active offensive actions, so the mortars had to work on the accumulation of manpower in the landings. About a hundred mines were released in a day. The guys appreciate the training in Poland with gratitude, but they don't use much of what they learned in real combat. They admit that they have to gain experience on the go. They were taught well in Poland, there are no complaints about that, but they don't see the war that way, explains -Bob- and clarifies: they think they can come, deploy, as the book says . For example, during the exercises, the instructors there said that wait for the target until you get the coordinates for the car. But now in our war we don't have time to stand in the middle of the field like that wait, it's unrealistic, adds the commander. In general, -Mitjai- admits, he can now go to Poland himself and tell a couple of secrets about -Rak- . The boys are grateful to the Poles and French, who -put their soul- into the training of our soldiers: -When they saw us off, they cried.- During the conversation, the language I also talked about the fact that some people are afraid to join the Defense Forces, justifying it for various reasons. -Mityai- understands this attitude in some way, and states: yes, there are problems, but this does not mean that one should sit back. -Yes, there is a question. But what to do? Maybe you are right, somewhere there is a lack of a smart commander or something else. But what to do? Well, come, be smart, do something, help. I always question such people, ok, you are right, but what next, what are your actions? Just sit and wait? There is no answer,- &#8211; he explains. The crew commander, a large man with a strong physique, admits that he himself did not plan to be in this place &#8211; I always didn't like -boxes-, although I served since the time of the ATO. -I tell them, I don't want to wear armor. Let's study with a mortar. So he got into the mortar box. But I don't regret being here at all,- &#8211; he recalls his transfer. A mechanic-driver -Rak- with the call sign -Forest- adds that, in his opinion, in the army any experience will be useful: from an IT specialist to a cook, to a technician and a tractor driver. -In short, I don't know except what a janitor in the army can do... Ah, sweep tracks!-, &#8211; he jokes. Our conversation is interrupted by three distinct explosions nearby. The guys say that a few kilometers away, the Russians are -unwinding- the settlement with KABs. According to them, the occupier's usual tactics in this area &#8211; simply erase villages and cities. -Oh, they finish with cassettes. Probably -Hurricane--, &#8211; says one of the fighters. While the occupiers are burning our land with -squares-, the crews of -Rak- self-propelled mortars are returning to combat duty. After all, at any moment they can be called to a task: leave, destroy the enemy with accurate fire, and hide in their capon again. More about the self-propelled mortar -Rak- based on the -Rosomak- armored personnel carrier, watch soon on the Army TV channel, subscribe here so you don't miss it.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/25/najkrashhe-shho-u-nas-ye-ekipazh-rozpovidaye-pro-unikalnyj-minomet-rak-na-bazi-btr-rosomak/	2024-09-24T20:00:54-07:00

A delegation of the Armed Forces of Lithuania visited Ukraine	The Land Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reported this on September 24. The delegation led by the commander of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Lithuania, Brigadier General Arturas Radvilas, visited higher military educational institutions and training centers, met with the commander of the Ground Forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Lieutenant General Oleksandr Pavliuk. The representatives of the Ukrainian side talked about the training of personnel, demonstrated the material and technical base, and shared the experience of conducting combat operations in modern conditions. The delegation of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Lithuania highly appreciated the Ukrainian experience in the use of electronic warfare (EW) and unmanned aerial systems (UAVs), which are an important part of the Armed Forces. In particular, each brigade of the Ground Forces has its own separate units that perform such functions. The guests noted the high level of quality of the training programs that were developed and used in Ukraine for the training of cadets of educational institutions and servicemen of the Armed Forces units. The commander of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Lieutenant General Oleksandr Pavlyuk, noted the readiness to share with international partners the experience of using electronic warfare and air defense systems, acquired during the conduct of hostilities against the Russian aggressor. In particular, the Department of Accumulation and Generalization of Experience has been created within the Ground Forces Command, the activities of which will soon be presented to the military attachés of the embassies of partner countries. The Lithuanian guests also saw the passing of a psychological obstacle course by military personnel undergoing basic military training. This test is important and one of the most difficult stages of every fighter's training. In conditions as close as possible to combat, Ukrainian servicemen, accompanied by experienced instructors, demonstrate tactical training skills, physical endurance and psychological stability. At the end of the visit, Brigadier General Arturas Radvilas visited the Chernobyl zone. It was here in 2022 that one of the routes to the occupation of part of the Kyiv region by the Russian army lay. The consequences of those events were the terrible crimes of the Russians, in particular, the mass murders of the civilian population in the communities of the Kyiv region, which were condemned by the civilized world. Cooperation with Lithuanian partners allows the Ground Forces to become stronger. In turn, NATO member states gain a better understanding of the threat of neighboring an aggressor state and the importance of Ukrainian experience in effectively countering such risks. As reported by ArmyInform, the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Lithuania visited the fortifications in Chernihiv region.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/24/ukrayinu-vidvidala-delegacziya-zbrojnyh-syl-lytvy/	2024-09-24T11:57:25-07:00

And we will continue to clean the system,- said Rustem Umyerov. He said that when he took office a year ago, the Ministry of Defense did not even have internal security. -We created the Department of Homeland Security from scratch. And today this department directly cooperates very closely with all law enforcement, anti-corruption, special bodies,- said the Minister of Defense. The Ministry of Defense also has an internal anti-corruption service and a separate internal audit department. -We do not reveal the algorithm of work - if someone thinks that they are smarter than our people, they will end up like that,- added Rustem Umyerov. As reported by ArmyInform, Rustem Umyerov held a meeting with the ambassadors of the Group of Seven (G7) countries and summarized the team's achievements during the first year of work in the department.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/24/rustem-umyerov-u-ministerstvi-oborony-nulova-tolerantnist-do-korupcziyi/	2024-09-24T11:49:18-07:00
He simply could not stay away from that trouble - the TCC officer told about his motivation	combat path of the officer was told by operational command -North-. Yuriy is a teacher by education. He worked by profession, then in local self-government bodies. He was the deputy and then the chairman of the district council. On February 24, 2022, he volunteered for the TCC and SP in Kozel region. At that time, his military experience consisted only of short-term service in the late 1980s. In the early 2000s, he completed training and obtained the rank of lieutenant, military specialty — an officer from the Military Academy. -Like most volunteers, I was motivated by the realization that I had to go to defend my Motherland, my own family. I simply could not stay away from the disaster that fell on our land,- Yuriy Marchenko said. He was immediately mobilized to the security company of the TCC and SP in Kozel region. He was the deputy commander for moral and psychological support. But a year later, on February 24, 2023, he voluntarily enrolled in the ranks of the 407th separate rifle battalion, which was just being formed at that time. Appointed to the position of commander of a rifle company, and a few months later transferred to the position of head of the intelligence group of the headquarters. After three months of training and coordination, in May 2023, the unit went to the place of execution of tasks. Kharkiv Oblast, then Kherson Oblast, Kyiv Oblast. Performed the task of protecting objects on 2-3 lines of defense. In the fall, they received a new task: to advance into Donetsk region in the Avdiyiv direction. -At the end of October, they got to the Avdiiv coke plant. I was the chief of military intelligence, we were engaged in planning. The main thing was establishing cooperation with other units, planning reconnaissance and surveillance of the enemy, and providing information to the command,- Yuriy Marchenko recalled. The enemy constantly attacked the positions of the rifle battalion with various types of weapons - mortars, artillery, tanks, regularly dropped from the planes of the KaBa. Heavy fighting took place when the enemy entered the rear of the Ukrainian units through the extensive system of underground communications in the -Tsarska Okhota- area at the end of January. Then the attack was repulsed, all communications on the territory of the plant were worked out in order to prevent the enemy from entering the territory of the Koksokhim plant this way, the officer says. The main personnel of a separate rifle battalion were withdrawn from the territory of the plant on February 12-13, 2024. -It was planned to move the battalion to another part. Our command post remained in place there. But the situation turned out to be such that we received a command to leave. On the 15th, we left in small groups of five - there were 24 of us. Then we were picked up by cars and taken to Myrnograd,- said the soldier. According to him, at that time they went out on foot in an unknown area, under constant fire and between mines. Then, in two days, he counted almost 250 KABs on the territory of the plant - enemy planes were in the air almost constantly. Captain Marchenko managed to get out without injuries. However, he admits, there were many concussions - no one counted them in those conditions. Although it was difficult, says the soldier, he held on to the belief that everything would be fine. He kept in touch with relatives thanks to the Internet. They also encouraged each other with their brothers who were nearby. From Myrnograd, the unit was taken to Cherkasy region for recovery. Yuriy was treated after the concussions he received and later underwent a medical examination and, according to its findings, was deemed unfit for service in combat units. He took up the relationship and already in April returned to his native Fourth Department of the Kremenchug TCC and SP in the Kozel region. Headed the documentation support group. Works with documents, deals with personnel issues and material support. Emphasizes that in order to win against a strong enemy, the Armed Forces of Ukraine need a motivated replenishment. -If not for us, men, to protect our Motherland, then who? Otherwise, the enemy will come here very quickly - to Poltava region. We have already seen how quickly he can advance when unopposed. I understand how important the work of territorial recruitment centers is in matters of replenishment of the Defense Forces. However, I also see the information press that today goes against the TCC. Because the task of the enemy is to disrupt the mobilization to the ranks of the Armed Forces by all means. And these IPSOs not only scare civilian men, who as a result try to avoid mobilization in every possible way. This also demotivates the soldiers who fight for Ukraine - some of them for three or four years. Military personnel also need time to rest. But who will replace them? The only way out is to postpone all refusals and stand up for Ukraine to everyone,- noted Yuriy Marchenko. As reported by ArmyInform, about such as Serhiy, a fighter of the 81st Slobozhan Brigade, called -Phantom-, it is said that they were born in a shirt. All because the soldier survived after the rupture of an 82-mm mine a few steps away from him.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/24/prosto-ne-mig-zalyshytysya-ostoron-tiyeyi-bidy-oficzer-tczk-rozpoviv-pro-svoyu-motyvacziyu/	2024-09-24T11:36:58-07:00

Are there alternatives to Telegram, the Center for Countering Disinformation at the National Securit...	It should be emphasized that it applies exclusively to military personnel, employees of state authorities and critical infrastructure enterprises, as well as employees of the security and defense sector. Is there a replacement for this popular messenger, do public authorities plan to switch to other popular platforms to disseminate information, and what safety rules should be followed when using messengers on the air of the national telethon Single News told Andriy Kovalenko, head of the Center for Combating Disinformation under the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine. He said that the Anti-Disinformation Center has a Viber channel with almost half a million subscribers. There is also an option to create a channel in the WhatsApp messenger. However, the problem is that a significant number of people are used only to the Telegram messenger, with the help of which it is convenient for them to receive information, so it is uncomfortable for them to switch to some new platforms. — This recommendation is not directly related to banning Telegram itself. Other solutions are needed if we are going to talk about any restrictions on Telegram as a means of receiving news in the future, Andriy Kovalenko emphasized. According to him, at the moment there is no question of the refusal of state authorities to run their own channels in Telegram. Also, those persons whose positions involve the need to do so will be able to use Telegram from work devices. Instead, consider using other messengers like Signal, WhatsApp, Threema, etc. for personal communication. At the same time, it is necessary to take care of personal safety and, if possible, completely refuse to send personal data, documents, photos through any messengers. It is also necessary to have strong passwords for all accounts in social networks. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that servicemen were banned from using Telegram on official duty. devices and explained why the military was banned from using the messenger. ArmyInform also wrote, that not so with Telegram and why information from Telegram - garbage poisons consciousness, and also informed, how the actions of French law enforcement officers against the founder of the popular messenger will help counter Russian aggression.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/24/chy-ye-alternatyvy-telegram-rozpovily-v-czentri-protydiyi-dezinformacziyi-pry-rnbo/	2024-09-24T11:12:34-07:00

They are slowly besieging the city, entering the flanks, and are beginning to mine the roads to Vugledar with drones,- he said. Mykola Voroshnov added that the Russians are conducting offensive actions simultaneously from all directions. -For example, they have a signal at 12:00 and they pushed for Pavlivky, Prychystivky, Vodiany. And it comes to the point that our drones don't just overheat the rotors or batteries, it overheats by itself and I don't want to take off anymore,- he said. However, units of the 72nd OMBr inflict maximum damage on the enemy, the enemy suffered huge losses. -But he steps over the heads of his own scum and continues to try to surround Ugledar with renewed strength. If you look at the city from a bird's eye view, then there is one solid haze around. Houses, farms, plantations, fields are burning,- he said.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/24/u-sylah-oborony-rozpovily-pro-sytuacziyu-u-vugledari-ta-bezperervni-shturmy-rosiyan/	2024-09-24T10:58:22-07:00

Telegram can track movement even when geolocation is turned off - NSDO	The head of the Center for countering disinformation under the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine told about this on the air of the national telethon -Edyni news- href=-https://youtu.be/j5TqaWCCdUg-> Andriy Kovalenko. -Few people know, for example, that Telegram can track movement even when geolocation is turned off,- he said. The head of the CSDP of the NSDC explained that such a function theoretically allows whoever controls the messenger to track the movements and whereabouts of any person who may be of potential interest. There is no zero chance that Telegram is controlled or accessed by Russian intelligence or other secret services of the occupiers. — We do not know 100% whether Russian intelligence has access and whether Durov is an agent or not an agent of Russian intelligence or whether he will cooperate. No one will give a guarantee, but the risk that your route will be with the enemy is quite high, explained Andriy Kovalenko. He noted that the risks of the Telegram messenger are not sufficiently known to users and poorly communicated in society, which massively uses this platform for news and personal communication. — The head of the State Security Agency, Kyrylo Budanov, constantly clearly says that Telegram poses a threat to national security. Because when the enemy can track your movement very simply using his actual messenger, which can be a tool for his intelligence, this is a threat. Therefore, such dangers must be voiced, the head of the Center for Combating Disinformation emphasized. Andriy Kovalenko also explained the reason why the ban on the use of Telegram on official devices and for sending official information to servicemen and employees of the security and defense sector, employees of state authorities and critical infrastructure enterprises caused a sharp reaction from society. — In my opinion, all because of the fact that now more than 70% of people consume news from Telegram channels. Accordingly, a large enough population is there, he said. In view of this, it is necessary to communicate more actively and explain the risks, threats and consequences that may arise from using the Telegram messenger. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that servicemen were banned from using Telegram on official duty. devices and explained why the military was banned from using the messenger. ArmyInform also wrote, that not so with Telegram and why information from Telegram - garbage poisons consciousness, and also informed, how the actions of French law enforcement officers against the founder of the popular messenger will help counter Russian aggression.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/24/telegram-mozhe-vidstezhuvaty-peremishhennya-navit-pry-vyklyuchenij-geolokacziyi-rnbo/	2024-09-24T10:32:04-07:00

Battles continue in two locations. The enemy once tried to dislodge our defenders from their positions in the Fedorivka districts on the Seversky direction with assault actions. The attack was repulsed, the enemy did not succeed. In the Kramatorsk direction Ukrainian soldiers repelled four attempts by the invaders to advance near Kalynyivka, Klishchiivka, Bila Hora and Predtechyny. The situation is under control. In the Toretsk direction, where the occupiers attacked our positions near Dachny, Toretsk and Nelipivka 15 times with the support of aviation, nine clashes have already been completed. Fighting continues near Toretsk. The main efforts of the enemy are directed in the direction of Pokrovsk.

Corvettes of the ADA type - what should the enemy be afraid of: about the powerful air defense syste...	Stepan Yakymyak notes that these ships are the latest models of multi-purpose ships of the near sea zone, capable of successfully fighting air, surface and underwater enemies. Corvettes are designed with low-visibility technologies in mind, which can reduce the range of their detection by the enemy. Also, these corvettes have the necessary means of radio-electronic, anti-aircraft, anti-ship and anti-submarine defense. In addition, the ships are equipped with aviation systems that significantly increase the radius of combat influence, and a modern strike missile system for destroying surface targets. These are very successful decisions that significantly expand the strike capabilities of the ship and its contribution to the support of joint forces on land. An analysis of the tactical and technical characteristics of ADA-type corvettes, their main armament and tactical properties demonstrates the significant potential capabilities of these ships. The military expert focuses on the armament of the air defense systems of these corvettes. For example, the joint use of an anti-aircraft missile complex (with a firing range of up to 20 km), a 35-mm anti-aircraft artillery installation (with a firing range of up to 4 km) and two 12.7-mm machine guns should ensure sufficiently dense anti-aircraft defense of the ship. This will make it possible to effectively counter a group of air targets that the enemy is able to form from supersonic land-based, sea-based and air-based anti-ship missiles and attack UAVs. It is expected that the anti-aircraft missiles of the ship complex should destroy the supersonic anti-ship missiles of the Russian Federation. We are talking, in particular, about Onyx-type missiles, which are in the arsenal of Bastion-type coastal missile systems of the Russian Federation. We will remind, several times these missiles were unsuccessfully used by the enemy to hit coastal targets on the Odesa coast. Stepan Yakymyak explains that the presence of modern anti-submarine weapons on corvettes creates significant capabilities in the fight against Russian submarines. - It is assumed that the latest samples of anti-submarine weapons (hydroacoustic complex and torpedo weapons. - Ed.) will ensure the early detection and destruction of modern submarines. Even such as project 636.3, which are in the arsenal of the Russian Federation. Let me remind you that these boats, equipped with cruise missiles of the Kalibr complex, launch systematic missile attacks on objects on the territory of Ukraine. Our corvettes will be equipped with shock missile weapons. If the missile complex will have a range of 150-300 or more kilometers, it will enable our ships to destroy (hit) enemy surface targets at the same distance. This is very important today, because the Russians have a significant number of combat surface ships of the main classes. — Let's simulate the situation. The use of only one ammunition in the amount of 8 missiles under different conditions will allow hitting an average of two to four surface targets. That is, it will be possible to disable 1-2 tactical groups of enemy ships. A military expert says ADA-type corvettes have modern means of communication and a combat information and control system: - This can provide an advantage over the enemy not only in the promptness of decision-making and actions, but also in the so-called intellectual advantage. What tasks will the -Ivan Mazepa- and -Ivan Vyhovskyi- corvettes be able to perform in specific conditions, for example, in the Black and Mediterranean seas or other specified areas? First of all, Stepan Yakymyak recalled the views on the creation and tasks of corvettes for the national navy that existed until now. — As is known, the leadership and specialists of the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine throughout the entire recent history of the state provided relevant justifications and strove to have similar ships in the fleet. After all, in 2010, the national corvette of project 58250 was laid down in Mykolaiv. According to the Strategy of the Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine 2035 (announced in 2018. — Ed.), it was planned to adopt a series of such corvettes during the second stage of fleet development, 2025-2030 . We will remind you that the Strategy was developed together with experts from NATO member countries, including the United States. Actually, corvettes can rely on two blocks of tasks: — If we analyze the hypothetical situation regarding the involvement of corvettes in actions in the conditions of the long war of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, then it should be taken into account that the newly built ships are in the Sea of ​​Marmara. They cannot be included during the war in the Ukrainian group of forces operating in the Black Sea. Because according to the Montreux Convention, the Bosphorus Strait is closed to the passage of warships. It should not be forgotten, says a military expert, that Russian forces still have significant capabilities in the fight against surface ships. The enemy has enough power to strike surface targets. the rascals still have air superiority for now. The ratio in anti-ship weapons, i.e. symmetrical means of confrontation at sea and naval combat, is still not in favor of Ukraine. It is because of this that the Ukrainian Navy chose and implemented the concept of asymmetric actions in the war at sea: — Therefore, it would be logical to state that in the current conditions, the hypothetical use of new corvettes in the Black Sea against the enemy is not a rational option. Many domestic and foreign experts claim that in modern conditions, ADA-type corvettes can perform so-called coalition tasks. It is about involvement in joint tasks (exercises) with NATO forces outside the Black Sea: — We will not only demonstrate loyalty to common values, but also really strengthen the Alliance's groupings at sea. And this is in the conditions when significant resources of our partners are spent to ensure combat operations and the success of the Defense Forces of Ukraine in the protracted war with the enemy. Stepan Yakymyak emphasizes that the best option for using the newly built corvettes and minesweepers, which are currently based in Great Britain, is to practice joint tasks and exercises with NATO partners outside the Black Sea. — Of course, it should be taken into account that in the event of the deployment of corvettes in the Mediterranean Sea and other water areas, one can expect provocations and, perhaps, even sabotage actions on the part of the Russian Federation. At the same time, if corvettes perform joint tasks as part of NATO forces, the risk of such actions by the enemy will be much lower. The military expert emphasizes: in the future, all possible tasks of corvettes will necessarily take into account probable scenarios of actions and task performance with various units of the Defense Forces of Ukraine and will depend on the enemy's capabilities at sea. It is extremely important to emphasize that the corvettes must learn to act together in the general system of combat use of the Defense Forces of Ukraine. — In particular, with units equipped with coastal missile systems, fighter-bomber aircraft, primarily F-16, naval unmanned and unmanned aircraft systems, reconnaissance assets, in particular, NATO forces in the Black Sea. Therefore, in the opinion of Stepan Yakymyak, the likely prospective tasks of ADA-type corvettes are: If we talk about the Black Sea, then in the future, in the event of a crisis situation and a military conflict, corvettes can be effectively involved in the following tasks: — I emphasize, the effectiveness of actions corvettes in the Black Sea will largely depend on solving the problems of ensuring the stealth and combat stability of these ships. This is the key point. This is necessary, first of all, during the process of deploying corvettes to combat areas and during active hostilities. Further, of course, in the case of returning to the base points and the presence of ships there for recovery and replenishment of supplies.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/24/korvety-typu-ada-chogo-varto-boyatys-vorogu-pro-potuzhnu-systemu-ppo-strategiyu-vms-zsu-ta-spilni-navchannya-z-nato/	2024-09-23T20:52:55-07:00
Under Stepov, he held his position for 5 hours by himself: the story of junior sergeant Volodymyr	What's it like to hold a position all by yourself? And how do their commanders drive the Russians to attack? Junior sergeant Volodymyr told the ArmyInform correspondent about this. — In March of this year, we advanced to Pervomaiske, in the Donetsk region. We were in a Hummer. As soon as we entered the settlement, the enemy began to -cover- us. So the race was very difficult. We were driven to the evacuation point, and from there we had to walk about 200 meters to reach the school where our position was. These 200 meters became -the road of life- for us... They worked on us with both mines and dumps while we approached the school. And we already had one wounded person. We had to replace guys from the 59th brigade at the position. When we entered the school premises, our wounded man was stabilized. Of course, constant shelling of us began. And later, the enemy began to storm. And these assaults were constant, almost non-stop. In the end, the enemy did enter the school premises. The second and third floors of the building were almost empty at that time. Well, we started knocking out the enemy... That day we killed four in the school, another one on the way out. The sixth, most likely, was injured, but managed to escape. Although later we heard from intercepts that he was no longer communicating... We took four walkie-talkies from them. And, of course, they heard what they were transmitting. From the interceptions, it was understood when they would go on assaults. By the way, the enemy is being forced to advance, because none of them wants to go forward. And when they tried to enter the school again, they did not know that we had already put theirs in front of it. And they ask something on the radio, think that they are communicating with their own. We say -Zachody!- in Russian. Well, they also filled up those at the entrance. They all hit me with some kind of cologne... It was there in Pervomaiskyi, by the way, that I was wounded...

Later, after mortar shelling, one more of our soldiers died. And there were three of us left. Then two of them left under certain circumstances, and I was left to hold the position away by myself. It lasted for five hours. I was told that my sector was for 12 hours, that I was being covered from left to right, I had to hold the landing... Later, the command gave two people to help. They stayed until dusk, and then a group was sent to support me. Until morning we held our position under these enemy assaults, and then we were already replaced.

Language inspectors in Frankivsk: propaganda twisted the words of the mayor and caused a scandal	After checking the information at the Main Directorate of the National Police in the Ivano-Frankivsk Region, the Countering Disinformation Center notified, that not a single language-related crime has been committed in the city recently. Similar fakes are actively spread by Russian propaganda in order to create the illusion of a split in Ukrainian society around the language issue. It should be noted that the enemy managed to play the -language card- only in 2014. At that time, it was the disinformation campaign surrounding the status of the Russian language in Ukraine that helped the occupiers seize Crimea and certain areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. On September 9, Ivano-Frankivsk Mayor Ruslan Martsinkiv discussed the public initiative -Language Inspectors-, which was immediately used by propaganda. The enemy spread a fake that communicating in Russian in Ukrainian cities would be severely punished. After that, the author of the initiative had to go into the public space and justify himself: not language inspectors, but public activists; they will not punish, but will promote the state one. Even Taras Kremin, the authorized person for the protection of the state language, had to intervene in the situation. -I want to warn against one big danger - there have never been and never will be any language inspectors in Ukraine. This is a pure invention of Russian propaganda, which since 2019, when the language law came into force, began to actively use the so-called semantic slurs, which they used to call our institution, calling me -Sprechen-Führer-, and representatives of the commissioner - language inspectors, punishers. This is one of the components of the information field from the point of view of Russian propaganda,- said Taras Kremin.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/24/movni-inspektory-u-frankivsku-rospropaganda-perekrutyla-slova-mera-i-sprychynyla-skandal/	2024-09-23T20:35:38-07:00
Immersion in archeology: about an unusual way of military rehabilitation	In the 12th century, monks started the first hospital center for soldiers here, which later turned into a separate monastery. And today, the -Spiritual restoration through culture- program is being implemented in the Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra National Reserve, the purpose of which is to provide moral and spiritual support to the defenders of Ukraine after the most difficult trials of the war through immersion in the cultural and historical space of the Lavra. We are talking about the program with the general director of the National Reserve -Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra- Maksym Ostapenko. — Maksym Anatoliyovych, for the military, especially after the injuries, it is very it is probably useful to immerse yourself in the cultural and historical space of the national shrine through communication, excursions, as well as prayer... — This program of spiritual restoration began its work in 2023. From the feedback we get from the military, — she really works. She has a very positive effect on the military because, actually, a person who is currently in the army, he should receive both psychological and moral support to a large extent. A military man must understand that he is not only saving his own family, his own house, fighting for his immediate environment, but also defending the independence of this state. When he gets to the Lavra, he understands that in this way he helps to protect Ukrainian shrines, which are no less important for the state than everything else that we have. After all, national shrines — are those things that cement any nation. And, unfortunately, Russia tried to take these shrines away from us during centuries For centuries, she tried to influence Ukrainians, our nation, our people through shrines. And now, the military, who participate in studying and diving into these shrines, also feel like defenders of the national heritage. And this is very important, because in this way we combine here the cultural component, the spiritual component and at the same time the psychological rehabilitation of those soldiers who come here. In addition, Lavra herself — span> it is a place of prayer, a place of deep identity and culture that definitely inspires people. Many of those who attend this program are coming to the Lavra, or not for the first time. Few people even know how powerful and outstanding this place is, which has shaped our identity for a thousand years. And when people join these sanctuaries, this incredible territory, they feel a very serious moral upliftment. provision (complex of measures that are carried out with the aim of forming, maintaining and restoring the moral and psychological state of the personnel of the troops (forces) necessary for the successful performance of assigned tasks. — Author). It seems to me that visiting such objects — is exactly what is called moral and psychological support in its purest form. — You recently took part in a workshop in the UK called 'Using Archeology for Restoration'. The main topic of the meeting was the development of methods of psychological rehabilitation and support for combatants and veterans. Tell us more about this meeting. — In June of this year, together with an employee of the reserve, head of the research department of archeology Serhiy Taranenko, we attended a seminar at the invitation of Bournemouth University in Great Britain. devoted to the rehabilitation of military personnel through participation in archaeological excavations. The seminar was attended by six groups engaged in such rehabilitation. One of them was our team. We talked about the experience that has already been implemented during the year in the Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra, and specialists from Bournemouth University, the Ministry of Defense of Great Britain and several other British universities talked about the experience of involving veterans, military personnel in rehabilitation through immersion in archeology. In Great Britain, the Nightingale program has been operating for about 10 years under the leadership of the leading archaeologist of the Ministry of Defense, Richard Osgood. This is a very interesting program that involves the involvement of veterans and improving their psychological state after participating in hostilities through involvement in archeology. We plan to highlight and expand the archaeological component of our rehabilitation program. The British experience showed us how important it is to organize work with the military at the excavations, and we are ready to apply this knowledge in Ukraine. culture- regarding many points, we managed to achieve what they did for 10 years. After all, they are only now coming to understand that, in addition to archeology, it is necessary to look for the possibility of adding a historical and spiritual component. And the basis of our program is precisely the historical and spiritual component, and archeology was one of the components. We have slightly different starting positions, but the idea of ​​spiritual restoration through involvement in the study of one's own history — this has already become a practice that exists in Great Britain, and perhaps in other countries. It is very nice that Lavra was also able to share her experience, and I think that our experience will be used. Colleagues from universities who study precisely the psychological aspects of such programs were very interested in getting acquainted with our information. I am sure that these contacts and this program will continue to develop. We dream that the program developed in the National Reserve -Kyiv-Pecherska Lavra- together with the Antony and Fedosiy Pechersky Charitable Fund and the Ukrainian Lavra Charitable Fund with the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, so that this program will be scaled to other cultural locations of Ukraine . There are already offers from other museums and nature reserves to join similar events with the participation of the military.

They play the role of bait: the Armed Forces explained the extremely high level of enemy losses in t...	Colonel Vitaly Sarantsev, the spokesman of Kharkiv OTU, told about this on the air of the national telethon -Yedini Novyni- . Since the beginning of the offensive in Kharkiv Oblast in May, the occupiers have lost more than 16,000 soldiers. — This is actually the population of a small district center anywhere — whether in Russia or Ukraine. Of course, this is a lot, but the enemy does not count with his losses, he is not interested in the losses of his personnel. He prefers to keep equipment or some sort of weapon rather than his own personnel, the spokesman said. This attitude of the Russian command towards its own soldiers allows them to be used as bait or bait to identify the firing positions of units of the Defense Forces. - Very often people are sent by some incomprehensible storms. People are very often sent on assaults or offensives, using them simply as bait for the Defense Forces to start working on them. In this way, they try to find out our fire system and then inflict fire damage, he explained. At the same time, those Russian soldiers who play the role of bait have practically no chance of survival. - It should be noted that Russia has never won a war with military art or any experience. This is all the blood, flesh and life of our compatriots, Vitaliy Sarantsev noted. He thanked all defenders of Ukraine - representatives of all units and components of the Defense Forces - for effective combat work. The achieved result in the destruction of the enemy was achieved precisely by their joint concerted and coordinated efforts. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that since the beginning of the second offensive attempt in Kharkiv region, the enemy has lost more than 16 thousand soldiers - this is population of the district center.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/23/vidigrayut-rol-prymanky-v-zsu-poyasnyly-nadvysokyj-riven-vtrat-voroga-na-harkivshhyni/	2024-09-23T11:11:28-07:00

The equipment of the occupiers is Soviet junk, but the enemy makes it a combat unit	However, due to the amount, it can bring results, so it is necessary to deprive Russia of the ability not only to produce, but also to remove from storage and put into service any military equipment and weapons. This was emphasized by the commander of the 92nd separate assault air defense battalion -Achilles- on the broadcast of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon. Captain Yury Fedorenko of the brigade named after Ivan Sirk, the basket captain. — The adversary retains the ability to finance its military-industrial complex enterprises, which deconserve, repair and refit Soviet junk that is, one way or another, a combat unit capable of performing combat missions, he explained. In view of this, the enemy retains the ability to saturate the front line with a sufficient amount of armored vehicles. — Today, the enemy copes with this task. Therefore, the technique is used by him from the point of view of military expediency - where it is necessary to have a quick result, the enemy tries to use this technique more intensively. Where he was shot and he has no reserves, of course he will use other means, the military said. Therefore, the main task is to beat the occupier on its territory, destroying the enterprises of the military-industrial complex.

About this informs September 23 SBU. -This time, the crimes of Major General of the Russian Police Yury Zavyalov, the deputy head of the main department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia in the Krasnoyarsk Territory, and his subordinates have been documented,- the report says. According to the case materials, at the request of Gauleiter Saldo in July 2022, the Kremlin -sent- them to Kherson, which was captured at that time, to carry out so-called -cleansing- among local residents. -For the organization of repressive measures, Zavyalov was appointed the head of the occupying -Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation in the Kherson region.- Two more Russian police colonels, Gennady Beryozin and Yuriy Zakavryashin, received the -deputy positions- of the head of the pseudo-institution, the SBU said. These three figures organized squads of Russians who abducted residents of the regional center and escorted them to the occupation torture chamber, which was run by Andrii Spivak, a 38-year-old senior lieutenant of the Russian police. -According to Zavyalov's orders, his subordinate subjected prisoners to cruel torture, including beatings and starving them,- the SBU said.

Coalitions of capabilities: 34 countries effectively support the defense of Ukraine	The Minister of Defense of Ukraine Rustem Umyerov told about this. -Within the Ramstein platform, we have created eight coalitions of capabilities, which include 34 member countries of the Contact Group on Defense of Ukraine. They signed Letters of Intent on cooperation. In addition, Memoranda have already been signed in certain coalitions, which allow centralized financing and procurement,- Rustem Umyerov said. According to the head of the Ministry of Defense, this applies to demining coalitions, drones, and IT. The Regulation on the Coalition of Maritime Capabilities was also signed. Such mechanisms enable countries to pool their resources for joint support of Ukraine's defense capabilities. Within the framework of the Air Defense Coalition, Ukrainian partners provided five new strategic air defense systems this year. Germany's Immediate Action of Air Defense initiative has already provided Ukraine with contributions worth over one billion euros. Also, in the Artillery Coalition, Ukraine received the first contributions to the production of Ukrainian artillery systems. As part of the Czech initiative, the supply of ammunition has already begun. -In addition, in the demining Coalition, we expect to purchase €22 million in the near future, and we have already received additional support from Sweden, and in the Drone Coalition, €50 million has been raised for the joint purchase of equipment, which will accelerate our fight on the front lines,- Rustem noted.

These funds will be directed in three main directions: ammunition, air defense equipment, and support for Ukrainian manufacturers. In particular, €400 million has been allocated for the production of weapons and military goods by Ukrainian companies. Rustem Umyerov noted that due to the sensitivity of the topic, many aspects of international activity remain non-public. -One notable result is the release of more than 3,300 people from Russian captivity since the start of the full-scale invasion. I am grateful to the Coordinating Staff for the Treatment of Prisoners of War and all the forces — the Office of the President, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the SBU, the Ombudsman — and the leaders of all countries who contributed to this achievement,- he said.

- Defense - breaks records: every second ammunition on the front is Ukrainian	The Minister of Defense of Ukraine Rustem Umyerov told about this. -We financed Ukrainian production for more than $4 billion. In Kharkiv Oblast, we repelled the Russian army with Ukrainian weapons. It was Ukrainian ammunition that provided the Armed Forces when we did not receive support from the United States,- the head of the defense department said. Today, every second piece of ammunition on the front is Ukrainian-made. If in 2023 the Ukrainian share of ammunition was 18%, then in 2024 it increased to 41%. -During this year, we have increased our long-range capabilities several times. In 2024, the Ministry of Defense alone contracted drones for over UAH 21 billion and ammunition for them for another UAH 9 billion. And together with the State Security Service, we purchased more than a million drones for our army. Thanks to the team of the Ministry of Statistics,- continued Rustem Umyerov. According to the head of the Ministry of Defense, Ukrainian drones showed what a real -Moscow never sleeps- is. Today, Ukrainian drones fly more than 1,000 km, reach Murmansk and Nadvolzhye, destroy Russian oil refineries and airfields. Ukraine was the first in the world to introduce the -swarm of drones- technology. In the last year alone, we managed to destroy or damage more than 200 targets on enemy territory. Among them are control points, airfields, ships, air defense systems and locations of Russian military personnel. Rustem Umyerov noted that this forced the enemy to relocate their planes to airfields 250 km from the border. -In the Black Sea, we forced Russian ships to flee from military bases in Crimea to the coast of the Krasnodar Territory. Without a full-fledged fleet, over the past year we have destroyed 10 Russian surface ships/boats and one submarine. Thanks to the DELTA combat system of the Ministry of Defense, we destroyed more than $15 billion worth of Russian equipment,- concluded the Minister of Defense. As reported by ArmyInform, the Ministry of Defense plans to launch a new Veteran+ application.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/23/oboronka-bye-rekordy-kozhen-drugyj-boyeprypas-na-fronti-ukrayinskyj/	2024-09-23T06:44:56-07:00

The Ministry of Defense plans to launch a new Veteran+ application	The Minister of Defense of Ukraine Rustem Umyerov told about this. Reserve+ — almost 3.5 million Ukrainians received an electronic military registration document in a minute. -We have reduced the physical load on the TCC several times. They gave an online alternative to the antiquated Soviet processes,- added the head of the defense department. Army+ — 230,000 military personnel already use electronic services, from submitting all kinds of reports to digitizing health data. About 20% of them are officers, 15% are non-commissioned officers.

The enemy strikes on its own territory: the structure of shelling in the North has changed	Vadim Mysnyk, the spokesman of the OTU -Siversk-, said this on the broadcast of the -Yedini Novosti- marathon. — Over the past 24 hours, we have recorded 24 KABs in Sumy region. The Kursk operation is being carried out and the shelling structure is also changing. For several days now, we have been observing that the enemy has been shelling and using such weapons more precisely in that area of ​​the Kursk region, which is controlled by our Defense Forces. If there are 24 KABs in Sumy Oblast, then they used 27 KABs in one district of Kursk Oblast, he said. For shelling, the occupiers mainly use long-range weapons, which can be used to strike from deep within their territory - guided aerial bombs and shock drones. Instead, the number of artillery and mortar fire decreased. At the same time, the Russians are also forced to strike first of all on their own territory. If the Russian military shelled Chernihiv, Sumy and part of the Kharkiv region 74 times in the past day, the enemy fired 91 times in just one district of the Kursk region. The tactics of enemy shelling on the territory of Russia are no different from enemy strikes on Ukraine — populated areas are completely wiped out. This scares and infuriates local residents, who see with their own eyes that there are no Ukrainian soldiers nearby, but their village is still being shelled. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in Kurshchyna, the Russians have resorted to the -scorched earth- tactic and are erasing their own villages from the face of the earth. Total from the beginning During the Kursk operation, the Russian military dropped more than 1,300 anti-aircraft missiles on populated areas controlled by the Defense Forces of Ukraine. This made part of the residents of the Kursk region to -see through-, but others still do not believe the reports that the Russian military committed the same crimes on the territory of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/23/vorog-bye-po-vlasnij-terytoriyi-struktura-obstriliv-na-pivnochi-zminylas/	2024-09-23T05:53:42-07:00

So, in Cherkasy: -on hot pursuit- they detained an 18-year-old local college student who, on the order of the Russian Federation, set fire to a military SUV with the help of a highly flammable mixture. It is noted that, expecting to receive a monetary -reward-, the young man recorded the fire on his phone camera and sent a video report to the Russian curator. However, he never received the promised -easy money- from the occupiers.

In order to destabilize the socio-political situation in the western region, the enemy promised Paliam money in exchange for a series of arson attacks. However, they did not wait for the promised money, as the law enforcement officers arrested both criminals -on hot pursuit- after the first arson. Mobile phones were seized from them, which they used in subversive activities for the benefit of the Russian Federation. Both defendants were notified of suspicion under Part 2 of Article 28, Part 1 of Art. 114-1 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (obstructing the lawful activities of the Armed Forces and other military formations in a special period, committed by a group of persons following a prior conspiracy).

The call was wrong: the telephone terrorist who scared the SBU went behind bars	reports this by the Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office. The court found a 35-year-old man guilty of knowingly false information about the preparation of an explosion at critical infrastructure facilities (Part 2 of Article 259 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine) for maintaining a public prosecution by the prosecutors of the Bogodukhiv District Prosecutor's Office of the Kharkiv Region.

During the check, the information provided by the attacker was not confirmed. -During the trial, the accused admitted his guilt, but at the same time stated that he does not feel any remorse for what he has done, because with such actions he expresses his protest against state policy and considers the actions of the leadership of Ukraine to be illegal,- the prosecutor's office noted.

The calm is deceptive, the situation is volatile: the enemy continues fighting in the Kharkiv direct...	Colonel Vitaly Sarantsev, the spokesman of the Kharkiv OTU, drew attention to this on the air of the Suspilne Novosti telethon. — There are locations where the Russians have gone on the defensive. In particular, this is the direction Hlyboke — Lypci. There, the enemy is currently entrenched in those positions that he still managed to hold. He is reshaping assault groups, building up his communications system and carrying out logistical support measures — all signs that he is preparing to resume assault operations in order to regain the ground he previously lost, he said. The spokesman emphasized that the situation is very changeable and significantly different in different areas - in some places the enemy is defending and building up forces to go on the offensive, in others it has not stopped offensive actions. — The enemy carries out assault actions in Vovchansk. He is also trying to advance in the area of ​​the Tyche settlement, in other directions, the military officer emphasized. The spokesman noted that the entire line of the Russian-Ukrainian border is a combat line, so the enemy can activate at any time in any area.

Housing for the military, construction audits, cost optimization — the defense infrastructure reform...	About this informs September 23 Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. -According to the formed vision of the target structure of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine and the results of the functional audit, the infrastructural direction should undergo a transformation,- noted Stanislav Heyder. The Deputy Minister reminded that his team started taking care of this block a month and a half ago. -We consider infrastructure as one of the key components of our capabilities that must be developed. We have a clear understanding of what to do in the next six months and how to transform this sphere,- said Stanislav Heyder. According to him, work is already underway on the key points of the transformation processes in the defense infrastructure. Among them: In the conditions of war, in particular, constant missile strikes by the enemy, the development of the necessary military infrastructure for the placement of personnel and equipment is of critical importance. Based on the approaches of NATO member countries, a decision was made to form a military infrastructure development function on the basis of one of the divisions of the Ministry of Defense. This feature will be developed over the next two months. Our task is to define clear priorities and directions for wartime defense infrastructure funding before the start of the new budget year. By the end of the year, a number of organizational changes will be introduced that will remove duplication of functions in the direction of infrastructure. The administrative structures that currently deal with issues of construction organization in the Ministry of Defense will be significantly reduced without loss of potential. From January 1, 2025, purchases of secondary housing, modular structures, equipment and certain other items of the Ministry of Defense for a total amount of several billion hryvnias will be transferred to the State rear operator. The result of these actions will be the release of a significant financial resource. For the first time, the Ministry of Defense will conduct a comprehensive audit of military facilities under construction. Over the next 4-6 months, the IOU will carry out an inventory of all current and frozen projects in order to form a holistic vision of how to effectively spend funds in this direction in 2025 and subsequent years. A component of this vision will be a strategic plan for the management of objects under construction. The Ministry of Defense will change the approach to providing military housing. Instead of multi-year construction projects, clear and transparent financial mechanisms and financial support for housing will be introduced. The concept of such changes has already been formed, its discussion with financial institutions and non-governmental organizations has begun. In order to create a transparent electronic record of lands and buildings of the Ministry of Defense, work is underway on the appropriate IT system. A prototype of such a solution has already been created, and the first results of the implementation of electronic accounting are expected by the end of the year. Work has begun on the creation of a civil real estate agency that will manage land and other real estate on a commercial basis. Examples of NATO member countries are taken as the basis for the work of such an agency. In order to save costs for the operation of the infrastructure, the implementation of individual energy efficiency pilot projects has already begun. However, what is needed is a comprehensive policy and implementation of joint energy efficiency projects. Work is underway to launch a partnership project in this direction. During the war, the priority in cooperation with partners was and will be armaments. At the same time, the subject of discussion is also joint projects in the areas of construction, restoration (reconstruction) of defense infrastructure facilities, such as health care facilities, military educational institutions, etc. Bilateral security agreements concluded with partner countries can also become the basis of such joint projects. The implementation of joint projects will strengthen the capabilities of the Defense Forces both for military needs and for development needs.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/23/zhytlo-dlya-vijskovyh-audyt-budivnycztva-optymizacziya-vytrat-plan-reformy-oboronnoyi-infrastruktury/	2024-09-23T03:37:05-07:00

They can fall anywhere: mines of a prohibited type are used by the enemy in the Kharkiv region	Colonel Vitaliy Sarantsev, the spokesman of Kharkiv OTU, told about this on the air of the -Suspilne Novosti- telethon . - This is a dangerous type of weapon. -We have not yet fully investigated how large-scale their production process is - it can be either industrial or some local batch made with the help of Russian enthusiasts or volunteers,- he said. However, even if we are talking about artisanal production and a quantitatively insignificant batch of such mines, they do not become less dangerous. The power of their not too large explosive charge is enough to maim a person or even take his life if timely medical assistance is not provided. — This ammunition can be dangerous for both the military and civilians because the enemy scatters it in any area. He can drop it in those locations that, in his opinion, can be used by our military as routes for movement, the spokesman emphasized. He said that the occupiers install such mines remotely, dropping them on populated areas. - They can fall anywhere - in the yard, on the roof of the building, somewhere in the garden or in any place, - emphasized the military man. It is difficult to detect such ammunition due to its small size, camouflage color and a small number of metal parts. - It has a maximum of plastic parts, it is very difficult to detect it with a metal detector. If he, wrapped in green tape, falls into the grass, it is very difficult to see him, - explained the spokesman of OTU -Kharkiv-. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in Kharkiv region, the occupiers are installing new mines, which are an analogue of the banned PFM-1 -Petal- and explained why do the Russians mine the area with drones.

This weapon is not accurate. Therefore, cases of -friendly fire- occur quite often, when the enemy inflicts fire damage on his units, he said. Blocked enemy soldiers are in dire straits, but they still have the ability to hold the defense. - This is a large industrial enterprise. A lot of buildings have been preserved there in some places, a lot of underground communications have remained, in which it is difficult on the defensive side, but it is possible to organize a high-quality defense, he explained. This situation has been going on for several months. The occupiers are trying to deliver the blocked unit with the help of UAVs. — They had their own system in place for deliveries. Therefore, of course, we cannot put up with this for a long time. You can't keep such a hostile person in your rear.

Fire on one's own is the norm for the enemy: what is the reason?	The reason was explained on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- by the commander of the -Achilles- 92nd separate assault battalion. Captain Yury Fedorenko of the brigade named after Ivan Sirk, the basket captain. — The enemy, in the amount of firearms he uses and with the level of training of the personnel, quite often has practice on his own. In particular, due to the use of aviation. This is rather the norm for the enemy, he said. This is primarily about the low level of training of individual Russian servicemen who do not have sufficient knowledge, skills and abilities for combat work with appropriate weapons and military equipment. This is one of the factors that helps the Defense Forces to restrain the offensive attempts of the invaders in the Kharkiv direction. — At the moment, we must say with certainty that, despite all attempts, the enemy is not making any progress in the direction of Vovchansk. Because the defense forces detect in a timely manner, inflict fire damage and fully control the enemy, the officer said. Likewise, the Russian occupiers are not making any progress in the area of ​​the border village of Hlyboke, north of Kharkiv. — The defense forces manage to keep the initiative fully in their hands. To support the initiative, it is necessary to work to the point of exhaustion, but the main thing is to achieve an important result - preventing the enemy from passing through our battle formations, explained the commander of the Ukrainian drones. The situation in the Kupyan sector is more complicated, where the Russians are conducting active offensive actions with the use of a significant number of personnel, weapons and military equipment. — The adversary uses more than the overwhelming number of forces and means in order to reach the left bank of the Oskil River, then gain a foothold by occupying a bridgehead and develop further success, Yuriy Fedorenko reported. However, thanks to the joint coordinated work of the units of the Defense Forces operating on this stretch, the occupiers did not have any significant successes. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in Vovchansk the Russians are shelling their own units in the area of ​​the Aggregate Plant from the TOS-1A -Solntsepok- heavy flamethrower salvo system.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/23/vogon-po-svoyih-dlya-voroga-norma-u-chomu-prychyna/	2024-09-23T00:36:15-07:00
In the Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra, military personnel undergo -Spiritual restoration through culture-	Its first component — a 10-day rehabilitation for military personnel includes living on the territory of the Reserve, participation in archaeological excavations, master classes in icon painting and pottery, visiting museum exhibits, exploring the territories of the Upper and Lower Lavra and its caves accompanied by specialists of the Reserve, participating in services, communicate with spiritual mentors and monks of the monastery. The second component, called -Day in the Lavra for a military man-, involves immersion in the atmosphere and life of the Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra for one day for groups of military personnel up to 20 people, accompanied by a tour guide. They explore the territory, listen to tours, join in the activities of the Reserve, visit local shrines and pray with spiritual guides. The general director of the National Reserve -Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra- Maksym Ostapenko told the correspondent of ArmiyaInform that -Spiritual restoration through culture- has a very positive effect on military personnel who undergo this program. — We combine here the cultural component, the spiritual component and, at the same time, the moral rehabilitation of those soldiers who come here. The Lavra itself is a place of prayer, a place of deep identity and culture that definitely inspires people. It is a powerful, outstanding place that has shaped our identity for a thousand years. And when people join these shrines, this incredible territory, they experience a very serious moral upliftment. After all, a person here feels his belonging to a large social organism called the people of Ukraine, the state of Ukraine, Maksym Ostapenko emphasized. Over a year, more than 900 military personnel and their family members have been through the program as part of the -Day at the Lavra for Military- component, as well as 26 chaplains and 102 military personnel in the ten-day recovery program. Currently, the program is planned, various units, all types and branches of the military, military chaplaincy services are involved. Fighters are encouraged, selected, and formed into groups. Lieutenant Colonel Volodymyr Samoilyk, chief specialist of the Department of Organization of Military Chaplains' Activities of the Military Chaplaincy Service of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, told about this. — The project is extremely important because the guys are in different conditions when they perform their combat duties. And this time, although it is small, is extremely important. It is important to stay in a holy place, a prayerful place, where soldiers can be not only alone, but also with a military chaplain who is in constant communication with them, explains, sometimes helps, sometimes instructs. And this is a good project, which we hope will work more powerfully in the future, Volodymyr Samoilyk said. — I expect, first of all, that the servicemen will rest spiritually and physically after coming here. And they will enjoy this rest, because now is a very active phase of hostilities. And people get very tired. Most of the people here are after injuries, serious injuries. Perhaps someone has not yet been to the Lavra. And I believe 100% that they will find such a corner for themselves here, which will be something good for them, will be remembered and will help them in the future to carry out military service in the defense of our Ukraine, - shared his vision of the group leader, chaplain service lieutenant , military chaplain of the 23rd Engineering and Position Regiment of the Support Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Taras Gordiychuk. For the first time, he organized the brothers to visit the Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra. — Last week we had a group of servicemen of the National Guard of Ukraine who returned from captivity together with their families. This is a new category for us because we have mainly worked with military personnel either active duty or rehabilitating from hospitals. And we have not yet encountered the captives, but we are sure that this group of people is perhaps the most in need of support now in such facilities as the Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra, because their psychological and moral condition requires deeper work. After all, these people went through very difficult tests, very heavy stress, and I am sure that a place like the Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra can help many of them, - summed up Maksym Ostapenko. Today there is a constant demand for spiritual support and emotional support for military personnel, their families, families of the dead, prisoners of war, as well as military personnel undergoing rehabilitation and treatment in military hospitals. Next year, the renovation of building No. 55 of the National Reserve -Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra- is expected to be completed for the long-term stay of the military on the principle of pilgrim life. Rest rooms, rooms for master classes, and a library are planned to be installed in the center for the spiritual recovery of military personnel. Such practices, taking into account the possibility of scaling innovative models of spiritual restoration through culture and the support of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, will be gradually implemented on the bases of other historical and cultural reserves of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/23/u-kyyevo-pecherskij-lavri-vijskovosluzhbovczi-prohodyat-duhovne-vidnovlennya-kulturoyu/	2024-09-23T00:23:31-07:00

Day of mourning in Kryvyi Rih: three lives cut short by a Russian missile attack	reported this by the head of Dnipropetrovsk OVA Serhiy Lysak. No less tragic news came from Nikopol, where as a result of a kamikaze drone strike, 12-year-old girl died. In total, two civilians were killed in Nikopol. -Ukraine remembers every victim of Russian terror. My sincere condolences to the families of the victims,- ​​Serhii Lysak emphasized.

80,000 dead and the freezing of war: fakes are not only Russian	So, on Friday, during a meeting with journalists, Volodymyr Zelenskyi had to deny the information of The Wall Street Journal, which wrote that the alleged losses of Ukraine in the war amounted to 80,000 soldiers. -80 thousand? This is a lie. The real figure is much lower than what was published. Significantly,- said the President of Ukraine. Let me remind you that on September 17, the American newspaper The Wall Street Journal wrote that the number of killed and wounded Ukrainians and Russians participating in the war allegedly reached 1 million people. In particular, as the journalists claimed, 80,000 Ukrainian servicemen and 200,000 Russians were allegedly killed during the military operations. It is worth noting that the New York edition has recently come under severe criticism, in particular, due to the -global purge of editorial departments and the creation of a politically correct workforce.- Unfortunately, this is not the first time that the Western mass media have played along with the Russians, publishing in their materials information about Ukraine that does not correspond to reality. Just recently, the German tabloid newspaper Bild wrote about Ukraine's alleged readiness to -freeze- the war, referring to the Victory plan of the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyi. Journalists assured that the plan allegedly prescribes Ukraine's -readiness- to accept a -local ceasefire on certain areas of the front-. Zelensky was forced to react, assuring that Bild had spread a fake. No one will give the Russians Minsk-3 or any other format of freezing the war. Ukraine is categorically against this and the authorities at all levels are talking about it. It is important for us that the United States of America, which is able to ensure its implementation, supports the Victory Plan of Ukraine, and not capitulations or freezes. That is why it is always worth trusting official, and not anonymous sources, which are often used by the creators of information -dumps-.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/23/80-tysyach-zagyblyh-i-zamorozka-vijny-fejky-buvayut-ne-lyshe-rosijski/	2024-09-22T22:06:05-07:00

There are problems in Russia: why did Putin increase the size of the army	— First of all, let's analyze what was in the Russian Federation in terms of the number of all personnel before the large-scale invasion. The entire personnel, together with civilian personnel, was estimated at around one million 100 thousand. No more, plus or minus. In two and a half years, the Russian Federation lost more than 630,000 personnel. These are fantastic figures since the end of World War II. There was nothing like that. Let me remind you that the Soviet Union lost 15,500 during the entire war in Afghanistan, over 10 years. Russia is experiencing a serious problem of lack of manpower in the war. She has to compensate for the significant losses. Therefore, the Russians have no particular choice. Plus there is a so-called anticipatory extermination. What is it? The average rate of destruction of the enemy for us per month, especially during this summer, is 34-36 thousand. As of this minute, according to the full-time mobilization that the occupiers are carrying out, they are putting 32-34 thousand people in line. This backlash of 2,000 raschits seems to be small, but in fact it is very decisive. Therefore, they have no other choice but to increase the number of troops. — Is it a lot, plus 180,000 personnel. To some extent yes. The initial contingent of the Russian Federation that invaded Ukraine was about 180-200 thousand. But if you proceed from the opposite and understand that now the entire line of combat confrontation has approximately 600 thousand Russian invaders, then in order to really break something (our line of defense - ed), you need to double or triple this figure. The expert believes that with that type of mobilization in the Russian Federation, this is impossible. Do they have a mobilization resource from which to draw -cannon fodder-? Yes it is. It is up to three million men. But in order to actually change something on the battle line, the Russians need to go beyond the figures of 40-50 thousand per month. Will they go for it? I think not. Why? Because it will be a real social tension. And Putin is afraid of rebellion from below like fire. True, an uprising from below is impossible in itself, but it can be provoked by just one of the -Kremlin towers-. Everything the enemy does is logical. But I would not say that there is something mega unexpected from their side. And I am of the position that increasing the number of the army by 180 thousand to change the course in this phase of the war will not be decisive. No one in Russia has ever thought about training, emphasizes Petro Chernyk. For the Kremlin, Russian conscripts have always been just -cannon fodder.- — We understand that the enemy acts according to a very simple logic. You can learn to use a Kalashnikov assault rifle in 5 days. And they never cared about more serious tactical training there and never will. Therefore, it is not necessary to ask the question that, allegedly, the staff is poorly trained and this should somehow make our life easier. But remember that they just take a huge amount. I had personal experience in one of the tactical areas of the battlefield already this year. In 12 hours of assessing losses on our side and their side, we lost one killed, and they lost 24. This is so that we understand how much the Rashists do not respect personnel. If we take the two main categories of providing units and units of the Russian Armed Forces - artillery and armored vehicles - then the enemy does not have a single unit that is 80% manned, emphasizes Petro Chernyk. — If the enemy has security within 60%, it is already very good for him. But I emphasize once again, the Russians now mainly, in addition to massive artillery strikes, which have also significantly decreased in contrast to the summer of 2022, are betting on large infantry ramparts. Let me remind you that more than 100 million Kalashnikov assault rifles were produced. Of course, there are no 100 million in Russian warehouses, but there are millions. 37 million Mosin rifles were produced, 9 million RPG-7, the most massive hand-held anti-tank grenade launcher, 1.5 million RPG-18 Mukha, a reactive anti-tank grenade, 15 million Simonov self-loading carbines, and there are still up to 8 in Russian warehouses millions of Shpagin submachine guns and Sudayev submachine guns since World War II. And if the enemy needs them, they will be taken from there. It must be correctly emphasized, this number of 180 thousand Russians is purely for the provision (replenishment of losses - ed.) of these large infantry ramparts. That is, theoretically, this contingent of the enemy is for 5 months of ensuring the war of the Russian Federation against Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/23/na-rosiyi-problemy-navishho-putin-zbilshyv-chyselnist-armiyi/	2024-09-22T20:58:42-07:00
Mobilized in NATO camouflage: fern on helmet and combat makeup on Interflex	The correspondent of ArmiyaInform told about what methods of camouflage according to NATO standards are taught to Ukrainian mobilized during basic combined military training within the borders of the Interflex multinational training mission on the territory of Great Britain. The forest is moist and guarded. The wet krill, which wandered into the forest almost close to my shelter, still felt the danger and ran away. It is not easy to deceive a forest animal - on its side, hearing, sight, smell and knowledge of the area are sharp. However, now our task is not hunting - we have to hide in the forest from the enemy. At the next PPE class at Interflex, we learn basic knowledge, acquire skills and practice the skills of choosing, arranging and masking a shelter. The behavior of animals and birds is one of the signs that can betray us to the enemy. The screeching hum of a frightened flock of birds or, on the contrary, a bristling unnatural silence in the forest can indicate the presence of a person. However, there are almost no birds in our forest. Like, by the way, insects too - every once in a while you will encounter a beetle or be lucky enough to come across an anthill. Mosquitoes and flies, so annoying in Ukraine, are practically absent - probably due to the special island climate or the time of year. The escape of the rabbit looks quite natural - the timid animal could react to anything. So we can hope that the enemy lurking on the other side has not detected our presence due to the behavior of the animal. It is really not easy to notice us from the side of the field, because in addition to the usual camouflage form - most of us have a Ukrainian pixel, but there are also -British- - we have taken additional measures for camouflage. Some of these techniques are exclusive to the instructors, so it's not worth reporting them - let it be a surprise for the enemy. Others are quite obvious and widely used, so you can talk about them openly. There are several masking classes, they take place at different times and in different ways. The teaching method allows you to combine knowledge, abilities and skills from previous theoretical explanations and practical exercises and independently construct something new. This is the advantage of the teaching methods of foreign instructors. What we are taught is not an absolute unbreakable dogma, but rather the details of a constructor, each of which we must personally incorporate into our actions during the task. It is impossible to predict absolutely everything that will await you on the battlefield. But it is quite possible to work out certain modules and action algorithms, the combination of which in different combinations will allow you to adapt and use any conditions as efficiently as possible. Choosing from the acquired knowledge what fits the most right here and now, we put the elements of the acquired knowledge into the general puzzle of actions within the limits of specific conditions, creating a unique mosaic of combat. Among the basic elements of preparation for combat operations in the forest is the application of camouflage paint on the face. We start the preparation for the imitation of a combat exit with the morning make-up, painting the face with green, black and brown paints. For this, we have a special cosmetic bag with rich dyes, where dense green predominates. It is the main background on which we apply brown and black colors, creating the impression of a play of light and shadow among trees, bushes and weeds. It is not possible to paint the face too richly, because we will have the opposite of the desired effect - a bright grass-colored face with charcoal streaks and spots will sparkle in contrast among the vegetation and will be visible from afar even in the forest. Therefore, we apply paint in barely noticeable layers. -Commando in the jungles of Indochina,- someone quips. After wearing camouflage, we really look like American special forces somewhere in the area of ​​approaches to the Ke-San base. For those familiar with the history of the US war in Vietnam, there are indeed many parallels, from combat makeup to jungle warfare tactics. It is noticeable that the military of NATO countries deeply study the experience of all previous military conflicts, developing appropriate tactical techniques on its basis. The next step is to modify the spherical shape of the helmet using the tools at hand. In the forest, it immediately attracts attention, because in the natural environment, something close in shape to a perfect sphere is almost never found. So we attach to the helmet small twigs and ferns, with which the edges of the forest are covered. Now, if we carefully crawl from the depths of the forest into the fern thickets, we will be practically invisible to those looking at the forest from the side of the open field. We check the weapons and equipment once more, paying special attention to the combat make-up and the helmet-mounted spears - they must be strong enough. When the preparation is completed, we go to the edge of the forest to choose observation positions. About eight in the morning. It's been a little over three hours since the start of another training day, so we still have about 15 hours to master this element of the martial art. The intensity of the BZVP within the confines of the Interflex training mission in Great Britain is poisonous. From former civilians, we are increasingly turning into real soldiers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/23/mobilizovanyj-u-maskuvanni-nato-paporot-na-sholomi-ta-bojovyj-makiyazh-na-interflex/	2024-09-22T20:50:34-07:00
Fighter against underwater threats: NATO ordered unmanned robots to neutralize mines	As stated in the official release of ECA Group, which is the founding company of Exail, the amount of the concluded contract reaches €60 million. And the main consumers of the future automated minesweepers will be the Navy units of Belgium and the Kingdom of the Netherlands, ArmyInform reports. The agreement, in particular, provides for the direct supply of K-Ster C underwater mine disposal equipment, K-Ster CT training vehicles and related equipment to the Alliance military. The K-Ster blocks will be assembled on Exail's production lines at its Belgian plant in Ostend. The factory, due to open in 2022, is already producing a number of drones for the Belgian and Kingdom of the Netherlands navies as part of a program to modernize their mine countermeasures capabilities. -We are very pleased to continue our support to the Navy of Belgium and the Kingdom of the Netherlands and NATO allies with our advanced demining technology. This new contract is a testament to our commitment to providing innovative and reliable solutions for MCM operations. In Ostend, we have all the necessary manufacturing infrastructure to produce these new systems,- said Anthony Penn, Commercial Director of Exail. The K-Ster C is a single-use unmanned underwater explosive countermeasures vehicle designed for effective mine clearance. Outwardly, it is somewhat similar to a classic torpedo. The device has a compact design that ensures easy deployment and operation, and is also equipped with a powerful cumulative charge that can effectively neutralize all types of mines. Its high maneuverability and advanced guidance system allow it to accurately target and detonate enemy infernal devices, ensuring safe and reliable minefield clearance. For its part, the K-Ster CT is a special version of the drone, created for training purposes and equipped with an inert warhead. This allows for realistic and effective training of Navy personnel without the risks associated with live ammunition. Remotely controlled underwater vehicle K-STER has a mass of 50 kg, a length of 1.5 m, a hull diameter of 230 mm, a speed of 6 knots, the duration of the task up to one hour. A special feature of the K-STER device design is a bow compartment with a combat charging compartment that can be rotated in the vertical plane. The turning angles of the nose compartment are from −90° to +90°, the mass of the explosive is 6 kg. This ensures the optimal angle of impact on the mine with a cumulative jet. The power plant of the K-STER device includes a lithium-ion battery and four reversible thrusters. The K-STER device is equipped with an omnidirectional hydroacoustic station with a range of operating frequencies of 500–1200 kHz and a range of 40–100 m. In addition, the device is equipped with a color video camera and a light. The K-STER device is controlled via a fiber-optic cable. As note the authors of the Naval News portal, in addition to units of the Belgian Navy and the Dutch Navy, these anti-mine devices have also been chosen and used by the defense forces of about 20 countries.

Four km under drones for 5 hours: the soldier - Fighter - told how he and his comrades evacuated the...	In the Armed Forces - from July 2023. This year, in the Zaporozhye direction, he participated in several successful trips as part of the evacuation group. How is it 4 kilometers to carry the body of a brother and hide from enemy drones every minute? What is the most important thing for a driver transporting a seriously injured person? But what injuries are currently the most common on the front? -Boyets- told our correspondent about this. I remember my first visit. We had to evacuate the body of our fallen brother. It was in the Verbovoy district, in the Zaporozhye direction. Then at 5 o'clock in the morning we left. At first they were on the BMP, because they still had to bring water to the boys at the position. We are just approaching, and they immediately start firing at us with a mortar. The enemy noticed us. I immediately hid. They waited a little and followed the body of their brother. They carried him back for about five hours. The distance covered was more than four kilometers. While they were carrying them, they periodically listened for drones and hid from them. There were four of us, but it is difficult to carry when the deceased weighs more than 100 kg. As soon as they heard the drone, they ran in different directions, immediately covered themselves with a branch or something else, or hid in a chance. We walked like this for two kilometers and met a guy from the 82nd brigade. He was the -three hundredth-. Our brother helped him, applied a tourniquet. Then we took his machine to make it easier for him to go, and he went ahead of us. He had a wound in his hand and some shrapnel. So he went out with us then. Finally, we reached a point where there were no enemy drones. The next exit was at my place, when a wounded person was taken away. The boys followed him, and I had to pick them up in the car. At that time we had a T4 bus. When you are a driver, in such cases it is important to think that you have to return from this exit alive. When I was leaving, I prayed as I should, I told myself that I must be alive and well, and that I must get my brothers out. Our guys, who were carrying this wounded man to the car, wanted to take a smoke break because they were tired. But they still decided to deliver it as soon as possible. Then it was necessary to drive very quickly, because the wounded person was bleeding profusely. If I had arrived 15 minutes later, this guy would not be alive. We immediately took him to the hospital. And they said that we were on time. The hospital was located nearby. And I constantly gave gas while driving. And dear, you understand what it is like there. The third exit, I remember, the injured person was not very difficult. But it had to be taken away very quickly. At that position, the enemy burned the dugout. In addition to the wounded, I took his brothers, because they were also affected a little. They immediately took him to the hospital again. Two drivers always go on such trips, because anything can happen. But this time I had to go myself. When I arrived at the point, the boys were already waiting for me in the bushes. We were going back, then there was a flight in our direction, about 50 meters nearby. It didn't affect me, I turned around and gave even more gas to get there faster. Then took them out. Now, as far as I know, everyone is alive and well. &#8230;As a rule, the front lines of all injuries are hands, feet, and eyes. Because enemy mortars and drones work there most often. I want to say this to the new recruits who are currently joining the army: if the instructors teach you something, then try, don't be lazy. Freebies are not an option here. Obey the commanders. And most importantly, study. Because it will make sense only if you prepare well. This will save your life on the battlefield.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/23/chotyry-km-pid-dronamy-protyagom-5-godyn-voyin-boyecz-rozpoviv-yak-z-pobratymamy-evakuyuvav-tilo-zagyblogo/	2024-09-22T20:30:19-07:00

From Solntsepok to their own units: in Vovchansk, the Russians are shelling their own	Volodymyr Chernyak, officer of the -Rubizh- brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine, told about this on the air of the Yedyni Novyny telethon . - Probably, they decided to ease the suffering of the Russians, who are currently blocked at the Aggregate Plant. Indeed, it is not the first time that the Russians have fired at the Aggregate Plant and the surrounding areas, since we did not fire them, he said. The aggregate plant turned into a trap for the Russian military. — There are now quite a small number of Russians there, many of them are already incapacitated. Their logistics are disrupted, they are trying to use drones to compensate for the lack of drinking water, food and ammunition, the military explained. With cautious optimism, he announced possible good news from Vovchansk, in particular from the area of ​​Aggregatny Zavod. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that Vovchansk was shelled from Solntsepok: Aggregate Plant district under attack by the occupiers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/22/z-solnczepoka-po-vlasnyh-pidrozdilah-u-vovchansku-rosiyany-obstrilyuyut-svoyih/	2024-09-22T10:42:32-07:00

An officer of the -Rubizh- brigade of the National Guard told about the city battles in Vovchansk on the telethon -Yedini Novyny- Volodymyr Chernyak of Ukraine. - Now we are slowly forcing the Russians to attack less and defend more. However, this does not mean that there are any counteroffensive actions. Large-scale counteroffensive actions are still a long way off, as the Russians still have an advantage in manpower and weapons, he said. Vovchansk is almost completely destroyed, which complicates the actions of both the soldiers of the Defense Force and the invaders. — Vovchansk is almost completely destroyed, this does not benefit either side, as shelters are becoming fewer and fewer. Street battles are mostly hiding and maneuvers that take place almost constantly from building to building, even for each entrance you can fight for a week, - explained the soldier. However, he noted, the situation is slowly but steadily leaning in favor of the Ukrainian defenders, although it is too early to talk about any significant successes. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in the north of Kharkiv Oblast, the occupiers were forced to abandon assault operations — the enemy is evacuating casualties and regrouping.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/22/za-pidyizd-mozhna-bytysya-tyzhden-miski-boyi-u-vovchansku-opysaly-v-sylah-oborony/	2024-09-22T10:27:35-07:00

On rusty -motorcycles-: in the Kharkiv direction, the occupiers use outdated Soviet armored vehicles	This was explained by a military officer from with the callsign -Stig- is an officer of the 2nd separate detachment of the Special Purpose Center -OMEGA- of the National Guard of Ukraine. -The occupiers are using armored vehicles for logistics, to replenish personnel at the forward positions,- he said. According to the military, the enemy cannot use it during assaults. — This is more about replenishing some logistics and advanced positions with personnel. Because almost the entire territory of the battle line is controlled by UAV strike groups. And if it is not impossible to drive in an armored vehicle just like that, then it is very close to it, he explained. The officer noted that these are primarily outdated samples of Soviet equipment, which the Russians do not regret. — They use this technique in one way. That is, it is not some kind of advanced technology. These are old Soviet models, such as MTLB, BMP-1, BMD and so on. They simply send one, two, sometimes three units of armored vehicles to the position and understand that this vehicle may not even reach the position, he explained. Similarly, Russian commanders do not spare their own soldiers. -And if it reaches the position, it does not have time to unload and is destroyed literally before the occupier can even disembark with this equipment,- said the military officer. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in Kharkiv Oblast the Russians throw recently mobilized prisoners on -meat assaults-.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/22/na-irzhavyh-motolygah-na-harkivskomu-napryamku-okupanty-vykorystovuyut-zastarilu-radyansku-bronetehniku/	2024-09-22T09:31:20-07:00
The DSHV showed the work of one of the most important areas of modern warfare	This is reported by command of the Airborne Assault Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. -Reb is one of the most important areas in modern warfare. After all, it is UAVs that pose one of the biggest threats to our fighters,- the message says. In particular, reconnaissance drones target artillery, missiles, and anti-aircraft missiles. FPV strike drones are weapons that deal significant damage to Ukrainian infantry. -EW tools are our shield. Thanks to the work of the workshop of the 77th brigade, it is possible to make effective devices that protect the infantry. And what is very important is to make them cheaper and faster than on the market,- noted the command of the DSHV. According to one military officer, with the help of UAV-reconnaissance, with which radio-electronic warfare is fought, the enemies target both -shahedis- and all their missiles. Therefore, it is very important to know how to protect yourself from FPV drones. -Each EW means is a power supply, interference generation and radiation (antenna) systems. And also plastic cases to protect them. Chinese antennas are usually of very low quality, so we make them ourselves. It takes about 8 hours to make one antenna housing. A set of three antennas is a day,- the defender said. He noted that the cost of one antenna (cables, connectors, plastic) is about 1,000 hryvnias, and to buy a similar one requires from 3 to 4 thousand hryvnias. -In terms of characteristics, our antenna is even better because we know what we are making it from and check it at every stage. We invest about 50,000 hryvnias in one EW device, manufacturers sell from 120,000 hryvnias per analogue,- the military officer explained.

Away with barbecues and barns? The occupiers are changing the ways of protecting armored vehicles	About this on the broadcast of the telethon -Edyny Novyny- told the crew commander of the UAV -Kara Nebesna- UAV of the -Rubizh- brigade - officer Andriy Otchenash. - They had a period of time when they completely sheathed their equipment that could not move the turret and used it as a -taxi-. Currently, they are trying to somehow modernize their methods of defense against FPV copters so that the tank can be used directly as a tank, and at the same time, to be able to transport personnel with quality, he said. Therefore, the Russians are trying to preserve the maneuverability and firepower of their armored vehicles. — Heavy equipment and transports enemy personnel and sometimes even manages to withdraw without casualties. There were moments when they drove up close to our positions, shot at our positions and had the opportunity to drive away, the officer said. In his opinion, this indicates that the occupiers are using powerful EW tools. - This is a sign that they are using high-quality electronic warfare systems because our FPV drones simply cannot fly up, said the drone commander. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that the Russians trenches are dug by suicide soldiers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/22/get-mangaly-ta-sarayi-okupanty-zminyuyut-sposoby-zahystu-bronetehniky/	2024-09-22T08:50:26-07:00

According to them, as a result, both invaders remained under the rubble forever. -Perhaps, at least now they have realized that leaning on a foreign country with a war is the wrong way.

Enemy Motorized Infantry: Advantages and Disadvantages explained in Defense Forces	The advantages and disadvantages of the use of motorcycles by the Russian occupiers, as well as why the enemy resorts to their use, on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyni- explained a military man with the call sign -Stig- - an officer of the 2nd separate detachment of the Special Purpose Center -OMEGA- of the National Guard of Ukraine. - First, a motorcycle is a light, maneuverable, high-speed, highly mobile target. When there are many of them, it is very difficult for even strike UAVs to engage several targets at once. Therefore, some of them reach their destination, he said. At the same time, the use of motorcycle equipment also has a number of disadvantages. -The disadvantage of this tactic is that this target is not armored,- he explained. Due to the lack of any protection, even during an inaccurate hit of ammunition next to an enemy motorcyclist, debris can either injure or even eliminate the occupant, and completely disable his vehicle. — We have already worked on these goals and are well acquainted with such tactics. They have been using it since at least this spring, the military said. He explained why the Russians resort to the use of motorcycles. - First of all, armored vehicles often simply do not reach places that can be reached by motorcycle. They have to carry out their replenishment, logistics, and they do it on motorcycles, because sometimes there is simply no other way for them, said the officer. Another drawback is the low carrying capacity of motorcycle equipment, but the occupiers even try to evacuate the wounded on motorcycles. -We saw a group of four motorcycles evacuating moderately injured people,- Stig said. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in the north of Kharkiv Oblast, the -rats on mopeds- did not get there - the biker occupiers blew up the mines.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/22/motoczykletna-pihota-voroga-perevagy-ta-nedoliky-poyasnyly-v-sylah-oborony/	2024-09-22T05:48:19-07:00

The corresponding video was released on September 22 by the Khortytsia operational-strategic group of troops. -Sniper is a profession that requires calm, balance. I can't count how many of them I've killed. I'm counting how many I've lost here. That's more important to me. It's productive for me, not when you kill 5, 6, 7 there, but when you make sure that yours are not killed. This is the most important thing,- assures the female sniper. According to her, there are no people there for her. -Only creatures that have human form. So first, tenth, twentieth, it doesn't matter. The main thing is for him to leave our land,- she says. Another sniper notes that he always thinks about destroyed villages and cities before going out. He says that he will never forgive this. -The enemy will learn about the fact that the group was working in a certain area along the line of combat contact, counting their losses,- the Khortytsia OSU emphasizes.

-Disposable slaves- in -zombieland-: suicide soldiers are digging trenches for the Russians	The crew commander of the -Kara Nebesna- UAV crew of the -Rubizh- brigade told about this on the air of the Yedyny Novyni telethon - officer Andriy Otchenash. — The Russian Federation has one of the most powerful engineering forces in the world, unfortunately. Due to the fact that they have conditionally slave soldiers, no matter how ridiculous it sounds. They have whole units of -disposables- that are launched to dig trenches, to dig positions. Unfortunately, they do it very quickly and very qualitatively, he said. The officer reported that the defenders of Ukraine had repeatedly observed cases when such -disposable slaves- of the enemy entered the positions without weapons. - There have been several situations where they start groups even without weapons. Maybe in armor, helmets, but without weapons - with shovels, picks, all means to dig out positions. And they just dig 24/7, said the soldier. Enemy soldiers, realizing that they can save themselves only by digging in as deep as possible, dig trenches with maximum intensity. In some cases, enemy positions are equipped even by persons who are not dressed in military uniform. - They are dressed in ordinary black robes, not like military personnel. They don't have weapons, but they dig, and after a day or two or three you see that there are actually lines of trenches that appeared out of nowhere, Andriy Otchenash said. Such a tactic gives the enemy, who does not count on any losses, the desired result. - You seem to throw ammunition at them, you seem to destroy the personnel. And they just send new -meat-, which continues to dig. It looks like a zombie land, but unfortunately it's an effective zombie land, he said. Sometimes the enemy soldiers assigned to equip the positions do not have any individual protection. - We have repeatedly seen that military personnel enter sometimes even without armor, without helmets and absolutely without any weapons. They really only go there to dig, - said the officer. The military assumed that in this way in the Russian army they can be punished for some crimes. - Sometimes they are punished like this, it is a punishment: if you survive - well done, if you do not survive - not well done. But the very fact that this is such a widespread phenomenon is extremely surprising. Unfortunately, it is surprising with its effectiveness, said the drone commander. At best, 50% of such -disposable- suicide bombers survive, but the other half still digs out chances and arranges sufficiently high-quality dugouts, which are then entered by soldiers of the Russian army prepared for combat operations. Earlier, ArmyInform reported on attacks -on foot- by the dead- — the -murderous tactics- of the Russians in the Kharkiv direction.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/22/odnorazovi-raby-u-zombilendi-u-rosiyany-okopy-kopayut-soldaty-smertnyky/	2024-09-22T04:32:17-07:00

Six Russian fighter jets were found over the Baltic Sea in two days	This was reported by the Air Force of Latvia. According to their reports, violations were recorded on September 20 and 21. Russian planes did not turn on their transponders and did not provide a flight plan. Eurofighter fighters of the German Air Force, involved in the NATO mission to protect the airspace of the Baltic countries, were taken into the air. The fighters warned the Russian pilots and escorted them to the border. As the online edition reminds Delfi, the Ministry of Defense of Latvia has increased surveillance of the airspace after the incident on September 7, when a Shahed drone fell in the Haigalivska Volost of the Rezekne Region. Russia actively uses these Iranian-made drones in the war against Ukraine. The activation of Russian aircraft increased after the Russian Navy exercises -Ocean-2024-, during which Russian and Chinese warships conducted joint exercises from September 10 to 16, which are part of Russia's largest naval exercises since the time of the Soviet Union. However, as the head of the intelligence center of the Estonian Defense Forces, Colonel Ants Kiviselg, noted at the press conference, the exercises were less extensive than expected. -Part of the training took place in the Baltic Sea. Russia stated that 90,000 personnel and 400 ships would take part in them, however, according to our assessment, the exercises were on a much smaller scale and took place at a low level. First of all, flights of strategic bombers and some reconnaissance flights were carried out,- &#8211; he said. The General Staff of the Estonian Defense Forces reported that the Baltic Fleet's share of activity was insignificant. The exercise culminated in local actions by the various fleets and was more of a demonstration than a real training process. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/22/shist-rosijskyh-vynyshhuvachiv-vyyavyly-nad-baltijskym-morem-za-dva-dni/	2024-09-22T03:49:05-07:00

The regional center of Sumy is also under fire. -They hit residential buildings, critical infrastructure facilities, and farms. They do not stop such tactics, but as a result of the transfer of hostilities to the territory of the Kursk region, the Russians are forced to shell their own territory,- said Vadym Mysnyk. So, two days ago, the enemy dropped 17 anti-aircraft missiles on the territory of the Sumy region, and on the Kursk region &#8211; 21, and in the last day - 13 KABs in the Sumy region, and 31 - in the Kursk region. -That is, we see that as a result of the actions of the Defense Forces, the enemy is forced to spend its arsenals on strikes on its territory,- &#8211; the spokesman added. Also, the Defense Forces of Ukraine constantly monitor the situation at the border. As Vadym Mysnyk noted, the Russians are actively mining the border from their side, creating fortifications. Also, the activity of DRGs has decreased, as the Armed Forces have effective tactics against such groups. -Thanks to such tactics, the Russians cannot use heavy armored vehicles - tanks and BMPs are actively destroyed on the approach. Therefore, they have to work in small infantry groups, but this does not give a full-fledged result,- the spokesman explained.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/22/syly-oborony-ne-dayut-rosiyanam-zastosovuvaty-tehniku-na-sumskomu-napryamku-otu-siversk/	2024-09-22T03:25:39-07:00

Rustem Umyerov: The partners have never ruled out the possibility of long-range strikes on Russia	The Minister of Defense of Ukraine, Rustem Umyerov, made optimistic forecasts regarding the solution to this issue during the broadcast of the telethon. -The only news-. According to the Minister of Defense, Western partners have never claimed that this is impossible. Instead, they are immersed in internal decision-making processes to obtain the necessary approvals. Rustem Umyerov emphasized that Ukraine has good relations with all allies and is ready to wait for the final decision. -We were never told it was impossible. Our partners are focused on operational issues and need permissions to stay on the -safe side,- explained the head of the Ministry of Defense. Rustem Umyerov also noted that in some countries it is necessary to go through complex internal procedures, including approval by the parliament or the National Security and Defense Council. In addition, the victory plan of President Volodymyr Zelenskyi, which he intends to present to Western leaders in September, provides for the right of Ukraine to decide independently how to use the weapons provided to it. As ArmiyaInform reported, there are already agreements on the transfer of F-16 and Migare. Continuing negotiations on Gripen and Eurofighter Typhoon fighters.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/22/rustem-umyerov-zhodnogo-razu-partnery-ne-vyklyuchyly-mozhlyvist-dalekobijnyh-udariv-po-rosiyi/	2024-09-21T21:01:18-07:00
Gives a second life to radios: the story of the signalman Phoenix	Maksym was born in Boryspil district near Kyiv and has the nickname -Phoenix-. After all, it gives a second life to technology. He was involved in electronics almost all his life, his father gave Maksym a soldering iron for his 10th birthday, and even then he became interested in repairing household appliances. That is why the boy managed to find a job in the army. Currently, he repairs and restores communication equipment that is out of order after enemy fire. He joined the Defense Forces on the first day of the large-scale invasion, while the boy notes that he planned to go not to the army, but to the enterprise of the military-industrial complex. — But on February 24, they brought me a summons, and already at 6:00 p.m. I was in the unit. At the beginning, he served in the security company of the Boryspil TCC. There were tasks. And for a person who had never encountered the army, it was both difficult and difficult, and sometimes scary. And already in December 2022, he was transferred to the 110th separate mechanized brigade, says Maksym. Currently, -Phoenix- is the head of the repair shop at the field communications center, and together with his brothers, he provides communications to the headquarters and rear units. At the same time, his work is not limited to the 110th brigade, the young man explains that communication must also be provided to other units that are in the Pokrovsky direction. There is no big difference between civil and military electrical engineering, says a military officer. Therefore, he does not experience any additional difficulties during work. However, due to the dynamism of the war, it is quite often necessary to change the style of work, to get used to something new. — Yesterday we could also use Baofeng, but now we have completely forgotten about them. The work of the same FPVs, WEB frequencies also changes. The enemy started calculating the launch location of the Mavic, we rewrote the firmware so that there was no longer a link to the launch location. Changes take place extremely dynamically. And this adds a lot of work, but we are working, - added Maksym. Last year, the military man spent a lot of time at zero, and the tasks were diverse. It was necessary to deal with the towers, install transmitters for work to mislead the enemy or eavesdrop. -Phoenix- also launched broadcasts calling on the Russians to cease fire or offer to surrender. He also went to Avdiivka several times, which, according to the boy, he managed to bypass -along and across-. During the serious assaults on the city, Maksym worked alone in the workshop, and 10 Starlink terminals were brought to him almost every day. Then the boy slept for 3-4 hours, but he understood the importance of work. According to Maxim, the best way to explain the importance of communication in the military is by analogy with civilian life. When an ordinary person does not pick up his phone in the morning, does not start reading the news, watching various videos, then by the evening he will begin to feel a certain vacuum. — A vacuum, because she does not know what is being done in the white world, and what is being done behind the fence. And work chat, and with family, and so on. And now we're just adding to all of this a potentially life-threatening thing. Life is in danger, and you don't know which side the danger is coming from, the soldier explained. He clarifies that when there is communication, personnel can be warned of an enemy attack and this will help prepare for battle. Maxim calls the old -tapik- (military wire communication. — Ed.) the most secure means of communication in the army, which, although, according to him, has a large number of shortcomings, it cannot be eavesdropped by the enemy, which is very important during the war . — There was no modernization of all of this, the 1958 model -tapiks- were used. It can be made much smaller, it can be made much more interesting. Nevertheless, the warehouses are full of this good, it was picked up, washed a little, cleaned - and it works, said -Phoenix-. At the same time, he again emphasized that the war is changing rapidly, and that is why on the front -tapiks- are almost not used, and Motorola communication devices can be seen more often. - As for me, just subjectively, it seems to me that the hardest thing is when we move from one area to another and we have to simply lay everything out from scratch. There is such a thing that masters, like crayfish, carry the workshop with them under their tails. No matter how banal it is, but after the third move, everything is already unified for me. I have a folding table, I have a folding chair, everything is minimized. There shouldn't be too much in the workshop, the boy said. And the presence of the workshop itself makes it possible to save time when other fighters are forced to involve civilians in the repair of certain equipment. At the same time, -Phoenix- is also aware of the enemy's state of affairs. He specified that almost all Russian brigades work on the same equipment, but the quality of specialists is questionable. Also, a significant part of the occupiers, who are sent for meat assaults, are not provided with means of communication at all. However, the guy does not underestimate the capabilities of the Russians, because the occupying special forces have good means of radio-electronic warfare and radio-electronic intelligence. Maksym explained that at first glance it may seem that he is doing nothing, he is sitting in a chair in front of the computer, there is a soldering iron on the table, and there are various monitors in front of him. However, after the battle, the soldiers with whom he worked come to him and express their gratitude. This is the best reward for him. — For example, when guys from the front line come and say: -everything is clear on the communication.- This is very nice. When no one quarrels, that there is no connection, when the boys hear each other, then this is the most gratifying, the soldier added. The army taught Maxim more responsibility for himself, as well as for his subordinates, because in war mistakes are measured by people's lives. That is why, when he undertakes some work, he does it qualitatively and quickly. After the end of the war, -Phoenix- first of all wants to get on his motorcycle and ride 800 kilometers without stopping. The guy called his bike the best psychologist. — I really want that. I miss him so much. Sometimes such trash, so heavy. This is my desire after the war - to get on my bike and go on a motorcycle trip somewhere for at least a week. In the Carpathians, and maybe by the sea, somewhere where there are few people and only nature, Maxim emphasized.

How the Russian peace fell into a fire trap in Belarus: a half-thousand-year history	Volodymyr Hutsul, associate professor of the Department of Archaeology, Ecology and Cultural Studies of the Uzhgorod National University, told ArmiyaInform about the famous Battle of Orsha in 1514, in which the armies of European and Asian military traditions met. — The mention of the 510th anniversary of the Battle of Orsha is included in the -Ukrainian military-historical calendar for 2024-. However, this battle took place during the war between Lithuania and Muscovite on the territory of modern Belarus. A person who is not sufficiently familiar with Ukrainian history may have a question - what is Ukraine here for? - It is important to remember that Ukrainian history did not take place in a spherical vacuum. The processes that took place in Central-Eastern Europe in the 16th century influenced Ukrainian history and, accordingly, Ukrainian history had an impact on European history. Therefore, we should abandon Ukrainian historical isolationism and understand Ukrainian history in the context of European history. The Battle of Orsha in September 1514 is the culmination of the confrontation between two military and political powers in Eastern Europe, which gained strength at the beginning of the 16th century - the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Grand Duchy of Moscow. Then the Muscovites were on the rise, practicing good old Mongol expansionism combined with the ideas of Byzantine imperialism. At that time, the Ukrainian lands were at the center of the confrontation between these two powers, therefore the Battle of Orsha relates directly to Ukrainian history, is a part of it. —However, at least according to my observations, few people outside the professional community of historians know about the Battle of Orsha. Why so? Why was little attention paid to it before? — This is an old Soviet totalitarian historiographical tradition — to keep quiet not even certain events that are relevant for the history of Ukraine, but even entire periods. Or to present them as unimportant marginal plots from the point of view of Soviet totalitarian history. With such an approach, Moscow's defeats were tried to be hidden and not mentioned again. On the other hand, in the Belarusian national historiographical tradition, the Battle of Orsha is well known and quite popular. Not only because the events took place on Belarusian territory, but also because the battle is an important plot of the modern Belarusian national idea, which separates Belarusian history from Moscow history. —From what sources do we know about the Battle of Orsha? How informative are they? — Like most large-scale battles of the 16th century, the Battle of Orsay is fairly well documented. We can name several types of historical sources that inform us about the causes and background of an event, its participants, course and consequences. First of all, these are the military and fiscal documents of the Jagiellonian Court, which tell us about the expenses for the campaign of 1514: mercenaries, artillery, etc. In the so-called archive of the Radzyvils, we have a list of parts of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth that were sent on the campaign of 1514. Then we have the earliest reports of the Battle of Orsha, which is the Jagiellonian diplomatic correspondence with European and non-European monarchs. The most interesting, in my opinion, are visual sources. Several unique images have reached us about the Battle of Orsha. This is a woodcut from a eulogy in honor of Andrzej Krytski, published in Krakow in 1515, which contains the only portrait of Prince Konstantin Ostrozki during his lifetime. We also have a large painting depicting a battle, painted in the first third or perhaps even the first quarter of the 16th century. It is currently kept in the Warsaw National Museum. It is a large, original visual narrative of the battle, featuring up to a thousand characters. There are also visual sources of Moscow origin in the so-called Lytsovo Chronicle Vault - there are more than 10 illustrations dedicated to the Battle of Orsha. So we have a complex of sources both from the side of the losers and from the side of the winners. - What were the troops that gathered at Orsha? - We know much more about the Jagiellonian army than about the Moscow army. Based on documents, images and narrative messages, we can say that the Jagiellonian army was organized according to the latest European fashion. At that time, the military fashion in Western Europe was defined by the so-called Italian Wars - the conflict between the Valois and the Austrian Habsburgs over Italian heritage. It was these wars of the late 15th and mid-16th centuries that became a kind of laboratory of military technologies. Their main trend was to combine old-style heavy shock cavalry with small arms units. There is a stereotype that hand firearms almost immediately supplanted, destroyed or nullified the importance of knightly cavalry. In reality, this was not the case. It was the combination of firepower and shock cavalry that ensured the effectiveness of armies in the 16th century. If we talk about the formation of the army of that time in different countries, then the Grand Duchy of Lithuania relied on the common movement - the general military duty of the nobility. Nominally, at the request of the Grand Duke of Lithuania, every landed gentry had to join military service. However, at the beginning of the 16th century, this system did not work very effectively. It is this ineffectiveness of the system of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth that is the main reason for the series of defeats of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in the war with the Muscovites, when Lithuania suffered significant territorial losses. On the other hand, in the Polish crown at that time, processes were taking place that balanced the general movement of the mercenary army - military specialists. At that time, this was also a pan-European trend - to supplement in different proportions or to try to replace the nobility common movement with mercenaries. - And what was the Moscow army like at that time - did it also develop according to European trends or did it have any peculiarities? - The Moscow army consisted mainly of the so-called local cavalry. These were also people who had military service for land grants from the Moscow prince. However, more than half - 50-60% - of the Muscovite army consisted of so-called combat serfs, or servants. These were dependent unfree people who were taken to the war by the landowners - the so-called boyar children. Compared with Europe, in particular with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Poland, the Moscow military elite had practically no rights and freedoms. Combat serfs did not even have what boyar children had. This greatly influenced both the worldview of representatives of the Moscow military community and their combat traditions and tactics on the battlefield. - That is, it directly affected tactical techniques? - As for military technology, the Moscow army was mainly composed of horse archers. It was borrowed from Eastern, Mongolian and Tatar tactics. The combination of shock heavy armored cavalry with fire infantry of the Muscovites to the extent that it was common in Europe was not practiced. Instead, the Jagiellonian army combined heavily armored plate cavalry, lighter cavalry with melee weapons - so-called hussars, mounted riflemen, light infantry and field artillery. This led to a wider range of tactics that such an army could use on the battlefield. - What was the number of troops on both sides? - There is a debate about this. There is an old narrative tradition dating back to the 16th century to count the Jagiellonian army at 30,000, and the Moscow army at 80,000 combatants. These figures are greatly exaggerated, because neither the Moscow principality at that time had such a resource, nor the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Polish crown. If we turn to the military and fiscal documentation, we can count about 12,000 soldiers in the Jagiellonian army near Orsha. There were about 7,000 boyar children in the Moscow army, each of whom had to be accompanied by at least one combat serf, that is, we have at least 14,000. At the same time, we have every reason to believe that there were more serfs - 2-3 with each boyar child. Accordingly, the total number of the Moscow army increases approximately twice - to 28-30 thousand. — However, with a numerical advantage, the Russian army lost the battle. How did this happen? — The battle began with a Moscow attack, then continued with a counterattack by the Lithuanian commonwealth movement. Attacks and counterattacks continued until the Jagiellonian army managed to lure part of the Muscovites under the muzzles of the fire infantry, which Prince Konstantin Ostrozky had prudently placed in an ambush. This ultimately determined the outcome of the battle. However, one should not forget the importance of heavy armored cavalry, the effectiveness of the new trend of combining it with fire infantry, and the combination of various battle tactics. All this tipped the scales in favor of the army under the command of Prince Konstantin Ostrozky. - Was this battle significant in the short and long term? - The main goal of the Jagiellonian campaign was not achieved - Smolensk was not recaptured. On the other hand, it was a heavy and even catastrophic defeat of the Moscow army, which had enormous moral significance. Both for the social capital of the Jagiellonian monarchy and for the political capital, it was then believed that God himself sided with the victors, granting victory in the battle. The third point was that after the battle of Orsha, the Muscovites avoided open clashes with the Jagiellons in the field for a long time, until the Livonian War. The war after the Battle of Orsha lasted until 1522, but no more major battles took place in the field. Many representatives of the Moscow military elite died and were captured in the battle. The nobles of the Grand Duke of Muscovite—the elite part of the Muscovite military—suffered heavily. Another part of Muscovites was captured and transported around Europe, showing the European rulers a kind of traveling circus or a menagerie of captured savages from the East. Thanks to this, the Europeans were able to see the wild Muscovites with their own eyes.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/22/yak-russkij-mir-u-bilorusi-potrapyv-u-vognevu-pastku-pivtysyacholitnya-istoriya/	2024-09-21T20:41:00-07:00
Ratification of the Rome Statute: benefits and risks for the military	Actually, the path from signing to ratification of the Rome Statute in Ukraine was quite long - almost 25 years. And all this time, passions around the document did not abate. First, the President of Ukraine Leonid Kuchma, who ordered the signing of the Rome Statute, already in 2001 submitted an appeal to the Constitutional Court with a request to declare it unconstitutional. The Constitutional Court of Ukraine then came to the conclusion that the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, signed on behalf of Ukraine on January 20, 2000, does not correspond to the Constitution of Ukraine, in the part that refers to the provisions of the tenth paragraph of the preamble and Article 1 of the Statute, according to which the -International Criminal Court- ; complements the national bodies of criminal justice-. Subsequently, after the signing of the Association Agreement with the European Union in 2014, the ratification of this document became one of Ukraine's direct international obligations. However, the Ukrainian authorities were in no hurry to fully join the work of the International Criminal Court. ArmyInform asked lawyers to tell more about the International Criminal Court and explain what the ratification of the Rome Statute means for Ukraine and what risks it entails, in particular, for the Ukrainian military. — The idea of ​​creating an international court as a tool to prevent military conflicts and quickly punish the guilty arose after the Second World War, says Honored Lawyer of Ukraine Yevhenii Solodko. — After negotiations, the case did not move for almost 50 years, but the brutal war and genocide in Yugoslavia and Rwanda became a kind of catalyst for the process. At the UN diplomatic conference held in Rome on July 17, 1998, 120 states agreed to create the International Criminal Court. The document that regulates the work of the ISS became the -Rome Statute-, which was signed by the representatives of these states. The ICC was supposed to punish genocide, crimes against humanity (systematic murders, torture, kidnapping, etc.) and war crimes (attacks on civilian infrastructure, humiliation of the enemy, depriving prisoners of war of the right to a fair trial, etc.). A total of 137 countries have signed the ICC Statute, and 124 countries have ratified it. The ISS is located in The Hague, it began its work four years after the signing of the Charter, when it was ratified by the first 60 states. Yevgeny Sweetko says that there are countries that have even withdrawn their signature under it. This, for example, was done by the USA in May 2002. President George W. Bush said at the time that the International Criminal Court threatened the U.S. military and violated national sovereignty. China, India, Turkey, Egypt and Israel have also not signed or ratified the statute. Currently, the -Rome Statute- has been ratified by Ukraine, but the question arises - what does this ratification mean for us? — The International Criminal Court will be able to bring a Ukrainian to justice only if the national law enforcement system -cannot- or -does not want- to do it properly, explains Yevhenii Solodko. — If there is already a verdict of the Ukrainian Themis regarding a specific war crime - guilty or acquittal - then international justice is of no use here, because in Article 17 of the -Rome Statute- contains a list of reasons when an international court cannot accept a case for its proceedings. The main one is if the case is already being investigated by national law enforcement agencies. But the ICC can recognize that a national investigation was conducted improperly or specifically for the purpose of -protecting a person from persecution.- In this case, the international court can accept the case before its proceedings. He is convinced that states unfriendly to Ukraine, primarily the Russian Federation, will try to -throw- at the ISS with hundreds of statements against the military of the Armed Forces. Despite the fact that in November 2016, Russian President Vladimir Putin banned the ratification of the Rome Statute by decree. This happened after the ICC prosecutor's office began a preliminary investigation into the situation in Ukraine after 2014. Let me remind you that in 2008, when the Russian Federation started a war against Georgia, it submitted statements against Georgian political and military figures to the International Criminal Court. The Georgian authorities, in turn, filed lawsuits against Russia. The court spent 10 years investigating the situation, and ultimately punished only three officials of the unrecognized South Ossetia, but not Russia, which controlled them. Certainly, the ratification of the -Rome Statute- is one of the conditions for further European integration of Ukraine. All members of the European Union are members of the ISS. -This is a clear signal that Ukraine shares the principles of the international order based on laws and rules, and is fully ready to act in accordance with these principles,- Prosecutor General Andriy Kostin said. He also emphasized that Ukrainian prosecutors already cooperate with the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court on a daily basis, and ratification will only strengthen this cooperation. After completing the procedure of joining the ICC, Ukraine will have the right to appoint its own judge to this international body, participate in prosecutor elections, and approve the distribution of the court's budget. Full participation in the ICC will make it easier for Ukrainians to access the court's special trust fund and increase the chances of receiving compensation for victims of Russian crimes. Lawyer Oleksiy Novikov names five main advantages of the ratification of the -Rome Statute-: Oleksiy Novikov explains: In general, our experts agree that the ratification of the Rome Statute is an important step for ensuring international justice and protecting human rights.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/22/ratyfikacziya-rymskogo-statutu-perevagy-j-ryzyky-dlya-vijskovyh/	2024-09-21T20:30:39-07:00
Fake -confessions-: propaganda has once again started the old trick about drug addicts	The Center for Strategic Communications and Information Security reminds us of this. In order to record the desired -picture-, the prisoners are forced under pressure and threats to voice the dark propaganda. This time, propagandists spread lies about narcotic substances that dull fear, reduce pain and increase courage. Drugs allegedly used by the soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are supplied to the Ukrainian army, including from the United States. This is a very old propaganda fiction. Do you remember the -spiked oranges- of the Orange Revolution and the fakes about the drug-addicted President of Ukraine that have been circulating since 2019? Now, allegedly from the words of a Ukrainian prisoner of war, propagandists are spreading lies about Ukrainian drug-addicted soldiers. But in this case, the fake was launched on behalf of an unidentified person (surname, rank, type of military, affiliation to a military unit, etc. are missing), so it may not even be a real prisoner of war, but a dummy person. By spreading such nonsense, Russian propaganda tries to discredit the Armed Forces in the eyes of conscripts and Ukrainian society in general.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/22/fejkovi-ziznannya-rospropaganda-znovu-zavela-staru-sharmanku-pro-narkomaniv/	2024-09-21T20:25:49-07:00

Scorched earth tactics: in Kurshchyna, Russians wipe their own villages from the face of the earth	Vadym Mysnyk, the spokesman of OTU -Siversk-, told about this on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- . — They have such a tactic that they do not distinguish at all which is Ukrainian territory and which is actually Russian. Their only tactic is simply scorched earth — they erase settlements from the face of the earth and they cannot use any new tactics, he said. He said that over the past day, the Russian military dropped 17 anti-tank missiles on the territory of the Sumy region and 25 anti-tank missiles on the part of the Kursk region controlled by units of the Defense Forces of Ukraine. — Such ratios are practically preserved. That's why we moved the hostilities to their territory, the spokesman said. He also emphasized that the Kursk operation made it possible to protect the border regions of the Sumy region from shelling from mortars and artillery. Unfortunately, the Russians can launch more long-range weapons, primarily attack UAVs and anti-aircraft missiles, from deep within their own territory and hit Ukrainian populated areas in this way. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that part of the residents of the Kursk Oblast -have become enlightened- and they no longer believe Russian propaganda.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/21/taktyka-vypalenoyi-zemli-na-kurshhyni-rosiyany-styrayut-z-lyczya-zemli-vlasni-sela/	2024-09-21T11:24:59-07:00

By turning it over, they show it and want to turn it over to the Defense Forces of Ukraine, to Ukrainian soldiers. But it no longer works here, he said. Most of the -heroes- of materials fabricated by Russian propagandists are well known to the Ukrainian military. - The fact is that we know a lot about all the characters in these edited videos, because we communicate a lot with the local population, - the spokesman explained. In order for Russian propaganda to stop working, it is enough to show it to those who can see the real state of affairs on the ground with their own eyes. This is exactly what is happening to local residents in the Kursk region of the Russian Federation. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that residents of Kurshchyna are considered traitors in the Russian Federation.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/21/vrut-po-tyelyevizoru-chastyna-meshkancziv-kurskoyi-oblasti-prozrily/	2024-09-21T11:11:24-07:00

And now they do not provide a green corridor so that residents can leave the active combat zone, the military said. Some of the locals say directly that they are now considered traitors in Russia. — Some told me frankly that they are considered traitors to the Kremlin authorities, because they take bread from Ukrainian soldiers and are witnesses to the shame of the failures of the Russian army on the border, which gave us the opportunity to carry out such an operation, he explained. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in Kurshchyna, the locals did not believe the films about the crimes of Russians in Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/21/svidky-ganby-rosijskoyi-armiyi-meshkancziv-kurshhyny-v-rf-vvazhayut-zradnykamy/	2024-09-21T09:47:17-07:00

The prosecutor's office named who was behind the torching of military vehicles	spokesman of the Prosecutor General's Office Nadiya Maksimets told about this. According to her, there is every reason to believe that enemy special services are behind the order to set fire to the cars of servicemen and volunteers with the aim of destabilizing the internal situation in the country, especially in the frontline regions. Curators look for performers through Telegram channels and at first give an easy task, for example, to put up flyers. And then they proceed to the arson order. The vast majority of performers, about 90%, have a selfish motive - the desire for easy money. For such crimes, they offer from 700 to 3 thousand dollars. But I don't remember a case where the performer received the offered amount. Law enforcement agencies promptly respond to such cases. 196 criminal proceedings have already been initiated and 169 paliyams have been notified of suspicion. Nadiya Maksimets emphasized that prosecutors take a principled position both during the selection of a preventive measure and directly during the hearing in court, demanding the harshest punishment for committing such crimes.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/21/u-prokuraturi-nazvaly-hto-stoyit-za-pidpalamy-avtivok-vijskovyh/	2024-09-21T08:44:55-07:00

Vadim Mysnyk, the spokesman of OTU -Siversk-, told about this on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- . — We constantly communicate with the local residents of Kurshchyna. The Defense Forces of Ukraine provide them, in accordance with international humanitarian law, with everything they need for their lives, including food, medicines, drugs, doctors' access to them, and so on, he said. At the same time, informational work was organized for those local residents who said they knew nothing about Russia's attack on Ukraine and the crimes of the Russian occupiers on the territory of Ukraine. — While communicating, we immediately began to explain, to show those who said that they do not know what is happening in Ukraine, what kind of war it is. They were shown photos and documentaries about what they did, what crimes were committed on our territory, the spokesman said. The reaction of the residents of Kurshchyna was different - some categorically did not believe what was shown and refused to look at the evidence of war crimes by the Russian military. - They couldn't believe it, some were in hysterics, some didn't want to watch at all. Apparently, they still knew, because they have family ties in Ukraine. Now they can't believe it, because they were completely brainwashed by propaganda, said Vadym Mysnyk. However, there are also more conscious local residents who are able to be critical of Russian propaganda, especially when it comes directly to themselves. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that more than 1,300 corrected aerial bombs have been dropped by the Russian military on the part of the Kursk region controlled by the Defense Forces of Ukraine since the beginning of the offensive operation.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/21/bylysya-v-isteryczi-na-kurshhyni-misczevi-ne-poviryly-filmam-pro-zlochyny-rosiyan-v-ukrayini/	2024-09-21T08:12:27-07:00

That is why they try to constantly keep this pace. After all, this is the main direction of the enemy, where he throws significant resources,- said -Phoenix-. According to the paratrooper, in the last 2-3 days they have been using a large number of armored vehicles, which has not happened in the last month. -They use their latest tanks, BMP-3, and support all their offensives with equipment. The front line is constantly changing one way or the other,- he noted. In addition, the enemy does not have time to gain a foothold and build defensive structures, which makes it quite vulnerable. The occupiers suffer very heavy losses and do not make significant progress.

This is discussed in an interview with Valentina Obolentseva . -Currently, we are forming a package of psychological rehabilitation services. It will be provided outside of military facilities. Military personnel will be able to receive it together with their families, and this is very important. The duration of this recovery will be within 14 days,- she noted.

The investigation confirmed the participation of the Russian Federation in the shelling of the Red C...	This is reported by the Office of the Prosecutor General. Under the procedural leadership of the Donetsk Regional Prosecutor's Office, a pre-trial investigation is being conducted in criminal proceedings initiated on the grounds of violation of the laws and customs of war, combined with intentional murder (Part 2 of Article 438 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine). We will remind you that on September 12, 2024, the Russian army committed another war crime in Donetsk region. The troops of the aggressor state with barrel artillery hit 3 vehicles of the International Committee of the Red Cross in the village of Virolyubivka of Kostyantynivska MTG during the distribution of humanitarian aid. As a result of the shelling, 5 employees of the International Committee of the Red Cross were injured. Three men died immediately at the scene of the attack. Two of their colleagues suffered shrapnel wounds and mine-explosive injuries. The law enforcement officers established two places of impact of artillery shells and one place of impact of an attack UAV. Fragments of the mentioned ammunition and the remains of the unmanned aerial vehicle were removed from the scene. Based on the results of investigative actions, inspection of the scene, expert examinations and witness interviews, it was established that the artillery shelling was carried out by 2 high-explosive artillery shells of 152 mm caliber and the Lancet unmanned barrage munition, which is only in the arsenal of the Russian Armed Forces. The 152 mm projectiles were used in tandem with a drone that has a laser range finder and autonomously detects and engages the target. This not only explains the wreckage of the -Lancet- UAV found at the scene, but also indicates the deliberate nature of the attack on vehicles and personnel of the International Committee of the Red Cross, General Prosecutor Andriy Kostin noted. Taking into account the traces of damage to the surrounding buildings and cars, as well as the recorded locations of ammunition hits, the direction of the flight was determined in advance. According to the investigation, the firing positions of the artillery units were probably located in the area of ​​the village. Yagidne, Bakhmut District, Donetsk Oblast, a territory currently occupied by Russian troops. On the occupied territory, from which the shot was fired, the following are participating in the hostilities: These units are armed with artillery systems for firing 152 mm shells and Lancet attack UAVs.

A wild boar was released on a minefield: Germany introduced an armored vehicle for neutralizing infe...	As informs the official portal of the manufacturing company, at the military training ground in Bergen, Germany, representatives of this well-known company, in particular, in the Armed Forces, conducted a practical demonstration of the capabilities of its new highly protected armored demining vehicle Keiler NG, ArmiyaInform reports. More than 100 military and defense industry representatives from different countries attended the event. Keiler NG cleared the site at a speed of up to 250 meters per minute. Keiler NG, which means -wild boar-, is based on the chassis of the Kodiak armored engineering vehicle, and therefore belongs to the Leopard 2 family of tanks, which are detailed our agency told. This use of a well-known platform makes it possible to reduce logistics costs. The main tool of the machine is a Pearson mine plow more than 4 meters wide and with a speed of 250 meters per minute on loose soil. The machine is also equipped with the Plofadder remote demining system from the Rheinmetall division of South Africa Denel Munition, which works similarly to MICLIC. It allows making passages 160 meters long and 9 meters wide. As noted defense market researchers from IKK Defense Express, an important feature of the machine is the possibility of its transformation into a remote controlled drone An interesting feature is the ability to quickly convert the machine: instead of a plow, a bulldozer blade can be installed, which gives the Keiler NG additional options for clearing anti-tank obstacles, filling trenches and creating fortifications. Reviewers from the European Security and Defense portal write that the demonstration of the Plofadder detonating cord system, developed by the Rheinmetall Denel Munition company, attracted special attention. Two Plofadder systems on one Keiler NG can effectively deal with even deep mine barriers. According to Rheinmetall, Plofadder destroys 90-95% of the mines along the way, while those that remain will be degraded. Once launched, the Keiler NG will advance along the path, plowing through the terrain softened by the explosion. The Keiler NG is also equipped with a second-generation demining duplicating magnetic signature device in front of the plow, which greatly improves demining safety. The Pearson Pathfinder Clear Lane Marking System is installed to mark the safe area behind the machine. She installs special pennants, visible both at night and during the day, as the car moves forward. Rheinmetall Denel Munitions explosive charges are placed in the upper rear of the hull. An engineering crane with a hydraulic drive is installed in the center of the case. It can be used, in particular, to quickly replace a mine plow with a bulldozer dump, and if necessary, remove any obstacle. For remote activation of electronic mines, the machine uses a special magnetic complex. Despite the weight of 63 tons, the Keiler NG develops a speed of 65 km/h, can overcome obstacles 90 cm high, overcome slopes of 60% and cross trenches more than 2.50 m wide. The Keiler NG crew consists of two people, the workplaces of both soldiers are located on the left side of the car. To strengthen the protection in the center and on the sides of the machine, additional reservation is installed. At the request of the customer, active protection complexes can be installed on the car. For self-defense, the Keiler NG is equipped with a ROSY rapid cloaking system and a Natter remote-controlled weapon station with a 12.7 mm machine gun. In addition, the concept of the machine provides for the possibility of remote deployment and installation of active protection, which makes it maximally adaptable to different combat conditions. Basic characteristics: Plofadder detonating cord system: In the future, after passing all the tests, the new mine defuser should replace the obsolete Keiler, created on the basis of the M48 tank. It is also being considered to equip it with an active protection system and a sophisticated interface for digital operations. Rheinmetall improves its combat vehicle fleet with the next generation Keiler armored vehicle.

-Vkyd- for more than five million: the Russian Federation wants to repeat the tragedy of Okhmatdyt	The Countering Disinformation Center reminds that this may indicate that the enemy is preparing another terrorist attack on civilians the projects The author of the fake is the foreign intelligence service of the aggressor country. It is her statement that Ukraine is allegedly preparing -a staging of a Russian missile attack on a children's institution- -at the behest- of the United States, which is being spread by propaganda resources of the Russian Federation. Such -throw-ins- by the Russians have nothing to do with reality and may indicate that the enemy is preparing another attack on civilian objects. Ukrainians have had the opportunity to see this more than once. With such actions, the enemy is trying to sow panic among Ukrainians, bring division and distrust into our society, and justify their own crimes. After all, Russia tries to blame Ukraine for all war crimes committed by its own army without exception. Thus, Russian propaganda stubbornly calls the mass killings of civilians in Buch and other Ukrainian cities that were under occupation a -provocation and staging-, and the rocket attack on the -Okhmatdyt- children's hospital a -hit by an anti-missile missile of the Kyiv Air Defense Forces-. Don't let the enemy mislead you.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/21/vkyd-na-ponad-pyat-miljoniv-rf-hoche-povtoryty-tragediyu-ohmatdytu/	2024-09-20T20:37:09-07:00
-We were just landing and throwing grenades-: how -Tokha- and -Dobry- captured the Russians	— He was the -three hundredth- at our platoon base&#8230; The enemy in that area entered between the positions, we were not told their exact number. As if they saw five. Therefore, in the morning we were assigned the task of going in to clear (landing. - Ed.) and pick up the wounded man, he could not walk, - recalls the soldier with the call sign -Good-. According to the words of serviceman Anton, he and -Dobry- in the -two- then went ahead with the landing: - We were clearing, and there were a lot of -beds-, positions. We just moved along the landing and threw grenades, because the landing was very dense: the leaves constantly shimmered when the sun broke through. It seemed that someone was sitting behind every bush. We fired, threw grenades, and moved as fast as we could to capture part of the landing. - -Toha- (Anton. - Ed.) says: -Do you see the enemy? Shove him.- The enemy then realized that it would not be very successful to fight with us, -Dobry- notes. Anton adds that the enemy was really confused: - Besides, they had no reinforcements. When I ran out and saw them, they just raised their hands. The only thing they kept shouting was -don't kill, don't kill!- -Dobry- clarifies that they were confronted by four Russians: - And the fifth escaped from them at night. The captives said that he threw the machine gun down the road to the position. As Anton points out, it was clear from the Russians that they did not really want to fight: - I understood that they had reached this landing and were waiting for reinforcements, because they did not understand where to go next. During the time they talked, they said that they were abandoned and forced to come here. They said that they have no use here at all. Although, according to the documents, there were also contract workers from 2018. Maybe the actors are good. The question arose, how to tie them, because I didn't have any tape or anything. I saw that one of them had a tourniquet on his bulletproof vest. He tied it with him&#8230; In the end, four were captured and very quickly took their fellow, the -three hundredth-, who was waiting for us. Anton says that the adventures did not end there. When the wounded man was brought to the evacuation point, the enemy noticed the car that was supposed to pick up our soldiers. — And the mortar shelling began. It was very hot, a -120- flew nearby and hit the car and the driver with the call sign -Timoha-. We very quickly jumped into the pickup truck and at a speed of 140 kilometers per hour we flew in the trunk across the field under heavy fire, Anton recalls. -Good- confirmed that our wounded man survived and is now in the hospital.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/21/my-prosto-jshly-posadkoyu-j-kydaly-granaty-yak-toha-i-dobryj-rosiyan-u-polon-vzyaly/	2024-09-20T20:30:23-07:00
-Queen- from an RPG: how an FPV drone is taught to fire a grenade launcher. Experience of the unit -...	His responsibilities included the practical implementation of ideas and their direct technical implementation. Now he directs all his experience to the effective destruction of the enemy. An ArmyInform correspondent visited the -Bulava- strike drone unit, which was created on the initiative of the drones themselves in February 2023, and saw with her own eyes a new development - the -Queen of Hornets- drone, armed with a hand-held anti-tank grenade launcher. — We do a dark thing for a bright purpose. Most of us grew up on futuristic movies, Terminator is the same. And here is the year 2024 - an iron bird is flying, squealing from the air, - says the warrior. The work of the unit requires ingenuity, perseverance and imagination. And in this creative process there is an important goal - to use every opportunity where you can risk the life of a drone, and not the life of a person. Almost the entire team has infantry experience. These guys know from their own experience what defense in the trenches is like, and they deeply value the lives of their fellows. — The drone does not cost much. In any comparison. No matter how cynical it may sound, everything in war has its own price - a tank shot, a drone, a soldier's life. And I would like those who do not let it all pass through their hearts as much as we do, at least from a financial point of view - to lose a drone is cheaper than to lose a person, - says -Boas-. Discussion of that , how to try to shoot with a drone from a hand-held anti-tank grenade launcher, started in the unit a year ago. Everything rested on a platform capable of carrying the required weight, maneuverable and suitable for the price/quality ratio. — We had agricultural drones, but it was not so easy to set the right angle for them. Even if you are a super pilot, the risks of losing a drone are high, and this is a very expensive story. And then the -Queen of Hornets- appeared, which opened up a lot of possibilities. The idea has been in my head for a long time, and not only with us. We just took it and tried it, - says the fighter and adds: - The important point is that no one interfered with us. Ideas, developments, implementation. When your eyes are burning and you don't put sticks in your wheels, then there will be efficiency. -Queen of Hornets- is the largest Ukrainian FPV drone already in use on the battlefield. It was developed at the request of K-2 battalion commander Kirill Veres to create a relatively cheap and affordable FPV bomber. Due to its high carrying capacity, the drone can perform a number of tasks, in particular, increasing the range of other FPV drones by 25 km. The trigger mechanism for the RPG drone was developed by Serhiy, who has been designing UAVs since 2015. For a long time, he made drones for the front as a volunteer, and then he came to the unit as a soldier. - Our first dialogue was: -Oh, finally I see who assembled the same drones in the kitchen- - -Yes!- . I say: -Believe me, you'll stay here for a week and you'll see that the possibilities for creativity are unlimited,- Udav remembers their meeting with a smile. , in addition to the drone, assemble the jet installation. Colleagues kindly joke about the fact that sometimes an engineer finds an unexpected practical application for things that others would have left in the landfill. From the next room of the secret -creative center-, the duty watchers watch the course of events on monitors. at the front, how crews work. They identify problems in time and participate in the search for solutions. — You can get in touch quickly — wait, it's not like that, or don't fly there, because there is a EW. If, for example, we see that there is a large consumption of BC in the first half hour, then, without waiting for the command, we already pack — and in an hour the additional stock is ready. It's all by itself, by feel. As one organism. Time is very important in war. Roughly speaking, the problem has not yet been announced, but it is already being solved. This is experience, interaction, the full involvement of everyone and the desire to work for the result, - says -Udav-. Regarding the discussions about unified and non-unified components, the guys say that it is two in one - tasks and conditions for their constant fulfillment change, flexibility is needed. Each such unit must have a workshop and specialists capable of reworking the standard BC. — The factory line is unified, it goes without saying, but for specific tasks that may require solutions on the spot, there must be a workshop and SVP engineers. By the way, such a VOS exists, and our specialists are worth their weight in gold. The boys are mostly all self-taught. They traveled to the experienced grandfathers and learned. Any innovative development, in order to be scaled at the state level, must go through the seven circles of hell. The device is clumsy, so a lot hangs on such creative hubs. The power is in making it all work. Both above and below. Then there is a chance to effectively confront the enemy, - says -Uvad-. The pilots in the team are different - there are those who clearly make resets, there are those who -hit- (hit with FPV drones) masterfully at a moving target , feels the wind. On the day of training, we all felt the wind - the gusts knocked us off our feet, even though we were in -armor-. Usually they don't fly in this weather, but the guys said that the -Queen- will handle it. The pilot with the call sign -Skif- shot back and landed the bird near us, maneuvering between gusts of wind. As for the tactics of use, the creators of the flying RPG see it as effective in urban battles, supporting assaults and finishing off equipment. — When the drone returns, it takes less than two minutes to equip it. Taking into account the range, recharging, it's all very fast and convenient. When the situation is such that in one front room it is ours, and in the other it is ****, then it is possible to give people the opportunity to move away, take cover, sneak into the floor where the enemy has planted. Udav dreams that during drones with RPGs and assault rifles became the cover group for the assault. — Do you often come forward to shoot back when several of these are maneuvering around you? Let them hit aimlessly, but they will make them lie down. Or -rolling- goes, you stop it by various means. The equipment remains battered, but not destroyed. It takes several FPV flights to finish it off. You can spend 5 -birds-. And here such a repeated story can come in handy. When asked about criticism, -Udav- says with a smile that no development can do without it. Both a critical view and certain discussions are part of the process of improving anything. And already during constant combat use, new questions and new solutions will arise. He reminds that at the beginning of the use of FPV drones there was also a lot of criticism, and many points were changed and honed already in practical work. > — At one time, we began to waste time not because of a good life, but because we had few drones, and a lot of enemy equipment was in position. It was necessary to somehow stop them, scare them away from the infantry. In the summer of 2023, there was one position where, roughly speaking, there were 5 drones for one and a half pilots, and we were able to stop 12 pieces of equipment. Yes, we did not destroy them all. Rather, they were driven away from us by skid steers with a wheel mechanism. Not all self-propelled guns worked, but speed and skill did their job. We saved the lives of the infantrymen, - recalls -Udav-. We decided not to discuss the details of the constructive solutions, although the engineers state that absolutely everything we invent, the enemy will repeat in one way or another. — This is not a super closed technology. All components are easy to get. Both they and we have been doing this for years. The once narrow circle of amateurs and specialists has now become wide. I read their posts as much as they read ours. They have their own progress and their own troubles. Of course, there will be copying. No matter how vile the enemy, we must remember that they are not morons. They are better at scaling effective products. The same FPV. We were the first. Instead, they were filled with them at some point so that they all flew, it was clear that they did not regret it, as if from a conveyor belt. But they are less flexible than we are. This is my vision, - says -Boad-. The boys laugh - if you give them a notebook and a pen, not all of the virtuoso pilots will pass the theory easily, although they can do miracles with their hands. The unit is actively sending soldiers to pass exams for the flight VOS, so let's touch on a sore topic. In the military, there are situations when those who have been flying for more than a year have a bunch of confirmed damage to enemy equipment, awards, and the VOS is still the hundredth and the position is not related to the actual type of tasks. We regularly have to hear stories when some commanders send such specialists to -zero- as shooters. Which again raises the problem to the outside — in areas where there should be an effective system, the human factor dominates. - Everything is clear with us. The sector of responsibility is given. We are going on a reconnaissance. We choose where we can work effectively. Specialists are valued, promotion of self-improvement is maximum. For this to happen, there must be healthy vertical communication, the willingness of staff officers to learn the art of war, and we have been lucky with that. Well, the backbone of the unit is volunteers from February 2022, motivated. It happened differently, but we made our way to it, - the fighters say about their work. - We are open to other divisions to share experiences, we are interested in seeing this develop. Maybe someone will come up with something else. Maybe better. We will only be glad, - adds -Boa-.

They were surprised - two occupiers disguised themselves as a pile of shit and tried to attack	The video appeared on September 20 on the brigade channel. It shows how two occupiers crawled under the camouflage net, took with them a EW and in this form crawled across the field to our positions. As long as our pilots were able to suppress their surprise and laughter, the Russians were able to get very close, but the disappointing end of their plan was the hit of the reset. After that, the invaders went about their usual business: they died long and painfully. -They adapt, trick, try their best, but everything fails. Is it a robot? Dog? Or maybe a saboteur? No! This is a Russian occupier!-, the brigade commented on the video.

More than a thousand shots and each one hit the target - the story of a locksmith who became a gunsm...	The report about the soldier was released on September 20 on the Airborne Assault Forces channel of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. -These were fierce battles, the Russian infantry, under the cover of a tank, started moving towards our units. I was brought up. Shot. Then another one. The first was stopped, the second was completely destroyed. When I looked at my calculations, it turned out that that shot was the anniversary, the thousandth shot,- Mudryi said. According to him, he has been counting the number of his shots since the beginning of his service. At first I wanted to count only effective ones, but then it turned out that the professionalism of the crew allows almost every shot to be effective. -I am a contractor. He deliberately joined the army in 2021. I passed the basic general military training, special training, coordination, and I met the -big war- trained and with a fully formed team that knew what to do. That is why my crew has thousands of tons of burned Russian iron and a considerable amount of enemy infantry,- Mudry assured. Before serving in the Armed Forces, he worked as a locksmith at one of the Zaporizhzhia factories. -If I hadn't left in 2021, I would certainly have joined the ranks of the Armed Forces in 2024. I don't understand why men sit at home and watch how p..ors (Russians of Putin's orientation, - ed.) destroy everything in their path, how they kill people are mocked. This is not the norm. This needs to be countered and countered as a group. Now part of my native Zaporizhzhia region is under occupation, so I understand very well why and for whom I am here now,- Mudryi said. His parents are waiting for him at home. The elder brother, as well as Mudry, is in the ranks of the 25th brigade. And almost all friends and relatives. There are no dodgers among relatives. -And for those who are hiding, who are trying to overstay, and especially for those who are -not my war-, I want to explain! Realize that there is a war in the country. You will either voluntarily join the army, or you will wake up one morning as Russian slaves. For now, you have this choice — to stand side by side with us and drive the enemy beyond the borders of our country. So don't wait! Join in!-, urged the Wise.

The Office of Defense Innovations of the EU - Rustem Umyerov - was opened in Ukraine	About this the head of the defense department announced on his Facebook page. -This is a new stage in our relations with the European Union in the field of defense technologies,- Rustem Umyerov emphasized. The main focus of this cooperation is to combine efforts to strengthen defense capabilities. Special attention is paid to joint developments in the field of IT and weapons production, which will be decisive for defeating Russian aggression. Strengthening the technological capabilities of Ukraine, the IT coalition has already attracted more than 70 million euros from 13 participating countries, creating a secure IT infrastructure for the Defense Forces. -Our drone coalition, which includes 16 participating countries, has provided more than 500 million euros in funding and transferred thousands of drones to Ukraine,- Rustem Umyerov said. The minister emphasized that over the past 2.5 years, Ukraine has rapidly become a world leader in drone technology. Today, more than 500 Ukrainian drone manufacturers and thousands of developers create advanced solutions for combat operations. With an annual production capacity of up to 3 million drones, Ukraine has established itself as a real defense and technical center. -Our country has a huge potential in defense technologies, and I urge European partners to invest in Ukrainian manufacturers. Together, we can significantly strengthen the defense capability not only of Ukraine, but also of the whole of Europe.

The Akhmat subdivision was transferred to Kharkiv Oblast: what does this indicate?	About this on the broadcast of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon told the commander of the battalion of shock air defense systems -Achilles- of the 92nd separate assault Captain Yury Fedorenko of the brigade named after Ivan Sirk, the basket captain. — On the Kharkiv section, the enemy transferred units such as -Ahmat-. When does -ahmat- come? -Akhmat- comes in when it is necessary to put everyone — cooks, technicians, and so on — into service in the Russian occupation forces, he said. The military explained that the -Akhmatians- have the actual permission and ability to take any action against servicemen of all other units of the Russian occupation forces with the aim of forcing them to unquestioningly obey all command orders, no matter how absurd or dangerous they may be. - They impose discipline, punish physically, send them into battle in case of non-fulfillment of tasks and end the life of the Russian occupier by firing squad, can beat them with sticks and many other things, - Yuriy Fedorenko explained. He emphasized that this shows that the enemy does not give up its initial intentions and will try to complete the task at any cost. -If we talk about Hlyboke, this is the maximum approach to the administrative borders of the city of Kharkiv, and accordingly, in one way or another, they will increase the ability to conduct shock and assault operations with the aim of advancing to the city of Kharkiv itself,- said the Achilles commander. The plans of the occupiers in Vovchansk also remain unchanged - they consist in the complete capture of the ruins of the city, which was practically wiped off the face of the earth by enemy artillery and aviation. — On the Kupyan section, the enemy is more active, they use a significant amount of manpower and equipment. Aviation with guided air bombs is used very intensively, the officer said. Here the enemy rushes to the left bank of the Oskil River. — It is fundamentally important for them to occupy a bridgehead there with its further expansion and, as a result, the occupation of the Left Bank of Kupyanshchyna. But at the moment, the Defense Forces managed to significantly stop the advance of the enemy, Yuriy Fedorenko said. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that the enemy dropped an aerial bomb on Kup. Yanshchyna: two people died.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/20/pidrozdil-ahmat-perekynuly-na-harkivshhynu-pro-shho-cze-svidchyt/	2024-09-20T10:29:37-07:00

DOT-Chain reduces more than 30,000 documents in the Armed Forces every week	About this reported on September 20 by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. Thanks to digitization, the process of ordering food for military units has become much easier — the need for about 30,000 paper applications every week has disappeared. The system also makes it possible to reduce the operational burden on the military. Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Dmytro Klimenkov noted that the introduction of the DOT-Chain system reduces paper bureaucracy, ensures transparency and efficiency in the processes of supplying rear property. -Digitalization is a key element in our strategy for efficient use of public funds. The MOU Partner portal allows you to attract new suppliers more efficiently and without unnecessary difficulties, which significantly increases the quality of purchases. These steps help us better respond to the needs of the Armed Forces and optimize resource management,- stressed Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Dmytro Klimenkov. Currently, DOT-Chain covers the entire process of food supply — from submitting product applications to issuing invoices. In addition to military units, the system is also actively used by suppliers who can use their personal accounts: -Now we are also working on enabling the military to use the system through a smartphone. And in the future - to upload acts on low-quality products. We will also add the reports of inspections conducted by the DOT. The military and suppliers will be able to familiarize themselves with them. Such an approach will increase the transparency and accountability of the process, as well as have a qualitative impact on its effectiveness,- noted Alyona Zhuzha, IT adviser of the DOT. ArmyInform reported how useful new DOT-Chain system and how to use it. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/20/dot-chain-skorochuye-ponad-30-tys-dokumentiv-u-zsu-shhotyzhnya/	2024-09-20T10:04:02-07:00

400,000 hryvnias of baseless combat — the head of the rear is suspected of abuse	This was reported by the Special Prosecutor's Office of the Eastern Region on September 20. The investigation established that the 56-year-old major, understanding the scope of power and his official powers, developed a plan to seize the financial support of servicemen for participating in combat operations on the front line, while at the same time being at the point of permanent deployment of the military unit. In order to implement the criminal intent, he involved two servicemen of his unit, who in January and February 2024 were included in the lists of payment of additional compensation in the amount of UAH 100,000. 400,000 hryvnias were unjustifiably paid to the specified servicemen. Part of the funds from the said payments in the amount of UAH 85,000 was transferred to the suspect at his request. As reported by ArmyInform, a platoon commander was detained in Lviv Oblast material support, which traded in state fuel. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/20/400-tys-gryven-bezpidstavnyh-bojovyh-nachalnyka-tylu-pidozryuyut-u-zlovzhyvanni/	2024-09-20T08:30:33-07:00

Video of the night work of the operators of the 2 separate units of the OMEGA Special Purpose Center made public September 20 . This is how the internal rotation of the enemy personnel at advanced positions in the north of Kharkiv Oblast takes place - the chances of enemy soldiers arriving unscathed are practically zero. Earlier, ArmyInform showed, how the drones from the Teroborona burned down the -Grad-, a tank and a bunch of vehicles in the Pokrovsky direction.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/20/zirvaly-vnutrishnyu-rotacziyu-na-harkivshhyni-zajty-na-pozycziyi-czilymy-u-vorogiv-nemaye-zhodnyh-shansiv/	2024-09-20T01:08:50-07:00
In Zaporizhzhia, a demobilized conscript of the Armed Forces who started working for Russian intelli...	This informs the Security Service of Ukraine. To obtain intelligence, the occupiers recruited a 22-year-old demobilized conscript who had previously served in one of the military garrisons of Ukraine. The young man came to the attention of the military intelligence of the Russian Federation through his parents, who live in the temporarily captured part of the territory of the Zaporizhzhia region and cooperate with the Russian special service. In May of this year, he retired to the reserve and settled in the regional center. Later, a personnel employee of the 316th Intelligence Center of the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation (better known as the game) based in Sevastopol approached him remotely. The identity of the occupier has already been established by SBU employees. -At first, the enemy intelligence officer requested from his agent the coordinates of the combat units and logistics warehouses of the military unit in which the former conscript was serving. Then, on the instructions of the Russian army, the traitor began to go around the front-line city, where he secretly recorded the locations of the units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the bridges through which they move in the direction of the front line,- the SBU said. &nbsp; The enemy planned to use the intelligence to prepare strikes against the Defense Forces using guided aerial bombs, kamikaze drones and heavy artillery. The security service acted in advance and arrested the agent -in the act- when he was conducting reconnaissance near a military facility. At the scene, a mobile phone was seized from the detainee, which he used to communicate with his Russian curator. On the basis of the received evidence, the investigators of the Security Service informed the detainee of the suspicion under Part 2 of Art. 111 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (treason committed under martial law). The perpetrator is in custody. He faces life imprisonment with confiscation of property. As ArmiyaInform reported, the Security Service detained an agent of the Russian military intelligence in Kharkiv. The intruder was correcting Russian rocket-bomb attacks on the front-line city and nearby territories.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/20/u-zaporizhzhi-zatrymaly-demobilizovanogo-strokovyka-zsu-yakyj-pochav-praczyuvaty-na-rozvidku-rf/	2024-09-20T00:49:30-07:00

In the area of ​​the settlement of Hlyboke, the enemy focused the main attention on restoring the combat capability of the assault groups of the 11th tank regiment of the 18th motorized rifle division and conducting aerial reconnaissance. In the area of ​​the settlement Krasne, he tried to carry out logistical support measures with the use of motor vehicles. The enemy is building up a communication system near Lukyantsiv. In the Lyptsiv area, the enemy carried out measures to provide logistical support to units in forward positions and replenished the ammunition of mortar units. During the past 24 hours, there have been 3 combat clashes. the Russian occupiers carried out 1 airstrike using 2 anti-aircraft missiles and 51 kamikaze drone strikes.

An enemy shahed flew near the Khmelnytsky NPP during a night attack — ODA	About this notified head of the Khmelnytskyi Regional State Administration, Serhii Tyurin. The head of the region noted that Russia continues nuclear blackmail by directing missiles and drones towards Ukrainian nuclear power plants. Today's incident with the -shaheed- near the Khao NPP is another confirmation. -That is why the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyi, and all representatives of our state are so actively appealing to partners to provide Ukraine with modern air defense systems, so that we can protect not only ourselves, but also the entire continent from Russian terror,- he added. As reported by ArmyInform, tonight as a result of an anti-aircraft battle 61 attack UAV and one Kh-59 guided air missile were shot down. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/20/vorozhyj-shahed-proletiv-bilya-hmelnyczkoyi-aes-pid-chas-nichnoyi-ataky-oda/	2024-09-20T00:24:02-07:00
Broke the enemy's plans: a paratrooper held a position in Kurshchyna for a day alone	The story of a brave warrior was published by the command of the Airborne Assault Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. -Five of us entered the position, but after a while only three remained - two fighters had to withdraw to another position, and at dawn the attack began,- says machine gunner Volodymyr. It was very hot, because the enemy -poured- everything - heavy infantry weapons and artillery. Enemy drones hung in the sky almost constantly, some of which were conducting reconnaissance and adjusting fire, and others were dropping ammunition on the defenders of the position. -I saw how my brother suddenly bent down. I started calling him, but he didn't move. Later, he realized that his comrade was already dead, because a bullet or shrapnel had hit him in the head. And in a few minutes, the commander of the position was wounded, so he had to be urgently evacuated,- the machine gunner recalls. Volodymyr held the position himself for almost a day. As soon as the enemy's infantry started to move, they immediately opened fire, and the infantrymen were forced to retreat to their starting positions. Later, their own broke through to Volodymyr. Now he is sure that his faith helped him to persevere. -I am a person of faith, so I prayed that God would help me pass this test. And I also did what I had been taught for so long — I destroyed the hated enemy with my machine gun, carrying out the given order,- the fighter states. Earlier, ArmiyaInform told a story about a chef from the Russian Armed Forces, who turns burnt tanks into -candies-.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/20/zlamav-plany-voroga-desantnyk-dobu-samotuzhky-trymav-pozycziyu-na-kurshhyni/	2024-09-20T00:09:18-07:00
Air defense forces shot down 61 attack UAVs and guided air missiles	This was reported by the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Also, the enemy attacked with 70 attack UAVs of the Shahed type (launch areas: Primorsko-Akhtarsk, Kursk, Yeysk — Russian Federation). Air force, anti-aircraft missile forces, mobile fire groups and units of the Defense Forces of Ukraine were involved in repelling the enemy's air attack. As a result of the anti-aircraft battle, 61 attack UAVs and one Kh-59 guided air missile were shot down. As a result of active countermeasures by the Defense Forces, nine enemy drones were lost in location in several regions of Ukraine (no information about casualties or destruction was received).

-Wings- with artificial intelligence: automatically bringing the enemy to destruction should be scal...	About this on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- told the commander of the BPAK shock battalion -Achilles- of the 92nd separate assault brigade named after the basket captain Ivan Sirk, captain Yuriy Fedorenko. — The state of Ukraine has made extremely strong progress in terms of the development, production and combat use of a number of drones, in particular the long-range -wing- type, he said. The military said that it is gradually possible to saturate Ukrainian units with such UAVs along the entire line of combat. — At the beginning of 2023, these tools were used exclusively by individual divisions. It was effective enough, but not as intense as the demands of the front required. Corresponding improvements were made, and most units of the Defense Forces today effectively use wing-type strike weapons, the Achilles commander said. He explained the benefits of AI-equipped drones. - Equipping with artificial intelligence - automatic proofing in this case - makes it possible to bypass the enemy's electronic warfare and, when capturing the target, enter it clearly. In this way, the effectiveness of the application increases many times, the officer said. He emphasized that such UAVs make it possible to destroy valuable enemy equipment, the loss of which not only costs the occupiers financially, but also critically undermines their combat capabilities. This deprives the occupiers of forces and means to conduct hostilities and, accordingly, helps save the lives of Ukrainian defenders. — They preserve life, give the opportunity to knock out, in particular, the enemy's anti-aircraft defenses. This is extremely important, because the less the enemy has anti-aircraft means, the more opportunities for our intelligence to fly further, said the military. Thanks to this, it is possible to detect the enemy on the distant approaches to his advanced positions in the deep rear. — The more we destroy the enemy in the areas of their accumulation, the less of them will reach the front line. These -wings- objectively make it possible to perform such a task at the expense of destroying anti-aircraft defenses, the commander of the Ukrainian drones explained. He noted that in this way it is possible to effectively destroy the occupiers, including across the line of the state border of Ukraine on the territory of the Russian Federation. ArmyInform previously reported that syurpryzy/->Ukrainian drones promise the enemy new unpleasant surprises for him already in the spring of next year.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/20/kryla-zi-shtuchnym-intelektom-avtomatychne-dovedennya-voroga-do-znyshhennya-slid-masshtabuvaty/	2024-09-19T23:57:15-07:00
Where and how buffer zones have already been created: foreign experience	What are buffer zones, how they were used during conflicts between other countries and whether they can guarantee security, ArmiyaInform tells. Zones created with the purpose of separating one territory from another are called buffer zones. In international relations, they are most often represented in the form of demilitarized zones. This is done with the sole purpose of stopping the killings and the possibility of striking neighboring territories. This practice is not new. Yes, after a series of wars, or as they were shamefully called in the international community, conflicts, such zones were created. On July 27, 1953, North and South Korea signed an armistice agreement and established a demilitarized zone along the entire border (248 km), 2 km wide on each side. On both sides of the zone there are minefields and there are significant groups of troops. On May 31, 1974, after the October 1973 war, better known as Doomsday War, a UN Security Council resolution created a 75 km long demilitarized zone near the Golan Heights between Israel and Syria. The UN mission monitors the territory's buffer status to this day. On August 16, 1974, after the end of hostilities between Cyprus and Turkey, a UN Security Council decision created a buffer zone 180 km long and up to 7 km wide, separating the Republic of Cyprus from the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. The UN mission monitors the ceasefire regime. On March 26, 1979, Egypt and Israel signed a peace treaty, according to which the Sinai Peninsula became a buffer zone where the deployment of armed forces was limited. On April 3, 1991, following Operation Desert Storm, the UN Security Council established a demilitarized zone along the border between Iraq and Kuwait. The zone is surrounded by barbed wire and is 200 km long. Until 2003, a UN mission was stationed in this zone. So, as we can see, the creation of such zones in some cases managed to stop the bloodshed. At one time, Israel was able to establish silence on the northern border for a while. It was in the 1980s, after the so-called First Lebanon War in 1982. In the late 1970s, the north of Israel became the target of continuous Palestinian terrorist attacks. Palestinian terrorists who infiltrated from the territory of Lebanon committed large-scale terrorist attacks in Israel - taking hostages and killing 21 schoolchildren in Maalota, an attack on bus passengers on the Tel Aviv - Haifa highway, which led to the killing of 38 Israelis. From the territory of Lebanon, the Palestinians, using MLRS received from the USSR, continuously bombarded the northern regions of Israel. An independent terrorist -republic- emerged on the territory of Lebanon, which is directly adjacent to the Israeli border, and was named after the main Palestinian terrorist organization -Fatahland-. Terrorist leader Yasser Arafat took advantage of the civil war in Lebanon and effectively seized power in the border areas. Tens of thousands of terrorists were concentrated in Arafat's territory of Lebanon, in numerous camps and training centers gang formations continued to be trained for further attacks on Israel, huge arsenals were created. Arming, training and political cover for Arafat's terrorists was led by the USSR. The Kremlin hoped, with the help of Arafat, to expand its influence in the Arab world, which was greatly shaken after the total defeat of the satellites of the USSR - Syria and Egypt in the wars of 1967 and 1973, and therefore did not skimp: a stream of Soviet weapons went to the Palestinians: tanks, artillery, small arms. According to the German magazine Spiegel, the Soviet weapons received by the Palestinians would be enough to arm a 500,000-strong army. The chief military advisor to the Syrian Defense Minister was Colonel-General Hryhoriy Yashkin, who arrived in Syria from the position of Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany. Thousands of Soviet officers were at all levels of command of the Syrian troops, from batteries and companies to the Syrian Ministry of Defense. Syrian troops under the command of Soviet military advisers occupied strategically important areas of Lebanon. The final straw that broke Israel's patience was the assassination of Israeli ambassador to Great Britain, Shlomo Argov, by Palestinian terrorists on June 3, 1982, after which he miraculously survived but was left disabled. -Shlom al-Galil- (Peace of Galilee) - that's how the General Staff of the IDF called the operation of Israeli forces in Lebanon, which began on June 6, 1982. During the lightning operation of the Israeli Air Force, almost all Soviet air defense systems and dozens of aircraft were destroyed. The ground operation also achieved its goal. The Israeli victory also marked the technical backwardness of Soviet weapons, which were significantly inferior to Israeli and American weapons, as well as combat technologies, and, in addition, showed all the viciousness of Soviet air warfare tactics and the construction of air defense systems. After the end of hostilities, a certain strip of South Lebanon remained under Israeli control - the IDF (Israel Defense Forces - Author) retained control over a 19-kilometer (12-mile) buffer zone, which was held, in particular, with the help of the pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army (SLA). In 1985, Hezbollah, a Lebanese radical Shiite movement sponsored by Iran, called for an armed struggle to end Israel's occupation of Lebanese territory. When the civil war in Lebanon ended and other rival groups agreed to disarm, Hezbollah refused to do so. Fighting with Hezbollah weakened Israel's resolve and led to the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Lebanon in 2000. But the truce did not last long - in 2006, the Second Lebanon War began, after which Hezbollah suffered significant losses, and the border was quiet for a while. But now, after the operation in Gaza, launched in October 2023 on the northern border, shelling continues again. Since the escalation of the conflict, more than 60,000 people have been evacuated from Israeli border towns and settlements inland. According to the data of the international organization Organization for Migration, which keeps records of migration flows in the world, approximately 90,000 residents from the Lebanese side left their homes in the south of the country. Hezbollah began using Burkan missiles against Israel, which can carry up to 500 kilograms of explosives and have a range of 800 to 1,200 kilometers, depending on the modification. According to many analysts, another war is only a matter of time. So, as we can see, the creation of buffer zones does not always guarantee safety.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/20/de-ta-yak-uzhe-stvoryuvalysya-buferni-zony-inozemnyj-dosvid/	2024-09-19T23:44:20-07:00

Currently, humanitarian demining is carried out on 282 sites with a total area of ​​17.5 square kilometers, of which 88 sites with a total area of ​​7.23 square kilometers have already been transferred to territorial communities. In addition, according to the Action Plan for the clearance of explosive objects, 2,059 square kilometers of agricultural lands were surveyed and demined. It was possible to return this territory to productive use. -According to the results of the initial non-technical survey of the territories affected by explosive objects, their area decreased from 156,000 to 142,000 square kilometers,- Ivan Gavrilyuk said. Members of the National Mine Action Authority decided to form a consolidated position of Ukraine for participation in the 5th review conference of the Convention -On the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and Their Destruction.- In addition, the head of the Secretariat of the National Authority for Mine Action, Colonel Ruslan Beregulya, who heads the Main Department of Mine Action, Civil Defense and Environmental Security, announced the start of work on demining plans for 2025. Attention was also paid to demining the Ukrainian sea. It is planned that Ukraine will receive three more demining ships next year. We currently have two of these. In addition, the effectiveness of demining the maritime territory increased thanks to the support of Germany, which transferred special equipment for the detection and classification of explosive objects. As reported by ArmyInform, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine invited Bulgaria to join the international demining coalition.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/20/u-minoborony-povidomyly-skilky-ukrayinskyh-zemel-vdalosya-rozminuvaty-za-25-roky/	2024-09-19T23:38:22-07:00

He explained that this was necessary so that the enemy could not ape Ukrainian innovative developments and tactical techniques for as long as possible. — The adversary is trying very hard to work out all the issues of technical innovations used by the Defense Forces and tactics, as we do it. Therefore, some decisions have to be hidden behind seven locks for a certain time, — emphasized the commander of the Ukrainian drones. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in the Vovchan direction, the occupiers increased the number of reconnaissance drone flights, increasing air reconnaissance by about 40% compared to the previous period.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/20/za-simoma-zamkamy-rozviduvalni-bpla-rosiyan-zbyvayut-dronamy-vzhe-ponad-sim-misyacziv/	2024-09-19T22:27:59-07:00

NATO anti-drone training: Ukraine took part for the first time	This was reported by the NATO press service. From September 10 to 20, more than 450 participants from 19 NATO member states and three partner countries gathered in the Netherlands to test the ability of commercially available counter-drone systems to work together. During NATO's annual C-UAS Technical Interoperability Exercise, more than 60 counter-drone systems and technologies, such as sensors, drone guidance systems, jammers and cyber interceptors, were tested in real-world conditions. Ukraine's first active participation in these exercises is part of the Ukraine-NATO Innovative Cooperation Roadmap, approved by the leaders of the Alliance countries and Ukraine at the Washington Summit. -Exercises such as C-UAS TIE provide a unique opportunity to jointly address pressing issues such as the autonomy and interoperability of drones, as well as to study Ukraine's combat experience in combating small unmanned aerial vehicles,- the statement said. The integration of counter-drone technologies into NATO's Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) is essential to strengthening the Alliance's deterrence and defense capabilities. At the 2024 Washington Summit, Allies took steps to further improve the readiness, response and integration of NATO's IAMD and agreed to support the development and implementation of an integrated air and missile defense architecture for Ukraine. As ArmiyaInform reported, the chiefs of general staffs of the armed forces of NATO countries held a meeting in Prague on September 13-15 to implement the decisions of the Washington Summit and discuss how The Alliance will strengthen deterrence and defense while increasing support for Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/20/navchannya-nato-z-protydiyi-bezpilotnykam-ukrayina-vpershe-vzyala-uchast/	2024-09-19T20:47:38-07:00
The enemy's factory of fakes has been exposed: what the enemy is lying about	Media workers received a leak of internal documents of the -Social Design Agency-, which works on behalf of the administration of the President of the Russian Federation and created almost 40,000 units of fake content in 4 months of 2024. Serhiy Kiriyenko, the first deputy head of the administration of the President of Russia, is called the curator of the agency's activities. Among the fake documents, in particular, a document allegedly from the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense was found: the order of the Deputy Ministry of Defense N. Kalmykova to the heads of units and departments of the Armed Forces not to confirm - information about the presence of prisoners of war for exchange on board- Il-76, which crashed in the Belgorod region of Russia in January 2024, and fake quotes from representatives of the IOU about the -insignificance of these losses-. The purpose of these fakes, according to the accompanying documents, is to accuse the Ukrainian military leadership of censorship and concealment of the truth about the disaster. In fact, the Il-76 was transporting S-300 missiles, which Russia uses to fire at Ukraine. And Russia used this incident to sow discontent among Ukrainians and undermine Western aid to our country. Also, in the -register of fakes and falsehoods- there is a forgery of the alleged order of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces Oleksandr Syrskyi equating the capture of military personnel with treason . The purpose of this fake, as stated in the description of the task of the Russian agency, is -discrediting the military-political leadership of Ukraine and demoralizing the Armed Forces of Ukraine-. In addition, among the agency's -accomplished tasks- are fake quotes from Oleksandr Syrskyi, manipulation of the population points and regions from which the fighters of the Ukrainian Armed Forces are allegedly called up the most. To split Ukrainian society, the Kremlin fakers actively used the difficult relationship between Volodymyr Zelenskyi and his predecessor Poroshenko, the mayor of Kyiv Klitschko, as well as the former commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces Zaluzhny. span> For according to the editor and presenter of Radio Liberty's -Schemes- project Nataliya Sedletska, this investigation is unique in that it exposes and documents in detail how thousands of fakes about the war in Ukraine were created, aimed both at Western audiences states, as well as Ukrainians. Some of them were shared by influential people and were even taken seriously.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/20/vykryto-vorozhu-fabryku-fejkiv-rf-pro-shho-breshe-vorog/	2024-09-19T20:19:43-07:00
What awaits Ukraine in winter: an expert on the Kremlin's missile and drone terror	Military expert Petro Chernyk told ArmiyaInform about this: -In a strategic sense, I do not think that this winter will be anything unique in terms of tactics from the Russians, especially missile and drone attacks. Yes, they somewhat managed to raise the total number of missile strikes. The last missile salvo by the enemy, which took place in August, was 127 missiles. I will decipher it, why you should not look in the direction of some absolute disaster, because they say that this is the biggest blow. Yes, he is the biggest. The previous one was in December of last year and had 102 missiles then. That is, they raised (rocket volley — Ed.) to 25 rockets. But if you take a calculator and multiply the carriers with which they can strike, then they have at least 20 Tu-95MS aircraft. And they can take on board up to eight Kh-101 missiles, so we already have 80 missiles. The Russian Federation has up to ten missile carriers of various classes in the Black Sea. For example, small missile ships of the type -Buyan-M-, -Karakurt- and the patrol ship -Vasiliy Bykov- are equipped with Kalibr missile systems. The Russians also have two more operational frigates of the Admiral Gorshkov type. Each carrier ship can carry eight missiles. If we add missiles from Tu-95 aircraft and ships, then we already have up to 160 missiles. Of course, there are also Iskander-M launchers and S-300 complexes, which the enemy has switched to surface-to-surface mode of operation. Let's add the coastal missile complexes -Bastion- and -Val-, etc. That is, if you put everything together, the enemy theoretically should have, well, at least 300-400 missiles. And what is not? And it won't. Why? The occupiers are at the highest point of missile production. Since they started somewhere in the middle of 2023 to produce 120-130 missiles per month, a maximum of 140, they are standing still. They cannot produce more. Indeed, in August of this year, the use of an abnormal number of Shahed drones, almost 800, was recorded. But even for this indicator, they will no longer come out. That is, as these last volleys took place, so they will continue to be. The hit rate on our side for -shaheeds- sometimes even reaches 100%, for rockets varies from 85 to 95 percent. These are very high figures. Good news for us. If until the middle of last summer, even autumn, the Americans produced 20-21 missiles for the Patriot air defense system, then it has already been confirmed that in August of this year they produced plus 20 missiles. And this is already 40 pieces per month. And production will increase. That is, our covering of the sky will increase. Germany will transfer 17 new IRIS-T systems to strengthen Ukraine's air defense. This is a strengthened division, it is very good. Let me remind you that the IRIS-T complex has an impressive accuracy rate of 95 percent. Each launcher has 8 missiles. That is, 10 systems - 80 missiles. Finally, we have F-16 planes. They have a unique AIM-9 Sidewinder missile on board. It is an American air-to-air missile with a short range of up to 20 kilometers. By the way, this is the most massive air-to-air missile in the world. More than 200 thousand of them were produced. Spain has announced that it will send to Ukraine a complete battery of the Hawk anti-aircraft missile system, which contains 6 launchers. One launcher is three missiles, the radius of application is up to 40 kilometers. Again, this is the most massive rocket that exists in the world in this class. More than 40 thousand of them were produced. We have to look carefully at this winter, of course there will be difficulties. The winter will not be easy, because our energy infrastructure is destroyed by 40-50 percent. But the absolute disaster that our enemy is counting on will not happen either. Why? After all, we get more than half of the electricity generation from nuclear power plants. Plus there is good news - this is the construction of another nuclear power plant in Ukraine. This is a powerful answer. Let's add here the so-called small generating capacities. Starting from the mass installation of electric solar panels and wind turbines and ending with ordinary generators for own households and institutions.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/20/shho-chekaye-na-ukrayinu-vzymku-ekspert-pro-raketno-dronovyj-teror-kremlya/	2024-09-19T20:13:35-07:00
What is the new DOT-Chain system and how to use it: step-by-step instructions	Among other things, the quality of execution of combat tasks by units, and the motivation of personnel, and globally, national security in general, depend on the speed, efficiency, quality of the supply of products to military units and the complete absence of a corruption component during these processes. So, a week ago, another digital product for the military was launched in Ukraine. On September 11, the State rear operator presented DOT-Chain, an innovative IT system for managing the rear needs of the Armed Forces. This IT system from the State operator of the rear should fundamentally change the processes of providing food to the Armed Forces. The system digitizes key processes: from product orders to invoice processing, thereby reducing delivery times by four. So now all the stages, from the application filled out by the head of food service to the payment to the supplier, are collected in one place. All necessary documentation and signatures of each of the parties are also collected in one place. Creation of DOT-Chain has become the largest digital project in DOT. A team of IT specialists of the State Rear Operator worked on the development for half a year. The Ministry assures that this innovative solution will be able to completely eradicate corruption. The budget for rear support of the Armed Forces currently amounts to 96 billion hryvnias. DOT-Chain's primary mission is to simplify processes, increase awareness, and strengthen support for both the military and suppliers. During the presentation of the system, Alyona Zhuzha, the IT advisor of the State Rear Operator, responsible for the project development, says the following about the key advantage: — After everyone learns to use the system and we work out all the processes in it, it is expected that we will be able to do even more reduce delivery time. Before that, 30,000 paper documents were generated to provide food for one military unit. This is just one week of one military unit. There is no need for that now. According to her, from now on the system shows all the statuses of procurement and delivery documents, and expense invoices are immediately uploaded to the system. At the same time, the State operator of the rear, having electronic signatures from the military unit and the supplier, can immediately pay the application. Information from the system will also be used by the Ministry of Defense to adjust the needs of the military in accordance with the data. See in detail in the video instructions step-by-step recommendations-tips on how to use the DOT-Chain system. At the moment, the functionality of the system extends only to food. In the future, it is promised to be scaled up for purchases of other categories of goods. — I'm sure that each of you has seen posts on social networks that somewhere there are problems with food, and somewhere the situation is critical. The DOT-Chain system allows us to understand exactly where the situation is in real time, to make decisions and take responsibility for what is happening on the ground, says the head of the State Rear Operator Arsen Zhumadilov. Changes brought by the DOT-Chain IT system:	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/20/chym-korysna-nova-systema-dot-chain-i-yak-neyu-korystuvatysya-pokrokova-instrukcziya/	2024-09-19T20:00:33-07:00

Drones of the Defense Forces told when it is possible to overcome enemy EW	An officer of the Separate Detachment of Special Purpose Unmanned Systems -Kryla- told about this on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- Omega- of the Special Purpose Center of the National Guard of Ukraine with the call sign -Storm-. He said that the Russian occupiers use various EW systems to suppress the control signals of Ukrainian drones. - Usually these are some mobile REBs in the form of backpacks. The infantry takes them for themselves, advances in a certain direction and tries to gain a foothold there, he said. However, such EW means require constant power supply, which is difficult to provide at the forward positions of the enemy. — Some logistics also work in them. They used their drones to deliver various batteries, food, so that their enemy force could hold out in a certain direction as long as possible. This is usually not very effective because constant power is required for these BERs. It can work for a certain time, and then, due to the fact that it is no longer working, it is possible to carry out various types of damage, the officer explained. At the same time, the enemy is also trying to strike Ukrainian defenders with the help of UAVs. — Recently, the number of applications of FPV drones has increased. But, taking into account the fact that we use REBs, their effectiveness drops to a minimum. In the same way, they are trying to calculate our EW system and use aerial reconnaissance drones. There are not so many of them in the directions, but they are also used, said the UAV operator. He emphasized that the fighters of the Defense Forces also do not stand still and use various types of EW as efficiently as possible to suppress enemy drones. Earlier, ArmyInform showed how Ukrainian drones destroy the enemy in Kharkiv Oblast in a variety of ways with the help of FPV, skids and -dragon- drones.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/19/koly-mozhna-podolaty-vorozhyj-reb-rozpovily-dronari-syl-oborony/	2024-09-19T11:07:03-07:00

During the day, snipers destroyed 20-40-50 people - company commander Serhiy Varakin	The conversation with the officer was broadcast on September 19 on the channel of the -Return Alive- foundation. The most valuable thing for Serhii is his subordinates, whom he gently calls family. In March, Serhiy Varakin lost a soldier for the first time in 9 years of service, an enemy FPV hit one of the company's pickup trucks. -I always tried to hold back - I'm a man. But sometimes you can't help it: you stand and roar,- Serhiy explains. The war is changing, which forces Serhiy Varakin, as a commander, to resort to non-standard solutions. One of these is the mastery of kamikaze drones by snipers. -If we can't get the enemy from the ground, then we will get him from the sky,- says Serhiy Varakin. As reported by ArmyInform, a sniper of the 77th separate airmobile brigade of the Russian Air Force with the call sign -Wolf- told how to prepare and what is important during combat work. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/19/v-den-snajpery-nyshhyly-po-20-40-50-cholovik-komandyr-roty-sergij-varakin/	2024-09-19T10:44:12-07:00
AK-74 for -noise isolation-: in Kharkiv Oblast, enemy soldiers are poorly trained and equipped	An officer of the Separate Detachment of Special Purpose Unmanned Systems -Kryla- told about this on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- Omega- of the Special Purpose Center of the National Guard of Ukraine with the call sign -Storm-. — If we take the trend of combat training of infantrymen, then in recent times these are usually people who signed a contract six months to a year ago. Of course, they had some training, they were not immediately sent to the front, he said. However, the level of education of the occupiers is extremely low, they have not mastered even small arms. -In most cases, they just use weapons to make some noise isolation so that we think they are trained in something,- the officer explained. The occupiers are primarily armed with AK-74 assault rifles, but they also have newer weapons. - In terms of equipment, in most cases there were no special forces or military personnel with greater experience. These are ordinary infantrymen who serve literally up to a year. Therefore, in terms of skills, they have a very low level, the military said. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that during attacks in Vovchansk, the enemy steadily loses up to 70% of attack aircraft - barely a third survives.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/19/ak-74-dlya-shumovoyi-izolyacziyi-na-harkivshhyni-vorozhi-soldaty-pogano-vyshkoleni-j-osnashheni/	2024-09-19T10:31:43-07:00

-Tamara and I are behind bars as a couple-: two collaborators were detained - a teacher and an offic...	This was notified by the Security Service of Ukraine. Two collaborators cooperated with the occupation administrations of the Russian Federation in Luhansk region and Kharkiv region. One of the figures was the -deputy director of the lyceum of the LNR-, which the Rashists created on the basis of the captured school in temporarily occupied Luhansk. -According to the investigation, the collaborator obliged the lyceum teachers to teach the history of Ukraine exclusively according to the -methodology- of the Russian Federation, in which the facts of the formation of our statehood were completely falsified. The collaborator also praised Putin and the full-scale invasion of Russia, which she regularly spoke about in front of the school community,- the SBU said. In August of this year, the defendant arrived in Kyiv via EU countries to resolve social issues. She planned to stay hidden in the city for a while, and then return to Luhansk. SBU employees located her and detained her in a rented apartment. According to the investigation, the suspect is a 42-year-old resident of Luhansk region, who in 2014 went to cooperate with the enemy. Before being appointed to the -position-, she underwent -retraining courses- in Rostov-on-Don. Another collaborator was detained in Kharkiv region. -The accomplice of the aggressor turned out to be a 58-year-old resident of Kupyansk, who after the capture of the city joined the local occupation administration of the Russian Federation. There, she was appointed to a -position- where she drew up documentation on the technical maintenance of military barracks and the occupation authorities of the Russian Federation,- the Ukrainian special service added. So far, the investigators of the Security Service have notified both detainees (in accordance with the crimes committed) of suspicion under Part 2 and Part 3 of Art. 111-1 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (collaborative activity). Investigations are ongoing. The perpetrators face prison terms. Earlier ArmyInform reported about a 22-year-old unemployed resident of the village of Geniivka, Slobozhansk community, Chuguyiv district, Kharkiv region, who collected data on the deployment of units of the Defense Forces on the territory of the district and reported them to Russian curators.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/19/my-z-tamaroyu-za-graty-paroyu-zatrymaly-dvoh-kolaborantok-vchytelku-ta-chynovnyczyu/	2024-09-19T09:21:25-07:00

In his first battle, he defeated the enemy's armored personnel carrier - the story of the Phantom fi...	said about the soldier on September 19 Airborne assault troops of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. And although the soldier is still undergoing rehabilitation, he is already planning to return to the army, because in Bilogorivka, where he was seriously wounded, his comrades continue to fight the enemy. -It is extremely difficult to maintain the defense in Bilogorivka. Digging a trench there is a challenge with an asterisk, because there is almost no land - solid chalk that cannot be dug,- says Serhiy. According to the paratrooper, chalk not only makes it difficult to set up positions: it also poses another threat to soldiers. The fact is that fragments from mines and shells are not absorbed by the ground, as happens when a trench is dug in ordinary soil, but bounce off the hard rock and scatter chaotically in different directions, finding victims among our defenders. -My brother, who was standing not far from me, was hit by a shrapnel just like that when we were repelling an enemy assault,- Serhiy recalls. According to the brave paratrooper, the situation is complicated by the fact that the enemy considers Bilogorivka as the -key- to the defense of Siversk, so they will spare nothing to capture this village: bullets, artillery shells, mines and anti-aircraft missiles - all this deadly irony the enemy sends tons every day in the position of stable fighters. But no iron is able to break the will of the paratroopers of the 81st brigade to resist. The story of a brave fighter with the call sign -Phantom- is a vivid example of this. He will remember his first fight and what preceded it for the rest of his life. -At the position, we walked seven kilometers, carrying 45 kg of cargo. It was difficult, but there were still -flowers-. When the orcs started storming us, it became a real test,- says the paratrooper. According to the soldier, after the mortar shelling, with which the enemy -processed- the positions of the Ukrainian defenders, the assault of the enemy's infantry, supported by a tank and an armored personnel carrier, began. At the same time, the appearance of the tank was a surprise for the soldiers. -He descended from the tericon at neutral speed, so he could not be heard. When he started climbing the mountain, we couldn't see him then, but we already heard the roar of the engines and realized that something serious was going on. We saw the tank only when it left, as they say, -under our noses,- Serhii recalls. The unit went into battle. Serhii grabbed the RPG-7 grenade launcher and started firing at the armored personnel carrier, which also came within range of the shot, and his brother engaged the tank. -I don't remember when I knocked out an armored personnel carrier, because I fired five shots from a grenade launcher. I know for sure that I hit more than one cumulative grenade. I remarked about myself that I would shoot him, as if in a shooting range,- says Serhiy. The tank was also knocked out by a well-aimed shot of his comrades. The infantry was partially killed - only those who managed to escape in time survived. Recalling the first and subsequent battles in which the brave paratrooper participated, he says that he understood how important the professional training of a soldier is. -I was taught well at the training center: I could freely handle a machine gun, a machine gun, and a grenade launcher, so I felt confident in battles, because my actions were brought to automatism,- Serhii assures. Those who are still hesitating, the brave soldier understands a little, because he himself did not immediately join the army: he adjusted himself for several months, but in the end he made his conscious choice. But now he says that he needs to overcome his emotions: -Don't be afraid. Yes, it's scary, but we need to go to war, because we won't have a future if everyone doesn't come to their senses and go to protect their relatives, our Motherland. And before this war has come to your home, come to your senses and join the army, there will be work for everyone,- says the paratrooper.

Threat of ecological disaster: Russians mined dams in the Belgorod region	This was reported by the spokesman of the operative-tactical group -Kharkiv-, Colonel Vitaly Sarantsev. According to him, the Russians are not only actively building defensive fortifications around Belgorod, but also actively mining general and special purpose hydraulic structures. -This can be seen as a 'bookmark' for the future - if, for example, the situation changes dramatically and the Russians have to blow up dams to slow the advance of the Defense Forces of Ukraine,- he suggested. The spokesman also noted that the Russians could also use mines to carry out an -operation under a foreign flag- - to blow up dams in order to later blame the Ukrainians for this. -It can also be assumed that the Russian Federation is preparing provocations at hydrotechnical facilities in order to further accuse Ukraine of environmental and humanitarian consequences,- said the spokesman of Kharkiv Technical University. He added that such actions can be used to mobilize the local population of the Belgorod region and to divert the attention of Russians from internal problems. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in Kharkiv region, the occupiers were transferred -to foot fodder-, as a result of which Russian soldiers were poisoned due to a lack of quality provisions, and in Vovchansk, a third of the fighters in the enemy's assault groups survive - the enemy steadily loses up to 70% of its assault troops.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/19/zagroza-ekologichnoyi-katastrofy-u-byelgorodskij-oblasti-rosiyany-zaminuvaly-damby/	2024-09-19T08:34:38-07:00

From a miner to a hero-defender: the story of soldier Mykola Savinykh	on September 19 operational command -North- told about the fighter. At first, Mykola served as a mechanic-driver of BTR-80, where together with his unit he was on combat duty in the southern direction for almost half a year. Then he was in the Izyum direction of the Kharkiv region, where he held the defense and did not allow the enemy to establish a pontoon crossing across the river.

Espionage for the Armed Forces, the Russian IPSO, fakes: what is known about the General Staff	informs the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine about this. Experts examined about 27 thousand units of media content published from June 8, 2018 to July 26, 2024. In particular, in its activities, the channel focuses on the following operations: Analysis of the content of the enemy Telegram channel was conducted by the Strategic Communications Center in cooperation with the Cyber ​​Department of the Security Service of Ukraine and the Main Communications Department of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. It is noted that since 2014, the Russian Federation has been waging a hybrid war against Ukraine, which includes information operations. -Russian informational aggression includes campaigns aimed at discrediting the Defense Forces of Ukraine, falsifying the events of the Russian-Ukrainian war, and depriving Ukrainians of the will to resist,- the report says. Russia also carries out information manipulation and interference both openly and covertly, often masking its actions under the guise of Ukrainian initiatives. In particular, he creates pseudo-Ukrainian pages in social networks and messengers in order to subtly influence the Ukrainian audience. One such resource is the National Headquarters Telegram channel, which is moderated by Russian intelligence services and specializes in topics related to the Defense Forces and is aimed at the military. Therefore, -NachStabu- is part of the Russian information campaign aimed at weakening Ukraine through information attacks, and performs the role of an instrument of hybrid warfare.

A third survives: in Vovchansk, the enemy steadily loses up to 70% of attack aircraft	An officer of the Special Purpose Center -Omega Wings- of the National Guards of Ukraine with the call sign -Storm-. - As you can see the tactics of our enemy, he does not spare his manpower. The main technique is to move by 3-4 people. If someone is able to make it to a certain point, they are pinned and waiting for the next batch. Thus, for 20 people, only 7-6 people who hold a certain plot are able to reach. In this way, they accumulate their strength and spread across the front, he said. Accumulating in sufficient numbers for the next advance, the occupying soldiers try to move on, again losing about 2/3 of their personnel. - Since this is a city, the enemy tries to use the buildings. Lately, he has resorted to the tactic of single use of manpower. The enemy moves singly and accumulates at appropriate points in order to spread across the front and gain a foothold in certain areas of the terrain and push back our forces, the officer explained. In order to gain a foothold, the occupiers use basements and ruins of buildings, in which it is quite difficult for them to inflict fire damage. In order to deliver the personnel to the assault lines, the enemy uses fast maneuvering equipment - buggies. They are just as difficult to hit with drones. — There are also moments of movement on some kind of equipment. These can be buggies, quite maneuverable equipment, it is very difficult to follow. We usually try to use FPV drones, but it is very difficult at such a speed, where the equipment just flies by in a second and it is very difficult to catch it, - explained -Storm-.

As informsIOU, this was discussed at the meetings of the Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine for European Integration, Oleksandr Balanutsa, with representatives of the leadership of the Swedish Ministry of Defense, as well as research and educational institutions. -Ukraine strives not only to adopt the experience of our partners, but also to share its own best practices.

From now on, the main intelligence agency is also in art: a wall painting -The wise man rules over t...	The creation of the mural was initiated by the Suchasna Ukraine Charitable Foundation with the support of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. And the artistic project was realized by the artist Volodymyr Manzhos, recognized in Ukraine and the world. The artist depicted the successful operations of the GUR on the mural: — The story in my author's style about the activity of the GUR of the MOU in the Black Sea. We see here a personified collective image of intelligence - the GUR symbol, a sea drone, a surf as a reference to a sea drone, a battered -Russian warship-, the hand of someone wise ruling over the stars. This is the slogan of GUR, the author shared his idea. This is the seventh work from a series of his mural works about historical, fateful events in Ukraine. — I created my first job in India in 2015. Then there were jobs in Kyiv, Poland, and Paris. All these works in one way or another reflect the events we are witnessing. Finishing each of them, I sincerely believed that this was the last work of this series. And the next mural will reflect our victory, peace and prosperity. Therefore, now I wish that the next mural would be just like that, Volodymyr Manzhos concluded. The president of the -Modern Ukraine- Foundation, Volodymyr Havrysh, said that before the large-scale war, one of the initiatives planned by the benefactors was the murals of modern Ukraine. The goal then was to unify the country. Murals were to be created in each area to promote the idea that we are one. — But in 2022, a full-scale invasion began and we realized that in addition to systematic aid to the front (more than 150 million hryvnias have been provided to date), cultural diplomacy plays an important role. Today you see a mural that shows the power of Ukrainian intelligence, our defenders, destroying ships in the Black Sea. And the task of this presentation is also to collect 10 million in order to purchase the Magura V5, which will destroy naval targets, ships, so that the Ukrainian people live under the free Ukrainian sky, Volodymyr Havrysh said. He also shared plans to create murals in other countries. -These murals will be the gratitude of the Ukrainian people to all partner countries, the civilized world and the people who help Ukrainians today to resist and defeat the enemy,- the philanthropist noted. Andriy Yusov, a representative of the Ukrainian State Educational and Cultural Organization, thanked the author, the public, and volunteers for the implementation of this creative initiative. — This time the mural — owl, Magura, sea — is dedicated to the destruction of the enemy's potential on the Ukrainian sea and the liberation of our territories. Actually, it is not only support of fighting spirit. This is real art. We did not influence the creative process in any way, apparently, but conceptually, of course, this is joint work, - Andrii Yusov said. — Russian aggression is, of course, a terrible evil, but the struggle of the Ukrainian people continues. And it must be supported, supported by motivation. And, actually, such art projects are very important support. At the same time, despite the fact that we are talking about repelling Russian aggression at sea, this is a very bright artistic project, a bright picture, like the entire struggle of the Ukrainian people. The work of Volodymyr Manzhos is, without exaggeration, a cultural phenomenon. We are grateful that the Main Directorate of Intelligence is now both in art and on the streets of Kyiv. Andriy Yusov joked that today the largest owl in Ukraine has settled in Kyiv, and this owl is certainly inextricably linked with the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, with the work of special forces and group 13 - Magura V5 operators. He conveyed the thanks of the soldiers to the author and everyone present and emphasized how important such recognition of their work is. — But, in addition to the fact that it is a beautiful work of art, it is also a large charity fundraiser for Ukrainian Magura attack drones, which effectively destroy the enemy Russian fleet. That's why it's great when art helps the Security and Defense Forces, Andrii Yusov summarized. The ceremonially opened mural is a continuation of the -GURKIT from GUR- campaign, within the limits of which at the beginning of September the computer game -Gurkit on the Swamps- was presented, where everyone can try themselves in the role of the operator of a modern Ukrainian surface drone and donate to its purchase. At the presentation, a limited edition of the own brand was distributed based on the motifs of the mural with the author's signature, as well as an exclusive -skin- for Monobank cards and a themed merch drop of the SYNDICATE brand with an image of the mural. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/19/golovne-upravlinnya-rozvidky-vidteper-ye-j-u-mystecztvi-v-kyyevi-vidkryly-stinopys-mudryj-panuye-nad-zirkamy/	2024-09-19T04:41:36-07:00

Ukrainian howitzers -Bohdan- are financed from profits from the frozen assets of the Russian Federat...	This was spoke the Ambassador of the European Union to Ukraine Katarina Maternova in an interview - European truth-. According to her, the production of Ukrainian howitzers -Bohdan- has already been paid for with this money. Katarina Maternova reminded that half a year ago, the EU approved the scheme for using the income from frozen Russian assets - the interest -dripping- on them - for the benefit of Ukraine, and in August the first 1.4 billion euros were allocated from them. In particular, several member states received funding for new arms supplies. She emphasized that it is much more important that 400 million of this amount will go to Ukrainian defense enterprises. It was Denmark that came up with such a system. It was the first country to contract and pay for the production of Bogdan howitzers for the Armed Forces. -So, we poured 400 million euros through Denmark into the Ukrainian defense industry. Agree, this is quite a significant amount&#8230; And that's such exquisite justice, isn't it? With the funds of Russian frozen assets, you make howitzers,- the ambassador said. Katarina Maternova noted that Denmark contributed some of its own funds to the amount of 400 million euros of rockets and thus placed a large order at the Ukrainian military plant. According to the ambassador, in the next tranche of the frozen Russian assets, they want to pledge an even larger amount to finance the production of weapons directly by the Ukrainian defense industry. -From the next tranche, an even larger amount will go directly to the Ukrainian defense industry. Because you produce products of the same quality for less money, you do it faster, you have lower transport and logistics costs, and in addition, manufacturers pay taxes in Ukraine and help support the economy,- she said. The ambassador added that this is something she is particularly proud of, as she was one of the most ardent defenders of this idea.

-Orlan-, Zala, Supercam: why it is difficult to shoot down enemy reconnaissance drones	Why it is difficult to shoot down enemy reconnaissance drones explained on the live broadcast of the national telethon -Edyny Novyni- the spokesman of the National Guard Ruslan Muzychuk of Ukraine. — When we talk about shooting down, it is, of course, primarily the detection of such UAVs. This task is not the most difficult - to directly detect various types of aircraft, in particular, such as -Orlan-, -Zala- or -Supercam-. Another issue is their downing, because we see, for example, there was quite a lot of activity in Kharkiv Oblast last month, and on the northern border UAVs are used specifically for reconnaissance, he said. However, detecting an enemy spy drone is only the first step. After that, there is a danger that the process of shooting down a Russian UAV will capture another enemy aircraft, which will allow the occupiers to discover the positions of units of the Defense Forces and fire at them. - There is a possibility that another aircraft or with the help of other means can detect the place from which the strike was carried out - whether it was some kind of anti-aircraft system or, if the circumstances allow, small arms, - the spokesman explained. In view of this, it is not always possible to open fire and it is safe for soldiers of the Defense Forces units to shoot down an enemy drone. — Much of the work is now being done to land such drones with the help of electronic warfare. Now we also see that there are cases when our pilots-operators of FPV drones shoot down such enemy aircraft with the help of FPV drones in the air, Ruslan Muzychuk said. The spokesman also reported that last day fighters of the National Guard of Ukraine shot down two UAVs of operational-tactical level -Orlan- in the South. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that the enemy increased the number of flights reconnaissance drones in the Vovchan direction - in recent times, the occupation's air reconnaissance activity has increased here by 40%, and also explained, why the destruction of enemy reconnaissance UAVs is the key to reducing the number of strikes by KABams.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/19/orlan-zala-supercam-chomu-skladno-zbyvaty-vorozhi-drony-rozvidnyky/	2024-09-19T00:51:45-07:00

The man came to the attention of the occupiers because of his pro-Kremlin posts in Telegram channels. There, he was approached by a staff member of the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces (better known as the game) and offered cooperation. On the instructions of a Russian intelligence officer, the agent regularly went around the city and secretly recorded the location of the Defense Forces. Then he marked the corresponding coordinates on Google maps and sent a -report- to his Russian curator via messenger. SBU employees exposed the agent at the initial stage of his intelligence activity, which made it possible to secure the positions of Ukrainian troops in a timely manner. After documenting every step of the suspect's criminal actions, he was detained in his own apartment. During the searches, a mobile phone was seized from the agent, which he used to photograph military objects and communicate with the Russian game.

A collaborator from Luhansk region fantasized about concentration camps in Kursk region	One of such -generators of lies- is the traitor of Ukraine, ex-director of the Luhansk regional state television and radio company Rodion Miroshnyk.

Rodion Miroshnyk of the special assignment of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation published a report -on the situation of the civilian population in the populated areas of the Kursk Region captured by the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation.- According to his data, -the Ukrainian military has created concentration camps in the border zone-.

Miroshnyk's fantasies are another example of -mirroring- information tactics, when the Russians try to accuse Ukraine of war crimes similar to those they themselves have committed since the beginning of the war. As you know, the system of filtration concentration camps was invented and actively used in the occupied Ukrainian territories by the armed forces of the Russian Federation.

Artur Olefirenko currently commands the 1st tank battalion of the separate Siver tank brigade. He started his military career back in 2014. Then he served as a mechanic-driver and fought against the Russians near Luhansk. Later, he decided to become an officer and entered the National Academy of Land Forces named after Hetman Peter Sahaidachny. In 2019, after graduating from university, I took the position of tank platoon commander in the 1st separate tank Siver brigade. - All my service - from platoon commander to battalion commander - I have served in the First Tank and this I'm proud! - says Artur Olefirenko. At the beginning of the large-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, Artur Olefirenko commanded a tank company. They were on the border with Belarus. But later they received an order to retreat to Chernigov and take up defense there. The first tank defended the city together with the 58th brigade named after Hetman Vyhovsky, which fought on the approaches to Chernihiv. At that time, Artur Olefirenka had a group of four T-64BV tanks. I had to work almost around the clock. Huge convoys of Russian vehicles and the practice of tankers against the enemy were remembered. In one of the battles, Artur destroyed a Russian T-72B tank, as well as an enemy BMP. The infantry fighting vehicle burned down along with the crew and landing party. And the crew of the tank was captured. In this tank was the commander of tank battalion 35 of the separate Guards Motorized Rifle Brigade of the Russian Federation, Major Leonid Shchotkin. Schotkin's crew managed to distinguish themselves by shelling a residential building in Chernihiv, for which the Russian major was later sentenced to 11 years in prison. — After the loss of command, the fighting spirit of the Russians disappeared somewhere, and the offensive was stopped, - recalls Artur Olefirenko. For the defense of Chernihiv at that time, Captain Artur Olefirenko was the commander of the 8th tank company of the 3rd tank battalion - received the award -Honorary Citizen of the City of Chernihiv- and the Order of Bohdan Khmelnytsky III degree. After the battles for Chernihiv, the company underwent reconstruction and received Bulat tanks. And again into battle. They fought in almost all areas of the front — near Kharkiv, in the Donetsk, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia regions. — The battles for Lysychansk and Lyman are the most memorable. Then we worked together with paratroopers of the 25th and 81st brigades. There, the company shot down a large amount of Russian equipment — Russian BMP-2s and tanks were on fire, Artur Olefirenko recalls. In 2024, he took command of a tank battalion. - As for a commander, the main thing for me is the motivation of the personnel. So that the tankers understood each other with half a word, so that they were friendly. Our battalion is a big military family. Senior soldiers train the new arrivals, they are helped in this by the battalion management. And we give 100%. It happens that newcomers don't do everything right away, but over time they make up for it, - says Artur Olefirenko. According to him, many soldiers of the battalion who were in battles were awarded both departmental honors and state awards. Replenishment takes place both at the expense of training centers, and they themselves periodically select tankers. In any case, all newcomers undergo training even in the unit itself. - For us, the main thing is to expel the enemy from our Ukraine and for our children to grow up without war, - adds Artur Olefirenko.

Stalker goes to sea: US shipbuilders presented an unmanned surface ship	As stated on the portal of the American manufacturer, Swift Sea-Stalker The S3 is an unmanned (remote or autonomous) small unmanned surface vehicle (sUSV) with high endurance, a strong aluminum hull and a super-powerful diesel engine, according to ArmyInform. Designed for surveillance and interception missions, the S3 USV is designed to operate in difficult waterways in conflict zones, including the Gulf of Africa and South China Sea regions. The S3 can be operated remotely or operate autonomously, providing flexibility and efficiency in maritime operations. Equipped with four AGM-179 Air-to-Ground Missiles (JAGMs) combined in one installation, this maritime drone represents a significant advance in the US Navy's unmanned maritime capabilities. The maritime drone has a top speed of more than 56 km/h, an effective range of 1,000 nautical miles, and the ability to continuously perform tasks for about 40 hours, ensuring long-term operational capabilities. These features enable it to effectively monitor and respond to threats along its coastlines, increasing security at sea. The Yanmar 4LV230 230hp (3800RPM) engine provided for this craft is available in two different powerplants: propeller driven and jet powered. It complies with NATO standardization agreements (STANAG) 4586 and the protocol of the common architecture of unmanned aerial vehicles systems (JAUS). The Marine UAV is capable of carrying a maximum payload of 1,500 pounds (680 kg). For control, the Swift Sea-Stalker S3 drone is equipped with radar/EO/GPS/AIS/ and COTS sensors. Swiftships recently received a contract from the Pentagon to manufacture the S3 USV. -We are proud to support the US Department of Defense's mission to protect its waters and protect vital maritime interests,- Swiftships said. -The delivery of the S3 USV is a significant step forward in achieving future maritime security goals.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/19/stalker-vyhodyt-v-more-sudnobudivnyky-ssha-predstavyly-bezpilotnyj-nadvodnyj-korabel/	2024-09-18T20:10:09-07:00
The F-16 is invincible in air combat, but there was one exception	ArmyInform tells about which plane was able to confirm the downing of an F-16 during a real aerial battle. The circumstances of the incident were reconstructed, so the dogfight can be viewed on video. Reconstruction of air battle between Greek and Turkish fighter jets The battle took place on October 8, 1996 in the context of the Aegean dispute - a conflict between Greece and Turkey over sovereignty and adjacent rights in the Aegean Sea and airspace spaces above it. Read also: F-16s were in Ukraine long before August 2024: Americans piloted together with Ukrainians However, for a long time none of the parties officially recognized the fact, and only more than one and a half ten years later, Turkey acknowledged the loss of one of its F-16s as a result of a Greek fighter jet being shot down by a missile. On the other hand, Greece has never officially acknowledged the downing of an F-16 fighter of the Turkish Air Force. It is known from open sources that the incident occurred during the Greek-Cypriot -Nikiphoros- exercises and the simultaneous exercises of the Turkish Air Force. It is reasonable to assume that the exercises were deliberately conducted simultaneously to disrupt the armed forces of a neighboring country. Read also: How the F-16 shot down the Russian -Sushka-: about the historic battle and why Kursk is here During the Turkish exercises, four F4 Phantom bombers moved to the southwest in the area between the islands Chios and Samos of the Aegean Sea. The bombers were accompanied by a pair of F-16 fighters. When the Greek military saw Turkish planes on radar, they raised a pair of fighter jets to identify and intercept the identified targets. Ultimately, this led to the downing of one of the Turkish F-16s. Read also: Two F-16s collide during simulated combat, one pilot survives: from NATO history When a pair of Hellas fighters went out to intercept, one of the Turkish F-16s, according to some claims , entered Greek airspace in the area of ​​the island of Chios. One of the Greek pilots immediately attacked, firing an R550 Magic II -Mazhik- missile at the intruder. The Magic R.550 is a close-range air-to-air missile from the French company Matra. It was developed in 1965 to compete with the American AIM-9 Sidewinder missile. Read also: F-16 -stormed- so fast that slow electronics couldn't cope: test video explains everything Magic R.550 made compatible with Sidewinder launch equipment, so it could be launched, in particular, from F-16 fighters. However, this time the missile was launched by another air fighter. It was as French as the missile, the Dassault Mirage 2000, a fourth-generation multirole jet fighter. Developed in the 1970s by Dassault Aviation, it became the main combat aircraft of the French Air Force in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Read also: Accidentally flew into the air. The incident that could put an end to the F-16 project Greece purchased from France and put the Mirage 2000 into service in the late 1980s, so by the mid-1990s Greek pilots already had many years of experience operating these fighters. After the defeat, one of the Turkish pilots died, but the second was able to eject successfully. Later, he was picked up by Greek rescuers. In Turkey, the fact of the loss of an F-16 fighter as a result of a battle with a Greek Mirage 2000 was recognized only in 2012. This was done by Turkish Defense Minister Ismet Yilmaz. In response to a parliamentary inquiry, a Turkish official said that on October 8, 1996, a Turkish F-16D Block 40 was shot down by a Greek Mirage 2000 using an R.550 Magic II missile. Despite the fact that Greece did not recognize the fact that the F-16 was shot down by a Mirage 2000 missile, in Turkey, the relatives of the dead F-16 pilot sued the Greek officer who piloted the Mirage 2000. This caused one of the many exacerbations in Greek-Turkish relations, about which was written with indignation in the media of both countries. The French began promoting their Mirage 2000 fighter as -the only plane that can shoot down an F-16.- Earlier, ArmyInform reported that France will provide Ukraine with Mirage 2000 aircraft and provide staffing of the Ukrainian army brigade.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/19/f-16-neperemozhnyj-u-povitryanomu-boyu-ale-stavsya-yedynyj-vynyatok/	2024-09-18T20:06:00-07:00
Battle for Pokrovsk: about fortifications, enemy losses and what does the weather have to do with it	What are the possible scenarios of the development of events in this direction and will the Ukrainian defenders be able to crush the offensive potential of the occupiers? Military expert Petro Chernyk told ArmyInform about this. — Is the task before the Russians to seize the Pokrovskoe-Myronograd agglomeration in a strategic sense? Of course, there is such a task. Why? This is the next link in the strategy that they are considering - access to the administrative borders of Donetsk region and Luhansk region. Indeed, they are somewhere within 10 kilometers of Pokrovsk. In fact, the enemy already has full-fledged barrel artillery there. Let's say the D-30 howitzer has a strike range of 15 kilometers, while their longest-range systems such as Hyacinth, Msta B, Acacia work at 28 kilometers. Yes, indeed, heavy artillery duels are already taking place on this part of the front. — But there are several important nuances. Let's recall Bakhmut. The active phase of the Battle of Bakhmut is 10 months. That's a lot. One PVK -Wagner- lost about 22 thousand killed there. If, relatively speaking, the battle begins in September-October, it will be long-lasting, heavy and bloody for the occupiers. Why? The so-called wet weather season is approaching, rains are expected in autumn. The enemy will not be able to use heavy tracked vehicles, such as tanks, BMP from flanking positions, from the field. There will be only large infantry ramparts. And large infantry ramparts are very, very difficult even for Rashist infantry to move on a wet field. Also, mining the terrain on our side. This is all they have to go through. The expert adds that the same reasoning applies to Avdiivka. Avdiivka was stormed by the Russians for almost 10 years, starting in 2014, just as the war in Donbas began. And this year alone, the active phase of fighting for this Ukrainian city lasted more than four months. During this period alone, the Russian army lost almost 50,000 soldiers. Petro Chernyk emphasizes that battles can be lost. Even if we have to leave Pokrovsk, it will not be a disaster. — I really like historical parallels. The Battle of Poitiers is one of the greatest victories of the English in the Hundred Years' War, which was won in 1356 over the French. Then the English captured the French king, but in the end, England just lost the war. And there is one more nuance. The enemy now has a huge personnel problem. He is able to mobilize up to 30-32 thousand per month, but he can't do more at the moment. During this summer alone, the Defense Forces of Ukraine destroyed more than 107,000 Russians. And here, as I call it, the pre-emptive extermination of even 2-3 thousand enemy personnel is a very important and principled issue. I do not cancel the battle for Pokrovsk. It (this battle. - Ed.) is extremely important, but I don't think it will be an easy walk for the occupiers. Perhaps the battle for the Pokrov-Myrnograd agglomeration will be the battle that will ultimately undermine the combat potential of Russian troops. How the Germans once undermined their strategic offensive potential during the ten-month standoff with the French at Verdun in 1916. Of course, time will tell. — In the spring, the government allocated more than 20 billion hryvnias for the construction of fortifications of defense lines. Defense lines continue to be built near Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad. The expert adds that -this is a continuous process.- Of course, the construction of fortifications, with problems, with human factors, mistakes and the like, is not without this, but they are still being built. And the enemy will have to reckon with it. — In addition, the process of saturating the units of the Defense Forces with weapons is currently underway. Chernyk says, at the beginning of the Great War, the Americans produced 14,000 shells of 155 caliber per month. And now they have already confirmed that now, for the fall, they reached the figure of 50 thousand shells. This is a very good step forward. Also, the Czech armed initiative to help Ukraine was fully operational. — Recall that at the beginning of the large-scale invasion, the ratio of artillery volleys was 1 to 10, 1 to 15, and sometimes 1 to 20. Now even the Russians say that there are moments and locations when we (Ukrainian Defense Forces . — Ed.) in parity, and sometimes there are more artillery volleys than they have. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/19/bytva-za-pokrovsk-pro-fortyfikacziyi-vtraty-voroga-ta-do-chogo-tut-pogoda/	2024-09-18T20:00:05-07:00
They were scared by a drone, shot with a machine gun - a trap for the enemy from our fighters	The video appeared on September 18 on the group's channel. The assault group of Russians hid in a barn. Our FPV drone flew there. After the explosion, those Russians who could walk ran away. Two invaders ran right at our machine gun and were shot at close range. As reported by ArmyInform, the pilots of Tactical Group -Adam- made a selection destruction of Russian attack aircraft that never reached our positions.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/18/nalyakaly-dronom-zastrelyly-z-kulemeta-pastka-dlya-voroga-vid-nashyh-bijcziv/	2024-09-18T12:07:34-07:00
The Russians use UAVs for delivery in the Kharkiv Region: the Armed Forces oppose	Vitaliy Sarantsev, the spokesman of OTU -Kharkiv-, told about this on the air of the nationwide telethon -Edyny Novyni- . — The opponent is trying to apply it. In particular, this was also the case in Vovchansk, when with the help of drones they deliver provisions and ammunition to blocked servicemen on the territory of the Aggregate Plant. They also tried to provide those units that perform tasks near Lyptsi or Lukyantsi, he said. The spokesman explained that these are mostly UAVs capable of carrying a certain load weighing up to several kilograms. Thus, the enemy is trying to carry out logistical support measures, that is, to deliver water, provisions, and ammunition. -However, it is going very badly for him, at least in the direction of Hlyboky-Lyptsy, because there we have strengthened certain measures and, in connection with this, logistical support of the enemy's forward positions is almost not happening,- the spokesman said. He noted that he will not reveal all the secrets live, but noted that the Defense Forces are effectively countering the enemy in this regard. At the same time, the occupiers intensified aerial reconnaissance with the aim of finding new supply routes, places of possible basing and setting up positions, as well as identifying units of the Defense Forces and subsequently inflicting fire damage on them. — As for the location and the direction of Liptsi-Hlyboke, we notice a certain lull in the enemy's activity there, but this does not mean that he has abandoned his intentions. He is strengthening there, he is carrying out fortification equipment for his positions, he is bringing in additional personnel there, - Vitaly Sarantsev said. This means that the enemy has not given up its aggressive intentions and plans to resume offensive actions. — The most difficult situation remains in Vovchansk itself, where fighting is constantly going on where the enemy is trying to advance in different areas of the city. In particular, in the areas of high-rise buildings, he is trying to carry out assaults in some places with the support of light armored vehicles. However, he does not manage to do all this, said the spokesman of Kharkiv OTU. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in the Vovchan direction, the occupiers increased the number of reconnaissance drone flights, increasing air reconnaissance by about 40% compared to the previous period.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/18/bpla-dlya-postachannya-zastosovuyut-rosiyany-na-harkivshhyni-zsu-protydiyut/	2024-09-18T11:57:01-07:00

But the assault of the Russians ended before it had even begun. First, the enemy was hit by FPV drones and drops. Those who remained alive tried to escape, but in vain. One of the invaders decided to pretend to be dead, but our drones did not believe him. Then the Russian -helped- himself with early demobilization with his own machine gun. As reported by ArmyInform, fighters of the 24th mechanized brigade named after King Danylo filmed the remains of Chasovoy Yar, which the Russians continue to storm and erase from the face of the earth with all possible types of weapons: artillery, mines, rockets, kamikaze drones and anti-tank missiles.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/18/forsuvaly-kanal-potrapyly-na-toj-svit-znyshhennya-voroga-bilya-chasovogo-yaru/	2024-09-18T11:46:10-07:00
Mines are dropped from drones: the Armed Forces explained why the Russians mine the area in the Khar...	Does this indicate the enemy's refusal of offensive operations on the air of the nationwide telethon -Edyny Novyny- explained the spokesman of OTU -Kharkiv- Vitaly Sarantsev. — They are not mining a continuous territory, but are conducting reconnaissance of possible routes for the advancement of our forces, and on these possible routes they are dropping mines. They are dropping a PFM-1 mine, the so-called Petal, he said. Recently, the fighters of the units of the Defense Forces also discovered new anti-personnel mines, which were probably made in an artisanal way. - Recently, it was noticed that they are trying to use a new type of ammunition - a mine, the body of which is made on a 3D printer. It is made of plastic, that is, it does not have increased electromagnetic sensitivity. Inside it is filled with TNT, has a detonator, the spokesman said. It is precisely such mines that the Russian occupiers scatter on the routes of the possible advance of units of the Defense Forces. — This is done with the help of UAVs. I won't say it's a systemic thing, but it means the opponent needs more time to prepare for a counterattack. In this way, they are trying to restrain the possible advance of units of the Defense Forces, Vitaly Sarantsev explained. At the same time, he emphasized that the Russian occupiers have not given up their aggressive intentions. They move and accumulate personnel, reform and reformat assault groups, attempt to establish a system of command, communication and supply in order to build up forces and resume offensive operations. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that occupiers began to scatter anti-personnel mines of a new type in the north of Kharkiv region, which in principle, the actions are similar to the prohibited PFM-1 -Petal- mine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/18/miny-skydayut-z-droniv-v-zsu-poyasnyly-navishho-rosiyany-minuyut-misczevist-na-harkivshhyni/	2024-09-18T11:32:09-07:00

When the smoke after the heavy smoke cleared, it turned out that there were no bodies of the occupiers left at the site of the explosion. The pilots had to search for their remains in the bushes. As reported by ArmyInform, the pilots of the 1st Assault Battalion of the 92nd Assault Brigade named after Kosh Ataman Ivan Sirk spotted and hit a pile of enemy ammunition stacked in the open air, or rather, under a tree.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/18/na-konczert-kobzona-nashi-shturmovyky-provely-teleportacziyu-dvoh-okupantiv/	2024-09-18T11:24:07-07:00

Transferred -to foot feed-: in Kharkiv Oblast, the occupiers poisoned themselves due to a lack of pr...	The reasons for the mass poisoning of the Russian occupiers on the air of the national telethon -Edyni Novyni- explained the spokesman of OTU -Kharkiv- Vitaly Sarantsev. — The reasons are quite simple. For several days, the personnel of the enemy, who are in the forward positions, will not receive either provisions or water. Because of this, he is forced to switch to foot feed, he said. Forced to feed themselves, the occupiers often consume poor-quality water and food. - He is forced to drink water from streams or from wells. Earlier, we reported that in some places the enemy does not take away their dead, due to which there is a complication of the sanitary-epidemiological situation, the spokesman explained. So the situation is complicated by the fact that in some places the enemy does not evacuate irreversible losses, so the bodies of the dead Russian soldiers decompose and poison the area. — A certain amount of something gets into the ground, into the water. This is all the enemy is trying to consume. This leads to the fact that the personnel who drank or used this water, where there are other needs, develop gastrointestinal disorders. There are no corresponding medicines either. This worsens, in addition to everything else, the enemy's morale, which is why we note cases of more frequent surrenders, - said Vitaly Sarantsev. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that massed stomach disorder knocked off the feet of the occupiers in Kharkiv Oblast and that zdavatysya-v-polon/->logistics -in manual mode- forces the Russian invaders to surrender as prisoners.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/18/perevely-na-pidnozhnyj-korm-na-harkivshhyni-okupanty-potruyilysya-cherez-nestachu-proviziyi/	2024-09-18T10:49:12-07:00
An analogue of the forbidden -Lepestka-: the occupiers are installing new mines in Kharkiv Oblast	This was notified in Kharkiv OTU. These are pressure mines that have a body printed on a 3D printer. Inside the case is a detonator and a plastid charge. -In terms of size and principle of action, the new mines are similar to the PFM-1 -Petal- mine banned by international conventions. Their small size and unpredictable nature make them extremely insidious,- Kharkiv OTU emphasized. There are currently no reliable data on the scalability of the production of these mines in the Russian Federation. It can be assumed that the appearance of such mines may be the result of the private initiative of individual manufacturers. Despite the relative ease of making such mines, they pose a serious threat to the lives of our defenders. In connection with the new danger in the -Kharkiv- OTU, they called for increased caution in the combat zones and in the liberated territories. Earlier, ArmiyaInform reported that the Armed Forces of Ukraine explained why are Russian inhumans executing Ukrainian prisoners.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/18/analog-zaboronenogo-lepestka-na-harkivshhyni-okupanty-vstanovlyuyut-novi-miny/	2024-09-18T10:44:16-07:00
From raising children to aiding the occupiers: a kindergarten worker was convicted in Kharkiv	This was notified in the Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office. An employee of one of the Kharkiv kindergartens has been an active participant in pro-Russian chats in the Telegram messenger since September 2023. There, the woman wrote comments in which she denied the armed aggression of the Russian Federation and discredited the defenders of our state, claiming that they are the ones who strike the civilian infrastructure of the regional center. In addition, while communicating with an acquaintance who lives in the Russian Federation, the woman gave him information about the locations of the Ukrainian military on the territory of Kharkiv. This information was not published in open access. Law enforcement officers exposed the woman at the end of March this year at her place of residence and seized evidence of her illegal activities. The accused was awaiting trial while in custody. During the trial, she fully admitted her guilt and repented of what she had done. The court found the woman guilty of disseminating information about the location of military formations formed in accordance with the laws of Ukraine, committed under martial law, as well as manufacturing and disseminating materials that contain denials of armed aggression by the Russian Federation against Ukraine. The court sentenced the woman to 5 years in prison. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that a Russian policeman and his Ukrainian posipaka will be tried in Kharkiv Oblast for that during the occupation they tortured Ukraine's defender.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/18/vid-vyhovannya-ditej-do-posobnycztva-okupantam-u-harkovi-zasudyly-praczivnyczyu-dytsadka/	2024-09-18T10:34:53-07:00
There is a very important result for last night on the territory of Russia — the President	The President stated this in appeals of September 18. -There is a very important result for last night on the territory of Russia. These are the things that weaken the enemy. I thank everyone involved! Such aptness that inspires! Our special services: Security Service, GUR, Special Operations Forces thank you!- said Volodymyr Zelenskyi. According to him, today there were two reports of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, General Oleksandr Syrskyi. -At first, there was a long report about all directions of our actions, our defense, our offensive steps.

We will keep the situation on our bridgehead within the limits of calculations,- the President noted. According to him, maximum attention is also paid to directions in Kharkiv region and Donetsk region. -We are working on strengthening, and this is in terms of weapons and personnel. Today, I spoke with the Minister of Finance of Ukraine and the Secretary of the National Security Council regarding funds for key state needs, for defense. We have to provide everything that Ukraine needs,- said Volodymyr Zelenskyi. According to him, the priority is not only to implement everything that has already been agreed upon and that is currently stalled at the logistics stage, but also more strategic things. -We have clear tasks for the selection of teams: this is equipment, this is training. All the promises regarding air defense, which were made during the summit in Washington, have not yet been fully fulfilled. And it is important right now, right at the beginning of autumn, to have more results for the air shield,- the President noted.

The authors of the gun convoys with explosives: traitors from Luhansk region will be sentenced in ab...	This was notified by the Security Service of Ukraine. There, they collected the evidence base for three more collaborators who cooperate with the Russian Federation on the temporarily captured part of the territory of Luhansk region. We are talking about Yevgeny Katsavalov, the head of the occupation administration of the -MNS LNR- and his two -deputies- - Vitaly Kucherov and Roman Kochetov. After their appointment to -positions- in 2023, the individuals involved began to follow the instructions of the Kremlin regarding the logistical support of the occupation groups of the Russian Federation fighting on the eastern front. In particular, they organized the transfer of combat FPV drones from Russia to the occupiers on the front lines. To disguise military routes, the collaborators carried out the transportation of UAVs by trucks under the guise of -humanitarian aid- for the civilian population of the frontline areas. At the same time, enemy accomplices transported ammunition and military ammunition to the Russian troops in such -gumconvoys-. -In addition, the collaborators organized the production of explosive devices for drones, which the Rashists use to attack advanced units of the Defense Forces of Ukraine. Collaborators often -report- about this during speeches on the airs of rosZMI, where they also call on the civilian population of the temporarily occupied areas of Luhansk region to support the war against Ukraine. For his cooperation, Putin awarded Katsavalov the rank of -Lieutenant General of the Internal Service- by decree, the SBU said. On the basis of the received evidence, the investigators of the Security Service informed all three collaborators in absentia about the suspicion under Part 5 of Art. 111-1 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (voluntary occupation by a citizen of Ukraine of a position related to the performance of organizational-administrative or administrative-economic functions in illegal authorities created in the temporarily occupied territory, including in the occupation administration of the aggressor state).

A new food supply model for the Armed Forces: what is known	The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine informed about this on September 18. The principle and goal of the new model is to reduce logistics in delivery and increase quality control. The MOU studied the practice of partners from Great Britain and involved expert opinions from other NATO agencies, the USA and Canada in order to implement the best practices in the Ukrainian model. -We are introducing a two-tier quality control system. The additional stage is at the distribution centers,- said the Deputy Minister of Defense. According to him, representatives of the DOT, the Ministry of Defense and suppliers check the quality of products. Only after that they are sent to military units. -For the first time, the State operator of the rear will select producers of 75% of the catalog food product through so-called signal tenders on the Prozorro system. That is, those products that are most often used are ordered by military units,- Dmytro Klimenkov said. According to him, these are meat, fish, canned goods, cereals, dairy products, etc. Suppliers will sign contracts with manufacturers. -DOT-Chain will implement a so-called black list, where suppliers who do not properly fulfill their contractual obligations will be noted,- he added. This model will be launched as a pilot project from February 2025 and will operate within a year in Kyiv, Vinnytsia, as well as in Zhytomyr, Cherkasy, Kyiv and Kirovohrad regions. No additional funds are required for this pilot project. It will be implemented exclusively with the money provided for the purchase of food products for the Armed Forces of Ukraine. One of the goals of this model is transparent reporting. Each stage of the procurement and supply process will be recorded in an electronic system. All processes and responsibilities of each party will be written there: from the customer to the contractor, from the application to the fact of delivery. -This will allow, first of all, to monitor and quickly respond to challenges and problems. The second is that it will contribute to the prevention of corruption, it will increase the responsibility of each party, and most importantly, we will receive information, analytics on the volumes and terms of supply,- Dmytro Klimenkov explained. As reported by ArmyInform, DOT-Chain is a unique digital system for managing food supply processes for the army. The system shortens the product supply cycle by 4 times and improves quality control.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/18/nova-model-postachannya-harchovyh-produktiv-dlya-zsu-shho-vidomo/	2024-09-18T09:24:34-07:00

The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine informed about this on September 18. -We have completed the first stage of procurement reform for the Armed Forces.

Overwhelm -Orlana-: how we manage to destroy Russian UAVs	Military expert Petro Chernyk answered this question. — The enemy has now begun to lose many more unmanned aerial systems, especially high-altitude ones, which fly at an altitude of several kilometers. First of all, it is about their most massive reconnaissance unmanned complex -Orlan-10-, the expert notes. And he adds that a really breakthrough moment happened in the middle of this summer: - Our radio electronic struggle increased by an order of magnitude. The phenomenon consists in the fact that we managed not only to increase the production of the required amount (of REB means - Ed.), but also to greatly reduce its cost. The breakthrough did happen. And the state should be thanked for the fact that, by law, a number of restrictions were removed from the components that come to Ukraine. The second reason for the increase in the enemy's losses of operational-tactical UAVs is the improvement of the operation of portable anti-aircraft missile systems of various classes and types. — These are the same FIM-92 Stinger or excellent RBS-70 complexes, which have proven themselves very well&#8230; And we should mention one more unique thing - kamikaze drones: we have learned to use them to climb to great heights to enemy UAVs and destroy them, says a military expert. And he concludes that the three components he listed are what allowed our Defense Forces to raise the enemy UAV destruction rate so high. But Petro Chernyk advises not to be enchanted: — Because in the area of ​​radio-electronic warfare, the enemy has the second school in the world. He also knows how to work with REEs. And microelectronics can be obtained on world markets. He learns and learns quite quickly&#8230; At the same time, the expert notes that the level of destruction by our Defense Forces of such a number of operational-tactical level enemy UAVs is a truly unique phenomenon that has not yet occurred in this war. — If I had been told a year ago that it would be possible to approach the Orlan-10 with the help of another drone, and a smaller one, it would have only made me smile.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/18/zavalyty-orlana-yak-nam-vdayetsya-nyshhyty-rosijski-bpla/	2024-09-17T20:33:14-07:00
29 months of captivity. The history of the struggle, capture and return of the Hero of Ukraine Vikto...	During the battles for surrounded Mariupol, on April 11, 2022, Viktor Ivchuk was awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine by the Decree of President Volodymyr Zelenskyi. And the very next day, April 12, Ivchuk was captured by the Russian Federation. The story of the officer's combat journey and resilience, 29 months of captivity and his return home is in the ArmyInform material. A military man originally from Vinnytsia. Studied at Mykola Pirogov Vinnytsia National Medical University. 2014 year. An officer in the 95th separate airborne assault brigade of the Armed Forces participated in battles in the east of our country. At that time, he was the head of the medical service. The fighting was heavy and intense, so Ivchuk, together with his comrades, provided first aid to wounded soldiers and civilians, and carried out their evacuation. On July 27, 2014, during the assault on the Savur Tomb, the officer received a shrapnel gunshot wound to the right hand. But, despite this, he organized a real special operation, thanks to which it was possible to evacuate 60 wounded from the battlefield. For this, Ivchuk was awarded the Order of Bohdan Khmelnytsky III degree. For several years, he held the post of deputy head of the military hospital in Dnipro, while simultaneously studying for a master's degree at the Ukrainian Military Medical Academy. A month before the beginning of the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation, Colonel Ivchuk was transferred from Kyiv to Mariupol and appointed to the position of commander of the 555th military hospital. The hospital continued its work even after February 24, 2022, despite constant shelling by Russian troops. Until March 16, when the last building of the institution was destroyed by bombing at the same time as the Mariupol Drama Theater, where hundreds of civilians were hiding. Thanks to the efforts of hospital doctors, hundreds of lives of the defenders of Mariupol and its residents were saved. They worked despite everything, although operations had to be carried out under fire, in basements, in helmets and body armor. In March 2022, a bomb hit the hospital - the facility was targeted by the enemy. All the medical personnel, together with the wounded, divided into two groups. The first one was to join the Ukrainian military at Azovstal. The other, including Commander Viktor Ivchuk, went to the Ilyich metallurgical plant. On April 11, 2022, the head of the Mariupol military hospital, colonel of the medical service, Viktor Ivchuk, was awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine with the award of the -Golden Star- order. -On April 11, 2022, by the decree of President Volodymyr Zelensky, my husband was awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine. In the morning, I received telephone greetings, and I knew nothing about the decree - it was not at all before that. The next day I received a message from an unknown number: -We are being taken prisoner.- I had a mixed feeling. On the one hand, she was happy that her husband was still alive, albeit in captivity. At that time, no one even imagined what Russian captivity was. On the other hand, it was very infuriating that the occupiers, contrary to the norms of international humanitarian law and the Geneva Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners of War, forcibly deprived the doctors of their freedom. They should have let them go! But no. They said they would trade them for their military,- recalls Victoria Ivchuk. The wife remembers the last phone conversation with her husband at the beginning of April 22nd - he was saying goodbye to her and her son. What followed were 29 long months of enemy captivity. According to his wife (and she was told this by military men who had been released from captivity earlier), the leadership of the colony in Olenivka allowed our medics, including Viktor, to treat and care for the wounded, whom they took out of Mariupol. But when the terrorist attack happened, they were not allowed to join the victims. People were burning alive, but no one was saving them. And a year after that tragedy in Olenivka, his wife Viktoria received a letter with a stamp of the Russian post office on the envelope. In the envelope was a piece of paper with a few lines: -I'm fine.- She recognized Victor's handwriting. But there was no date in the letter - it was difficult to understand when it was written. As it turned out later, shortly after the prisoners were taken from Olenivka to Stary Oskol, the colony distributed to everyone the same pieces of paper with the identical text: -Everything is fine with me.- Victoria, together with the families of captured and missing doctors, created the public organization -Military Doctors of Ukraine-, which included relatives of prisoners from Kherson region, Donetsk region, and Kharkiv region. Together, they gathered all the information related to the prisoners, which was transmitted by the relevant authorities. The NGO cooperates with governmental, human rights and public organizations. Has its own site. In June of this year, Victoria and other women, whose relatives defended Mariupol and are illegally held in Russian torture camps, had an audience with the Pope and asked him to facilitate the release of Ukrainian prisoners of war. During the meeting, Victoria Ivchuk presented the pontiff with a symbolic medical gown with photos of captured doctors. The officer returned to Ukraine after the exchange on September 13, 2024. His son, wife, parents and brother were waiting for him. Photos from Victoria Ivchuk's personal archive and from open sources	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/18/29-misyacziv-nevoli-istoriya-borotby-polonu-j-povernennya-geroya-ukrayiny-viktora-ivchuka/	2024-09-17T20:21:49-07:00
Wounded in battle: about payments to defenders during treatment	ArmyInform explains when and what wounded defenders can receive and why payments may stop. By the way, currently all social guarantees also apply to those military personnel who perform combat missions outside Ukraine - on the territory of the aggressor state. In the event of injury to a military serviceman, the payment of financial support for the last position held for the entire period of treatment is preserved. Currently it can continue not more than 12 consecutive months. Here we are talking about the time a military man spends in hospitals or hospitals, as well as medical leave. This usually takes several months. If there is a need for longer treatment, then no later than 4 months after the start of treatment, you need to undergo VLC. It is on the basis of this decision that the payment of financial support should continue in the future. Tip: During the entire period of treatment or medical leave, stay in touch with your immediate commander and report any changes. Our own experience shows that this prevents payment problems. This payment is included in the list of additional rewards. In the army, it is better known as -combat-. She is also a wounded soldier assigned. But there are certain nuances. When is it paid? Now about the nuances. The basis for this payment is a certificate about the circumstances of the injury (injury, contusion, mutilation), so-called form 5. It must be provided in a military unit. And it must be stated that the injury is related to the defense of the Motherland. If there is no such wording in the certificate, then the money will most likely not be credited. The certificate must also state that the serviceman was wearing personal protective equipment, did not commit a criminal offense, did not attempt to injure himself, and was not under the influence of alcohol or drugs. All the listed items are grounds for refusing to pay additional compensation. One more nuance. After discharge from the hospital, the -combat- 100,000 should continue to be paid only if you are sent on leave for treatment due to a serious injury. This should be spelled out in the conclusion of the VLK. If the injury is not serious, then the payment of 100,000 is stopped. It is also worth remembering that this additional reward is calculated in proportion to the number of days. That is, as well as -combat- (for example, if you were in the hospital for 20 days, then the additional reward will be approximately 65 thousand hryvnias). If additional reward after wounding is not paid, then a report should be written in the name of the commander for inclusion in the order for payment of additional reward and a copy of the certificate of wounding should be attached to this report. If the payment is refused, and you consider it illegal, you can contact the hotline of the Ministry of Defense or lawyers. Case law shows that, as a rule, military personnel are still credited with all guaranteed benefits, if there are grounds for this. Wounding of servicemen is one of the grounds for the payment of material assistance for solving social and household issues. This is defined by decision of the Minister of Defense dated September 16 January 2024. Such assistance may be paid once a year in the amount of a monthly allowance. More about how to get this help can be read here. If the injury resulted in disability or partial loss of working capacity, in this case you can also count on one-time cash assistance. Its size depends on the established disability group and the subsistence minimum for able-bodied persons, which is revised every year. If the disability occurred as a result of an injury during the performance of military service duties, then the following payment amounts have been established in 2024: One-time assistance is provided not only in the event of injury during the performance of military service duties, but also , who received a disability during military service as a result of illness or injury. The amount of the benefit also depends on the set disability group: A one-time benefit is provided in case of partial disability. The Medical and Social Expert Commission (MSEK) must establish the degree of disability in percentage. The amount of payment will depend on the established degree. For servicemen who are partially disabled due to injury (contusion, trauma or mutilation), illness during the performance of military service duties, the basic amount from which the amount of payment will be calculated is 211,960 hryvnias. For example, if the MSEK established a 20% loss of working capacity for you, then the one-time benefit amount will be UAH 42,392. Finally, one more piece of advice: keep all medical documents (form No. 100, conclusions of VLK, MSEK, certificate on the circumstances of the injury, etc.). Without them, it will be very problematic to prove your right to payments later.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/18/poranennya-v-boyu-pro-vyplaty-zahysnykam-pid-chas-likuvannya/	2024-09-17T20:13:59-07:00
There is fake creativity in the swamps again: screenshots of fake orders of the Ministry of Defense ...	So, recently, a photo of order No. 274t dated September 4, 2024, allegedly from the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, has been circulating on the Internet, in which, with the aim of -following European values-, they order to create special conditions of service for -servicemen representing LGBTQ+-. Also, full-time psychologists of military units are supposed to conduct testing of personnel for belonging to these communities. The so-called document is fake, as is its content. First, the -order- does not meet the requirements of official record keeping. Secondly, the Chief of the General Staff cannot sign the order of the Ministry of Defense. Thirdly, the content of the fake document contradicts at least the Constitution of Ukraine and several laws. In addition, this is not the first time that Russian fakers have tried to ridicule and humiliate LGBT+ representatives, including the military. In the face of a large-scale invasion, Russia describes itself as a territory for everyone who believes exclusively in -traditional values.- And Ukraine is trying to be shown as a country where the authorities are forcibly engaged in -LGBTzation- of citizens. In this way, the aggressor country demonstrates its disdain for the democratic system, opposing it to the -Russian measure-.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/18/na-bolotah-znovu-fejkokreatyv-v-soczmerezhah-gulyayut-skriny-pidroblenyh-nakaziv-minoborony-pro-lgbt/	2024-09-17T20:00:25-07:00

-I will not step back-: Stalin's order is read to the occupiers in the Kharkiv region	About this in an interview for ArmyInform told the spokesman of the -Kharkiv- OTU, Colonel Vitaly Sarantsev. — In the Kharkiv direction, cases are known when the commanders of the occupiers read order No. 227 in front of the formation, using it as an additional motivational tool, he said. According to the spokesman, this indicates that Russians identify the events of the Second World War with modern aggression against Ukraine. They believe that they are continuing the heroic struggle against fascism and Nazism. - They connect all this into a single whole with modern events. This simplifies the perception of the conflict by Russians, as they are forced to believe that Ukraine is not a victim of aggression, but a continuation of the same -fascism- that their grandfathers fought against, Vitaly Sarantsev explained. More about it read in ArmiyaInform's long interview with Vitaliy Sarantseva.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/17/ny-shagu-nazad-stalinskyj-nakaz-zachytuyut-okupantam-na-harkivshhyni/	2024-09-17T10:44:16-07:00

The Armed Forces explained why Russian inhumans execute Ukrainian prisoners	About this in an interview for ArmyInform told Colonel Vitaly Sarantsev, spokesman of the Kharkiv Technical University. The occupiers closely monitor the reaction of Ukrainians to the war crimes of the Russian military, collect comments, and then show their own servicemen what they are called to do with them in captivity. — The case with the 155th Marine Infantry Brigade of the Russian Federation, when they put the head of a Ukrainian soldier separated from his body on a stake and bragged about it on video, proves just that. Of course, this provoked quite outrageous comments on social networks, with calls for the same treatment of Russian prisoners. The propagandists of the Russian Federation collect all these posts (made, in particular, not by Ukrainians themselves, but by Russian bots) and use them for information and propaganda work both among civilians and among the Russian military. In this way, they show, they say, this is what will happen to those who surrender to captivity, the spokesman explained. In addition, the Russians hope to provoke or stage similar war crimes already on the part of the Ukrainian military in order to influence both the Russians and Ukraine's foreign partners with the goal of depriving Ukrainians of international support. More about it read in ArmiyaInform's long interview with Vitaliy Sarantseva.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/17/u-zsu-poyasnyly-navishho-rosijski-nelyudy-strachuyut-ukrayinskyh-polonenyh/	2024-09-17T10:03:44-07:00

Instead, those servicemen who were freed due to such rotations are redirected by the Russian command directly to conduct offensive actions. At the same time, conscripts who perform special tasks to ensure logistics on the territory of the Russian Federation are in the same risk zone as any other servicemen of the Russian army. — We inflict fire damage on the enemy, wherever he is.

They are promised a powerful social package so that they have already moved to another status and they can be involved in directly conducting hostilities, the military explained.

Logistics - in manual mode - in Kharkiv Oblast forces the occupiers to surrender	Vitaly Sarantsev, the spokesman of OTU -Kharkiv-, reported this on the -Suspilne Novosti- broadcast. Cases when the enemy surrenders in the Kharkiv direction have become more frequent. Yesterday, there were two Russian prisoners in the north of Kharkiv region, and today four occupiers surrendered. — The adversary is forced to find new routes for logistics, to change logistics methods. If earlier he used the technique in some places, now he does all this exclusively in manual mode, that is, he carries everything by hand, he said. This situation arose as a result of the successful actions of the Defense Forces, primarily fighters from the UAV units, who broke the supply chains in the enemy's near rear with the help of bomber drones and kamikaze drones. — An opponent who has been in advanced positions for a long time does not receive adequate support. We manage to break the logistics chains and, accordingly, they sit without food, without water. Of course, this in a certain way affects their moral and psychological state and they prefer to surrender themselves to captivity than to return to their commanders, to the inhumane treatment that is organized in them directly in the places, the spokesman explained. The military emphasized that the motivational measures for the personnel of the Russian occupying forces by the enemy command have the opposite effect to what the Russians wanted. — They only contribute to the enemy losing faith in the military and political leadership and, accordingly, they choose the right path for themselves in terms of surrendering, — Vitaly Sarantsev concluded. The spokesman said that cases of desertion of the Russian military are currently observed in several areas of the Kharkiv direction - in the Vovchansk region, near Hlyboky and Lukyantsi. -The personnel have a certain percentage of demoralization and refuse to follow orders, refuse to carry out combat missions, refuse to carry out special tasks of casualty evacuation or logistical support,- he said.

A female rat who worked for Russia was detained at the Zaporizhzhia defense plant	About this informs Security Service of Ukraine. Among the priority targets of the enemy were air defense systems, deployment points of the Defense Forces and enterprises of the defense-industrial complex. The occupiers were also interested in the routes of transporting Ukrainian weapons and ammunition to the front line. According to the case materials, two residents of Zaporozhye turned out to be agents of the Russian military intelligence. One of the detainees is an employee of the Zaporizhia Strategic Defense Plant. The woman gave the enemy information about the location of workshops where military products are produced, and also reported on missile damage to the enterprise where she worked. Another SBU agent was caught red-handed when he spied on units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine based in Zaporizhzhia. To collect data, the person involved not only went around the city, but also -darkly- asked for the information he needed during everyday conversations with acquaintances. During searches, mobile phones and computer equipment with evidence of working for the enemy were found in the possession of the suspects. -Currently, the investigators of the Security Service have informed the agents about the suspicion under Part 2 of Art. 111 (treason committed under martial law) and part 3 of Art. 114-2 (unauthorized dissemination of information about the movement, movement or location of the Armed Forces) of the Criminal Code of Ukraine,- the message reads.

Institute for the study of war and media: the Armed Forces explained how to avoid distorting the fac...	On this emphasized the spokesman of OTU -Kharkiv- Vitaly Sarantsev in an interview with ArmiyaInform. — The Institute for the Study of War is an authoritative resource that analyzes the situation based on open data. However, its reports are often based on a large amount of information from various sources, which may change or be incomplete. At the same time, ISW does not distinguish between official and unofficial sources and very often uses propagandistic Russian materials in its analysis, he said. Voiskovy emphasized that credit should be given to the Institute's analysts, because they always refer to sources of information, providing a list of everything they used during the preparation of the report. At the same time, he noted that the Ukrainian media often unjustifiably perceive the Institute's messages as a definitive fact, thus presenting society with a distorted picture of events. — This undermines our work, the work of the official communication channels of the military-political leadership of the state, the work of communicators of the Armed Forces and Defense Forces as a whole. We are conducting a defense operation in which every action, including informing the public, must be subordinated to the interests of defense. Using unverified information, even taking it from such a powerful resource as the Institute for the Study of War, one can unknowingly play along with the enemy, the spokesman emphasized. More about the information space of modern war read in the great interview of Vitaly Sarantseva ArmiyaInform. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that Ministry of Defense officials held a meeting with the delegation of the Institute for the Study of War, emphasizing that The Institute for the Study of War is one of the well-known analytical centers whose work helps the world see the real state of affairs during the Russian aggression against Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/17/instytut-vyvchennya-vijny-ta-media-u-zsu-poyasnyly-yak-unykaty-perekruchennya-faktiv/	2024-09-17T00:38:37-07:00

A cavalcade of diplomats to China, the Taliban and why the collapse of the Russian Federation: an ex...	These questions were answered by military expert Petro Chernyk. — The process of finding a formula for exiting this phase has begun. The most striking sign and argument for this is the so-called summit in Switzerland. A lot of countries gathered there, they simply wouldn't have gathered if they didn't understand some logic of the development of events, says the expert. And he notes that this process cannot be fast: - I really like historical parallels. Let's say the Americans have been negotiating with the Taliban for more than a year. Agreed, but it lasted over a year! This is despite the fact that the stakes in Ukraine and the US stakes with the Taliban are completely out of proportion. Chernyk calls the huge cavalcade of diplomats from Europe to China a second serious sign that the process of finding a way out of this war has begun. — And most importantly, Lavrov recently made a series of statements that they do not need foreign territories, that they are fighting for some Russian people who speak Russian, for the so-called Russian peace. But could there be a trap (in possible negotiations. — Ed.)? Maybe, says a military expert. And he notes that history knows many similar cases: - The brightest, the closest to us, is the Cyprus problem of 1974. Then the Turks invaded Cyprus, formed their own republic, which no one recognizes. And two large countries, primarily the United States and Great Britain, resolved this issue. But the conflict was not resolved by itself, there is no solution to it until now. Can something similar happen with the Ukrainian issue? According to Petr Chernyk, maybe. — I really don't like the word -freeze- because our conflict cannot be frozen for such a long time. There is a high probability that some new demarcation formula will be found. Of course, no one recognizes those territories in the civilized world. A large international contingent is also possible. Why not? It is only important that there are not many Russian proxies there, because they are, say, on the African or Latin American continents, the military expert emphasizes. According to him, in the future, as soon as Russia enters a breathing mode, sanctions may be partially lifted from it, and the possibility of the next Russian-Ukrainian war is only a matter of time: - But again, there is one more very important nuance. This is dangerous and not the best scenario for us, but the Russians have not achieved the most important goal. They did not liquidate Ukrainian statehood. Ukrainian state to be&#8230; And we will truly calm down only when the Russian Federation breaks up into 25-30 states, their nuclear weapons are taken away, they are cut off from free resources in Siberia, and the population that will remain around Moscow undergoes the so-called sanitization - ideological cleansing. The same as the Nazis went through after World War II. Chernyk names our further accession to NATO or the formation of a direct military alliance with the USA as an option. — If this does not happen, even if we find a very acceptable formula for us, then the issue of the Russian-Ukrainian war will only be a matter of time. As Bolshevik Lenin said: -Losing Ukraine is like losing your head.-	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/17/kavalkada-dyplomativ-do-kytayu-taliban-ta-do-chogo-tut-rozpad-rf-ekspert-pro-ryzyky-myrnyh-peregovoriv/	2024-09-16T20:30:32-07:00

The modern war of Russia against the Ukrainian people and the state of Ukraine is sometimes called the most documented and represented in the media in the history of mankind. Media coverage of hostilities plays a colossal role in shaping public opinion about the war in Ukraine and abroad, and influences public attitudes and policies of foreign partners. ArmiyaInform spoke with Colonel Vitaly Sarantsev, spokesman for the operational-tactical group -Kharkiv-, about the information component of modern warfare. The first part of the interview: Kharkivshchyna as a friend of Syria: the spokesman of the OTU -Kharkiv- called the most despicable purpose of the application KABs. — On the Telegram channels of Ukrainian units and individual military units, and following them in the Ukrainian media, videos are often shared not only of destroyed equipment or positions of the occupiers, but also of liquidated enemy personnel. On the one hand, this is a demonstration of the effectiveness of the combat work of the defenders of Ukraine. On the other hand, there are accusations about the inhumanity of the distribution of such videos, and in some cases they even try to talk about violations of international law, laws and customs of war. How justified are such criticisms of the Ukrainian military? Can the published video recordings be used against the Defense Forces of Ukraine? - Several main points should be taken into account here in order to maintain a very shaky balance between the appropriateness of placing this or that publication and the impropriety, so to speak. On the one hand, the video that demonstrates the effectiveness of our defenders is a kind of message to society that the army is fighting and winning. This is also a kind of report to our citizens who help the Defense Forces with donations. Also, these videos show the average Russian occupier that he could be the next victim. At the same time, posting on information resources video clips depicting the bodies of the dead or the suffering of the wounded may be considered a violation of international humanitarian law, in particular, norms on respect for human dignity or rules for treating the wounded. Everyone who is involved in the work in the information sphere, be it television, news sites, or channels in social networks, has a special responsibility for how they talk about war, because the constant promotion of such content can lead to the desensitization and normalization of violence in society. It should be remembered that every word, every photo, every video frame has weight, especially in wartime. Before disseminating any information, the media person should be aware of its potential consequences. Can it be used by the enemy and how? Will it harm the morale of our defenders? Will it cause panic among civilians? We must be responsible for every word, because not only our reputation, but also the fate of the country depends on it. — I agree, but sometimes one gets the impression that accusations of inhumanity or violations of international law against the Ukrainian military are excessively scrutinizing, especially against the background of what the Russian occupiers openly indulge in and brag about — murders, torture, indiscriminate shelling, or even special targeting destruction of residential buildings, educational and medical facilities, energy facilities etc. One gets the impression that the aggressor is allowed to do everything - he and the aggressor, his crimes have already become a general characteristic of the occupier, and therefore no one is interested. Whereas Ukrainians are forced to fight -in white gloves- - there is such meticulous, increased attention to us. - Indeed, a certain cognitive disparity is visible: on the one hand, we feel the war crimes of the Russian Federation, which has already become the norm for everything of the world, and on the other hand, increased demands are being made to Ukraine regarding compliance with international humanitarian law. For many, this gives rise to a sense of injustice and double standards. But it should be remembered that one of the rules of International Humanitarian Law is non-reciprocity or non-response to wrongful actions of the enemy. This means that respect for the laws of war does not depend on the actions of an enemy who does or does not follow the same rules. The laws of war must be respected at all times, regardless of the actions of the enemy. That is, if the Russians shelled Okhmatdyt, it does not mean that we have the right to shell some children's hospital in the Russian Federation. The rule -an eye for an eye- does not apply here. Therefore, our task is to spread true information about the war and the crimes of the Russian Federation, involve foreign media, involve international organizations in the investigation of these war crimes. In any case, we must adhere to international humanitarian law, even in spite of provocations by the enemy, because, among other things, this is also an important factor in obtaining international support, including military aid. - One more related question. The Armed Forces of Ukraine are hitting enemy positions, including across the border, on Russian territory. But sometimes we get the impression that our territory is being hit regularly, constantly, a lot, and we do not strike back or hit very little, because we were forbidden by the Western allies, we were not given ammunition, etc. Is it even necessary to talk about the fact that the armed forces are also inflicting fire damage on the territory of the Russian Federation? - The enemy must be destroyed wherever he is. Russia has attacked us and is waging an aggressive war of aggression under a fictitious pretext. the Russians seek to destroy the Ukrainian state and the Ukrainian people. We know how cruel the enemy is in his actions, without any moral and ethical restraints. Therefore, it should be destroyed, in particular, on its own territory. According to international law, every state has the right to self-defense. Russia is the aggressor and is fully responsible for all the destruction and casualties on both sides. And of course we have to talk about it. — Quite often, Ukrainian media disseminate information about the situation at the front with an appeal to foreign sources, which are perceived as more authoritative and reliable than Ukrainian ones. For example, reports citing the daily reports of the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) as a primary source have become very popular since the beginning of the large-scale invasion. At the same time, it is not difficult to notice that in many cases the institute's report is reduced to a simple recording and transfer of information from open sources, including official data of the Defense Forces of Ukraine — operational information regarding the Russian invasion of the General Staff of the Armed Forces, information messages of operational-strategic and operational-tactical groups troops, speeches of officially authorized spokespeople, etc. Why is this happening, why do our media people often cite ISW as a primary source even where the institute's report simply repeats official reports? - The Institute for the Study of War is an authoritative resource that analyzes the situation based on open data. However, its reports are often based on a large amount of information from different sources, which may change or be incomplete. At the same time, ISW does not distinguish between official and unofficial sources and very often uses propagandistic Russian materials in its analysis. To the credit of its analysts, they always cite the sources of information, providing a list of everything they used in the preparation of the report. But some of our media probably need to be scolded in this matter, because they perceive the information reported by the Institute as a given. For some reason, it is believed that if certain information is published by ISW, then it means that it has real confirmation and acquires official status. As a result, they sometimes present society with a distorted picture of events. I believe that this is unacceptable. In addition, it undermines our work, the work of the official communication channels of the military-political leadership of the state, the work of communicators of the Armed Forces and the Defense Forces in general. We are conducting a defense operation in which every action, including public information, must be subordinated to the interests of defense. Using unverified information, even from such a powerful resource as the Institute for the Study of War, can unwittingly play along with the enemy. - Can you open the veil of secrecy a little, how a regular daily information message is prepared in Kharkiv OTU? - During the day, we receive information from the areas of the front, from all the brigades that perform combat tasks in our operational-tactical group . Of course, we also work in units during trips. We work with data provided by intelligence. It should be taken into account that the war is very dynamic, the course of hostilities is very fluid. Therefore, in order not to harm our troops, certain information, of course, does not go to the general public, but we organize other information into a daily summary. We may provide some information with a delay, for example, it refers to those moments when we have made some progress or reached new milestones. — And do you take information from any Russian propaganda resources? Do you monitor them? - Of course. Monitoring of the information space, including that of the enemy, continues around the clock. We intercept all information related to the course of hostilities. We, of course, analyze how the enemy presents news and what he talks about. Now we can conclude that the depopulation of Ukrainians — and not only the military, but also civilians — on Russian propaganda resources has reached the point where calls for the total genocide of the entire Ukrainian people are already being presented as something completely commonplace and something that should not arouse in Russians no objections. -Nazis- for Ukrainians is perhaps the most moderate option, there are many much worse ones. The use of such radical images not only incites hatred, but also creates a hostile atmosphere that makes genocidal actions against Ukrainians acceptable in the eyes of Russian society. — But these media can be read by Ukrainian media professionals and ordinary readers. What advice would you give them when they accidentally or purposefully go to an enemy resource? How to work with the information received from there? - The most important thing is that you don't have to go there at all. There are many interesting and useful information resources, both domestic and foreign. Russian ones do not belong to them. But if you still got there, then I advise you not to fall into -betrayal-, because the entire information module on Russian propaganda resources is built in such a way that it can cause panic in an unprepared reader. It should be understood that these channels are propaganda, that they present a distorted reality, and it will be very difficult for an untrained reader to read this or that information. In general, it is important to maintain critical thinking and observe certain rules of safety and media hygiene. —Most of the Russian propaganda resources available to the Ukrainian reader work on the Telegram platform. Since the beginning of the large-scale war, there has even been a certain phenomenon of the so-called Zyu-voenkors, who, of course, are not any military correspondents, but act purely as propagandists of the aggressive war of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, providing its media support. Telegram is very popular in Ukraine, but it has a lot of frankly manipulative channels and hostile propaganda, so it is increasingly believed that it can be dangerous for the national security of Ukraine. So what to do with Telegram in Ukraine? - In my opinion, we should not abandon Telegram or ban it. Banning such platforms may resemble the actions of authoritarian regimes, where control over information is used to suppress dissent. However, its status needs to be determined. Is it messenger or media? If it is a media, then its activities must comply with Ukrainian legislation that regulates the media sector. This means that it must comply with requirements regarding the reliability of information, countering propaganda and protecting national security. This issue needs to be clearly defined at the legislative level to avoid abuse and to ensure both freedom of speech and safety. In addition, a clear definition of the status will make it possible to establish who is responsible for the content that is distributed through Telegram channels. In general, in matters of the functioning of not only Telegram, but also social networks, Ukraine should -show its teeth- more often. We must have strong legislation and tools to monitor, regulate and, if necessary, control platforms that can be used to undermine our country's sovereignty or spread harmful information. —You mentioned the Kursk region, and in continuation of the information topic, I also want to ask about the Russian prisoners of war who were captured by the Defense Forces. It is noticeable that Russian propaganda has strengthened allegations that Ukrainians treat prisoners cruelly, on the one hand, and is trying to increase hatred of the Russian military among Ukrainians, on the other. - This is true. The case with the 155th Marine Corps Brigade of the Russian Federation, when they set the head of a Ukrainian soldier on a stake and bragged about it on video, proves just that. Of course, this provoked quite outrageous comments on social networks, with calls for the same treatment of Russian prisoners. The propagandists of the Russian Federation collect all these posts (made, in particular, not by Ukrainians themselves, but by Russian bots) and use them for information and propaganda work both among civilians and among the Russian military. In this way, they show, they say, this is what will happen to those who surrender to captivity. Such work with the Russian military has certain fruits - some of them prefer to self-destruct - shoot themselves, blow themselves up with a grenade or even strangle themselves with an Esmarch tourniquet - than surrender to captivity. - But at the same time, there are reports in the Ukrainian media from brigades about how wounded Russian servicemen surrender as prisoners - Yes, this happens, and it has been happening, in particular, in our direction, since May more than 50 Russian occupiers surrendered as prisoners. Among the vivid cases, there was a report from the -Charter- brigade about how Ukrainian fighters, with the help of a drone, threw water and a note with instructions on how to surrender to a wounded Russian to a wounded Russian. Then he was taken to Ukrainian positions by drone, and everything was fine with him. In general, Ukrainians treat prisoners in a civilized manner, this cannot even be compared with the conditions in which our prisoners of war in the Russian Federation find themselves - it is enough to compare the appearance of prisoners during exchanges. —In fact, sometimes it is very surprising when Russian propagandists and Russian users of social networks are outraged by reports about the rescue of Russian soldiers, about the fact that they are being taken prisoner. Why does it cause such hatred in them that the Ukrainians saved their military man? - Here, probably, it is a matter of their mentality as a whole. Heroic death is cultivated in Russia. This goes back at least since World War II. A prime example is Stalin's infamous Order No. 227 -let's take a step back.- Surrender is considered something shameful, if a person surrendered even wounded and unable to continue fighting, they still consider him a traitor and a criminal, even his closest relatives disown him very often. This attitude towards prisoners in Russian society also prompts their soldiers to die or lay hands on themselves, but not to surrender. The Russian command constantly warms this attitude. It is in our Kharkiv direction that cases are known when the commanders of the occupiers read order No. 227 in front of the formation, using it as an additional motivational tool. This, by the way, shows that the Russians identify the events of the Second World War with the events that are happening now. They believe that they are continuing the heroic struggle against fascism and Nazism, etc. They connect all this into a single whole with modern events. This simplifies the perception of the conflict by Russians, because they are forced to believe that Ukraine is not a victim of aggression, but a continuation of the same -fascism- that their grandfathers fought against. The very reports about our humane treatment of Russian prisoners destroy the image of bloodthirsty -Nazis- they created for Ukrainians. When it turns out that this is not true, it makes them extremely angry. This breaks the picture that Russian propagandists have been creating for their fellow citizens for decades about Ukraine and Ukrainians. — In your opinion, do the Ukrainian media cope with keeping the propaganda blow from the Russian Federation and at the same time competently informing the Ukrainian society? Do we win this war information or do we lose more? On the one hand, most Ukrainian media resist the flow of misinformation by the Russian Federation. For example, factual initiatives and independent journalistic projects significantly reduce the impact of Russian narratives within the country and beyond. It is also worth noting a certain increase in the level of media literacy of Ukrainian citizens. On the other hand, Russian propaganda, which has huge financial resources and media platforms, continues to be a threat, especially at the international level. As for the question of whether we win the information war, the answer is difficult. In many aspects, Ukraine has won important victories, in particular in shaping a positive international image and coverage of the truth about Russian aggression. However, Russian propaganda still affects certain audiences, especially in the west and in countries where Russian media have a strong position, so we all have a lot of work. By the way, literally it became known that the USA, Canada and the United Kingdom have launched a joint diplomatic campaign against sources of Russian influence in the world. In addition, the United States has imposed sanctions on the Russian propaganda channel of Russia Today and one of the main mouthpieces of the Kremlin Dmitry Kiselev. You can only congratulate these decisions, as this is another step towards our victory.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/17/yak-gotuyut-zvedennya-v-otu-harkiv-pro-telegram-vidosy-z-peredovoyi-ta-instytut-vyvchennya-vijny/	2024-09-16T20:19:49-07:00
the Russian IPSO attacks: why does the enemy lie about payments for the status of a child of war	Yes, since the beginning of September, a video has been circulating there, which talks about the alleged entry into force of the new law No. 4995 on the status of -children of war-, according to which from September 1, 2024, children will receive 15 thousand hryvnias each month for three years. The video shows the website of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine and screenshots from the Diya portal about the status of a child of war. The service identifier is 01199. In fact, this information is not true, it is distributed with the aim of misleading the public and increasing the degree of social tension in our state. Law No. 4995, which is referred to in video, was adopted back in 2017 and concerns the provision of housing for families of fallen ATO soldiers. In addition, according to with the service identifier 01199, it is indeed possible to obtain the status of -child of war-, but this only applies to persons who are citizens of Ukraine and who were less than 18 years old at the time of the end of the Second World War (September 2, 1945). State Propaganda Russia's apparatus uses TikTok to broadcast Kremlin narratives, spread disinformation, and IPSO. At the beginning of 2024, the social network even introduced restrictions on the distribution of content from the accounts of Russian propagandists. One of the most famous examples of Russian IPSO in TikTok, which is aimed at demoralizing Ukrainian society, are videos with allegedly Ukrainian military personnel and demotivating comments in them. . Text messages or a voiceover blame the Ukrainian authorities for all problems, not the Russian Federation, which is waging a terrorist war against our country. In this way, the enemy is trying to create a split within the society. In some cases, the Russians decorate real Ukrainian videos from the front in their own way, in others they try to pretend that they are showing servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, applying stickers in the form of chevrons, etc. The peak of the next wave of distribution of such videos coincided with the beginning of the mobilization campaign, so their goal was and remains the disruption of mobilization. Research shows that almost 20% of search results on TikTok contain fake or information that misleads users. Because of this, several countries around the world have already taken the initiative to ban this social network.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/17/rosijske-ipso-atakuye-navishho-vorog-breshe-pro-vyplaty-za-status-dytyna-vijny/	2024-09-16T20:12:29-07:00
Two in one: Poland has developed the newest UAV — a scout that can be an artilleryman	As claim the developers of the aircraft from the Polish company WB Electronics, this UAV significantly expands the user's situational awareness, while giving him the ability to safely observe rapidly changing situations on the battlefield or in other environments, ArmyInform reports. One of the main features of X-FRONTER is the use of a military-grade encrypted communication line to control it. This technology provides stable communication protected from jamming attempts, which allows the drone to effectively perform reconnaissance and strike missions at a distance of several kilometers from the operator. With this level of protection, infantry units can rely on the X-FRONTER to conduct surveillance and precision attacks in difficult combat environments. The X-FRONTER is capable of carrying a small explosive payload, including thermobaric, fragmentation, and cluster warheads. This ability makes it not only a reconnaissance tool, but also an effective means of inflicting point strikes on the enemy. In addition, the design of the drone allows it to be easily adapted for different missions, including additional modules such as: infrared markers, devices for installing smoke curtains and other technical innovations. Another important technology implemented in X-FRONTER is the capability for swarm operations. This drone can work in a group with other drones, dividing tasks among themselves. For example, several X-FRONTERs can perform reconnaissance, while other drones equipped with explosives act as mobile artillery, striking the enemy. This greatly expands the tactical capabilities of infantry on the battlefield. The design of the drone from the Polish manufacturer in the folded state resembles a PET bottle in size and shape, which allows you to easily carry it with you. The drone is capable of reaching a speed of up to 60 kilometers per hour and a height of up to 300 meters. In the unfolded state, the X-FRONTER is quite a classic quadcopter, that is, a four-rotor aircraft with symmetrically located -shoulders- around a cylindrical fuselage. Its -hands- with stationary engines and propellers are hidden right in the hull, thanks to which both transportation and preparation for flight take place quickly and without problems, and the absence of protruding elements prevents them from being damaged during transportation. Flight time is up to 40 minutes, which gives infantry units considerable operational flexibility. This flight duration allows the drone to perform long missions, providing reliable support to troops in various situations. X-FRONTER is a versatile tool that can significantly increase the combat capabilities of infantry units. Thanks to its compact size, high mobility, encrypted communication and the ability to operate in swarms, this drone becomes indispensable for a wide range of tasks on the battlefield. The Polish developer presented a new compact and deadly X-FRONTER infantry drone.

The Defense Forces spoke about the tactics of the Russians in the Lymano-Kupian direction	Officer Andrii Otchenash, commander of the Kara Nebesna UAV crew of the Rubizh brigade, told about this on the broadcast of the Yedyny Novyni telethon. According to him, the enemy moves mainly by infantry, and much less often by vehicles. -They use a huge number of personnel. In some places, technology is used, but not as brightly as it was before. They understand that as soon as they use a large amount of equipment, it will be destroyed immediately,- said the officer. He explained that the Russians are trying to move in small groups, accumulate at certain points and carry out further offensive actions. -For example, a group of 10 Russians moves, four arrive. They hide in dugouts, where it is more difficult to get them. Next comes the next group. They are all waiting to be replenished until they are collected enough for assault actions,- the officer noted. As reported by ArmyInform, today in the Kupyansk direction the enemy ;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=traficsource->carried out seven assaults near Sinkivka and Lozova.

He provided the occupiers with transport and fuel: the director of the agricultural company will be ...	The Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office informed about this. The director of an agricultural enterprise located in the village of Bily Kolodyaz of the Kharkiv Region became an accomplice of the occupiers and handed over to them the automobile equipment of the agricultural company controlled by him and the fuel for it. Since March 2022, the head of the enterprise deliberately established contact with representatives of the aggressor state and handed over the premises of the elevator building along with the equipment and other material assets available at that time to the enemy. In June of the same year, the occupiers appointed a man to the position of -temporary administrator of the Branch of the Joint-Stock Company -Gosudarstvennaya provodlovstvennia zernovaya kompaniya Ukrainy Belokolodezyansky elevator-. The enemy's helper ensured the operation of the enterprise and organized the reception, drying, shipment and temporary storage of agricultural crops. In addition, the accused gave instructions to subordinate employees to refuel motor vehicles that were on the company's balance sheet, which he later also handed over to the armed forces of the aggressor state. An accomplice of the enemy performed his duties until the moment of deoccupation. Currently, he is hiding from Ukrainian law enforcement officers, he is declared wanted. The man will be tried in absentia for aiding the aggressor state. He faces up to twelve years of imprisonment with deprivation of the right to hold certain positions or engage in certain activities for a period of up to fifteen years and confiscation of property. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in Kyiv and Donetsk, minors who set fire to military vehicles were detained.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/16/zabezpechuvav-okupantiv-transportom-i-palyvom-dyrektora-agrofirmy-sudytymut/	2024-09-16T10:13:17-07:00

The President held a Stavka: the situation at the front, drones and improving the work of combat tra...	This is stated in a message in telegram channel of the head of state. At Stavka, there were also detailed reports from both intelligence agencies — SZR and GUR — regarding the intentions of the Russian occupiers and the situation in their ranks. Scouts noted a noticeable deterioration of discipline in Russian units. The second issue of the Stavka was the current state of preparedness of engineering protection at critical infrastructure facilities and the calendar for the completion of works. -Question number three is combat training centers. I listened to the report of the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defense Igor Voronchenko. He instructed the General Staff to provide a list of measures to improve the work of the centers.

But this does not mean that he left and gave up the offensive. No, he is building up his forces, he is conducting an internal rotation of units. Where it is possible, he is trying to carry out logistical support measures, build up the communication system, build up the management system. This is evidence that he is still preparing to carry out offensive actions in certain directions with the aim of restoring the lost position, the spokesman noted. He emphasized that the Defense Forces, under favorable conditions, are trying to advance and advance, and also regularly inflict effective fire damage on the occupiers. — We are improving our own tactical position and little by little we are liberating our land from the Russian occupiers, Vitaly Sarantsev concluded.

They became her acquaintances from the temporarily occupied territories, who can conduct financial transactions in the Russian Federation without hindrance,- the message says. In the period from May 2022 to April 2024, the woman sent money to their cards, and they were already able to transfer money directly to the partner's account in Moscow. &#8221; The businesswoman's companion uses this money to pay taxes to the Russian budget, thereby ensuring the constant functioning of the military-industrial complex enterprise, primarily the missiles with which the enemy systematically fires at our state, law enforcement officers said. The Slobid district prosecutor's office of the city of Kharkiv approved and sent to the court an indictment against the 50-year-old director of a private enterprise for financing actions taken with the aim of changing the borders of the territory and the state border of Ukraine in violation of the order established by the Constitution of Ukraine, based on a prior conspiracy by a group of persons (part 3 of Article 110-2 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine).

Strengthened by 40%: the enemy intensified aerial reconnaissance in the Kharkiv region	The enemy's goal was explained on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- the spokesman of the OTU -Kharkiv- Vitaly Sarantsev. - Enemy air reconnaissance increased by about 40%. He spends her both day and night. It should be noted that the adversary can thereby fulfill two purposes. The first is the identification of units of the Defense Forces with the subsequent task of fire damage on positions and our forces and assets. The second issue is reconnaissance of movement routes for own units. He monitors this or that area and tries to draw up an optimal route for moving both personnel and equipment, he said. Another task of enemy air reconnaissance is to find routes for safe movement in the nearest enemy rear for the purpose of establishing logistics. — He is trying to find new routes for logistical support activities. Because our FPV drones do not allow us to live peacefully, do not allow us to move peacefully for any purpose - whether for assaults or for delivering provisions or ammunition to advanced positions, the spokesman said. Despite this, the Russians are still trying to use equipment for logistical support and personnel transportation. Defense forces effectively counter such attempts. — Yesterday evening, the enemy tried to bring personnel to Vovchansk with the help of vehicles. But the equipment was discovered, it was damaged and it was partially destroyed along with the crew and the landing party that it was carrying to reinforce units in Vovchansk, Vitaliy Sarantsev reported. Earlier, ArmyInform informed that destruction of enemy reconnaissance UAVs long range is one of the keys to reducing the number of anti-aircraft missile strikes on Ukrainian territory, and also reported that in the area of ​​Aggregatny Zavod in Vovchansk, the enemy hit their own units with anti-aircraft missiles.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/16/posylyly-na-40-vorog-aktyvizuvav-povitryanu-rozvidku-na-harkivshhyni/	2024-09-16T02:41:38-07:00

On the air of the national telethon -Yedini Novyni- the spokesman of OTU -Kharkiv- Vitaly Sarantsev emphasized this. — First of all, of course, it is the destruction of the carriers of these ammunition. This is the first. And the second, more important, I believe, is the destruction of the airfield infrastructure in the range of the weapons that we are now asking from our partners, he said. Strikes on enemy airfields with long-range weapons from Western partners can significantly change the situation for the better for Ukraine. — Destruction of airfield infrastructure, destruction of airstrips, destruction of warehouses with ammunition, warehouses with PMM — this, of course, would greatly improve our situation and greatly weaken the offensive capabilities of the enemy, he explained in detail. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that the occupiers hit the Kharkiv region with anti-aircraft guns: one person died in the region, 47 were injured.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/16/aerodromy-vazhlyvishi-za-nosiyi-u-zsu-nazvaly-golovnyj-sposib-borotby-z-udaramy-kab/	2024-09-16T01:42:26-07:00

The Armed Forces explained why the Russians do not dare to attack ships in the grain corridor	This was noted by the spokesman of the Navy of Ukraine, Captain 3rd Rank Dmytro Pletenchuk, on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyni- . — The incident took place outside our grain corridor, our corridor is operating in a stable mode. Most of it, as you know, passes through the territorial waters of the member countries of the North Atlantic Alliance. Accordingly, the Russians do not dare to do such pranks in these waters, he said. In addition, grain carriers usually sail under foreign flags. Among the leaders who use the services of the Ukrainian grain corridor, China is on the first place and Spain is on the second. — We had a similar case last year. Over time, of course, it will become clear whether this was a targeted attack or not. However, this does not change the fact that the Russians targeted a civilian vessel, regardless of whether it was the result of the irresponsible use of inappropriate weapons or a targeted attack, the spokesman emphasized. Russians hit a civilian ship with wheat from Ukraine for Egypt with the Kh-22 Burya anti-ship missile. - This is a rather outdated type of weapon. It is anti-ship, but given that it was immediately designed for a nuclear warhead, an error of 50 kilometers was not a problem for it. But when it is used with another warhead, it can become a problem for it - not only for it, but also for everyone who is in the radius of flight of this missile, Dmytro Pletenchuk noted. He reminded that this missile should be called -50 for 50- - launched more than 50 years ago, it may not hit the target, deflecting at a distance of more than 50 kilometers. The spokesman also noted that the Russians launched a missile from a Tu-22 strategic aviation bomber. -This shows that the Russians do not dare to come close to our coast using tactical aviation,- he emphasized. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that withdrawal of Russian ships from the port of Novorossiysk is connected with the threat of use of long-range weapons by the Defense Forces of Ukraine, which could hit ships at the base's location.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/16/v-zsu-poyasnyly-chomu-rosiyany-ne-navazhuyutsya-atakuvaty-sudna-u-zernovomu-korydori/	2024-09-16T01:03:24-07:00

In the area of ​​the settlement Tikhe, he brought personnel to advanced positions, focused the main attention on conducting aerial reconnaissance with the aim of identifying units of the Defense Forces of Ukraine. In the area of ​​the settlement Hlyboke, the enemy is carrying out individual movement of personnel with the aim of replenishing the current shortage in forward positions, conducting engineering reconnaissance of advance routes.

-From fire to flame-: the Russians made an unpleasant choice in the Black Sea	Such a well-founded assumption was made by the spokesman of the Navy of Ukraine, Captain 3rd rank Dmytro Pletenchuk, . - This may indicate the fact that at some point the Russians felt uneasy at their base of Novorossian and had to choose, as they say in Russia, -from fire to flame,- he said. The occupiers had little choice - either to stay at the base, where they could be hit by Ukrainian long-range weapons, or to go out to sea, where Ukrainian naval drones stalk enemy ships. — As a result, they chose to go out to sea, where they can meet Ukrainian drones. Why did they make this choice? We'll probably find out sometime soon. But most likely, their choice was not very pleasant, the spokesman suggested. Obviously, it became even more dangerous for the occupier ships to stay at the base in Novorossiysk than to go to the open sea. - The tactic of hiding at the Novorossiysk base for the past many months is understandable, because it is easier to organize defense there than in the open sea. Therefore, such a choice leads to similar conclusions, Dmytro Pletenchuk noted. On the other hand, he emphasized, it is hardly possible to claim that going to sea is connected with the possible use of ship-based missile weapons by the Russians. Earlier, ArmyInform explained, what could threaten the mass withdrawal of Russian missile carriers to the Black Sea, and reported that due to logistical problems, the occupiers will increase the transport load on the emergency Crimean Bridge.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/16/yz-ognya-da-v-pol%d1%8bmya-u-chornomu-mori-rosiyany-zrobyly-nepryyemnyj-vybir/	2024-09-15T23:15:55-07:00

Mobilized in Britain: -cloak-coat- and -dragon fire- on -forest exercises- Interflex	We are camping near the lake. In the morning, fog hangs and swirls on the surface of the water. Today is the last day of the -forest- trip, and we are finally lucky - for the first time in three days, the rain subsided, and then the rain stopped. As soon as the sun rises over our -Sherwood- forest, thick steam rises from the ground, grass, trees and wet clothing. The rays burn as mercilessly as the cold rain poured down before it. Such is the climate and weather of the British Isles in the middle of the sea. For the next lesson, instructors gather at our branch on the lake shore. We wait for several minutes until the other departments come up - they are a little further, so they have to go longer. At this time, we are quizzed to find out how well we remembered the content of yesterday's lessons. I catch myself thinking that it is easier to do the task correctly than to explain how and why exactly you do it. It's not a language barrier - our translators do an excellent job. The point is in the nature of the memorization itself - it happened at the bodily level of muscle memory, so in order to realize it, it is necessary to first reproduce the sequence of actions. Some rush not to tell, but to show. Instructors do not deny that in battle you need to do, and not explain how you do it. Doing the task is better than talking about it, and the teachers are happy with the students, which is what they wanted. In the end, the whole platoon gathers on the shore and we are shown the content of the next lesson. The instructors remind once again that a good soldier must always take care of himself. Good health and physical fitness, sufficient sleep and rest, adequate nutrition and comfortable living conditions determine the combat effectiveness of personnel, and therefore the effectiveness of combat missions. The instructors note that in the rain we all got soaked. In addition, they explain, during the hostilities we will have to overcome water obstacles one way or another, which is why we were gathered on the shore of the lake. So now there will be hands-on training with elements of immersion in reality and we will be taught how to dry quickly even if we get wet even worse than we already got wet in the rain. The hint becomes more than transparent - we guess that now at least part of the lake will have to be waded along the shore. -Hell, I think, why get up an hour before the official climb and dry my uniform - I'd rather sleep.- The next thought is about where the children's clock goes - I have an ordinary office clock and in the rain it has already fogged up from the inside from excessive moisture, although the hands are still moving. Diving would leave him no chance of survival. The intrigue is intensifying, but we still haven't received an order to swim across the lake or even enter it. Realizing exactly what we are afraid of, the instructors look at each other conspiratorially and smile. I watch how the second hand crawls behind the fogged glass, and I decide to drown the watch for good. The house, the mountains and the barn burned down - we had to buy a waterproof one. I don't want to get into the water in a dry form, but I'm already mentally ready for that. Everything is resolved unexpectedly - another one of the instructors just swims up to us from the depths of the lake. For at least 20 minutes, he watched us from the cold water near the shore. Now, using his own example, he will show us how to quickly dry thoroughly soaked clothes and shoes. We will dry our already wet uniforms - there is no need to get into the lake for this. The technology of self-drying is simple - we have already described it and shown it a little earlier. In about the same way, I dried myself before waking up. However, the instructors now show and describe important details that we might not have paid enough attention to. The basic things you need for drying are a fire source and dry fuel, ours is FireDragon - -dragon fire- or -dragon fire- as you prefer. It is desirable to also have some kind of stand on which you can place a mini-fireplace, but in extreme cases, an ordinary stone or a fragment of a brick will also do. The most interesting element is the -cloak-coat-, which we just called - a poncho, a tent, a cape, and a cover. The variety of names is due to the versatility and multi-functionality of this rectangular sheet. With the help of a -cloak-coat-, you can arrange the simplest shelter - a mini-tent or a cover. You can simply cover your gear and supplies with it, or wrap yourself in it. A camouflage-colored waterproof -cloak-coat- is necessary so that no one notices you during a stop. It is able to protect both from a heavy downpour and from the scorching rays of the sun. And during drying, the -cloak-coat- helps to create a special microenvironment around the fighter dressed in thoroughly soaked clothes, in which the high temperature allows for rapid warming, and the intense evaporation - to expel moisture from the clothes. The main thing is to be careful not to burn the -cloak-coat- with -dragon fire-. But this is already a matter of vigilance and the minimum necessary skills. The instructor easily advises on this, as long as his colleague explains the best way to dry the shoes. Read also: The General Staff showed what equipment Ukrainians receive during training in Great Britain Finally, we they ask if we noticed the newcomer from the lake before they invited him out. We did not notice - under some branches hanging from the shore and natural debris, the instructor was extremely well camouflaged. Careful local camouflage will be one of our next lessons. The Interflex Intensive continues with another action-packed day.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/16/mobilizovanyj-u-brytaniyi-plashh-palto-ta-vogon-drakona-na-lisovyh-navchannyah-interflex/	2024-09-15T20:20:18-07:00
Combat Boat 90: the expert talked about the advantages of combat boats that Ukraine will receive fro...	The purpose, tactical properties and combat capabilities of the SV90, as well as the likely scenarios for the use of these boats, in particular in the Azov-Black Sea region, were told to the ArmyInform correspondent by the officer of the Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, retired captain 1st rank, candidate of military sciences Stepan Yakymyak. It is known that these boats are the best in their class, as evidenced by their use by many countries, including the United States. It is no secret that the so-called -great maritime power- of the Russian Federation also at one time purchased several samples of such boats from a Swedish manufacturing company and built one and a half dozen such boats. Swedish SV90 combat boats were produced in different versions and for various tasks, but during their design and creation, the main task was the rapid deployment and landing of amphibious assault groups on the coast. This is evidenced by the special bow gear, the ability to transport a relatively large number of people in a special protected room and the small draft of the boat (0.8 m), which allows a direct approach to the shore. According to Stepan Yakymyak, these boats are primarily capable of quickly and safely delivering personnel over considerable distances and covertly evacuating them. — For example, in the conditions of hostilities on rivers 2 km wide, a group of six such boats can transfer a company of paratroopers in full equipment from one bank to another within 1.5-2 minutes. In sea areas, this unit can be overturned by the same group of boats over a distance of more than 400 km in about ten hours with the mandatory condition of providing combat support for this group and support, primarily from air strikes, Stepan Yakymyak noted. Other advantages include increased maneuverability and the ability to approach directly to different types of coasts (rocky, sandy, marshy, etc.). — In addition to amphibious, assault, and special operations, combat boats of the SV90 type, if used by the Defense Forces of Ukraine, can be used to lay mines, to perform patrolling tasks, transport troops and property, and evacuate the wounded. Also, these boats can perform tasks in the protection of sea and river communications and in combat support of forces operating in river and sea areas and on the coast. In the case of operations along the sea coast and ensuring greater stealth of operations, the task of transferring several special-purpose groups to the coast controlled by the enemy can be successfully accomplished. When using such boats, it is necessary to carefully plan reconnaissance, surveillance and cover them from the air against the strikes of UAVs and enemy fighter-bomber aircraft. So, the range of tasks, taking into account the actual areas of operation of the Defense Forces of Ukraine on rivers, estuaries and the Black Sea, is actually very wide. However, as Stepan Yakymyak adds, a much larger number of such boats is needed, which is due to the scale and scope of the areas of military operations and the combat capabilities of the enemy. If their number is sufficient, they could perform up to 40-60% of the main combat tasks of the surface forces of the Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine at sea and rivers. By the way, about the options for the use of these boats told the spokesman of the Navy, captain of the third rank, Dmytro Pletenchuk.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/16/combat-boat-90-ekspert-rozpoviv-pro-perevagy-bojovyh-kateriv-yaki-otrymaye-ukrayina-vid-shvecziyi/	2024-09-15T20:09:33-07:00
Stolen icons, hanged children and a shot train: fakes about Kurshchyna, with which the Kremlin scare...	In August, screenshots of ads allegedly posted on the OLX service appeared on z-channels. They depict Orthodox icons that were allegedly taken by the Ukrainian military from the Kursk region. The most common selection published by Telegram scammers includes five allegedly stolen icons. >Estonian resource provereno.media found the originals of these images. As it turned out, the icons come from Konotop, Zaporizhzhia, Kyiv, Kremenchuk and Lviv Oblast. One technical detail unites all the fake images: the top line shows the location — Kursk Oblast and Kursk. But everyone who uses the Ukrainian OLX service knows that only Ukrainian regions can be selected there. Kyiv and Kirovohrad regions, as well as Crimea (ARC) are represented on the site under the letter K. The purpose of spreading this fake is obvious — to accuse the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of looting. ArmyInform already wrote about the -reflection- tactic, which Russian propagandists actively use when talking about Kurshchyna. This is how they try to accuse Ukraine of war crimes similar to those committed by the Russians in 2022 in Buch, Mariupol, Izyum and other Ukrainian cities and villages. Recently, propagandists have been terrorizing their citizens with particularly brutal -units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine- , formed from Georgian, Polish, French and American mercenaries-, who -hanged 8 children in a barn-, or that -The command of the Armed Forces during the attack on the Kursk region ordered to shoot a passenger train.- In Ukraine and in the West, such lies no longer work, because many representatives of foreign, influential and truly independent media have already visited the occupied Armed Forces territory of the Kursk region. In their reports, foreign media persons claim that they did not see traces of -atrocities- similar to Russian prisoners, as well as to civilians — that is why Moscow is so nervous about uncontrolled mass media in a territory it does not control. In addition, it was the Kremlin that refused to provide a humanitarian corridor for the evacuation of civilians from the territory of Kurshchyna, which is controlled by the Armed Forces of Ukraine. That's why many questions about Putin and his managerial vertical arise already in Russia itself. After all, the Kremlin dictator uses Russian citizens in the war only as consumables.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/16/vykradeni-ikony-povisheni-dity-ta-rozstrilyanyj-poyizd-fejky-pro-kurshhynu-yakymy-kreml-lyakaye-svoyih-gromadyan/	2024-09-15T20:00:59-07:00

And I think that under other circumstances they would not be interested in stopping the war,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. The President noted that victory for Ukraine means being very strong and being ready for strong diplomacy. -And that is why I have prepared several points. Four of them are the main points. Plus one that we need after the war. I will share them with President Biden. It is about security, geopolitical location of Ukraine, very strong military support of Ukraine. And about the fact that we should freely decide how to use this or that thing. We are talking about decisions on economic support,- Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. He added that he is ready to accept proposals for this plan from Joe Biden's team if they strengthen the peace plan and Ukraine's position. -I think it will be fair and proper to share this plan with both candidates for the presidency of the United States - Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. And a lot also depends on the decisions of the US Congress, so we would like to share with Congress as well. After these steps, we are ready to share the plan with everyone,- said the President of Ukraine. Earlier, Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Ukraine is asking the United States to grant permission to use long-range weapons to attack Russian airfields, but not received it yet.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/15/volodymyr-zelenskyj-rozpoviv-podrobyczi-planu-peremogy-ukrayiny/	2024-09-15T09:11:35-07:00
Vovchansk is under fire control: the occupiers are hiding in the woods	A military man with the call sign -Stig- told about this on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- - officer of the 2nd separate detachment of the Special Purpose Center -OMEGA- of the National Guard of Ukraine. — The city is almost completely destroyed, there is not a single whole building. We are right now in the suburbs of Vovchansk, so I can confidently tell you that there is not a single whole building in the city, he said. The degree of destruction of Vovchansk is catastrophic - the battles are taking place right in the urban development. — The city is completely under fire control both from the enemy's side and from our side. Right now, an artillery duel is going on, the city is being covered by enemy artillery, our artillery is working, our strike drones are working, the military said. The occupiers do not stop trying to advance and gain a foothold in the city ruins. — The enemy is trying to advance with reconnaissance groups, small infantry groups to some new positions. However, it faces resistance from the Security and Defense Forces and loses its offensive potential. But he will not stop trying to move forward through the city, the officer said. At the same time, the occupiers cannot set up positions in the city, so they mostly entrench themselves in the surrounding forests. - They try to hide mostly in the forests. Very good vegetation here, very good terrain from the point of view of shelters. Therefore, most of them hide in dense forests. -Unfortunately, this is a problem, because even in winter, if it is a coniferous forest, it is very difficult to recognize and hit the enemy,- explained the Ukrainian drone commander. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in Vovchansk, the occupiers are resorting to single infiltration tactics , and fights in the city take place just inside high-rise buildings a>.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/15/vovchansk-pid-vognevym-kontrolem-okupanty-hovayutsya-v-lisah/	2024-09-15T08:58:16-07:00

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said this in interview with CNN. -Everyone is waiting for the decision of the US and after that they make their decisions. We would love to use this weapon and attack aircraft on military bases. Not civilian infrastructure, but military bases,- emphasized Volodymyr Zelenskyi. The President emphasized that planes from these airfields are used not only for launching missiles, but also for anti-aircraft fire. -These planes drop 4,000 guided aerial bombs every month only in the east of Ukraine. With these guided bombs, they destroyed 80% of our energy infrastructure,- the head of state said. He added that in meetings with partners, he warned about waiting too long, because of which the Russians began to move their planes to a greater distance. -Now Russia has begun to withdraw its planes to a distance of 300-500 kilometers. And now we need more permissions. But we still don't have them,- Volodymyr Zelenskyi said.

The key to reducing the number of KAB strikes is the destruction of enemy reconnaissance UAVs	A military man with the call sign -Stig- told about this on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- - officer of the 2nd separate detachment of the Special Purpose Center -OMEGA- of the National Guard of Ukraine. — The enemy makes very extensive use of strike and reconnaissance drones. There are already fewer reconnaissance units, but there are more and more shock units, he said. He noted that combating the enemy's reconnaissance UAVs helps reduce the number of UAV strikes. — In the Vovchan direction, the activity of the use of anti-aircraft missiles has decreased a little over the last week or two, because the Russians lost a lot of long-range reconnaissance UAVs, which corrected the use of tactical aviation, including when using anti-aircraft missiles. In the last two weeks, they have not used the KABs much. And for the last week, reconnaissance UAVs do not even fly into the deep rear during the day, - said the military man.

Pointed Russian missiles at Kharkiv: the enemy informant was sentenced	The sentence became known from the sentence of the court register, the identity of the convicted installed Kharkiv Anti-Corruption Center (KHAC). According to the HAC, it is about Yuriy Panfilov, who was accused of disseminating information about the deployment of the Armed Forces and justifying Russian aggression. The court recognized the man as an informant of the Russian special services, who adjusted Russian airstrikes against the critical infrastructure of Kharkiv. Among the main targets of the enemy were strategically important enterprises, in particular the defense-industrial complex. For greater effectiveness of missile and drone attacks, the Russians expected to receive from Panfilov the geolocation of Ukrainian air defense. In case of receiving such information, the invaders hoped to -bypass- the air defense systems of the Armed Forces of Ukraine or carry out a targeted attack on them. To collect intelligence, the convict found the places of -arrivals-, and then took hidden photos and videos there. The man forwarded all the information he received to several chat rooms of pro-Kremlin Telegram channels controlled by the special services of the aggressor country. Also, in September 2023, he videotaped the consequences of the Russian shelling of the state-owned enterprise Kharkiv Armored Plant. The convict began transmitting data to the enemy in the fall of 2023. Before that, Panfilov distinguished himself by publishing posts and comments on Facebook in which he tried to discredit Ukrainian defenders and admired the aggressor state. In addition, he denied that residential buildings in Kharkiv were being shelled by the aggressor state, and he called the tragedy in Buch, which was staged by the Russian military, a theater and a fake. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that law enforcement officers reported the suspicion to the Russian general, who ordered the capture of -Kharkiv in 5 days-.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/15/navodyv-rosijski-rakety-na-harkiv-vorozhyj-informator-otrymav-vyrok/	2024-09-15T07:33:10-07:00

Well, how else can the situation be escalated?- said the head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Kyrylo Budanov rejected the seriousness of the suggestion that the president of the Russian Federation would provide much more aid to countries and groups in the Middle East with the aim of escalating the war there. -How can he help when he himself asks for help from others? How will it help globally? Yes, you can send a special forces unit, no problem. You can transfer, for example, 50 MANPADS. But what next? Everything is fighting here, the entire Russian army, everything that is produced goes directly from the assembly line to the front. Everything they buy - by the way, no one gives them anything for free - everything goes to the front. How will they help?-, the head of the GUR of the Ministry of Defense argued his position. -Globally, they cannot do anything as long as the war in Ukraine continues,- Kyrylo Budanov concluded.

These conclusions with reference to secret Russian data in the framework of the discussion panel during the 20th meeting of the Yalta European Strategy (YES) shared Head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, Lieutenant General Kyrylo Budanov. The head of the GUR of the Ministry of Defense pointed to the fact that Russia predicts that -all their problems will begin in the summer of the 25th year-, as both the financial and economic factor and the socio-political factor will combine. According to him, the Russian Federation is currently struggling with the deterioration of the economic situation, because it understands that the recession, which is already noticeable and painful, continues. According to the head of the Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense, the issue of shortage of personnel in the army is becoming more and more acute in Russia. -During this period (in the summer of next year 2025, - ed.) they will face a dilemma: either to announce mobilization, or somehow it is necessary to reduce the intensity of hostilities a little bit, which may ultimately be critical for them,- the Ukrainian leader said military intelligence. Kyrylo Budanov believes that -war fatigue exists in Russia, no matter what anyone says, because the war has already affected a large section of the Russian population.- He said that the Russians are frankly happy that the aggressor has already managed to capture more than 30% of the territory of our country, and they are also satisfied with the high salary in the Russian army. However, the number of volunteers is decreasing, which has prompted an increase in one-time payments upon signing a contract to 2 million rubles (equivalent to $21,993). The head of the GUR of the Ministry of Defense added that the socio-psychological state of the population of the aggressor country was also affected by Ukraine's efforts to transfer hostilities to the territory of Russia, deep into it.

This is what the officer told on the air of the Espresso TV channel. -Now the Russians don't have much choice regarding logistics to the occupied Crimea. Ferries are not operating. When they will work is not clear. One ferry is at anchor, and the other is waiting for repairs. Therefore, they do not have much choice.

This is from the head of the Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defensesaid during a panel discussion within the XX meeting of the Yalta European Strategy (YES). -As the head of intelligence, I can directly say: the fact that they deliver ballistic missiles there is unpleasant for us, but it is not the volumes, but in terms of ammunition, it is critical for us,- the head of military intelligence emphasized. -Unfortunately, I can say that we cannot do anything about it yet. This is such an unfortunate truth,- stated the head of the GUR MOU. According to Kirill Budanov, the stockpile of weapons inherited from the Russian Federation from Soviet times is running out. And the current volume of manufactured aircraft and armored vehicles cannot have any decisive importance on the battlefield. Another issue is the production of weapons of mass destruction, in which the occupiers have advanced, added the head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications. For example, as Kyrylo Budanov emphasized, the Russian Federation has made significant progress in the production of Iskander missiles, and the production of guided aerial bombs, which are a huge problem for Ukraine, has also increased. -I will not scare anyone, several times, let's say so,- summed up the head of the GUR MOU. As reported by ArmiyaInform, earlier Lieutenant General Kyrylo Budanov said that attacks deep in Russia have an important impact on the citizens of the aggressor country, and they also somewhat changed people's outlook as a whole.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/15/kyrylo-budanov-pivnichna-koreya-ye-golovnym-postachalnykom-ozbroyennya-dlya-rosiyi-i-cze-zavdaye-ukrayini-najbilshoyi-shkody/	2024-09-15T03:54:52-07:00

This was stated by the head of the Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense during a panel discussion within the XX meeting of the Yalta European Strategy (YES). The presenter asked the head of the IOU GUR how he assesses the possibilities of Ukraine to transfer the war to the territory of Russia. Kyrylo Budanov replied that, as a citizen, he would like more. However, -you have to look at things realistically-, so the head of military intelligence would focus on long-range strikes against the enemy. -Ukraine was a little weaker, that must also be recognized. And it's the fact that it's been almost three years of full-scale, and ten years of our war in general, and we're still holding on,- he said. The head of the GUR MOU noted that at the beginning of the Russian Federation's large-scale aggression against Ukraine, -we were definitely dealing with one of the most powerful armies in the world,- and the Russians failed to break us. -This is despite the fact that Russia has a large stockpile of weapons and equipment accumulated during independence, inherited from the times of the USSR and received from other states, such as the DPRK. Our ability to transfer hostilities to the territory of Russia — here I would place more emphasis on the ability to strike deep into the territory of the Russian Federation. This is the first. And on the very philosophy of it. It changed the outlook a little,- said the head of the GUR MOU. Kyrylo Budanov drew attention to the fact that the myth of their invincibility and security was destroyed for the population of the aggressor country after the strikes of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on objects deep in Russia. This greatly affected their social and psychological condition. He noted that previously Russians were convinced that their country was one of the strongest in the world, but this myth was destroyed with the first explosions in Moscow. As the head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications noted, -he undermined the entire foundation.- Kyrylo Budanov believes that this is the main achievement of these long-range strikes - breaking the faith of the people that they live in safety. When asked by the moderator of the discussion whether more such strikes are needed, the head of military intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine answered that -while the war is going on, everything must be done to the maximum. And when you can do more, you have to do more.- As reported by ArmiyaInform, on September 11, 2024, Nobody, Chimera, Aratta, Raven Group units and the 2nd special operations unit named after Vladyslav Peleshenko of the GUR of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine with the support of -Group 13- and the 10th mobile border unit -Dozor- of the State Border Service of Ukraine They carried out raid near the coast of Crimea.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/15/pislya-udariv-zsu-po-obyektah-vglyb-rosiyi-dlya-naselennya-krayiny-agresorky-zrujnuvavsya-mif-pro-yihnyu-neperemozhnist-i-bezpeku-kyrylo-budanov/	2024-09-15T02:50:43-07:00

The US Army intends to conduct another test of hypersonic weapons by the end of 2024	According to information profile resource Defense News, the head of the procurement department of the US Army, Doug Bush, made a corresponding statement. ArmyInform reports. Common Hypersonic Glide Body (C-HGB, -Common Hypersonic Glide Body-), which is a universal projectile developed jointly with the US Navy, was successfully tested at the beginning of 2024. The Navy envisions using the munition to be launched from ship-based launchers, while the US Army plans to integrate the munition for a land-based launch station. Defense News reports that the US Army has long worked with Leidos' Dynetics with the goal of creating an industrial base for the Common Hypersonic Glide Body, which will enter the armament of both the ground forces and the Navy. Previously, American private business had never been involved in the development of hypersonic weapons. -Following the Navy tests, we need to make sure that we have a full end-to-end test as close as possible to an operational test that will be successful,- Bush told reporters at a Pentagon briefing. The official also added that it is necessary to have confidence that weapons can be safely transferred to a unit that -may have to go to war.- The Army has yet to conduct fully successful trials. But, as Bush said, the military hopes that such a test will take place this year. If the tests are successful, the service will be able to transfer the hypersonic unit to the first unit as an initial operational capability as early as next year. Hypersonic missiles are capable of reaching a speed of Mach 5 (about 6,000 km per hour). The glider unit can maneuver at altitude, which makes detection by anti-missile systems difficult. According to the Pentagon, the battery of the ground complex consists of a command and staff vehicle and four heavy transporters with two containers on each with hypersonic missiles. The project range of the missile is 2775 km. The first US Army unit to receive hypersonic weapons (with the exception of universal munitions) was the 5th Battalion, 3rd Regiment, 17th Field Artillery Brigade at Joint Base Lewis-McChord (Washington State). The unit is part of the 1st multidisciplinary task force. The delivery took place two days before the scheduled commissioning date at the end of the 2021 fiscal year. The C-HGB consists of a warhead, a guidance system, cables and a protective heat shield. In August, Lt. Gen. Robert Rush, director of the Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office, said the Army was -really close- to deploying hypersonic weapons. But he cautioned that more tests would need to be conducted before any decision could be made about the future of the ground-based hypersonic missile. In May 2024, the US Navy conducted flight tests of an industrially produced missile in Hawaii. The tests were highly anticipated after a series of failed or aborted Common Hypersonic Glide Body tests. In 2023, the army and navy had to interrupt flight tests three times due to problems with the preparation of the missile for launch. As General Rush pointed out, it usually takes about ten years to develop missiles, but the hypersonic weapons program took only five years. According to him, it is necessary to make sure that -everything works-. If a decision is made to introduce a new weapon, there are strong strategic reasons for this.

In the Vovchansk direction, the enemy is increasing the number of reconnaissance drone flights	About this in broadcasts of the national telethon -Edyni Novyni- on September 15, the official representative of OTU -Kharkiv- Colonel Vitaly told Sarantsev. -This intensification of the use of enemy UAVs can be attributed to two factors. The first is to identify the location of positions of the Ukrainian Defense Forces for further strikes and intensification of further offensive actions. And the second is to work out routes for the movement of our own forces,- said Colonel Sarantsev. At the same time, according to the spokesman of the Kharkiv OTU, it is in the Vovchansk direction that there has been an increase in the number of desertion cases in the ranks of the occupying forces from the side of the soldiers of the invaders' army. -We have received information that such cases have become more frequent. Russian soldiers refuse to obey the combat orders of their commanders. Thanks to the successful actions of the Ukrainian military, which disrupted the logistics of the Russians, some of their units remain without the most necessary supplies: food, water, and ammunition,- Vitaly Sarantsev emphasized. At the same time, he emphasized the fact that in the Vovchan direction, the rotational actions carried out by the enemy do not always lead to the strengthening of the Russian army. Untrained recruits who do not understand elementary combat tasks get to the front line. As reported by ArmyInform, in Kharkiv region increased captured Russians.

Under the condition of attracting investments, the potential of defense production of Ukraine can re...	About this he said during a panel discussion at the Yalta European Strategy forum. Rustem Umyerov noted that Ukraine is able to significantly increase the production of military equipment and weapons, but for this, the support of foreign investors is needed. According to the Minister of Defense of Ukraine, the key needs of Ukraine remain timely financial and military assistance. -Last year we planned our production capabilities and determined how much we could jointly produce in the private and public sectors. Then our potential was 7 billion dollars. In 2025, we can triple this indicator,- said Rustem Umyerov. According to IOU estimates, under the conditions of additional financing, the potential of defense production can reach 20 billion dollars. -We are ready to open joint ventures with you. We can introduce you and connect you with any of our leaders to work together. This will give us the opportunity to increase our capabilities as well,- the Minister of Defense emphasized. He also emphasized that the capabilities of Ukraine's defense industry significantly exceed the amount of investments that the country can provide on its own. -Ukraine has already gained recognition in the world thanks to its courage. However, we have also excelled at being creative in difficult circumstances. The Ministry of Defense is ready to open joint ventures with partners. This will allow us to significantly increase our production capacity,- added Rustem Umyerov. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Rustem Umyerov took part in the European Defense Roundtable organized by the Munich Security Conference, and discussed with representatives of allied countries ways to counter the Russian threat.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/15/za-umovy-zaluchennya-investyczij-potenczial-oboronnogo-vyrobnycztva-ukrayiny-mozhe-dosyagty-20-mlrd-ministr-oborony/	2024-09-14T21:11:11-07:00

-Double blow-: on the army and the economy. Expert on the consequences of damage to enemy refineries	What is the effect of these attacks, how will it affect Russia's economy and its ability to continue to maintain the Russian Army's combat capability to wage a war of aggression against Ukraine? Military expert Petro Chernyk told ArmyInform about this: -We will divide this issue (strikes on the oil industry of the Russian Federation - ed.) into two parts. The first is the political and ideological part, and the second is purely technical and economic. In the political part, the myth that it is impossible to strike on the territory of Russia is finally dispelled. That is, a nuclear state cannot be struck, because it is not known what will happen. There is already the experience of the successful Kursk operation, and we have been hitting their oil industry for a good year and no nuclear apocalypse has happened. So, it turns out that it is possible to inflict fire damage on a nuclear state. To be fair, this is not the only case in history, as there are some experts who say it never happened. But, as it turns out, a similar situation has already happened, in 1982 non-nuclear Argentina attacked nuclear Britain, and Britain did not respond with nuclear weapons. By the way, the same Soviet Union survived an attack from the Chinese on Damansky Island in 1969, and no disaster happened either. That is, this ideological factor that it is possible to carry out complex strikes on their territory not only for military purposes, but especially for oil purposes, is very important.- We understand that as long as Russia sells oil abroad, as long as it lives as a country. That is, 40% of their budget is formed exclusively thanks to revenues from the oil and gas sector. The more strikes there, the less they will sell oil to foreign markets and receive hard currency. In this context, it is important to note that the Iskander-M missile has 27 foreign-made parts in its configuration. The Kh-47 -Kinzhal- missile has 130 foreign-made parts. And their most massive reconnaissance drone -Orlan-10- is half-equipped with foreign-made parts. That is, the less currency the Russians have, the less they will be able to purchase the necessary parts from which weapons will be made. Plus, fuel itself, as such, is one of the key aspects in today's war between the Russian Federation and Ukraine. After all, this is a war of military equipment, primarily heavy. Let me remind you that a T-90 tank consumes up to one ton of fuel and up to 100 kilograms of lubricant per day. If the enemy has around three thousand tanks along the demarcation line, then the Russians need three thousand fuel, in particular diesel, per day. Plus, the most elementary thing that worries us at the moment is enemy aviation. The same Su-34, Su-25, Su-24, Su-30 and so on. And plus enemy helicopters can also refuel with aviation kerosene. That is, to provide all this equipment, the occupiers need a lot of fuel resources. The most powerful blow that the Defense Forces of Ukraine inflicted was when an oil depot in the Rostov region of the Russian Federation burned for more than 9 days. There, first of all, tanks with aviation kerosene burned out. Of course, it is still a little early to say that the Ukrainian strikes will really affect their entire oil-refining sector of the Russian economy. After all, they have 30 large factories and 50 small ones, which is a lot. And in the area of ​​oil refining, Russians are definitely among the top three countries in the world. But the fact that this process (destruction or damage to enterprises of the oil and gas industry of the Russian Federation - ed.) is increasing and that each time they have fewer and fewer resources, for example, for oil processing, this is extremely important today. I will give an interesting example. If today there is a question of buying microelectronics, it can, of course, be bought on world markets in such a way that no one will understand who is buying it. Because it can be implemented, relatively speaking, through 5-10 procurement chains. Let's take a company from Iran. It ordered the necessary microelectronics from somewhere, say, Mexico, and the documents show that it is for household appliances. Then it (microelectronics - ed.) was taken and bought from the Americans and it got back to Iran. Who will control them? This is impossible to do. However, if a company in Paraguay were to come to Denmark, France, Germany and say -sell us the oil equipment- that has now burned down in Russia, it will become obvious to everyone who is the ultimate beneficiary and who is the ultimate buyer. Therefore, Russians will no longer be able to buy the necessary equipment on these global markets. And they cannot produce them themselves, especially atmospheric-vacuum pipes, where the distillation of oil and corresponding oil products takes place. Therefore, this (hitting Russian oil and gas industry enterprises - ed.) is simply a fantastic, wonderful, asymmetric response to our enemy. It (the answer - ed.) should grow and it will eventually give results. My favorite historical parallel. Hitler's Germany really fell when the Americans and the British destroyed 12 German plants for the production of synthetic gasoline. That's when things got bad for the Germans. Sooner or later, things will get bad for the Russians too.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/15/podvijnyj-udar-po-armiyi-ta-ekonomiczi-ekspert-pro-naslidky-urazhennya-vorozhyh-npz/	2024-09-14T20:30:27-07:00
Church Laundry Lies: Enemy Propaganda Does Not Fear God	Recently, fake information began to spread in social networks and on various pro-Kremlin Telegram channels that a laundry was allegedly opened in Lutsk in a church selected by the MP. As -evidence-, a photo of the church is attached, at the entrance of which the inscription -Clean - and Laundry- can be seen. StopFake investigators discovered that this is a photo of the bell tower of the Greek-Catholic Church of the Sending of the Holy Spirit in the city of Terebovlia, in the Ternopil region. A social laundry was opened there last year. According to notification of the Terebovlia City Council, the Greek Catholic parish was the winner of the mini-grant within the framework of the project -Development of social services for community cohesion to support IDPs and vulnerable groups at the parish level-. Parishioners monitored the situation in the community, drew up a map of needs and identified vulnerable categories of the population. They came to the conclusion that there is a need for a social laundry in Terebovla. After all, there are many seriously ill people in the community who need such a service and cannot take their clothes to Ternopil or Chortkiv. That is why they decided to implement such a social initiative. But the Russian agitprop decided to use this initiative to create another fake about the alleged -oppression- of the Moscow Patriarchate of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church and the -religious apocalypse- in Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/15/brehnya-pro-pralnyu-u-czerkvi-vorozha-propaganda-ne-boyitsya-boga/	2024-09-14T20:11:20-07:00
What is known about one of the first F-16 pilots: the story of the fallen officer Oleksiy Mesia	&#8230; The year is 2022. ZSU pilots Oleksiy Mes and Andriy Pilshchikov meet with American government officials to convince them: the Ukrainian army needs fighter jets. To strengthen the position of the pilots, they were then joined by Hollywood actor Sean Penn. &#8230; 2024 year. Already on board the F-16 in the sky of Ukraine, Oleksiy Mes repels a massive Russian combined air and missile strike. He destroyed three cruise missiles and one attack UAV — saving Ukrainians from enemy weapons. But, unfortunately, at the cost of his own life. What kind of officer was Mes and how he helped our state to become stronger and more effective in beating the enemy - in the ArmyInform material. Born on October 20, 1993 in Shepetivka, Khmelnytskyi. There he studied at a local school, which he graduated with a gold medal. Subsequently, he studied at the Kharkiv National University of the Air Force named after Ivan Kozhedub. Graduated from university in 2016. It is interesting that Mes and Andriy Pilshchikov with the call sign -Jus- were peers and studied together at KhNUPS. And died with a difference of 1 year and 1 day. -This is our issue, of which the whole of Ukraine and the Air Force are proud. I was lucky to be the instructor who gave him a ticket to the sky on the MiG-29 aircraft,- said Brigadier General Serhiy Golubtsov, Chief of Aviation of the Air Force Command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, at Oleksiy's farewell. Back in 2014, Mes went to Norway - at that time he was studying in the fourth year of KhNUPS. Told partners about participation in the OOS, exchanged experience, etc. And then there is the military service under the contract. He was enrolled in the personnel of the military unit in the position of squadron support commander - deputy commander of the operational group. In September 2022, the pilot was awarded the medal -For military service to Ukraine- - for personal courage and selfless actions shown in the defense of the state sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, loyalty to the military oath. The nickname -Moonfish- (-Fish-moon-) Mes got because of one of the curious cases, about which the man chose not to tell. As of June 2022, Mes was the commander of a squadron of Ukrainian MiG-29 fighters. At the age of 29, he had the rank of lieutenant colonel. Mes lobbied for the transfer of F-16 fighters to Ukraine. Pilots traveled to the United States, talked with the media and officials. He was fluent in English and could equally argue the need to protect the sky. -Moonfish- became the real face of Ukraine's F-16 lobbying campaign. Yes, back in June 2022, Ukrainian pilots flew to Washington to meet with members of the US Congress. There they spoke with Senator Mark Kelly, a former pilot and astronaut. After all, Moonfish was one of the first eight Ukrainian pilots to learn to fly the F-16 in Denmark in the fall of 2023. In September 2023, the Armed Forces wrote that an officer with the call sign -Moonfish- was undergoing F-16 training in Great Britain. He is one of those pilots called media. And after Juice and Moonfish met in Washington with Republican Congressman Adam Kinzinger, he introduced the Ukraine Fighter Pilots Act to the US House of Representatives. Moonfish was also one of the first Ukrainian pilots who went to the United States to learn how to fly the F-16. In September 2023, his training moved from the simulator cockpit to a real F-16 aircraft. At one time, Mes told about the training of Ukrainians on Western fighter jets on the air of a national telethon: -I would compare our planes that we have in our arsenal with the F-16 - it's like switching from a push-button phone to a 16th iPhone.- On August 26, 2024, the Russians launched another massive air-missile strike. Pilot Mesy on board the F-16 managed to destroy three cruise missiles and one attack UAV. -Aleksii saved Ukrainians from deadly Russian missiles. Unfortunately, at the cost of his own life. Oleksiy Mes was a strong and devoted soldier, a high-class pilot, a leader on earth and in the sky, a good friend, a loving son, father, husband, patriot of his country,- said the message of the Air Force Command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The soldier was buried on August 29. During the farewell ceremony, a pair of MiG-29 fighter jets paid tribute to the fallen pilot - Mesia's native MiGs, on which he began his pilot career. The pilot is survived by his wife Yulia, daughter, mother, father, sister. -His name was Oleksiy Mes, and he was the best pilot in Ukraine. He managed the entire F-16 project, he actually replaced the functional air attaché, he was a very funny guy and he loved his daughter very much. He was an excellent student who wanted to be a nuclear physicist and defended a research paper at the National Academy of Sciences about some incredible technology in dentistry,- recalls the officer, public activist Melania Podolyak. By order of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, lieutenant colonel Oleksiy Mesy was posthumously awarded the military rank of colonel. The reasons for the crash of the F-16 plane piloted by Oleksiy Mes are currently being investigated.

Hopelessness forces the occupiers to surrender: in Kharkiv Oblast, the number of captured Russians h...	Colonel Vitaly Sarantsev, the spokesman of Kharkiv OTU, told about this on the air of the national telethon -Yedini Novyni- . — The number is growing little by little. We report this in our daily summaries. This indicates that the enemy's personnel understands the complete hopelessness of their position and it has begun to dawn on them that in order to save their lives, they still need to raise their hands and surrender to the Ukrainian military, he said. The military emphasized that Ukraine strictly adheres to all norms of international law regarding the treatment of prisoners of war and called on Russian soldiers to surrender. — Unlike the Russians, we respect international humanitarian law. We treat prisoners normally and nothing terrible awaits them in captivity. Therefore, of course, we tolerate the enemy's decision to surrender and call on those who have not yet made a final decision to take an example from their comrades, the spokesman said. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that fighters of the 13th Special Forces Brigade -Charter- of the National Guard of Ukraine once again captured Russian servicemen in the Kharkiv direction.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/14/bezvyhid-zmushuye-okupantiv-zdavatysya-na-harkivshhyni-pobilshalo-polonenyh-rosiyan/	2024-09-14T12:03:52-07:00
Russians are fighting with people at public transport stops in the South	spokeon the air of the national telethon -Yedini Novyny- about the terror against civilians, which the invaders staged in the South of Ukraine. a> spokesman of the -Tavria- OUV, Captain Dmytro Lykhovii. — the Russians are already overstepping their bounds when they just plainly go to war with the civilian population just because they can. Over the course of yesterday, in addition to Kherson, they shelled 9 more settlements in the Kherson region. As a result, one civilian was killed, and 7 more civilians were injured, he said. Three more civilians were killed today as a result of an attack on an agricultural enterprise in Gulyajpilsk community in Zaporizhzhia. Also, civilian houses, private buildings, high-rise buildings, a school, a hospital canteen, a bus, and civilian cars were damaged as a result of enemy shelling. — In fact, they are fighting with public transport stops when a drop drone or an FPV drone or an impact drone flies there. Since he can't go back, and they don't see military goals there, they just attack civilians, in violation of all the Geneva Conventions, the spokesman said. The response to the terror of the Russian occupiers against civilians should be strengthening the means of radio-electronic warfare, strengthening anti-aircraft defense, and strengthening countermeasures against Russian UAVs. Also, the line of combat should be pushed as far away from Kherson as possible, so that the Russians have as few opportunities as possible to shell the regional center. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in Kherson two people were injured as a result of the Russian shelling.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/14/iz-lyudmy-na-zupynkah-gromadskogo-transportu-voyuyut-rosiyany-na-pivdni/	2024-09-14T11:49:56-07:00
In the north of Kharkiv Oblast, the enemy was terrorized by FPV drones	Colonel Vitaly Sarantsev, the spokesman of Kharkiv OTU, told about this on the air of the national telethon -Yedini Novyni- . — The extreme activity of our FPV drones prevents the enemy from making any movements, providing logistical support to units. The enemy there in the forward positions does not receive provisions or water, does not replenish ammunition stocks, he said. As a result, desertion and refusal to obey orders are becoming more common among enemy personnel, because it is extremely difficult for the occupiers to carry out any tasks due to the effective actions of Ukrainian drones. At the same time, the spokesman noted that the Ukrainian defenders do not have a complete advantage over the enemy in the use of drones - it is more about parity. — Both sides quite actively use this type of ammunition. We have 30 to 40 strikes per day, which are done precisely with the help of FPV drones. Therefore, it is difficult to say about any advantage in the air, it would be more correct to note that this is a certain parity in this armament, said Vitaly Sarantsev. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that ->in the north of Kharkiv Oblast, Ukrainian drones put the invaders on starvation rations, resulting in extremely high losses Russian soldiers increasingly resort to desertion.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/14/na-pivnochi-harkivshhyny-voroga-zakoshmaryly-fpv-dronamy/	2024-09-14T11:32:53-07:00
Summonses are being prepared to be served automatically: what is known	the head of the Department of Information Technologies of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine Oleg Berestovy told about this in DOU Podcast. -How are subpoenas being issued now? They are written out by hand, printed, and then the stack of paper comes to the head of the TCC, who must sign them, put a seal, and then the summonses are distributed. This is an inefficient process. That is why we have now created a function so that the summons can be generated in the -Oberig- registry, signed with the electronic signature of the head of the TCC, and not even printed directly in the TCC. It will go immediately to centralized printing, from there to Ukrposhta, it will deliver it, and we will have information on where the summons is located: whether it was delivered or not, whether it was lost somewhere, how long it took for delivery, etc.,- explains Oleg Berestovy . According to him, the process will be transparent and -it will allow the military-political leadership to have more relevant information than is available now.- -In order to understand the -funnel-, at which stage we are and what needs to be decided in order to expand the -funnel- in the end,- emphasizes Oleg Berestovy. And he adds: -Accordingly, when you sign this summons with an electronic signature, there won't be any signature signature; and you should be sure that you were not sent some kind of phishing or something, and that your TCC did indeed sign this subpoena. Therefore, Rezerv+ will have a function: how to use a QR scanner to check whether the head of the TCC really signed this summons, whether it is legal, valid, legal and no one else signed it on the way to the bus stop. This is a function that will allow to protect a person as a conscript.- Also, Oleg Berestovy emphasized once again that there will be no summons to Reserve+. -We are not planning this. We have a backlog until the middle of spring - there are no subpoenas. But we are planning to develop functionality to at least slightly automate and civilize the delivery of summons with the help of Ukrposhta and certain automated processes on the backend,- summarized the head of the IT Department of the Ministry of Education and Culture. As ArmiyaInform wrote, users of the Rezerv+ application will be able to check the authenticity of the written summons received from the TCC and SP.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/14/povistky-gotuyutsya-vruchaty-avtomatychno-shho-vidomo/	2024-09-14T11:15:56-07:00

The stigma of the captive: why Russians choose suicide over captivity	The reasons for the reckless behavior of the occupiers on the battlefield on the air of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon explained by the commander of the BPAC shock battalion - Achilles- of the 92nd separate assault brigade named after the basket chieftain Ivan Sirk, captain Yury Fedorenko. According to him, Russians surrender only when they have no other choice and they cannot even commit suicide - shoot themselves or blow themselves up with a grenade. One of the main reasons for this behavior of the occupiers is intimidation by Russian propaganda, which tells about the fictitious abuses that Russians allegedly suffer in Ukrainian captivity. - This shows that the Russian occupier has very, very much, and, I will emphasize once again for the third time - very much! — the propaganda machine is working powerfully. They either do not see or do not want to see how, for example, exchanges of prisoners of war take place. What Ukraine gives - with such well-fed faces, polished teeth and in the body, so-called. That is, they deal with people. And who are given to us — tortured, murdered, emaciated, where the occupier deliberately works to deprive them of their health and, as a result, after release from captivity, so that a person loses his life as well, - said the military man. As a result, Russians are simply afraid to surrender. Having believed the false propaganda, they believe that the Ukrainians will mock and abuse them. — Accordingly, the propaganda machine in the Russian Federation works in such a way that the occupier is objectively afraid to surrender, because he thinks that we do not follow international rules and norms, in particular the convention. That we will face. This is not true, - Yuriy Fedorenko emphasized. The second reason for the reluctance of Russian soldiers to surrender is even more interesting. It consists in the fear of returning to Russia for exchanges and being condemned and abused already there. -It is scary enough for the enemy to surrender, because he understands that even after the exchange, he will be abused already on the territory of the Russian Federation,- explained the commander of the Ukrainian drones. This is what forces the occupiers to choose suicide between captivity and suicide. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in the Kharkiv direction, the Russian command involves military personnel in the conduct of hostilities.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/14/tavro-polonenogo-chomu-rosiyany-obyrayut-samogubstvo-zamist-polonu/	2024-09-14T10:43:02-07:00
In the Zaporozhye direction, the enemy lacks forces for assault operations	The reasons for the decrease in the offensive activity of the enemy in the Zaporizhzhia direction on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyni- explained the spokesperson of the OUV - Tavria- captain Dmytro Lykhovii. - The number of combat clashes and assaults on the part of Muscovites can be counted on the fingers of one hand. For example, today until 4 p.m. they were not there at all. Yesterday, there were also none for the whole day, and in the three previous days there were only four of them, he said. The reason for the relative calm, compared to a number of other directions, is a significant lack of resources and reserves for the occupiers to storm in several directions at the same time. — Of course, Pokrovsky and Kurakhiv directions in the Donetsk region are now a priority for them. In addition, they have a huge area of ​​responsibility and, for many reasons, they need to transfer units to the Kursk direction, where they strengthen their forces in order to somehow respond to the offensive of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the spokesman said. In view of this, the occupiers were forced to transfer their forces from the Zaporozhye direction to other, more important for them directions of hostilities. — From the Zaporizhzhia region a few weeks ago - you can say she acted as a donor - they partially took units at the level of battalions, regiments, and brigades. That is why they are undergoing a certain reorganization, such an operational pause, Dmytro Lykhova said. At the same time, this does not mean that hostilities in Zaporozhye have completely stopped. The calm there can only be considered relative against the background of other directions. — The enemy is actively using all types of damage — artillery, missile weapons, attack drones, anti-aircraft missiles. Yesterday, 10 guided aerial bombs and 50 unguided aerial missiles flew in the direction of Orihiv. Today, the enemy has already carried out 2 airstrikes in the direction of Orihiv, closer to Zaporizhzhia, and, unfortunately, the civilian population and civilian infrastructure are suffering. Three civilians were killed today as a result of an attack on an agricultural enterprise in the Gulyajpil community, said the spokesman of the -Tavria- OUV. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that ->in the South, the occupiers rush to the Dnipro - attack with a whole zoo of brigades and regiments.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/14/na-zaporizkomu-napryamku-vorogu-brakuye-syl-dlya-shturmovyh-dij/	2024-09-14T10:33:24-07:00
One step before assaults: how conscripts are used in the Russian army in the Kharkiv direction	Exactly how the Russian command uses them on the air of the national telethon -Yedini Novyni- explained the spokesman of the OTU -Kharkiv- Colonel Vitaly Sarantsev. — The adversary began to use conscripts, this is indeed confirmed by intelligence data and other sources. But this does not mean that there are massive use of military personnel and that they throw them on assaults. These are conscripts who perform logistics tasks, serve as drivers or perform some other task, he said. Currently, there are no conscript soldiers of the Russian army directly on the contact line in the assault units in the combat zone. -But they are located in territories that border on non-attacked areas, they perform territory control tasks, communication tasks and many other tasks that are not directly related to the conduct of hostilities,- explained the spokesman. At the same time, he noted that the personnel of enemy units involved in hostilities in the north of Kharkiv Region have an extremely low level of training and motivation. In particular, we are talking about servicemen of the Russian Federation, who replenished the losses in the Vovchansk region. — They don't have enough experience, they don't even know how to orient themselves in a certain way in the local area. This indicates that the adversary is already trying to squeeze everything he has into this direction that is important to him. He tries everything to plug his holes both in defense and in those units that engage in active offensive actions, Vitaliy Sarantsev emphasized. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in the Kharkiv direction, the Russian occupation forces began to recruit conscript soldiers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/14/za-krok-do-shturmiv-yak-vykorystovuyut-strokovykiv-v-armiyi-rf-na-harkivskomu-napryamku/	2024-09-14T10:18:06-07:00
Digital recruiting will be launched in Ukraine: the first details from the Ministry of Defense	the head of the Department of Information Technologies of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine Oleg Berestovy told about this in DOU Podcast. -Now, for example, it is possible to sign contracts directly with military units. For this function, we are currently doing digital recruiting in Reserve+. We want to gamify this story a little - there will be swipes, a match with brigades (smiles - ed). But first there are more urgent tasks - and then we will gamify,- said Oleg Berestovy. The pre-release stage of digital recruiting, according to the head of the IT Department of the MoU, should be -from week to week.- As ArmyInform wrote, as of the beginning of September 2024 -profesiyi/->there are about 4,000 vacancies in the Defense Forces of Ukraine. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/14/v-ukrayini-zapustyat-czyfrovyj-rekrutyng-pershi-detali-vid-minoborony/	2024-09-14T10:03:08-07:00
Mass withdrawal of Russian missile carriers in the Black Sea: the Navy explained what this threatens	The spokesperson of the Navy of Ukraine stated this in -Suspilne.Novyny- air captain 3rd rank Dmytro Pletenchuk. -Probably, if the eighth missile carrier was not currently undergoing repairs in Novorossiysk, they would have taken it out to sea as well. But I can't say that this somehow affects the security level now,- he said. However, according to him, these are missile carriers, so the threat of their use remains. It should be taken into account. -But it was also preserved when they were directly at the Novorossiy base. Because it is a matter of a few hours to go to an external raid and shoot. This does not affect the overall distribution of forces and the situation. At least I haven't seen such reasons yet,- assured Dmytro Pletenchuk. The spokesman of the Navy noted that later we will find out the real reasons why the leadership of the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation made such a decision. He explained that Russia usually uses Kalibr from the Black Sea in order to maximally load Ukrainian air defense units. -The technical characteristics of these missiles actually no longer allow them to be used as a separate weapon. That is, the Ukrainian air defense has learned to fight them skillfully. The last shot down of the use of such missiles was 100%. There were more than 20 of them,- the Navy spokesman recalled. As reported by ArmyInform, on September 14, the occupiers took an unusually large number of ships into the Black Sea, including Caliber carriers. In the Black Sea there are 16 enemy ships, 7 of which are carriers of Kalibr cruise missiles with a total salvo of up to 48 missiles. There are 5 enemy ships in the Mediterranean Sea, four of which are -caliber- carriers with a total volley of up to 24 missiles.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/14/masove-vyvedennya-rosijskyh-raketonosiyiv-u-chorne-more-u-vms-poyasnyly-chym-cze-zagrozhuye/	2024-09-14T09:53:25-07:00

There were 5 storms yesterday, he said. Obviously, the spokesman suggested, the enemy is trying to get as close as possible to the Dnieper and take control of its main course. — He throws additional forces there. It can be observed that Russian units from the 144th Motorized Rifle Brigade, 205th Motorized Rifle Brigade, 337th Airborne Assault Regiment, 28th Motorized Rifle Regiment, 126th Separate Coastal Defense Brigade and the 61st Marine Brigade are participating in these battles for the islands. This is how a variety of Russian security forces from different structures of their occupation army are involved in solving certain tasks on the Left Bank of the Dnieper and on the islands, Dmytro Lykhova said. The spokesman suggested that the aim of the occupiers is to get closer to Kherson in order to further increase the shelling of the city. Earlier, ArmyInform reported on a sharp escalation in difficult terrain near the Dnipro: 60 enemy assaults took place over the past week.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/14/na-pivdni-okupanty-rvutsya-do-dnipra-atakuyut-czilym-zooparkom-brygad-i-polkiv/	2024-09-14T09:42:11-07:00

Polish tanks crush the Russians – PT-91 Twardy successfully repulse -meaty- assaults	This is discussed in the ArmiyaTV story. The PT-91 Twardy battle tank is a licensed version of the Soviet T-72M1, which was produced in Poland. It is noted that, unlike the Soviet prototype, -Twardy- received several modernizations. According to the commander of the vehicle, when the Russians once again resort to meat assaults, it is the -Twardy- that drives them away, equipped with new armor and a modern fire control system. In particular, Polish developers installed new gun stabilizers and a gunner's thermal sight. One of these tanks was given the call sign - -Grandfather-. When asked by a journalist how the PT-91 Twardy differs from the T-72, one of the crew members answers: -The difference is in the engine, it is more boosted and more powerful than the 72's. Well, you can see for yourself by the active armor: this is not -Kontakt-1-, not -Kontakt-2-. This is Polish armor, which they patented here,- says the army man. Our military learned to manage these units in Poland for 40 days. The targets on which our tankers work are mainly enemy infantry. -They arrange enemy assaults, attack with infantry. They crawl like locusts. Therefore, on foot. -Shooting- with a high-explosive fragmentation projectile is a -hooray,- comments a military man. As ArmiyaInform wrote, today Ukraine celebrates the Day of Tank Troops of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces General Olexander Syrsky congratulated the soldiers -tankers, reminding that tank troops are the steel fist of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/14/polski-tanky-nyshhat-rosiyan-pt-91-twardy-rezultatyvno-vidbyvayut-myasni-shturmy/	2024-09-14T08:52:45-07:00
The Ministry of Defense is preparing to launch automated postponements of mobilization	the head of the Department of Information Technologies of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine Oleg Berestovy told about this in DOU Podcast. -Automated deferrals are a hot topic. I understand that this is necessary, first of all, out of respect for those people who need it. And for release from work, which can not be done in the TCC. For example: people with disabilities. If the state knows about you that you have a certain group of disabilities and you are not suitable for service a priori, then why reconfirm, regularly pass the VLK? It is necessary to regulate both normatively and technically. We are working on it. We know how to do it, and in the coming weeks we will approach it,- said Oleg Berestovy. Also, according to him, automated deferrals will apply to guardians of three or more children. And also — deferrals for people who are studying, getting their first higher education. In addition, Oleg Berestovy called online military registration another important and popular function. As ArmyInform wrote, at the end of August the Verkhovna Rada supported in general draft law No. 11391 on expanding the range of conscripts who have the right to postpone conscription for military service during mobilization.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/14/minoborony-gotuye-zapusk-avtomatyzovanyh-vidstrochok-vid-mobilizacziyi/	2024-09-14T08:22:52-07:00
We are fighting for the security of the entire European continent — Rustem Umyerov	He informs about this14 September in social networks. -We are fighting for the security of the entire European continent, and our needs remain the same. First of all, this is an acceleration and increase in the amount of military aid: equipment, projectiles, long-range ammunition, mines and demining means, EW systems, spare parts,- he said. According to him, a critically important topic is the strengthening of Ukrainian air defense forces to protect critical infrastructure from Russian terrorist attacks. -We need not only more air defense systems, but also a reliable supply of ammunition for them,- Rustem Umyerov emphasized. He recalled that in August, Ukraine used F-16 aircraft for the first time to repel a massive air attack. The Minister of Defense of Ukraine hopes for the expansion of pilot training programs and the timely replenishment of the stocks of guided air missiles. -Also, more and more of our partners share the position of giving Ukraine the opportunity to strike with long-range Western-made weapons at military facilities on the territory of the Russian Federation. I thank the organizers and participants for their constant support of Ukraine on the way to victory,- he summarized. Earlier ArmyInform reported that the Minister of Defense of Ukraine met with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Lithuania. Rustem Umerov discussed with Gabrielus Landsbergis the situation at the front, as well as the daily shelling of our cities, during which the enemy continues to kill civilians. Also today, the head of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense met with the delegation headed by the Minister of Defense of Denmark Troels Lund Poulsen.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/14/my-boremosya-za-bezpeku-usogo-yevropejskogo-kontynentu-rustem-umyerov/	2024-09-14T08:03:21-07:00
by Russian air defense systems — across Russia: as a result of the Kursk operation, the enemy is she...	Vadim Mysnyk, the spokesman of OTU -Siversk- drew attention to this on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- . — During the past day, the enemy carried out 82 shellings on the territory of Chernihiv and Sumy regions. And on the territory of the district of the Kursk region, which is controlled by the Defense Forces, there were 127 shellings, including 37 anti-aircraft missiles, he said. This indicates that one of the tasks of the Kursk operation has been achieved - the enemy is forced to strike more intensively on its own territory, instead of shelling Ukrainian settlements. True, the Russian aggressors did not completely abandon the tactics of shelling the Ukrainian border. For this purpose, the enemy mainly uses weapons that can strike from deep within the territory, because units of the Defense Forces of Ukraine do not allow him to approach the border. — As for the Sumy direction, there are certain results of the Kursk operation. The enemy is trying to increase the intensity of shelling, but we also take our measures in response and do not allow him to hit our territory, the spokesman emphasized. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that Defense Forces forced the enemy to practically abandon the use of DRG in Sumshchyna, their zajmayutsya-drg/->detected with the help of UAVs and other technical means of monitoring the area. Therefore, Russian saboteurs on the northern border focused on mining area. Instead, thanks to the Kursk operation, Ukrainian defenders are able to significantly strengthen border protection in Sumshchyna /a>.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/14/rosijskymy-kabamy-po-rosiyi-vnaslidok-kurskoyi-operacziyi-vorog-obstrilyuye-vlasnu-terytoriyu/	2024-09-14T07:52:31-07:00

Now, according to various estimates, there are 30,000 to 45,000. That is, we see that there are results. The enemy is trying to pull up (reserves — ed.) to slow down our offensive actions and in general what we are doing on the territory of Kurshchyna,- commented Vadim Mysnyk.

Suicide on the battlefield: Russians shoot through -akhmat-	How is this related to the frequent suicides of Russian soldiers on the battlefield in the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon broadcast explained the commander of the battalion of shock air defense systems -Achilles- of the 92nd separate assault brigade named after the basket captain Ivan Sirk, captain Yury Fedorenko. The military said that the professionally trained -Akhmatians- do not fight on the front line. Instead, the appearance of -akhmat- units in a certain direction indicates a low level of motivation and discipline among regular Russian occupation troops. - Where -Ahmat- appears - there are problems in the troops, which they have to solve at the expense of a system of coercion, humiliation and destruction of servicemen of the Russian occupation forces, actually carrying out punishment directly on the battlefield, he said. As a result of such a system, it is easier for Russian soldiers to shoot themselves than to retreat without completing the task, because in the near rear they will be abused, tortured or even executed by the -Akhmatians-. — That is why you can often see a video published on social networks, when the occupier, having received an insignificant injury, for example, to the lower limbs, commits suicide by shooting himself in the head. It is easier for him to die on the battlefield than to return without completing the task to the rear. This result is ensured by the -Ahmat- unit, Yuriy Fedorenko explained. He noted that the Russian soldiers had only two options left - either to die on the battlefield or to be executed by the -Akhmatians-. - How long will the Russians tolerate that this very unit can do whatever they want with them, like with dolls - it's their choice, to die in Ukraine or at the hands of the -Akhmatians-, - concluded the drone commander. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in Kharkiv region, the Russians attack with -barracks- according to the Donetsk scenario, but the Defense Forces destroy 90% of the enemy's armored vehicles and 60-70% of the infantry.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/14/samogubstvo-na-poli-boyu-rosiyany-strilyayutsya-cherez-ahmat/	2024-09-14T02:50:42-07:00

Defense Minister Rustem Umyerov held talks with his Danish counterpart	This was reported by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. -He thanked the government and the people of Denmark for their faith in the victory of Ukraine and their significant contribution to the fight against the aggressor. Denmark became the first country to invest in the development of Ukraine's defense industry — we call it the -Danish model.- In particular, it directly financed the production of Ukrainian equipment for more than 50 million euros. We discussed the dynamics on the battlefield, the enemy's plans and our urgent needs,- Rustem Umyerov said. He reminded: every day the Russian aviation carries out about 200 sorties and launches up to 150 bombs. -To stop Russia's air superiority, we need to strengthen air defense, we need air superiority. Denmark plays a key role in this by training our pilots and has also provided the F-16s, which have already proven their effectiveness. I am grateful to Denmark for its strong support and am confident that our cooperation will help ensure a free future for Ukraine and Europe,- the Minister of Defense noted.

-Fin- and his Norwegian Leopard: battles in Zaporizhzhia, tricks of the Russians in the East and the...	During the war, -Fin- worked in the banking sector for the third year, before the large-scale invasion of Russia. After the mobilization, he took part in the Kharkiv operation, fought in Zaporozhye during the counteroffensive last year, and now he is in Donetsk region, together with his comrades, destroying the enemy on Leopard 2A4 tanks. -Fin- was among the first tankers who started working on German tanks that arrived in Ukraine last year from Western partners. ArmyInform tells its story on the occasion of Tank Troops Day. — I encountered a large-scale invasion at home in the Buchansky district of the Kyiv region. Heard how they started bombing Gostomel airport. The first explosion occurred at approximately 5:30 am. -Then I ran out into the street, and within a few minutes I learned from the news that the war had begun,- the serviceman recalls. -Fin- studied banking and graduated from the military department as a tank platoon commander. After studying, he worked in a bank, and already in October 2022 he was mobilized and assigned to the tank platoon commander, then still in the 4th tank brigade: - At first, they worked with T-64 and T-72 tanks. These were our main tanks, working in the Kharkiv direction. Later, -Fin- was offered to go to study on foreign equipment, while at first they were not even informed that it would be Leopard tanks. - Later we were already informed that we were going to study on foreign equipment, namely on Leopard 2A4 tanks. The training took place in Poland for about 40 days. -Fin- assures that this term is enough to master new tanks, because all servicemen already had significant combat experience. — Many who passed through Bakhmut took part in the Kharkiv operation. Tanks almost all go the same way. And it was very easy for us, as we just started studying, adds -Fin-. In Poland, he was trained on a Polish tank, and when he returned to Ukraine, he got one of the Leopards that Norway gave him. Currently, a whole tank coalition of countries is working, which transfers tanks of various modifications to Ukraine. — Tanks from different countries are slightly different in equipment, have different machine guns. There is also a difference in the devices, -night lights-, some of which have rear view cameras. But in general, the differences are not such that they cannot be understood or require additional training, explains -Fin-. His unit has been working at Leopards for a year and a half. -Fin- received one of the first such tanks that arrived in Ukraine. — I had my first combat use on this tank during a counteroffensive in the Zaporizhzhia region in 2023, the settlement of Mala Tokmachka. They went on the attack, started working. The enemy fired heavily at us, using FPV drones a lot. In the end, we completed the task and retreated to more advantageous positions to save the lives of the crew, save the equipment, the tank remained intact, - recalls -Fin-. After such an attack, many traces of artillery shells remained on the equipment. Tankers say that the Russians, on the one hand, are afraid of the Leopards, but on the other hand, they also hunt them, consider Western equipment a priority target. — There were cases of drone strikes, the commander of a tank with the call sign -Chechen- was killed in mine. He was hit by a -lancet- directly in the commander's hatch, he died on the spot. The crew survived, but the commander died, says -Fin-. Currently, the tanks of the 33rd brigade are performing combat tasks in the eastern direction and are holding back the advance of the Russian invaders. — the Russians are constantly trying to trick us. But we are not the first day in the war, so we know their tricks. -Leopards- are used precisely in tank battles, we engage in direct fire so that the target is 2.5-3 kilometers away, - notes -Fin-, and about Russian -analogovnet- tanks, such as the T-90M -Proryv-, says the following: — Tanks are all destroyed, all are burning. The key is knowing where to shoot. Crews are officially paid for each destroyed unit of enemy equipment. It's also an added motivation to destroy them more. — One of the crews destroyed two BMPs at once. They left and worked very quickly. -Leopard- has an excellent sight, sees far, plus speed. They just saw two BMPs in an open area and immediately stopped them with two shots. After that, they immediately rolled back -into a hole- so that neither artillery nor drones could catch up. We work at speed: there is a task, there is a goal, we worked quickly and hid, explains -Fin-. He adds that the Soviet tanks, which are also in the armed brigade, mainly work from closed positions, that is, as artillery and cover. — Nowadays, we often conduct training, because we do not know what will await us in the future. We may have to ford or ford a river. Bridges are often blown up, and we have to be ready for that, says the tank company commander. Currently, the 33rd brigade is also actively recruiting, in addition, experienced commanders can already train new arrivals themselves. — There is still a lack of highly qualified personnel, namely tank commanders. We have guys who were anti-tank fighters who joined us. We ourselves trained them on the training grounds, and now they skillfully perform combat tasks. That is, they were anti-tankers, but they became tankers. Tankers who work on foreign equipment constantly exchange experience in the operation of tanks and their use in combat operations. — My colleague studied in Britain on Challenger tanks, and we constantly exchange information about what we or they are better at, what are our weaknesses. We support the contact. -Fin- emphasizes that an important quality for a tanker is the ability to work in a crew. — The crew is one unit, they must work together. There has to be trust between them in order to move out and complete the task. And you also need perseverance to study, to learn the technique. Constantly working and training. There are no longer any height requirements. -I have a platoon leader who is 192 cm tall and he's quite comfortable,- adds -Fin- with a smile.

Distinguishes drones from birds: what is known about the radars that the Netherlands will transfer t...	As reported ArmyInform, the corresponding contract was arranged by the Ministry of Defense of the Kingdom with Robin Radar Systems in The Hague. Robin Radar Systems radars are designed to detect small drones, distinguishing them from other objects such as birds. A unique feature of certain radar samples from the Dutch manufacturer is their ability to work while driving on a vehicle, which ensures increased operational capabilities. The mobile nature of these radars makes them difficult for adversaries to detect and neutralize, providing continuous detection of air threats. These radars will play a crucial role in countering Russian drone attacks, providing a significant defense capability for Ukraine. The MAX, ELVIRA and IRIS radars offered by Robin Radar Systems provide advanced drone detection and tracking solutions suitable for a variety of environments. With its 360-degree 3D coverage, the MAX radar can detect and track thousands of moving objects simultaneously, providing real-time updates and accurate data through rapid rotation. Designed for airports and wind farms, it is particularly suitable for environments where flight safety is critical. ELVIRA, a 2D radar specifically designed for drone detection, uses advanced technologies such as micro-Doppler classification to effectively distinguish UAVs from other objects while offering easy integration with command and control systems. Robin Radar Iris® is a short-range X-band 3D radar designed for drone detection and identification. It is a frequency-modulated continuous-wave radar with two independent radio frequency systems, two pairs of antennas diametrically opposed to transmit and receive. IRIS is a lightweight 3D radar that deploys in less than 15 minutes and can detect drones at speeds of up to 100 km/h, making it ideal for rapid deployment in the field. The weight of these radars is 29 kg, they deploy in 15 minutes and provide a circular view, the instrument range of which is up to 5 km. The systems can detect UAVs weighing 3 kg from a distance of 4 km and 1.4 kg from 2 km. -This three-coordinate radar operates in the X-Band range, that is, at a wavelength of 3.75-2.5 cm and at a frequency of 8-12 GHz. The beam width is 6 degrees and the scan speed is 1 second, the analysts said. -As for the ability to work while driving, speeds up to 100 km/h and angles up to 10 degrees are allowed.- Also exists project integration of Robin Radar's IRIS with OpenWorks Engineering's Vision Flex CUAS optical autonomous surveillance system, which increases the effectiveness of target detection and recognition. Experts from IKK Defense Express believe that these small-sized installations will be an ideal addition to the work of small fire groups , which are engaged in identifying targets. They can also come in handy for cover from threats during marches, experts emphasize. In the context of the war in Ukraine, where drones are increasingly being used for reconnaissance and attacks, these radars will help provide valuable capabilities to counter the aerial threat. Their ability to quickly detect, track and classify drones will allow Ukrainian forces to better anticipate and neutralize drone attacks, strengthening their defenses against airstrikes.

Throw a shadow on NATO to hide its hybrid attacks: how and why Russia lies about UAVs	The purpose of this narrative is obvious — to show the Russians as if they are fighting against the entire -Western world- and to accuse Ukraine's partners of escalation. Information is being actively circulated in the Russian information space that the territory of NATO countries is allegedly being used by the Armed Forces to launch UAVs. For example, during the drone attack on the Murmansk region on September 11, Russian information launderers spread the news that one of the Ukrainian UAVs had arrived from the territory of Norway, a NATO member. The Kremlin has long sought to involve NATO in a war in order to lose not only Ukraine, but the entire -collective west-. According to the Kremlin dictator, such a reason for the unsuccessful completion of -svo- should have satisfied the domestic Russian audience. That is why Russian drones and missiles have repeatedly invaded the airspace of at least five NATO member states and two other European states. Moldova, which is particularly suffering from the consequences of Russian attacks, has repeatedly recorded cases of missile and drone debris falling on its territory, and Romania even activates the air alarm signal during Russian air attacks and has built shelters in border areas. On September 7, the Russian-Iranian -shahed- fell for the first time in Latvia, as a result of which the country announced the strengthening of air defense on its eastern borders. It is no secret for Ukraine that Russia has been waging a hybrid war against the entire civilized world for a long time. This is manifested in cyber attacks, systematic violation of airspace by fighter jets, particularly over the Baltic Sea, aggressive propaganda through the media and the church, funding of pro-Russian organizations and individual politicians. And the West's accusations of escalation, which periodically come from the Russians, are just an attempt to shift responsibility for their actions onto someone else.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/14/kynuty-tin-na-nato-shhob-pryhovaty-svoyi-gibrydni-ataky-yak-i-chomu-rosiya-breshe-pro-bpla/	2024-09-13T20:13:32-07:00
Utility discount in a few clicks: how to issue a discount remotely	ArmyInform tells who can use this service and what needs to be done. Previously, beneficiaries had to submit several applications. The first is about registering a war veteran, and the second is actually about assigning a benefit for housing and communal services. Currently, one application is submitted. And it's simplified. The point is that a significant amount of data is now collected automatically through electronic information exchange between public registries. By the way, family members of a veteran can apply for benefits. This can be done both by those who have already retired from the ranks of the Defense Forces of Ukraine, and by those who are still serving. For the latter, such an option can come in handy, because it is not so easy to personally visit various government institutions during service. Vacations are not big enough to waste time on. The result of the application review can be tracked in the section -My applications- - -application status-. Currently, the benefit for the payment of housing and communal services is provided in cash. By default, the Pension Fund can open an account in Oschadbank and inform the beneficiary about it. And the beneficiary must sign the bank account agreement. If you want the money to be transferred to an account in another bank, you need to apply to the territorial body of the Pension Fund. For registration, you need to provide your account, where the money will be deposited. It usually takes some time for registration and billing. But later the money comes. In general, the benefit involves the following process - you pay the full amount for housing and communal services, which are indicated in the payments. But you receive funds on the card in the form of compensation. It should be remembered that if you do not pay for the utility bill, the benefits may stop. We would like to remind you that the discount on the payment of housing and communal services is not the only benefit provided to the participants of hostilities. More about social guarantees read here. If you have not yet registered the status of a combatant, but there are grounds for its registration, we also wrote about the options how UBD can be issued now.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/14/znyzhka-na-komunalku-v-dekilka-klikiv-yak-oformyty-pilgu-dystanczijno/	2024-09-13T20:00:45-07:00
In Poland, the NATO-Ukraine JATEC Center - Ministry of Defense officially started its work	About this reported on September 13 by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. The decision to create JATEC was approved at the NATO summit in Washington in July this year. The center is located in the Polish city of Bydgoszcz. -The joint center with NATO will help Ukraine not only to implement procedures, approaches and standards, but also to share its own experience. Interoperability is one of our main goals and we are taking concrete steps for it. We have submitted our proposals for the implementation of the projects and are waiting for substantive decisions,- Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Stanislav Hayder commented on the event. Assistant Secretary General of the Alliance Thomas Goffus, Commander of the NATO Strategic Command for Transformations General Philippe Lavin, First Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Polish Armed Forces, Major General Karol Dymanovsky, Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine for European Integration Oleksandr Balanutsa took part in the negotiations in Poland. The parties legally established the creation of the Center and outlined its main tasks, structure, roles and functions of the management team. The work of JATEC is aimed at achieving interoperability of the security and defense institutions of Ukraine with the relevant institutions of the Alliance, improving the quality of education, increasing the analytical component and training personnel. The parties agreed that the establishment of the Center should be formally completed in October-November of this year. -The opening of a joint center with NATO is a real step towards the integration of Ukraine into the structure of the Alliance. Membership in NATO is not a political slogan, but the implementation of specific projects. We are gradually moving towards becoming a full-fledged part of the bloc, and the opening of JATEC brings us closer to this,- Oleksandr Balanutsa said during the event. Another topic of negotiations is ensuring the work of the Center, namely the need to provide resources from NATO for the implementation of measures and the development of an information and communication network.

Exposure, suspicion, special investigation: law enforcement officers in the Kupyan region worked har...	The law enforcement officers exposed a 49-year-old woman who worked as a clerk in the occupation administration. During the capture of the village of Dvorichna in the Kupyan District, a local resident voluntarily supported the Russian invaders. She assumed the position of -executive chief specialist of the paperwork sector of the Dvurechan territorial administration of the Temporary Civil Administration of the Kupyan district of the Kharkiv region.- The woman organized the documents and their further verification, formed cases and handed them over to the leadership of the occupation administration. Also, an official of the occupation administration was engaged in the formation of applications from local residents for further payment of -material aid- in Russian rubles. After the liberation of the district from the Russian invaders, the accomplice of the occupiers tried to avoid legal responsibility, but she was exposed. Also, the prosecutor's office in absentia notified about suspicion due to the fact of collaborative activity to a 37-year-old man who helped invaders to -legally take- Ukrainian enterprises into the property of the Russian Federation. During the occupation of the city of Kupyansk, he voluntarily agreed to cooperate with the Russian invaders, and in July 2022 he deliberately assumed the position of -executive chief specialist of the Department of Economic Development of the Military-Gradient Administration of the Kupyan District of the Kharkiv Region.- The man, on the instructions of the occupation leadership, carried out an inventory of communal and state enterprises, and also drew up -reports- based on its results. On the basis of these -documents-, the occupiers have already illegally transferred captured Ukrainian enterprises to the property of the aggressor state. Before the de-occupation of Kharkiv Oblast by the Defense Forces of Ukraine, the collaborator fled to the Russian Federation together with the Russian military. Law enforcement officers raised the issue of declaring him wanted. Also, the prosecutors completed a special investigation and sent to the court an indictment against the Kupyan city council member for the fact of collaborative activity. During the occupation of the city by the armed forces of the Russian Federation, she voluntarily cooperated with the Russian occupiers. In July 2022, the invaders appointed a woman to the position of -and. at. chief physician of the communal enterprise -Kupyanskoe territorial medical association- of the Ministry of Health of the Kharkiv Oblast Regional State Administration. Before the large-scale invasion of the Russian Federation into Ukraine, the woman worked as a cardiologist, so she had relevant work experience and skills that she used when working for the invaders. The newly minted -leader- coordinated the work of subordinate employees, followed the instructions of the occupation leadership and even managed to appear in a Russian propaganda video. In the video, the -chief doctor- talked about receiving the so-called -human aid with medicines- from the Russian Federation, thus creating a positive image of the aggressor country. The woman performed her duties until the moment of deoccupation. She is currently hiding from Ukrainian law enforcement officers. The accused has been declared wanted, she will be tried in absentia. A woman faces up to ten years of imprisonment with deprivation of the right to hold certain positions or engage in certain activities for a period of up to fifteen years and confiscation of property. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that this week, according to the materials The court of the State Bureau of Investigation sentenced 5 defectors, indictments were sent to the court against 3 collaborators, 4 more persons were notified of suspicion.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/13/vykryttya-pidozra-speczrozsliduvannya-potrijno-vidpraczyuvaly-pravoohoronczi-na-kupyanshhyni/	2024-09-13T11:43:34-07:00

Putin's subject spied on the Armed Forces in Kharkiv: -shtirlitsa- will be tried	This was reported by the Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office. In addition to official work in a banking institution, the man additionally spied for the benefit of the Russian Federation. Recruited by the Russian intelligence services, he established contact with a person who, in his opinion, had access to the state secret service in order to collect classified information.

The President of Ukraine answered whether the operation in Kurshchyna was a mistake	He told about this during his participation in the 20th annual meeting of the Yalta European Strategy. Volodymyr Zelenskyi also noted that thanks to the Kursk operation, it was possible to stop the enemy in the Kharkiv direction and slow down the advance of the Russians in the Donetsk region. After the operation in Kurshchyna, the backlog of the Armed Forces of Ukraine for shells near Pokrovsk decreased from 1:12 to 1:2.5. -In Kurshchyna, the Russians began their rapid offensive. About 60-70 thousand people want to apply. We know about 40,000 are already there,- the President noted. The President noted that it is a pleasant fact that not only Ukraine is talking about the deoccupation of its territories, but also Russia. In addition, Volodymyr Zelenskyi answered the question whether the Kursk operation was a mistake. The head of state recalled the Russian offensive in the Kharkiv direction, which is also a very important center of the eastern part of Ukraine. -You saw that they broke through our defenses, wanted to capture Kharkiv, in addition to their official messages regarding the construction of some buffer zones along our entire border, and they would not have finished with the East,- noted Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The President noted that we later received intelligence from our partners. -In the north of our state, starting from Sumshchyna, from the east to the north of our state, plans were being prepared to create appropriate buffer zones, and with one or another military success, they wanted to capture the centers of these regions. This is what the Kursk operation gave,- the head of state summarized. In the opinion of Volodymyr Zelenskyi, the operation gave the results that everyone was counting on. -The enemy has been stopped in Kharkiv Oblast, its advance on Donetsk Oblast has slowed down, although it is very difficult there, and there is still a long way to positive things there. However, they withdrew their forces from Kharkiv Oblast, Zaporozhye and other groups that were preparing in the north for the occupation of our territories. The enemy began to move all this to the Kursk direction. This is what happened,- added the President.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/13/prezydent-ukrayiny-vidpoviv-chy-bula-operacziya-na-kurshhyni-pomylkoyu/	2024-09-13T07:09:04-07:00

Enemy armored assaults have become more frequent in Kharkiv Oblast: how to counter them	How this can be countered told on the air of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon, the spokesman of the Kharkiv OTU Vitaly Sarantsev. — Last day, the enemy tried to storm the units of the Defense Forces in Vovchansk and used two BMPs for support. Both machines were detected already during the approach to our positions and were hit by fire from FPV drones. One of the cars was destroyed, the other was damaged, he said. Despite heavy losses of the occupiers, they do not stop trying to storm in the future, which indicates the importance of the Kharkiv direction for the Russian military and political leadership. In order to continue the offensive, the invaders are trying to change tactics and approaches to carrying out combat missions. On the other hand, the Russians are not sending any significant reinforcements to Kharkiv region and are forced to storm with available forces. — The enemy conducts constant rotations, accumulates forces that carry out assaults in the city itself. He rotates these units internally and is constantly trying to strengthen them. As for any global accumulation, it is currently not observed either in the direction of Vovchansk or near other settlements, in particular Hlyboky, Lyptsi or other locations on the Russian-Ukrainian border, the spokesman said. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that ->in Kharkiv Oblast, Ukrainian drones put the occupiers on starvation rations.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/13/vorozhi-broneshturmy-pochastishaly-na-harkivshhyni-yak-vdayetsya-protydiyaty/	2024-09-13T06:26:23-07:00

As a border guard - Schumacher - overtook enemy drones on bends	About Andrii with the call sign -Malyuk- said on September 13 on the website of the State Border Service. The first rotation of -Malyuk- — to the combat zone in the Kharkiv region. There he had to drive various armored and non-armored vehicles, deliver and pick up personnel from positions, transport the wounded, deliver ammunition and necessary property to the soldiers, etc. -With a night vision device, he drove at a speed of 120-130 km per hour at night. When the enemy FPV drones started to fly, it was even necessary to drive at a higher speed so that they did not catch up,- -Malyuk- recalls. Adrenaline, says the border guard, was over the top. However, they went to any challenge. And if at full speed in the dark they flew into ravines from enemy anti-tank vehicles and shells, then they simply pulled out the car, repaired it and drove on. Previously ArmyInform told about 43-year-old Serhiy, a soldier of the 78th separate airborne assault regiment and his experience of brutal battles in the Toretsk direction.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/13/yak-prykordonnyk-shumaher-na-virazhah-obganyav-vorozhi-drony/	2024-09-13T05:57:48-07:00
President of Ukraine: We need long-range capability to change the course of the war	He emphasized this during a speech within the XX meeting of the Yalta European Strategy. The head of state noted that while Ukraine is waiting for the delivery of promised air defense systems, primarily Patriot, from partners, Russia continues to strike our country. After all, the Russian dictator does not need any long-range permits for this. -Anyone who simply sees on the map where Russia strikes from, where it prepares forces and keeps reserves, where it locates military facilities and what logistics it uses - anyone who sees all this obviously understands what long-range Ukraine is for,- - the President emphasized. Volodymyr Zelensky also noted that the other day he discussed this in detail with US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken and British Foreign Minister David Lammy. According to the words of the Head of State, after this meeting, there can no longer be any open question about why Ukraine needs sufficient long-range. -I want to emphasize: enough. Not enough to simply say that there is a solution. Long-range enough to change the course of the war and force Russia to seek peace. And we very much hope for our partners, we hope for the result from our partners. At least we are working on it,- added Volodymyr Zelenskyi. As reported by ArmyInform, the EU will send interest from frozen Russian assets to strengthen Ukraine's defense.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/13/prezydent-ukrayiny-nam-potribna-dalekobijnist-dlya-zminy-perebigu-vijny/	2024-09-13T05:48:04-07:00

Without food and water in the trenches: the drones put the occupiers on starvation rations	reported who and how exactly deprived the occupiers of the basic necessities for conducting hostilities, on the broadcast of the -Suspilne Novosti- marathon spokesman of OTU -Kharkiv- Vitaly Sarantsev. -Such simple problems have serious consequences for the enemy, because those units that are in advanced positions cannot carry out their tasks efficiently, cannot go on assaults, cannot carry out tasks related to the engineering equipment of their positions,- he said. The lack of an established stable supply of provisions, water and, in some cases, even ammunition has a negative impact on the combat capability of enemy units. Such a situation was created thanks to the skilful combat work of Ukrainian drones, which broke the logistical chains of support in the enemy's near rear. — The prerequisite for this is the effective actions of our FPV drone operators, who skillfully search for the enemy's movement routes and cut all the logistics chains as precisely and accurately as possible. They destroy everything that approaches the positions, no matter how the enemy tries to carry out these support tasks either on foot, using motorized vehicles, or using cars, the spokesman said. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in Kharkiv Oblast, the occupiers suffer from Ukrainian drones.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/13/bez-harchiv-ta-vody-v-okopah-dronari-posadyly-okupantiv-na-golodnyj-pajok/	2024-09-13T05:23:56-07:00

Free pallia: no money was earned, only a suspicion of 10 years in prison	The Security Service of Ukraine informs about this. -This time, the occupiers remotely involved two Odesa residents, an immigrant from Luhansk region and a resident of Izmail district, before committing arson. Among them are three minors. All of them were looking for -easy money- in Telegram channels, where they got into the field of view of the special services of the Russian Federation, -said SBU employees. In order to carry out enemy tasks, the participants at various times found potential -targets- and then coordinated them with their Russian supervisors. After the arsons, the attackers recorded the fire on the cameras of their own phones and sent a -video report- to representatives of the Russian special services. According to such an algorithm, the perpetrators destroyed 6 official cars of Ukrainian defenders, but never received the promised money from the occupiers. Criminals were arrested -on hot pursuit- in various districts of Odesa. During the searches of the homes of the detainees, incendiary devices and mobile phones with evidence of subversive activities for the benefit of the Russian Federation were seized.

An inspector from Volyn is suspected of facilitating the illegal departure of men abroad	The Special Prosecutor's Office of the Western Region informs about this. According to the investigation, a 26-year-old junior inspector of the border service from Volyn established a channel for the systematic transfer of conscripts to Poland through official checkpoints.

Overloading and the storm factor: what can paralyze Russian logistics in Crimea	The spokesperson of the Navy of Ukraine, captain of the third rank Dmytro Pletenchuk, told about this on the air of -Suspilne.Novyny-. The main conclusion is that the occupiers have constant technical difficulties with the operation of the -illegal construction-. It cannot be loaded, but the occupants have no other way out. -First of all, this is due to the consequences of fire damage, the enemy cannot load it, but on the other hand, he does not have much choice. The cases of exploitation of car fuel tanks have become more frequent, that is, they have become overturned more. This information is being verified. But it fits into the general picture of the situation that arose due to the lack of ferry connections, which was the main logistical tool for ensuring the grouping both in Crimea itself and in the south of our country,- said Dmytro Pletenchuk. Another factor is added to everything else - the spokesman of the Navy of Ukraine states - soon the beginning of the season of storms in the Black Sea. And this will only increase the problems for the crossing, to protect which the Russians are forced to keep in the area. serious air defense forces.

The end of a saboteur's career: a man from Chernihiv who helped destroy his own city was detained	notified the Security Service of Ukraine. The perpetrator adjusted missile strikes on the regional center and prepared a series of arsons at Ukrzaliznytsia facilities. The priority targets of the enemy shelling were the base points of the Ukrainian troops involved in the defense of the northern borders of Ukraine. According to available data, the occupiers planned to use Kh-59 air missiles to carry out fire damage. The Russian special service also tried to find out the locations of enterprises that fulfill a state defense order. To perform these tasks, the FSB remotely recruited a 44-year-old employee of a local factory. -The man came to the attention of the Russian special services because of his anti-Ukrainian comments in Telegram channels. According to the instructions of the occupiers, the figure went around the area, where he secretly recorded the location of the Defense Forces. He forwarded the information he received to his Russian curator via messenger via a specially created chatbot administered by the FSB,- SBU employees said.

-Sarayami- according to the Donetsk scenario: what makes Russians submissively -canned in cans-	The battalion commander told about the peculiarities of storming -barracks- according to the Donetsk scenario on the air of the national telethon -Edyny Novyny- of shock air defense systems -Achilles- of the 92nd separate assault brigade named after the basket chieftain Ivan Sirk, captain Yury Fedorenko. — The first armored vehicle that goes in their assault column is mostly an old modification tank, roughly like the T-72. It can be without a tower, without ammunition. It is used precisely as a carrier. From above, it is actually covered with a -barn-. Anyone who has ever seen a barn or an old house knows how it will look made of metal, said the drone commander. In front of this armored vehicle are trawls designed to remove mine barriers, both anti-personnel and anti-tank. — Between the body of the tank and between this -barn-, which is welded on top, there is an assault infantry. Behind the tank, 2-3 BMPs are moving, similarly covered with -sheds- on top. Between the body of the BMP and this very -barn- is the assault infantry, the soldier continued. It is difficult to understand why the Russians meekly accept certain death. — Frankly speaking, I do not know what the Russian occupiers are telling the military and how they are forcing them to climb into this structure that is being built, because it is certain death. Most of the conscious people who are involved in the military affairs understand this, including new recruits of the Russian Federation. But the system of coercion in them works perfectly and the occupier is more afraid of his own than going to the battlefield to certain death. Therefore, one way or another, they are -preserved- in this -can-, said Yuriy Fedorenko. Next, assault actions take place - Russian -barracks- rush in the direction of the positions of the units of the Defense Forces. — At high speed, the main task is to jump to our advanced positions. -Tanchyk makes a pass and BMPs fly behind him to rush the infantry and then move on to shock-assault actions with the aim of displacing us from advanced positions,- said the commander of -Achilles-. The military said that drones saw such sheds for the first time in Donetsk region. There, they were used most in the Avdiivka region, in the Bakhmut area and in other places. Losses among the personnel of the enemy during such assaults are colossal. — 90% of vehicles are currently destroyed by Defense Forces on the battlefield either immediately or after damage. Up to 60-70% of the assault infantry, which moves on such equipment, does not reach the line of advance, Yuriy Fedorenko said. The military said that during the past day, Achilles fighters managed to destroy 4 units of armored vehicles - one tank and 3 BMP. In general, even more enemy equipment was burned on the field, because the gunners and drones of other units also worked well on it. Since the beginning of September, the -Achillesians- have already destroyed 25 units of the occupiers' equipment. However, the droners are in no hurry to relax - the occupants still have enough -dances- and -beh- left. -This indicates that the enemy still has the opportunity, unfortunately, to carry out shock-assault actions and deploy its lightly armored and armored vehicles,- noted Yuriy Fedorenko. Earlier, ArmyInform showed how the long-range -helmeted- Achilles - hit exactly under the turret of a Russian tank and defeated -Grad - in Belgorod region, and the all-seeing -Achilles- saw and eliminated the occupiers and shot a full yagdtash of enemy equipment in Kharkiv Oblast.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/13/sarayamy-za-doneczkym-sczenariyem-shho-zmushuye-rosiyan-pokirno-konservuvatysya-v-blyashanky/	2024-09-13T01:51:18-07:00

At the same time, the enemy fired 3,391 shots at the positions of our troops and settlements. In the Kharkiv direction, the occupiers unsuccessfully attacked three times in the Vovchansk region. Eight times the enemy stormed the positions of the Ukrainian military in the Kupyansk direction, in the Sinkivka, Kolisnikivka and Lozova districts. The battle is still going on near Stelmakhivka. On the Lyman direction, the Russian invaders tried to advance 6 times in the districts of Nevsky and Druzhelyubivka. The defenders of Ukraine are firmly holding the defense, inflicting significant losses on the enemy. In the Northern direction the enemy made 5 attacks. The main efforts were concentrated in the Verkhnokamyansky district. Two skirmishes are still ongoing here. In the Kramatorsk direction the occupiers tried to penetrate our defenses in the area of ​​Chasovoy Yar and the settlement of Stupochka. The situation is under the control of the Ukrainian military. On the Toretsk direction, the aggressors attacked five times for aviation support near Toretsk, Nelipivka and in the New York area. Currently, two more clashes are ongoing. In the Pokrovsky direction, a high intensity of hostilities is maintained. The number of clashes has increased to 32. The invaders continue to attack our positions near Vozdvizhenka, Novooleksandrivka, Zeleny Pol, Novotroitskyi, Grodivka, Novogrodivka, Selidovoy and Mykhailivka. 28 attacks were repelled by our defenders.

propaganda -reflects- information about Kurshchyna: why is Bucha here?	The situation is especially cynicized by the fact that, in the case of the shops, the propagandists show footage of the soldiers of the Soviet Union engaged in their usual looting business - only not in Ukraine, but in their -native- Kursk region! At the same time, the representative of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Maria Sakharova, calls on international structures -not to turn a blind eye to the terrorist acts of the Kyiv regime on the territory of the Russian Federation.- This tactic, typical of Russian propaganda, is called -mirroring.- Propagandists make the same accusations against Ukraine that we once made against Russia, in particular regarding the events in Buch. That is, they often do not even invent fakes, but simply copy news items from Ukrainian news. The average Russian who consumes this information willingly believes it, because he would have behaved the same way in a foreign country (which the Ukrainians were able to see many times) — he looted, shot, raped. Therefore, Sakharova's appeal to international structures is completely hopeless. After all, apart from unspoken accusations of crimes, the Russians cannot provide any evidence of illegal actions by the Armed Forces. It is Russia that systematically uses terrorist methods of warfare and violates international humanitarian law, while Ukraine protects its territory and citizens from the aggressor. Regarding the war crimes committed by the Russians in Ukraine, a significant evidence base has been collected, both Ukrainian and independent world media wrote about them and continue to write about them. Therefore, the Russians use -reflection- primarily to divert attention from their failure in Kurshchyna and the inevitable defeat in the war that they themselves started.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/13/rospropaganda-vidzerkalyuye-informacziyu-pro-kurshhynu-do-chogo-tut-bucha/	2024-09-12T20:22:16-07:00
Howitzer M101A1: the history of the gun — the record holder	This extraordinary howitzer certainly deserves a more detailed account. The correspondent of ArmiyaInform talked about it with Andriy Kharuk, a well-known weapons researcher, author of a personal profile art blog, doctor of historical sciences, professor of the Department of Humanities of the National Academy of Land Forces named after Hetman Petro Sahaydachny. The first part of the conversation was published by last week, and today we bring to your attention the second part of the conversation. — In addition to the modernization of the gun itself, as far as is known, the cartridges for it also underwent changes&#8230; — After the refusal in 1934 to use shrapnel in the ammunition of American 105-mm howitzers only two types of projectiles remained - high-explosive M1 with a mass of 14.97 kg and smoke. Already during the Second World War, an armor-piercing projectile, an aiming projectile (with colored smoke) and a cluster fragmentation projectile (used primarily in the Pacific theater of war) were adopted as weapons. The M1 projectile had two modifications - standard and -deep penetration- (with a reinforced case, but with a reduced charge mass). TNT or -composition B- - a mixture of TNT and RDX - was used for the equipment. The explosive mass for the standard projectile was 2.3 kg (for -composition B-) or 2.177 kg (for TNT); for a deep penetration projectile - 2.087 kg or 1.93 kg, respectively. The armor-piercing projectile weighed 13.25 kg and was equipped with a mixture of pentrite and TNT weighing 1.33 kg. The charge was profiled to form a cumulative jet. The initial speed of this projectile was 381 m/s. It could penetrate armor 102 mm thick at a distance of up to 1,800 m. Howitzer loading is semi-unitary (cases with charges were transported separately from shells, but were connected before loading). Seven variable shells were used for firing. — Mr. Professor, I ask you to clarify the marking system of this howitzer, because some informative sources create confusion in these markings. — In 1962, the M2A1 howitzer on the M2A1 carriage was given the designation M101 , and on the carriage M2A2 - M101A1. In both cases, barrels of two modifications could be used - M2A1 or M2A2, as well as anti-recoil devices of one of five modifications - from M2A1 to M2A5. Sights were improved and included: Elbow M16A1D telescopic sight for direct fire (3x magnification, 13° field of view); panoramic sight Panoramic M12A7S (4x magnification, field of view - 10°); quadrant M4A1. Ammunition, as before, consisted of semi-unitary shots, but their range was expanded and included the following types of shells: — This howitzer— no only an old-timer and a participant in many military campaigns, but also one of the record holders for the number of copies produced. - Mass production of howitzers at the Rock Island Arsenal continued until 1953, the total number of M2A1s produced was brought to 10,202 units. However, in the following years, the production of M101A1 howitzers was periodically renewed to fulfill export orders. The last such order (for 133 howitzers) was received in 1981 from Indonesia, the company fulfilled it by November 1983. —From the historical perspective and tactical and technical features, Andriy Ivanovych, let's focus on the direct service of this weapon. Which units of the US Army were they sent to? - In the late 1930s, the US Army began transitioning its infantry divisions to a new, -triangular- structure. The artillery of such a division was to consist of three divisions of 75-mm guns and one division of 105-mm howitzers (12 artillery systems in a division). Since there were no serial samples of 105-mm howitzers yet, the old 155-mm howitzers M1917 of the Schneider system were introduced in the division instead of these guns. Following the German Blitzkrieg in France, the US military decided to replace the 75 mm guns with 105 mm howitzers, leaving the division with a division of 155 mm howitzers - this was the organization of divisional artillery throughout World War II. — But, in addition to saturating each unit with specific guns, they needed to be managed successfully. How was this process organized? - An important innovation was the organization of a Fire Directio Center (FDC) in each division. It made it possible to focus the fire of the division on one target, and after it was hit, quickly transfer it to the next one. Central control equipment provided communication with batteries and forward artillery observers, as well as producing data for setting sights. In 1941, fire control centers also appeared at the division level. In 1937, the US Army had only 25 field artillery divisions. By December 1941 (the moment the United States entered the war), their number reached 142, and by 1945 exceeded 700. 264 of them had M2A1 howitzers: 161 divisions (147 as part of divisions and 14 separate) in the European Theater of War, 71 (respectively 62 and 9) in the Pacific and 32 in the US territory. In 1942, M2A1 howitzers appeared in the Marine Corps - one division of such guns was introduced into the divisional artillery regiments along with three divisions of 75-mm howitzers. By the beginning of the large amphibious operations on Saipan and Guam, the artillery regiments already had two divisions of 105-mm and 75-mm howitzers, and by the time of the landing on Iwo Jima in 1945, three and one, respectively. — As far as is known, during the Second World War this weaponry, along with others, was also prepared for export. How were these deliveries organized? - The main recipients of American aid under the Lend-Lease program - Great Britain and the USSR - did not show much interest in American artillery systems, making do with their own artillery systems. The USSR did not receive any such howitzers, the British were given only 16. The American howitzers were much more needed by China and Free France, which received 476 and 239 M2A1s, respectively. Another 223 units of these howitzers were transferred to a number of Latin American states that entered the war on the side of the Allies, but they were used in battle only by the Brazilians, who sent an infantry division to Italy that had three divisions of 105-mm howitzers. — And what was the fate of the use of these guns after the Second World War? — 105-mm howitzers were quite widely used during the Korean War, and on both sides of the front, both by the US and of the Republic of Korea, as well as parts of Chinese volunteers who fought on the side of the DPRK. The last campaign of the US Army in which the M101A1 howitzer was widely used was the Vietnam War. Their main task in this war was the direct support of infantry units, howitzers were relatively rare in divisions. Much more often, they were used in battery, underwater or even separate artillery installations. The use of howitzers of the 1st Division of the 7th Artillery Regiment as the armament of the LCM-6 landing craft became quite exotic. Later, AMMI pontoons mounted from standard sections were used as floating batteries. For two M101A1 howitzers, a pontoon measuring 27.45×8.66 m was used, on the edges of which ammunition storage was located, in the center - living quarters, and between it and the artillery bunkers - howitzer positions (all this was protected by armor sheets). Each battery had at its disposal three AMMI pontoons and five LCM-8 landing craft (three of them served as tugboats pushing pontoons, one as a fire control center, and another one carried additional ammunition). Since 1966, new 105-mm howitzers M102 began to arrive to replace the M101A1. The old systems were gradually transferred to the Allies until the end of 1969. South Vietnam received 730 M101A1 howitzers (only 60 of the new M102 systems were delivered). A year later, the South Vietnamese army had forty divisions of 105-mm howitzers (thirty in infantry divisions, seven separate and three airborne), as well as a hundred separate M101A1 platoons in fortified positions. Losses were also considerable, especially during the repulse of large-scale offensive operations. So, for the period from March 31 to April 10, 1972, 81 howitzers were lost. — Meanwhile, in the US Army itself, these guns were abandoned far from immediately. — In the US Army and Marine Corps, the M102 was never able to completely replace the old 105-millimeter guns. In 1983, the M101A1 took part in the last combat operation in the US Army — the invasion of Grenada. In 1985, the US Army had (mostly in the National Guard and Reserve) six M101 howitzers and 494 M101A1s. It wasn't until the 1990s that both the M101A1 and M102 were replaced by the new 105mm M119 howitzers. — During the so-called Cold War, the United States was an active supplier of its weapons to allies and partners. Surely, foreign armies were also interested in this proven weapon? — In the postwar years, American 105-mm howitzers entered the arms of the armies of several dozen countries — primarily NATO members (Belgium, Denmark, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Turkey , Germany, France). Non-aligned Austria and Yugoslavia also received them, and after the collapse of the latter, newly independent states. In Canada, Australia and New Zealand, the M101A1 replaced the British-style 25-pounder. If in Australia and New Zealand the American howitzers have already been replaced by the licensed version of the English L118, then the Canadians in 1997 modernized their 105-mm howitzers (replacing the barrel with a longer, 33-caliber one) and under the C3 designation they keep a certain amount in spare parts. The basic version of the M101A1 was designated in Canada as C1 and was produced under license in the 1950s. In Latin America, the countries that did not operate American 105-mm howitzers are easier to think of: Costa Rica and Panama. In the rest of the states of the region (from Mexico in the north to Argentina in the south, as well as the islands of Haiti and the Dominican Republic), these howitzers are in service. Their number varies from country to country and ranges from a few units to several hundred (for example, Brazil has more than 250). In Africa, M101s are less common, but even in this region, you can name a good dozen countries that have received these systems. Ethiopia, Libya and Liberia received 105-mm howitzers as military aid from the United States, and Mozambique and some other states received them -inherited- from the colonialists. In the Middle East, M101 was used by both sides of the Israeli-Jordanian and Iranian-Iraqi conflicts, and was used in the armies of Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen. American 105-millimeter guns are quite widespread in Indochina and the Far East (Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, Burma, the Republic of China, the Republic of Korea, Japan). In Japan and Taiwan, M101A1 howitzers were produced under license. In several countries, these howitzers have been modernized (for example, by turning into self-propelled guns, as in the Republic of Korea), but the modernization of the M101 is a topic for a separate story — Well, and a few words, Mr. Professor, about the present of these howitzers. — M101's career is gradually coming to an end. But even in the 21st century, this howitzer continues to serve to protect democracy. Ukraine received 18 such howitzers in September 2022. Their path to our Armed Forces was winding: the Americans at one time gave these howitzers to Denmark, and in 2002 they gave them to Lithuania, and twenty years later, the Lithuanians gave the M101A1 to Ukraine. The Ukrainian M101A1 made its combat debut in November 2022, and this howitzer was officially adopted by the Armed Forces of Ukraine on August 28, 2023. 71 separate hunting brigades are known to use these systems. In one of its previous materials, ArmyInform told about the service of these guns in the Armed Forces of Ukraine and how they are evaluated by our garmaty.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/13/gaubyczya-m101a1-istoriya-garmaty-rekordsmenky/	2024-09-12T20:11:21-07:00
How many rockets are needed to bring down the Crimean bridge: an expert on air defense of the Russia...	Military expert Petro Chernyk told ArmyInform about this. — Today, there is a question as to what the air defense of Crimea is in terms of cover by anti-aircraft missile systems. Indeed, at the moment it is much denser and better than the cover in Moscow, the military expert notes. According to him, almost all complexes are concentrated in Crimea, starting with a small radius of action, that is, for example, such as OSA, to the most modern S-300, S-400. And there is already confirmed information that their very rare S-500 complexes, of which there are 16 units in total, will be deployed there. This complex declares a target interception range of up to 600 kilometers at a speed of 3,000 meters per second - here we are talking about the target. Chernyk reminds that the speed of ATACMS missile is 1500 meters per second. — Why does the enemy act in this way? Because there is a problem with the Crimean Bridge. We are well aware that in order for the Crimean bridge to fall, it must be attacked by no less than 60-70 ballistic missiles. These are the same ATACMS. Or, let's say, now there is news that the development of our Ukrainian ballistic missiles of the Grom-2 type continues. In fact, there is nothing new here, but this work is ongoing, the expert adds. Chernyk says that there must be a large number of drones in this component: - And the total salvo for the bridge to really fall should be no less than 100-120 units of the appropriate equipment. the Russians are well aware that as soon as the bridge falls, Crimea will suffocate in terms of logistics. 90% of everything that is transported to Crimea is transported by rail. Petro Chernyk notes that it is becoming more and more difficult for the enemy to deliver (cargo. — Ed.) by barges. — Especially since we already have very good news that we even started sinking barges. Therefore, the enemy concentrated a huge amount of everything in the Crimea. At the same time, over the past six months, we have at least 5 cases of confirmation of the destruction of both the radar systems that provide the same S-400 anti-aircraft missile systems, as well as the destruction of the launchers themselves. And, so far, there is no confirmed information that the old ATACMS, which entered service in 1989, were successfully intercepted by the air defense system of the Russian Federation in Crimea, the expert emphasized. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/13/skilky-raket-potribno-shhob-upav-krymskyj-mist-ekspert-pro-protypovitryanu-oboronu-rf/	2024-09-12T20:00:52-07:00

In the Limansky direction, the enemy is increasing the use of systems -Solntsepok-	A serviceman of the 60th Separate Mechanized Brigade, Bohdan, told about this on Army TV. -The enemy is trying to increase the pressure, but they have problems that they cannot solve, first and foremost is the morale of their soldiers,- he said. The serviceman also said that it is very common among Russians to use Esmarch tourniquets instead of tourniquets for wounds, even among special forces. As reported by ArmyInform, the occupiers the positions of the units of the Defense Forces in Zaporizhzhia are heavily bombarded with artillery, airstrikes, strike drones and drops from copters. In view of this, the Ukrainian defenders must move and set up new positions in other places. This was the case, in particular, in the Orihiv direction.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/12/na-lymanskomu-napryamku-vorog-zbilshuye-vykorystannya-system-solnczepok/	2024-09-12T11:31:21-07:00

Seven people were injured as a result of airstrikes in Kharkiv and its suburbs	This was notified in the State Emergency Service. As a result of the shelling, residential buildings were damaged, and there are injured people. In one of the private houses, two women and an 11-year-old child were blocked due to damage to the front door. Emergency workers helped people get out. Rescue workers, pyrotechnicians and psychologists of the State Emergency Service worked at the scene. The Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office reported that from 16:45 to 17:00 Russian troops carried out a series of air strikes on Kharkiv and its suburbs. The occupiers also struck the territory of -Ekopark- in the village with an air munition. Forests of the Malodanyliva community. There were no injuries at the scene of the impact. Trees and a fence were damaged. From the recovered debris, the law enforcement officers have previously determined that the enemy used the FAB-250 from the UMPK for shelling. As reported by ArmyInform, at noon on September 12, the occupiers shelled the village of Borov, Izyum district, Kharkiv region, for the second time in a day. The occupiers targeted the rescuers of the State Emergency Service, who were eliminating the consequences of the previous shelling. As a result of repeated Russian shelling 2 people died, another 7 were injured, including 3 rescuers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/12/sim-lyudej-postrazhdaly-vnaslidok-aviaudariv-po-harkovu-ta-peredmistyu/	2024-09-12T10:56:26-07:00

Enemy shelling intensified in the Zaporozhye direction: the Defense Forces are setting up new positi...	Captain Dmytro Lykhovii, spokesman for the Tavria Military Academy, told about this on the air of the national telethon -Yedini Novyni- . — Positions are exposed to significant combined fire intensity. Even taking into account the fact that there is a fairly wide gray area, and the battles are of a positional nature, our units have to leave some positions because they are simply burned out, destroyed, he said. In view of this, the Ukrainian defenders must move and set up new positions in other places. This was the case, in particular, in the Orihiv direction. — The statistics of damage to Russian personnel and Russian equipment testify to the increase in the intensity of hostilities. Yesterday, 69 people were destroyed or disabled in other ways - these are irrevocable, sanitary and captives together, the spokesman said. Also, 42 units of weapons and military equipment of the Russian occupiers were destroyed and damaged in the operational zone of the -Tavria- air defense system. — There is something to brag about here, because in the Gulyajpil direction, where hostilities have not been taking place on the ground since mid-August, we managed to hit one tank and 3 armored fighting vehicles, Dmytro Lykhovi noted. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in the South, Ukrainian FPV drones destroy reconnaissance drones of the occupiers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/12/na-zaporizkomu-napryamku-posylylys-vorozhi-obstrily-syly-oborony-oblashtovuyut-novi-pozycziyi/	2024-09-12T10:23:40-07:00
46 units of enemy equipment: the paratroopers repelled four waves of assaults during the day	A video of the successful work was published on the brigade's Facebook page. -On September 12, the Russian occupiers thought of setting another record. Four waves of assaults from 5:45 a.m. to noon on the positions of the battalions of our brigade should, according to the enemy's plan, break through the defense of the Ukrainian paratroopers,- the brigade reported.

Cruise missiles -minimaly-: an American start-up offered the Pentagon a new ammunition	The startup Ares Industries, named after the Greek god of war, was only founded in May 2024. However, on the portal of the California startup center Y Combinator the other day there was posted a message that the engineers of this company have already started flight tests of compact and inexpensive cruise missiles from this manufacturer, ArmiyaInform reports. The missiles are being developed primarily for use against ships and will, according to Ares, be -ten times smaller and ten times cheaper- than any currently known model. Anti-ship missiles now weigh more than a ton and cost several million dollars each. Ares plans to sell its rockets for $300,000 per unit. Ares Industries details its developments in a release. The entire summer was spent building several prototypes and testing them in the Mojave Desert. As a result of these tests, the first batch is already being prepared for the delivery of operational missiles to customers, which is planned to be carried out by mid-2025. According to Ares representatives, cruise missiles should be compatible with existing launch platforms and move at a high subsonic speed (the speed of sound is about 1,200 km/h). Developers want to focus on land and ship options, that is, those that are launched from vehicles or warships. In the future, airborne versions and variants with a longer flight range will also appear. Ares does not provide any information about the range of the first version, only stating that it is several hundred miles (that is, no less than 322 kilometers). This California-based startup's rendering shows anti-ship missiles similar to Lockheed Martin's AGM-158C LRASM. Long-range anti-ship missiles (LRASM) have stealth characteristics. Individual cruise missiles can communicate with each other and use artificial intelligence to bypass air defense measures. Their range is 370 kilometers. The updated version, which is planned to be introduced by the US Navy in 2026, is expected to have a range of 950 kilometers. However, AGM-158C LRASMs are quite expensive. The price per unit is about $3 million.The US Navy and Air Force together want to buy more than 1,000 AGM-158Cs by 2030. Ares Industries believes that its anti-ship missiles could hypothetically be used against China in the Pacific Ocean. However, recent conflicts in the Middle East have shown that American weapons are too expensive. Current US anti-ship missiles are designed to attack destroyers. However, it makes no sense to attack smaller frigates or even drone boats with millions of dollars worth of remotely controlled weapons. In a possible conflict in the Pacific, the United States would launch thousands of anti-ship missiles a week, depleting the stockpile in days. -We cannot produce enough anti-ship missiles to counter China,- the company said. Another benefit of Ares Industries' approach is the ability to perform so-called saturation attacks. During such group attacks, the enemy's defense systems are suppressed by a huge number of missiles and drones. However, the weapons with which these attacks are carried out must be correspondingly cheap. And size plays a role, too. Warships have limited space in their missile launchers. For example, if an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer's Mk-41 launcher has room for 96 LRASM cruise missiles, it can at least theoretically carry and launch 960 smaller Ares missiles instead. Then a single destroyer could hit the enemy fleet with nearly a thousand anti-ship missiles. The goal is not only to cause material damage to the enemy. In the second wave of attacks, larger rounds and cruise missiles may be launched. They have a better chance of achieving their goal, because the air defenses are already weakened by Shahed drones or need to be reloaded with ammunition and anti-aircraft missiles, and therefore are not yet ready to repulse an enemy attack. The Pentagon's profile program also shows that the US wants to increase the production of small and cheap weapons. As part of this initiative, thousands of small unmanned autonomous drones will be developed by 2025 and will use artificial intelligence. Defense companies, especially startups, are also joining this trend. Anduril Industries, a company created by Oculus co-founder Palmer Luckey, recently announced that it will build a -hyperscale- manufacturing facility to create large-scale autonomous weapons systems such as drones or autonomous underwater vehicles. <iframe loading=-lazy- title=-What Do The Navy's Ship-Launched Missiles Actually Cost?- width=-640- height=-360- src=-https://www.youtube.com/embed/47BDvAuKRHc?start=271&amp;feature=oembed- frameborder=-0- allow=-accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write ; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share=-strict-origin-when-cross-origin- Comparative evaluation of the US Navy.

Counter-intelligence of the SBU exposed attempts by the Russian Federation to obtain data on the def...	About informs Security Service of Ukraine. The enemy agent turned out to be a local IT specialist who worked for a staff member of the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces (better known as Gru). On the instructions of the occupier, the suspect set up an -observation post- in his own apartment to covertly monitor the locations of the Defense Forces. To do this, the informant purchased and installed tactical binoculars with a high magnification, a rangefinder grid and a compass in the apartment of a multi-story building. With the help of specialized optics, the person involved hoped to detect the positions of air defense and Ukrainian artillery, in particular HIMARS rocket artillery systems. The attacker also tracked the routes of military convoys and the location of Defense Forces fortifications. He transmitted the information he received to his Russian curator through an anonymous chat in the messenger. According to the informant's coordinates, the occupiers planned to carry out a new series of missile and drone strikes on the front-line territory of the region. The security service exposed the enemy henchman early and detained him in his own apartment. Prior to that, comprehensive measures were taken to secure the locations of Ukrainian troops. During searches of the detainee's premises, optics and a mobile phone, which he used in his criminal activities, were seized. -Investigators of the Security Service informed him of the suspicion under Part 2 of Art. 114-2 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (unauthorized dissemination of information about the movement, movement or location of the Armed Forces with the possibility of their identification in the locality with the purpose of providing such information to the state that is carrying out armed aggression against Ukraine),- the message says. The perpetrator is in custody. He faces up to 8 years in prison. The special operation was carried out by SBU employees in the Zaporizhzhia region under the procedural guidance of the regional prosecutor's office. As reported by ArmyInform, life imprisonment threatens the spy who gave away the positions of the Ukrainian artillery.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/12/kontrrozvidka-sbu-vykryla-sproby-rf-otrymaty-dani-pro-oboronu-zaporizhzhya/	2024-09-12T03:39:55-07:00
Creation of technical requirements for turnstiles according to NATO standards: a new development of ...	It is about this informs September 12. -Within the limits of this process, the Department of Health of the Ministry of Defense (DOH) focused on the established requirements for tourniquets of the rotary and lever type, occlusive thoracic bandages, as well as methodologies for assessing their compliance with international standards,- the report says. To implement this task, the Ministry of Defense actively cooperates with international partners, in particular with the NATO Combat Trauma Committee (CoTCCC). The DOZ is studying the best practices of NATO member countries, initiating requests to the defense attaché at Ukrainian embassies regarding the quality standards of hemostatic tourniquets. On the basis of the received data, the department analyzed its own capabilities for the development of technical and functional requirements for mechanical products to stop bleeding. In addition, the Ministry of Defense has applied to the NATO Science &amp; Technology Organization to receive a grant to create a laboratory for testing and testing of tourniquets and first aid equipment. -Providing our army with modern, standardized medical equipment is at the top of our priorities. Our task is to make pre-medical care on the battlefield as effective as possible by adapting and implementing advanced international standards,- said Oksana Sukhorukova, head of the Health Department of the IOU. According to her, the development of requirements for turnstiles and their certification according to NATO standards is key to their strategy. -It's not just a procedure, it's about our commitment to providing every soldier with real-time, life-saving tools on the frontline,- she noted. Another important step was the adoption of order No. 436 dated June 29, 2024 -On approval of the Volumes of pre-medical care provided during hostilities and training of Security Forces and Defense Forces on a tactical basis.- According to it, the skill of using a tourniquet is mandatory at all levels of training in home care. The Ministry of Defense also cooperates with the Main Department of Doctrine and Training of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on updating the training programs of servicemen. In particular, the Department proposed to make changes to the basic military training program (BZVP), which will contribute to increasing the effectiveness of the training of servicemen in the field of pre-medical care. As reported by ArmyInform, earlier the delegations of the Ministry of Defense and NATO ->discussed speeding up the promised aid to Ukraine from allies. &nbsp;	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/12/stvorennya-tehnichnyh-vymog-do-turniketiv-za-standartamy-nato-nova-rozrobka-minoborony/	2024-09-12T03:27:44-07:00
-Your family will leave you, son-: Russia throws conscripts into battle in the Kharkiv Region	This was reported by the spokesman of the operative-tactical group -Kharkiv-, Colonel Vitaly Sarantsev. The next step may be the start of a large-scale mobilization campaign in the Russian Federation. — The significant losses suffered by the enemy in the Kharkiv direction, more than ten thousand people only in our operational zone in four months, forced Russia to look for additional resources to continue the war. Russian legislation does not prohibit enlisting conscript soldiers for combat operations after they have completed four months of service, so it is possible to predict their appearance in other areas as well, he noted. According to the spokesman, this may indicate a lack of military personnel in Russian units, as a result of which the military command is forced to use less experienced soldiers for combat missions. Voyskovyi added that Russian propaganda had already warmed up society to such a development, tested its reaction, which predictably turned out to be zero, so the next steps should be expected - the start of a large-scale mobilization campaign in Russia. ArmyInform previously reported that in the Kharkiv region, Russia is fighting with poorly trained soldiers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/12/rodyna-tyebya-brosit-synok-rosiya-kydaye-v-bij-strokovykiv-na-harkivshhyni/	2024-09-12T03:12:18-07:00

The First Ukrainian-Polish Forum of Defense Industries was held within the framework of the exhibition. The delegation of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry was headed by the Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Oleksandr Serhiy. Its composition included specialists in separate clusters of weapons and military equipment of the Ground Forces and the Air Force. The Ukrainian delegation held a number of meetings with representatives of military departments of individual countries and world defense concerns. Within the framework of the international arms exhibition, technical discussions were held with the world's leading manufacturers of weapons and military equipment from the USA, Norway, Finland, France, Australia, Great Britain, Poland and other countries. The Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine thanked the Allies for their large-scale support in the fight against Russian aggression and informed about the urgent needs of the Defense Forces of Ukraine to strengthen their capabilities on the ground and in the air. Among the priorities are air defense systems, unmanned systems for various purposes, means of radio-electronic warfare, ammunition and individual components for their production in Ukraine. The issue of organizing the repair of foreign samples of weapons and military equipment in Ukraine was also discussed. -I heard assurances from many of our partners regarding the continued support of Ukraine in the war with Russia. According to the results of the meetings with the representatives of the defense departments, in particular, Norway and Canada, the issue of preparation and conclusion of agreements on cooperation in the field of armaments was agreed upon,- said the deputy head of the defense department at the end of the trip. According to the words of the Deputy Minister of Defense, there was a conversation about the need to intensify work to meet the needs of the Defense Forces of Ukraine, as well as regarding the implementation of important projects for the long-term support of our army. -In view of the situation on the front lines, significant volumes of weapons production at Russian military-industrial complex factories, the supply of ammunition to the Russian Federation from North Korea and Iran, the Kremlin seeks to further destroy and kill. Therefore, we need to significantly strengthen the capabilities of the Defense Forces. Russian terror must be stopped by the powerful response of the Ukrainian army and the important decisions of our allies,- Oleksandr Serhii noted. According to our allies, Russia's war against Ukraine has become the greatest challenge to modern security policy. Russia continues to wage war and threatens not only Ukraine. Consolidating the efforts of democratic countries, increasing military aid to Ukraine is crucial in view of today's threats. In order for our army to be stronger in the fight against the aggressor, we ask our allies to create joint military enterprises, as well as to buy weapons for the Armed Forces from domestic manufacturers. Every euro invested in Ukrainian -defense- enterprises is an investment in European security. As reported by ArmyInform, the delegations of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine and the USA discussed the expansion of defense cooperation.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/12/mizhnarodna-pidtrymka-dlya-ukrayiny-obgovoreno-novi-ugody-pro-spivpraczyu-v-sferi-ozbroyennya/	2024-09-12T02:20:08-07:00

The head of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs lied again: about what this time	This happened after participation in the Strategic Dialogue between the Russian Federation and the Cooperation Council of the Arab States of the Persian Gulf. The head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation said: -We never wanted someone else's land. We wanted people who are part of the -Russian world- to be treated humanely. This absurd and false statement by Lavrov shows that the Russian government is generally detached from reality and lives in its own -bubble-. The whole world knows that the Russian Federation is an occupier and an invader. If Russia did not seek to seize someone else's land, then why did it change its own constitution to include six administrative-territorial units of Ukraine? Moreover, Russia cynically destroys precisely those regions where the Russian-speaking population mainly lived. According to the Office of the Prosecutor General, during the period of the large-scale invasion, as of September 10, almost 150,000 crimes of aggression and war crimes against the Russian Federation, more than 18,000 crimes against national security, and more than 2,000 crimes against children were registered. I wonder if, according to Lavrov's sick logic, after the liberation of part of the Kursk region, where the government of the Russian Federation refused to ensure the interests of its own citizens, Russia itself has the right to be territorially intact?	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/12/ochilnyk-mzs-rosiyi-znovu-zbrehav-pro-shho-czogo-razu/	2024-09-11T20:20:55-07:00
Leading cities and what will be new in the fall: how the recruiting campaign in Ukraine continues. I...	What are the most in-demand positions today? But in the end, do recruiting centers solve the problem of the lack of people in the army? ArmiyaInform asked about all this during a blitz interview with Oleksiy Bezhevets, the authorized representative of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine on recruiting issues. — A few numbers: how many open recruiting centers do we have as of the beginning of September? What cities are in the plans? — The network is developing. We currently have 34 recruiting centers. Kraynaya was opened in Uman, before that there was Chernivtsi. There are, of course, plans to open new recruiting centers. As always, we do not announce the city: first we open, then we talk about it. But about 10 more such centers are in the process of preparation. Currently, we have literally a few regions left in Ukraine where centers are not yet present. And in all these regions, preparatory work is underway. Moreover, we are talking not only about regional centers, but also district ones, where the local authorities, in cooperation with us, have decided that it is advisable to do this. Therefore, by the end of October, at most in November, there will not be a single region of Ukraine without a Ukrainian army recruiting center. At the end of autumn, there will be at least 40 of them, as I can see from the dynamics at the moment. As for statistics, more than 16,000 people applied to recruiting centers as of the beginning of September. That is, all these people received counseling. Yes, there are a certain number of people who could not find vacancies for one reason or another: either quite specific requirements, or a specific profile of the corresponding candidate, which may not be suitable for military service, or some other specific characteristics. After all, the part determines whether the candidate is suitable for the vacant position and whether the part wants to see a person with the corresponding characteristics in him. Therefore, we are now simultaneously launching the process of reviewing the status of those candidates who have not been selected for vacancies, but who have taken the initiative and voluntarily decided to join the ranks of the Defense Forces. The goal: to work additionally with everyone who has expressed a desire, but has not yet been able to become a military serviceman. We also have an active communication campaign, which will now be intensified in various channels: outdoor advertising, additional online activities, etc. Information influence plays a role because coverage and communication with communities gives us an influx of new candidates interested in positions in the military. When these communication activities subside and new information waves roll in, people forget that there is such an opportunity and live in their information bubble. Our task is to enter this information bubble and tell people about the unique opportunity to choose a position and part on their own. And then help make a choice, don't miss the chance, because the mobilization processes are ongoing. —Which city shows the most effective result in the context of people's appeals to the recruiting center? — We have four such cities: Kyiv, Lviv, Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia. By all indicators, these are the leaders, although there are also small cities, such as Shostka. This is a small town that has organized all these processes in a cool way, and they have great results. From the point of view of the efficiency of the centers even in small cities, this is already a definite plus, they perform their work, spending minimal resources and performing very important functions for the state. Yes, let even one recruiter work there. But if he recruits even 10 volunteers motivated to protect the Motherland of people, then this is already arch-class. And if there is already such an opportunity in a small community, and people have been helped, it is important. Because every person is a separate destiny. And we helped define and shape this destiny so that a person finds himself in the protection of the Motherland. —Which recruiting center and where was the most difficult to open from an organizational point of view? Is there resistance from local authorities in this process? And which region is the friendliest? We have wonderful people, and each region really has its own specifics (smiles. Ed.). Yes, there are nuances during the opening. Someone has different standards, approaches in work, business processes, communication culture, etc. Yes, in some places the processes were more complicated, in some - the processes went as quickly as possible. There are centers that we open literally within a week, and there are regions where preparation takes months. And it seems the same result, but the effort spent on this process is many times more. —What are your expectations-forecasts for the recruitment campaign of autumn 2024? — We continue to open centers, several per month. Maybe there will be an opening every week. Now we will see the dynamics in the degree of readiness. Up to 10 recruitment centers are planned to open in the next three months. We are also planning online activities at the same time: the process of creating a recruiting center in online mode is underway. This is a recruiting model where recruiters will proactively and exclusively online communicate with people and offer them certain vacancies in the Defense Forces. That is, we are talking about the proactive position of the center: we see a person who is looking for a job, his resume is posted on a website with vacancies. And we are the first to call and offer service in the Defense Forces and a position that is as close as possible to the position a person is looking for. Also, by the end of September, we plan to launch a hotline so that people can call, consult, voice complaints, etc. We hope to maintain the momentum in terms of volunteer requests in the fall, and it will only grow. We also want to provide physical support for candidates at all stages of registration to the ranks of the Defense Forces. We are currently discussing this with one of the recruiting centers of the Armed Forces centers. We are currently working out the details of how it should work and what it will look like. This is done so that the person is calm that there is a military man next to him, who will guide him -by the hand-, relatively speaking, through all the rooms, help with all the questions that have arisen: regarding VLK, processing documents, personal affairs, etc. And it will be a soldier -in the system- who communicates in the same language with other soldiers. We hope to launch such a service soon. Let's start with Kyiv and the region. In addition, we are preparing an approach to certain categories of people who, for example, are suitable for military service, but with certain restrictions. Such people now have the opportunity to join the service. And for such military personnel, we are developing a mechanism for creating a list of vacancies where, according to the law, they can serve, there are units that are ready to accept such people and ensure that these people actually return to military life. Such a separate initiative is also currently being developed. We will also go further in the future. Perhaps we will start with Kyiv: so that a person who decides to recruit can come to Kyiv, he will be provided with temporary housing and food while he solves organizational issues. And specialists will help her to complete documents at the TCC, and so that she can go to the training center to learn military affairs in a calm manner. In addition, the approval of changes in normative documents, Cabinet resolutions, which provide for the possibility of military units to directly register a recruit without the participation of the TCC, for the period of martial law, is currently ending. This is an exception in order to simplify the process of a person entering the army as much as possible. I hope that by the end of September these changes will be accepted and will come into force. —How many vacancies in the Defense Forces are we talking about as of the beginning of September? — According to our internal database, it is about 4,000 vacancies. Plus the online database on four online job search platforms — about 10,000 more. Yes, the mosaic of vacancies in the Defense Forces is huge. And a quality search gives a cool conversion: a person who applied and is eligible for military service can actually find a good job for himself. —Which professions/positions are currently the most in demand? — Every week there are spikes for certain positions. Yes, a large number of applications were, for example, for reconnaissance. There was a separate period when gunners were looking for positions. Always relevant - UAV operators. There is also a demand for staff positions, clerks, and the IT field. —Have there been cases when citizens turn to recruiting centers with the goal of signing a contract, rather than mobilizing? — Yes. Today, that ratio is roughly 40 to 60 or 60 to 40, and the figure fluctuates from month to month. —Do recruiting centers solve the problem of lack of people in the army? — Yes, there is a trend. The situation has improved significantly (in fact, since the end of spring) with the manning of military units. Yes, there are still not enough people, but the situation has improved. The role of recruiting centers in this is essential, because a large percentage of people who join the ranks of the Defense Forces every month are volunteers. These are thousands of people every month who used this new algorithm: took a letter of recommendation, found a part and went to serve there. And there are many such people. —How do young people react to recruiting centers? Your subjective observations. — If we take global statistics, then, unfortunately, we have the following indicators regarding the demographic situation: people who were born in the 90s or at the beginning of the 2000s are simply significantly less than those who who were born in the 70s, for example. But young people also turn to recruiting centers. We explain to them that they have the opportunity to conclude a contract for one year, they are not subject to mobilization, will have the opportunity to enter a higher military educational institution, receive the rank of officer, etc. It can be a ticket to life. Yes, young people are applying, and we perfectly understand that a lot needs to be done in this area, and a lot is already being done in this area. —Do women turn to recruiting centers— what is the trend? What positions are they looking for? Who are they in civilian life? - They apply, and there are a lot of them. In Sumy region, for example, a third of the candidates with whom work is being done on job selection are from women. One in three appeals is from a woman. And the potential is just huge. A woman in the army is not necessarily only a cook, a clerk, a lawyer or a journalist. In fact, there are no legal restrictions. A woman can also get professional training for almost any position in the army and perform her duties. A large number of units are very loyal and recruit women. Moreover, for different positions: snipers, UAV operators, medics. And Chernihiv region is also a regional leader in terms of the number of women applying to recruiting centers. —Portrait of a citizen of Ukraine who applies to a recruiting center,— what is he like? Each person is a separate universe. And to make the -average temperature in the room- would probably be wrong. I don't want to speculate (smiles. — Ed).

Two F-16s collided during a simulated battle, one pilot survived: from NATO history	The fatal incident occurred over the Greek island of Karpathos in the Aegean Sea in the context of the Aegean dispute, a conflict between two NATO member states over sovereignty and related rights in the Aegean Sea and the airspace above it. Reconstruction of a simulated dogfight between Greek and Turkish F-16s On 23 May 2006 around 12:40 local time, the Greek Air Force raised a pair of F-16 fighters to the interception of a pair of Turkish Air Force F-16s escorting an RF-4E Phantom reconnaissance aircraft over the Aegean Sea. The mission of the Turkish spy was most likely to photograph the S-300 air defense systems deployed on the island of Crete. Greek fighter pilots were ordered to intercept planes of the Turkish Air Force and to prevent them from approaching the coast of the island and taking aerial photographs of Greek objects. After the interception, Greek and Turkish fighter pilots resorted to a simulated aerial battle. The pilots of both countries strove to win by recording a conditional defeat of the enemy with the help of instruments. Maneuvering in dangerous proximity to each other, the Greek and Turkish fighter jets collided at an altitude of about 8,000 meters above sea level at a distance of 12 miles from the coast of the island of Karpathos. By <a target=-_blank- rel=-nofollow- href=-https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030232/http:/vasington.be.mfa.gov.tr/ShowAnnouncement.aspx?ID=115955 According to the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a Greek fighter jet attacked a Turkish F-16 from behind and below, which led to a collision between the two planes. The impact caused an explosion that was devastating to both air machines. The collision was witnessed by the crew of Egyptian Airlines flight 797 from Cairo to Vienna, whose pilot informed the control center in Athens that during the flight at an altitude of about 10,000 meters above sea level, he saw a flash about 600 meters below his plane. The rescue missions of both countries immediately went to the scene of the plane crash, hoping that both pilots managed to eject. Greek Super Puma and Turkish Cougar search and rescue helicopters participated in the rescue mission. However, only one of the two pilots was able to eject successfully - Turkish Air Force Lieutenant Halil Ibrahim Ozdemir. He was lucky the second time when he was accidentally spotted by sailors in the merchant navy. At a distance of about 100 miles from the Turkish coast, it was picked up by the Panamanian merchant ship Gas Century of the Japanese company Yamamaru. Greek Air Force pilot Konstantinos Iliakis did not manage to save himself - as a result of the impact, the cockpit of his F-16 was destroyed, so he could not eject normally. The search for the Greek pilot turned out to be fruitless. The sailors of the frigate Λήμνος managed to find only the Greek pilot's helmet and a survival kit with Greek markings. According to Greek media reports, Konstantinos Iliakis was one of the most experienced F-16 pilots who was trained in the US and had many flight hours. The incident caused a major crisis and led to heightened tensions between official Athens and Ankara, with the Greek and Turkish sides traditionally blaming each other for the disaster. In the end, Greece and Turkey toned down accusatory rhetoric and defused the conflict, but failed to settle it. Despite the fact that both countries are part of the North Atlantic Alliance, their disputes in the Mediterranean continue. To date, the Turkish-Greek conflict is the only one in which F-16s have suffered officially confirmed air combat losses. In addition to the May 23, 2006 crash, there were other incidents over the Aegean Sea that resulted in the downing of these fighters.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/12/dva-f-16-zitknulys-pid-chas-imitacziyi-boyu-vyzhyv-odyn-pilot-z-istoriyi-nato/	2024-09-11T20:00:11-07:00

How foreigners fight - told the GUR	He reported this on the air of Channel 24. The GUR noted that volunteers from different countries of the world, who came to Ukraine at the call of President Volodymyr Zelensky, formed the International Legion of the GUR MOU at the beginning of a full-scale invasion. They took part in all key campaigns at the front: Kyiv region, Kharkiv region, Kherson region, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk and Luhansk regions. -If we talk about foreigners, these are people who usually have a lot of military service experience in their countries and combat experience in other wars. We have servicemen for whom this is already the fifth or sixth war,- Volodymyr said. According to him, all foreigners without exception, even American Rangers or Navy SEALs, must go through a stage of training, standardization and other processes that help adapt to our realities. -When our candidates write to us with a desire to join the unit, we always tell them: 'Guys, no matter how experienced you are, no one is ready for such a war as here,'- explained the representative of the International Legion of the GUR. The HUR noted that the working language in the Legion is English, but servicemen from other countries also learn Ukrainian. -Many foreigners attend Ukrainian courses and learn our language quite effectively. They are already ordering coffee and hotdogs at gas stations. It's very cool,- said Volodymyr. As reported by ArmyInform, the International Legion of the GUR to the Day of Military Intelligence svoyih-operaczij/->listed his operations.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/11/yak-voyuyut-inozemczi-rozpovily-v-gur/	2024-09-11T11:58:43-07:00

OUV -Tavria-: the Russians changed the directions of assaults in the Orichiv and Dnieper directions	About this on the air Army TV, the spokesman of the OUV said - Tavria- captain Dmytro Lykhovii. -The Russians are putting the most pressure on the Dnieper region, where increased activity has been observed for several days in a row compared to recent weeks,- Dmytro Lykhova said. According to him, during the last five days there were 46 attempts of assaults and four more attempts today. The geographical nature of this pressure has changed somewhat. -If earlier they stormed the left bank of the Dnieper in the area of ​​the village of Krynki, a little further north, where our units retreated after they left this completely destroyed settlement, then in the last few days the assaults have been on various islands along a large stretch of the left bank.- he said. The occupiers operate east of Krynok and closer to Kherson itself, where there is a large and fairly wide gray area. -Probably, they gathered courage and started to try to capture this gray area. But they do not succeed, assault actions are not successful,- the spokesman added. In the Orihiv direction, the enemy has also changed the point of effort and is trying to press not only on the Robotynsky ledge in the area of ​​Robotyny and Malaya Tokmachka, but also further west closer to Zaporizhzhia in the area of ​​the village of Mali Shcherbaki. -This is also a de-occupied territory that was liberated as a result of the 2023 counteroffensive, and now the Russians have renewed pressure there. -Several assaults take place every day, in particular with the support of aviation,- Dmytro Lykhova added. As reported by ArmyInform, in the Kurakhiv direction, the Russian troops are storming in small groups and have almost not used armored vehicles in recent days. pro-demonstraczijni-ataky-rosiyan-na-kurahivskomu-napryamku/->conducting demonstration attacks.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/11/ouv-tavriya-rosiyany-zminyly-napryamky-shturmiv-na-orihivskomu-ta-prydniprovskomu-napryamkah/	2024-09-11T11:41:08-07:00

Rustem Umyerov: Our goal is to return every piece of Ukrainian land, including Crimea	The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine reported this. -For me, this is not just a business meeting or an opportunity to communicate with international partners. This is my personal struggle. Crimea is my home, and every day I, like millions of Ukrainians, feel the pain of the Russian occupation for my state and for our people on the peninsula,- said Rustem Umyerov. He emphasized that Russia uses our land for missile attacks, turning the peninsula into a springboard for aggression against Ukraine. -Therefore, Crimea is a key battlefield for our freedom. And we will not stop until we bring him home,- the Minister of Defense emphasized. He reminded that over the past year, thanks to long-range weapons, Ukraine changed the balance of power in the Black Sea and created a -grain corridor- independent of Russia, through which more than 5,000 ships passed. Defense forces destroyed 24 Russian ships, regained control of Snake Island and deployed the world's first drone swarm technology to counter the Russian fleet. -Our next step is to ensure security in the entire Black Sea region. As part of strengthening our maritime capabilities at the last Ramstein, we signed the Maritime Capabilities Coalition with our partners. This will provide us with additional support in protecting our internal waters and Ukraine's interests in international maritime waters,- said Rustem Umyerov. He added that our goal remains the same — to return every piece of Ukrainian land, including Crimea. -We are getting closer to this goal, in particular, thanks to such meetings as the Crimean Platform. Glory to Ukraine!- said the Minister of Defense. As reported by ArmyInform, President Volodymyr Zelenskyi during a speech at the summit of the Crimean Platform -prezydent-na-samiti-krymskoyi-platformy/-> declared that Ukraine will return all temporarily occupied territories and all citizens of our state.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/11/rustem-umyerov-nasha-meta-povernuty-kozhen-klaptyk-ukrayinskoyi-zemli-vklyuchno-z-krymom/	2024-09-11T11:18:46-07:00
In Volyn, a former official organized the escape of evaders for $5,000	About this informs the Security Service of Ukraine. According to the case materials, the former deputy head of the Volyn Regional Military Administration was involved in the organization of the raid. During her tenure at the OVA, the suspect set up a mechanism for the escape of evaders in the guise of drivers transporting humanitarian goods. The cost of such a -service- was up to 5,000 US dollars per client. To implement the -scheme-, the organizer involved the director of a local charity fund, which arranged international flights for conscript drivers. In this way, the personal data of conscripts was entered into the -Shlyah- information system, which allowed them to go abroad as -volunteers-. In order to find potential customers and transfer money, the person involved involved seven more accomplices.

The Defense Forces spoke about demonstration attacks by Russians in the Kurakhiv direction	About this on the air Army TV the representative of the press service of the 79th separate amphibious assault brigade Orest Drymalovskyi. -The enemy conducts assaults every day. Currently, it is precisely on our part of the front in the Marin community that the enemy has been conducting infantry assaults for the past few days, the equipment is being used in a limited mode,- said Orest Drymalovskyi. He also said that the enemy is in a certain sense carrying out demonstration actions, tanks, BMPs and infantry are leaving. -But as soon as they enter the line of attack, our artillery starts working, they immediately turn around. Obviously, the enemy wants to identify our firing positions,- &#8211; explained the speaker.

Without training and motivation: in the Kharkiv region, Russia is fighting with poorly trained soldi...	Colonel Vitaly Sarantsev, the spokesman of Kharkiv OTU, announced this on the air of the nationwide telethon -Yedini Novyni- . — This is a newly arrived personnel recruited by Russia — an existing mobilization resource has been raised. It is not yet known for sure who it is. These may be some ex-prisoners or representatives of foreign countries. In particular, there used to be people from Central Asia, Africa or the Middle East, he said. The spokesman noted that the Russian soldiers transferred to the Kharkiv direction have a low level of training and refuse to perform the assigned tasks. -Over the past few days or even weeks, we have already repeatedly noted cases of refusal of personnel - both in the direction of deep Lypka and in the Vovchansky direction - from carrying out combat and special tasks,- Vitaly Sarantsev recalled. The military officer said that cases of refusals have already been recorded and are becoming more and more frequent even in those brigades of the Russian army that arrived relatively recently in the Kharkiv direction. — A few weeks ago, the rotation of the 136th motorized rifle brigade, which took up positions near Vovchansk in the area of ​​the Tykh point itself, ended. They replaced the 82nd Airborne Assault Brigade of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, which suffered heavy losses and was withdrawn to recovery. This 136th brigade came in and stood still for several weeks. They tried to carry out intelligence activities, and equipped sabotage-reconnaissance groups, and tried to storm our positions head-on. Now they have also suffered losses, and as of yesterday - the day before yesterday, we have information that the servicemen of this brigade, which arrived in our direction not so long ago, are also refusing to perform combat and special tasks, he said. The spokesman explained that the special tasks include the establishment and provision of logistics and fortification equipment for positions. — This indicates that the enemy is more and more often in practically all directions using personnel who are not morally ready to perform any tasks. That is, they raise the mobilization resource, prepare it very hastily. Whether by deception, coercion, or in some other way, using promises of monetary rewards to be sent to war. But people understand that they were simply deceived and simply refuse to go into battle any further, said Vitaly Sarantsev. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in the north of Kharkiv region, the occupiers throw soldiers into battle less than a month after signing the contract and without any preparation, as a result enemy stormtroopers are sabotaging the orders of the command and in whole groups refuse to carry out the assigned tasks.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/11/bez-pidgotovky-i-motyvacziyi-na-harkivshhyni-rosiya-voyuye-pogano-navchenymy-soldatamy/	2024-09-11T10:36:36-07:00

Digitization of the provision of the Armed Forces: the DOT presented the innovative DOT-Chain system	-If earlier the term of delivery of products could be up to two months, after the introduction of DOT-Chain, this term should be reduced by approximately four times,- said Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Dmytro Klimenkov. -The digitization of procurement processes in defense is a strategic step in increasing the efficiency of supplies of all necessary military equipment.- -DOT-Shain is another important step towards a military that values ​​people, time and efficient processes instead of filling out hundreds of papers. Thanks to this system, the procurement of products will become clearer and more transparent, and the possibility of expanding it to other products will significantly simplify the logistics processes in the Defense Forces,- said Kateryna Chernogorenko, Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine for Digital Development, Digital Transformations and Digitalization. The creation of DOT-Chain has become the largest digital project in DOT. A team of IT specialists of the State Rear Operator worked on the development. -We were faced with the task of changing the old system so that the non-lethal support of the Armed Forces was more effective. Currently, DOT-Chain functionality extends to food. The DOT IT team has digitized the entire procurement process, from submitting product applications to issuing invoices and documents. In the future, the system can be quickly scaled to cover other categories of goods,- said Alyona Zhuzha, IT adviser of the DOT. 1. Digitized paper documents to optimize the work of the military. This is an important step towards abandoning the -paper army-. Instead of 30 thousand paperwork that the military had to process every week is now just a few clicks into the system. This significantly reduces the amount of work of salespeople. 2. Simplified the process of paying for goods. It will be four times faster, because expense invoices are immediately uploaded to the system, and DOT, having signatures from the military unit and the supplier, can immediately pay for the shipment. 3. Optimized data exchange. Information from the system is used, in particular, by the Ministry of Defense. This allows the military to adjust its needs according to the data aggregated by DOT-Chain: the number of requests, supply information, and the amounts accepted or not accepted by military units. 4. Adjusted the interaction between the parties involved in the process of providing the Armed Forces. In the DOT-Chain system, all procurement and supply documents are visible for each request. In fact, DOT becomes a third party that takes care of both procurement and suppliers and can quickly respond to changing requests from military units. State rear operator (DOT) is a procurement agency under the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, which provides the rear needs of the Armed Forces of Ukraine: food, property, fuel and lubricants. As reported by ArmiyaInform, a new model of food supply for the Armed Forces presented by the Procurement Agency of the Ministry of Defense -State Rear Operator-. As a pilot project, it will be operational in several regions of Ukraine as early as 2025.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/11/czyfrovizacziya-zabezpechennya-zbrojnyh-syl-dot-prezentuvav-innovaczijnu-systemu-dot-chain/	2024-09-11T03:38:08-07:00

From the contract to the front line — 20 days: whom the Russians throw into battle externally	The personnel of the occupiers involved in the hostilities characterized on the air of the telethon -Social News- by the spokesman of the Kharkiv OTU Vitaly Sarantsev. — Among the Russian servicemen there are also former prisoners who were dragged into this war under coercion or deception. There are representatives of foreign countries. There are actually different sections of the population, he said. Russians also use propaganda and coercion to force residents of temporarily occupied territories to join the invading forces. The motivation of such soldiers is extremely low. — These people are not motivated, and in connection with this, we note the numerous refusals of personnel of the armed forces of the Russian Federation to perform tasks. This happens both on the Hlyboke-Lyptsi route and on other routes, in particular in the area of ​​the settlement of Tyche. The 136th separate motorized rifle brigade recently entered there. They started to perform tasks just a few weeks ago, but we are already seeing numerous refusals of personnel to perform both combat missions and special missions, the spokesman said. The occupiers refuse not only to storm the positions of the Defense Forces of Ukraine, but also to perform tasks related to the adjustment and provision of logistics or the arrangement of fortifications. — This indicates that the Russians are gradually losing their offensive potential and they are forced to use anyone and any personnel in order to continue pushing into this war started by Russia, — explained Vitaly Sarantsev. At the same time, he noted that the enemy is actively replenishing not only tactical, but also operational and strategic reserves, paying the necessary attention to comprehensive training of servicemen. — Attention will be paid there to both combat training of personnel and, as they call it, military-political and ideological training. Therefore, we are not relaxing, we understand that, sooner or later, the enemy can supplement its current set of personnel with more trained military personnel, the military officer emphasized. Currently, the enemy does not feel the lack of personnel in the Kharkiv direction. — The forces and means that he currently maintains in our direction are sufficient for the enemy to continue to carry out active actions, to carry out offensive actions, to carry out assaults, to carry out sabotage and reconnaissance activities in non-attacked areas of the Russian-Ukrainian border with the aim of destabilizing the situation, with the purpose of carrying out intelligence tasks, Vitaliy Sarantsev reported. Earlier, ArmyInform reported that in Kharkiv Oblast, enemy attack aircraft are sabotaging the orders of the command in whole groups and refusing to carry out their tasks, and also showed a video with captured fighters of the -Charter- brigade of the NGU by the Russian military, who said that signed a contract for military service on August 23 of this year.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/11/vid-kontraktu-do-peredovoyi-20-dniv-kogo-rosiyany-kydayut-u-bij-eksternom/	2024-09-11T02:40:58-07:00

At first, he fought as part of attack aircraft, then transferred to the unit of attack drones, where he became one of the most effective bombers. -It is precisely because the paratroopers are always on the most difficult routes that I chose the 95th brigade. The fact that I joined the army almost immediately after school and did not have the appropriate training did not scare me. Here they teach to be warriors, every brother and commander is ready to give advice and share experience. Anyone who wants to will always be able to be effective on the battlefield,- says Znuschonka.

-Leopards- are not afraid to swim: how German tanks force water obstacles. ArmiyaInform report from ...	This is part of the training of Ukrainian tank crews of the 33rd separate mechanized brigade of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in between combat work in Donetsk region. Tankmen must be ready for any situation, for example, when the enemy blows up a bridge or crossing, but the hostilities must be continued. immersion Before overcoming an obstacle, the tank must be prepared, and this process is very responsible: the escape hatch, driver-mechanic hatch, triplexes, etc. are sealed. Such training is also part of the psychological preparation of servicemen for unexpected developments and unusual maneuvers. Tankists talk enthusiastically about German combat vehicles. -They are much more effective in their work than Soviet tanks. Maneuverable, easier to control and very fast,- says a tank operator with the call sign -Tourist-. These German tanks were handed over by Norway, which is part of the international tank coalition. All the crews in the brigade since the beginning of its formation have undergone training abroad and already have significant combat experience. The -Leopards- of the 33rd OMBr last year successfully participated in combat operations in the Zaporizhzhia direction, now they are hitting the enemy on East. Leopard 2A4 is capable of effective fire at a range of up to 5 kilometers. Its 120-mm gun is equipped with stabilization in two planes, at a distance of two kilometers the probability of hitting reaches 90%. -the Russians, of course, are afraid of these tanks, but they also try to -hunt- for them. True, they normally receive from us,- adds -Tourist-. Ukraine continues to receive Leopard tanks of various modifications from Western partners. In particular, the Netherlands and Denmark leopard-2/->are handing over 14 Leopard 2A4 tanks that they acquired for the Defense Forces last year. Earlier in July, 10 tanks provided Spain. Ditto training program continues Ukrainian tankers at a military training ground in Poland under the guidance of instructors from NATO member countries.

Marriage in Action: how to get married online as a military man	The service can be used by all citizens of Ukraine, but this opportunity can be most useful for military personnel. Military vacations are quite difficult to predict, so it is difficult to think everything through in advance and organize an ordinary wedding. And the new service allows you to make friends even while on the front line. Basically, it's a marriage in a few clicks. Only internet is required&#8230; and, of course, the consent of the other half. ArmyInform tells how to marry a military man online. The new service even allows you to make an offer through Diya. The partner will receive a notification to which they must respond within 14 days. In particular, you need to go to -services- in Actions. Select -marriage online- and -Make a proposal- item. The system will offer to send this offer to a messenger convenient for your partner. However, such an offer is not binding. But it is not mandatory. If you made an offer in another way, you can apply for marriage registration right away in Diya. In Services, you need to find the -Marriage online- section and select the -marriage application- section. Someone alone must submit an application and indicate a partner in it. The latter must confirm the submission of such an application. When this happens, you will receive a notification. Read it and click -continue-. Next, you need to choose the date and time of the ceremony. Action will notify when the DRATSS confirms this date. Also, in Diya, you can decide what to do with your surname after the wedding: keep your own, take your partner's surname or make it double. Then you and your partner need to confirm the marriage registration application, sign with an electronic signature and pay the administration fee. On the day of the ceremony, Diya will send a reminder about the start of the video conference. On the wedding day, you just need to go to Diya and follow the link to join the online ceremony. An employee of the digital DRATSS will be waiting there. The ceremony lasts up to 30 minutes. The digital marriage registration certificate will be automatically activated within a day. You can also order a physical document by Ukrposhta delivery or pick it up at the branch. By the way, a wedding can be a reason for an additional 10 days of vacation. How to apply for family leave, read here . There are also certain requirements for registering a marriage in Diya. We will remind, previously Ukrainians had the opportunity to submit an online application for marriage registration. But the ceremony itself was still supposed to take place in DRACE. The only exception was military personnel. A simplified procedure was developed for them, which made it possible to get married remotely. That is, without the presence of the bride or groom. This procedure is valid even now, so a few words about it. What is needed? To submit an application to your immediate commander, in which to indicate information about yourself and your significant other - surname, first name and patronymic, date of birth, citizenship and chosen surname, if you wish to change it. Next, the commander must send an application to the DRATS to which the serviceman submitted the application. The fact of marriage registration is certified by an act, which is drawn up without the physical presence of one or both brides and grooms. However, they must be currently connected to the video procedure. The deed record of marriage is drawn up on the day of receipt of the application for the registration of a marriage or deed by the DRATSS department. This option also remains valid, but the new service in Diya greatly simplifies the whole procedure. As reported by ArmiyaInform, during the beta testing of the service the first , who married in this way, was a military serviceman.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/11/shlyub-u-diyi-yak-vijskovomu-odruzhytysya-onlajn/	2024-09-10T20:12:29-07:00
How the world helps Ukraine with the treatment and rehabilitation of wounded soldiers	Vadym Svyridenko, the adviser to the President of Ukraine on issues of rehabilitation of combatants, told about this during an interview with ArmiyaInform. — After the return of the fighters, we ask for their feedback: how do they like the prostheses, how was the rehabilitation, what did they learn there. And I am very glad that our rehabilitation and prosthetics are not behind in the world. And partner countries are already contacting us, interested in our experience. Because our military, like no one else in the world, faces such combat injuries. And we know what it is and how to deal with it. That is why specialists, for example, surgeons from Canada or America, are already coming to us. They, among other things, helped perform operations for facial injuries, says Vadym Svyridenko. We tell you more about how partner countries help our wounded defenders to recover their health and return to action. This country has an extensive network of cities and institutions where Ukrainian servicemen undergo treatment and rehabilitation. As of January 2024, 1,044 victims, including 735 military personnel, were evacuated to Germany. Also, 125 children with oncological diseases are being treated in the Federal Republic of Germany. In particular, the -Sharite- clinic accepts Ukrainians for treatment - military personnel with severe burns and mine-explosive injuries as a result of Russian military aggression are also treated here. In April 2024, another 13 Ukrainian defenders with amputations left Kyiv for Berlin. In a German military hospital, they are to be fitted with innovative prostheses. In general, German specialists expressed their readiness to provide prosthetics to 60 Ukrainian military personnel in Berlin. Our servicemen are also treated and rehabilitated in the city of Wiesbaden - here they have the opportunity to fully recover and receive the highest level of care. Poland has been helping with military rehabilitation since 2014. Ukrainian soldiers, in particular, are patients of the -Good Brother- rehabilitation and recreation center. In this institution, they can undergo a course of rehabilitation and recovery. Several hundred soldiers have already taken advantage of this opportunity. -Despite the fact that my right leg is completely iron, and the left one is missing about 75% of tendons and 50% of muscles, Polish rehabilitators taught me how to properly control my body. And not only did I return to a more or less normal life, but I even performed tasks in the area where the OOS was held,- Lt. Col. Ihor Chuprun, who underwent rehabilitation in Poland, recalled at one time. Already after the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation, the assistance of the Republic of Poland in matters of rehabilitation and treatment of military personnel only increased. In particular, Poland offered Ukraine to provide treatment and rehabilitation to 2,500 wounded Ukrainian servicemen. In addition, at the Military Medical Institute in Warsaw, Ukrainian specialists are trained in the field of rehabilitation of the wounded, as well as diagnosis and treatment of people who have suffered war injuries. Here, they improve their knowledge of accompanying patients during rehabilitation and modern methods of prosthetics. In Spain, there is a whole program of treatment and rehabilitation of Ukrainian servicemen and veterans who were injured in the war. In addition, this country also helps in the organization of recreation for Ukrainian children affected by the war. The country -stepped in- in aid from the first days of a full-scale invasion. In particular, wounded Ukrainian border guards (about 30 servicemen) who were wounded in 2022 in the first days of the enemy's invasion were treated in Spain. Our defenders also receive rehabilitation and treatment in the military hospital of the city of Zaragoza. This Orad y Gajías General Defense Hospital is one of two controlled by the Spanish Ministry of Defense. And he started receiving our fighters as early as 2022. The Netherlands also operates a rehabilitation program for Ukrainian military personnel. More than one group of servicemen used it. And in the Netherlands, Ukrainian military personnel undergoing rehabilitation and volunteers assemble drones for the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Volunteers look for funding and order parts, while the military assembles the drones. Professional instructors help beginners. The finished device is thoroughly tested before being sent to Ukraine. From June 2022, the French Ministry of Defense will organize assistance to the Ukrainian wounded. One of the facilities that contributes to the treatment and rehabilitation of our soldiers in France is Percy Hospital. In March 2024, it was known that wounded army personnel were being taken to French civilian and military hospitals in the Paris region and Grand Est. As of spring 2024, there were more than two dozen groups of Ukrainian military personnel who arrived in France for treatment. Back in 2018, Bulgaria launched a two-year rehabilitation program for soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine who were wounded, injured and maimed during hostilities in eastern Ukraine. In addition, Bulgaria had the status of a leading country within the NATO Trust Fund project in the field of medical rehabilitation in Ukraine. Our wounded defenders are receiving rehabilitation services at Kaleroya Military Medical Hospital in Hisar. Indications for physiotherapy in Kaleroya are injuries of the musculoskeletal system, injuries of the peripheral nervous system of the upper and lower extremities. And in 2020, the Project of Medical Rehabilitation of Ukrainian Veterans in Bulgaria was launched. Wounded Ukrainian military personnel (both those undergoing military service and those on reserve/retirement) and civilian personnel of the security and defense sector were sent for treatment. Expenses related to the procedures and accommodation of persons in the clinic were provided by the Bulgarian side, and international and local transportation, medical insurance and food for this period were provided by the NATO Trust Fund in Ukraine in the field of medical rehabilitation. The Baltic countries are friendly to Ukraine and our wounded defenders. For example, in April 2024, Lithuania started a special program for the rehabilitation of the Ukrainian military - about 15 million euros were allocated to Ukraine. These funds should be directed directly to the reconstruction of hospitals and the training of specialists. And the Latvian Support Fund for Ukraine, founded in 2014, collects donations for the treatment and rehabilitation of wounded Ukrainian servicemen, is an intermediary between the state, Latvian clinics and Ukrainian wounded who need help. Thus, as of the end of August 2024, more than 540 Ukrainian servicemen who were wounded in the war with the Russian Federation were treated in Latvia. At the beginning of June, the government allocated 184,000 euros for the rehabilitation of the soldiers of the Armed Forces. Estonia is not lagging behind - as of June 2024, it was known that more than 240 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine had already completed a rehabilitation course in Estonia. America supported Ukrainian wounded defenders even before the large-scale Russian invasion. For example, in 2019, the US government allocated about 5 million dollars and accepted 10 seriously wounded Ukrainian servicemen for treatment. For this purpose, the Americans have identified 10 hospitals that will receive Ukrainian servicemen for free treatment. It was then known that the average cost of treating one, as Americans calculated, is half a million dollars. And in December 2022, in New York, just in time for the Day of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the House of Heroes was opened for the rehabilitation and prosthetics of Ukrainian soldiers who lost their limbs during the war. The house is located in the Staten Island area, not far from the ocean. Oleksandr Rubtsov, head of the charity organization Kind Deeds, who owns a real estate company, implements the rehabilitation program for the wounded. According to him, he rented a house for this purpose and is accumulating donor funds for the further rehabilitation of Ukrainian soldiers. In addition, American specialists come to Ukraine and help in the treatment of our military. So, in 2023, American microsurgeons operated on wounded soldiers in Uzhhorod. According to Andrii Novak Transcarpathian Regional Clinical Hospital, this is the second visit of microsurgeons from the USA. During the visit, American doctors performed 7 operations on military personnel: it is about eliminating post-traumatic defects of bones and soft tissues of arms and legs. Canada is also helping our wounded defenders get stronger and healthier. Thus, in 2023, Ukraine and Canada signed an agreement on medical partnership in the field of mental health and military rehabilitation. According to this document, the Ukrainian Center for Mental Health and Rehabilitation -Lisova Polyana- has a sister company, the -Atlas- Institute of Veterans and Their Families. Both medical institutions specialize in the field of mental recovery and military rehabilitation. But this country helped our wounded even before the large-scale invasion. For example, in 2019, a project on the rehabilitation of patients with severe neurotraumas was implemented in the Rivne Region with the participation of Canadian specialists. And the Canadian instructors from the UNIFAIR training mission, who teach the Ukrainian military to provide first aid in case of wounds and injuries, have already become a familiar story for us.

The next conquerors of Tysa did not even have time to get their feet wet	About informs the State Border Service of Ukraine. It is noted that the detainees were residents of Vinnytsia and Ivano-Frankivsk regions. A 60-year-old resident of Nizhnya Apsha in Transcarpathia drove them to the river in his vehicle. According to a previous agreement, the Transcarpathian was supposed to assist the Vinnytsia and the Ivano-Frankivsk in illegally crossing the Ukrainian-Romanian border. Dilock planned to earn 15 thousand dollars from his -clients-. Despite the fact that the Transcarpathian tried to escape, the border guards also detained him. It was possible to expose the illegal device thanks to information provided in advance by operatives of the detachment. Upon detection of signs of the crime provided for in Art. 332 KKU, the border guards informed the police officers. Currently, operatives of the Mukachevo detachment are establishing all the circumstances of the offense and the persons involved in the organization of the scheme of illegal transportation of men of draft age. ArmyInform reminds that it is better not to break the law, but to use the aggregator of vacancies in the Armed Forces or recruiting centers.	https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/09/10/chergovi-pidkoryuvachi-tysy-ne-vstygly-navit-nig-namochyty/	2024-09-10T11:35:30-07:00
